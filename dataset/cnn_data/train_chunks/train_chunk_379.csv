"Books have been written about him, a film was devoted to following his every move on a football field and now the career of French icon Zinedine Zidane has been immortalized in bronze. From Cannes to Real Madrid -- his first and last clubs -- Zidane's career was characterized by moments of audacity and greatness. None more so than when he scored a brace which helped win the World Cup for France on home soil in 1998, or one of the greatest goals of all time in the 2002 European Champions League final in Real Madrid's 2-1 win over Bayer Leverkusen in Glasgow. But Algerian-born artist Adel Abdessemed was less interested in the zenith of Zidane's career. Instead he has focused on its nadir -- the Frenchman's infamous headbutting of Italy's Marco Materazzi in the 2006 World Cup final in Zidane's last professional game. ""This statue goes against the tradition of making statues in honour of certain victories. It is an ode to defeat,"" exhibition organizer Alain Michaud told Agence France Presse after the five meter statue was unveiled in the French capital city of Paris outside the world-renowned Pompidou Museum. The statue captures the moment when, with the scores level at 1-1 between France and Italy in Berlin in football's biggest game, Zidane was given a straight red card for his assault on Materazzi deep into extra-time. France went on to lose the match on penalties, when striker David Trezeguet saw his spot kick crash into the crossbar and Fabio Grosso converted to crown Italy world champions. Exactly what Materazzi said to draw such a violent reaction from Zidane remains unknown. U.S. animated comedy Family Guy parodied the incident in the 2006 episode ""Saving Private Brian"", where Zidane headbutts an old lady while delivering her a birthday cake. Widely regarded as one of the finest footballers to have ever played the game, Zidane playedfor Cannes and Bordeaux in France, before moving to Juventus and then Real. The Algerian-born playmaker scored twice as France beat Brazil 3-0 in the World Cup final of 1998. He is also remembered for the stunning goal which won Real Madrid a ninth European Cup in 2002, when he converted a Roberto Carlos cross with a stunning volley against Bayer Leverkusen at Hampden Park. Zidane, who retired immediately after the 2006 final, was crowned FIFA World Player of the Year on three occasions. He now works as Real Madrid director of football, while his three sons are all members of the club's youth academy. Zidane is not the first footballer to be honored with a permanent monument to his on-field achievements. Wembley Stadium, the home of English fooball, is decorated with a statue of Bobby Moore, the defender who captained the country to its only World Cup triumph in 1966. Carlos Valderrama is the most-capped player in Colombia's history, famous for his flair and outrageous afro and the midfielder has a statue in his hometown of Santa Marta, complete with frizzy golden locks. But it is not just players who have been the subject of sculptures. Azerbaijani linesman Tofiq Bahramov, who ruled that England's controversial third goal had crossed the line in the 1966 final, has a statue outside of the stadium named in his honor in his homeland. Perhaps most unusually of all, English Premier League team Fulham has a sculpture of the late pop icon Michael Jackson outside its Craven Cottage stadium. The club's owner Mohamed al Fayed was a close friend of Jackson's prior to his death in 2009. Zidane's statue will remain outside the Pompidou Museum until the end of the Abdessemed exhibition in January.","A bronze statue of Zinedine Zidane head-butting Marco Materazzi unveiled .

"The battle over right-to-work legislation in Michigan has renewed debate over labor policy and the role of unions in the American economy. On Tuesday, the state House of Representatives passed two bills that would make Michigan the 24th U.S. state to enact right-to-work laws. Here's a quick look at the issue: . What's going on? Michigan's storied labor movement and its allies mobilized last week to stop Republican-backed legislation that would give workers the right to opt out of union membership and, critics say, weaken unions. Lawmakers last week gave initial approval to ""right-to-work"" bills in a surprise move that provoked thousands of labor supporters to descend on the state Capitol for protests that led to eight arrests. More protests are scheduled for Tuesday. Opponents accuse Republicans of abusing the legislative system to rush through the bills without public input. Supporters say the legislation would help improve economic competitiveness in Michigan which, despite some recovery, still has the nation's sixth-worst unemployment rate and median household incomes that lag the nation. What is right to work? ""Right to work"" is the commonly used term for laws that make it illegal to require that employees join a union or pay the equivalent of union dues to get or keep a job. Under such laws, employees can still form unions, engage in collective bargaining and go on strike. Currently, 23 states, most of them in the South and West, have right-to-work laws. In those states, union membership stood at 6.48% in 2011, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. In states without right-to-work laws, 10.8% of the workforce belonged to unions. Analysis: Why America's unions are losing power . When did right-to-work laws first appear? Florida was the first state to pass right-to-work legislation, in 1943, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Arizona and South Dakota followed in 1946. Then Georgia, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Tennessee and Virginia did so in the right-to-work boom year of 1947. According to the NCSL, the laws were a response to the growing influence of the labor movement during an era when union membership was rapidly growing -- more than doubling in percentage terms between 1935 and 1945, according to the Congressional Research Service. The most recent state to enact a right-to-work law was Michigan's neighbor, Indiana, in 2012. Before that was Louisiana in 1976. What do supporters say? Right-to-work supporters argue that it makes states more attractive to business, creates jobs and gives employees more choices. Supporters cite studies suggesting that job growth and private-sector compensation in right-to-work states have increased more rapidly than in other states. ""The case for right-to-work has always rested on the importance of defending worker freedom, but right-to-work laws also have a proven track record of encouraging economic growth,"" Will Collins of the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation wrote Monday. And critics? Opponents cite studies indicating that wages and growth are lower in right-to-work states, and they say that such legislation is little more than an effort to bleed unions in the name of worker freedom and choice. ""There is scant evidence these laws create jobs, help workers, or are good for a state's economy, as supporters claim,"" analysts for the liberal think tank Center for American Progress wrote earlier this year. ""Instead, these laws weaken unions and thereby hurt workers, the middle class, and local economies."" Critics also say that such laws allow nonunion workers to ""freeload"" -- gain the benefits of union representation without shouldering the burden of paying for it. Michigan bills weakening union power signed into law . Why is it coming up now? For one, union influence is waning in Michigan, as it has been nationwide for decades. In November, voters rejected a referendum that would have blocked right-to-work legislation. And Republicans control the state House, Senate and governor's office, reducing the influence of labor in legislative affairs. Still, Gov. Rick Snyder had said the issue was not on his agenda until recently, when legislative leaders began to press their case. He told Stephen Henderson, editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press, that he had tried to mediate a solution to avoid the bill coming to a head. ""That wasn't very successful, so I said, 'This is being put on my agenda,' "" Snyder said. ""I thought it better to try to get something done one way or another, and get the issue behind us."" He and other supporters now say the legislation is critical to the state's economic success. ""Like it or not, the 49 other states in the union are competing with us for businesses and workers,"" Snyder wrote on his blog. ""And across the nation, 23 states have enacted freedom-to-work laws -- including neighboring Indiana. Though Michigan is the comeback state, we don't exist in a vacuum. Our successes today could turn to failures tomorrow, so we need to maintain our competitive edge."" What's next? The bills now go to Snyder for his signature, and he has said he will sign them. Democrats have suggested they may challenge the legislation in court because GOP lawmakers skipped the usual committee hearings in passing the bills. The legislation cannot be overturned by a public referendum because they were in appropriations measures.","Right-to-work laws make it illegal to require that employees join a union .

"When I was 13, I was sold. Friends of my father worked for a corrupt adoption agency operating in my homeland of Ethiopia -- friends my father trusted. In 2006 they coerced him into believing he was sending my younger sisters and me to America for an educational program during which we would come home every summer and on school breaks. Little did my father know that his ""friends"" were being paid to recruit children for an American adoption agency. In fact, he didn't even know what ""adoption"" meant. Instead of an educational program, we found ourselves caught up in an international adoption scandal. We weren't the only ones lied to. The family who adopted us, who lived in the southwestern United States, were told that they were taking into their family three AIDS orphans, the oldest of whom was nine years old. The truth was that our mother had died from complications during childbirth, and our father was alive and well. Instead of nine, I was 13 years old; my sisters were 11 and six. Our new ""parents"" changed our names and told us we could no longer speak to each other in our own languages; we were punished if we disobeyed. Eventually, we forgot how to speak our native languages, Amarigna and Wolaytta. I was so young and naïve. I actually believed that if I ran away, I could walk back to Ethiopia. I wanted to escape from the people I felt had kidnapped us from our homeland, our culture, and our family. I was angry, hurt and grieving. After eight months, I was ""re-homed,"" without my sisters, to live with my adoptive mother's parents in the Midwest. I have only seen my sisters a handful of times since. Living in the Midwest was difficult. I had been taken from my family in Ethiopia, and then separated from my sisters. But instead of getting caught up in my depression, I threw myself into finding ways to let the world know the hard truths about corruption in international adoption. My second adoption placement did not work out either, and at 18, while still in high school, I found myself staying on a friend's floor.  A family in Maine, who I met through adoption reform work, offered to take me in. So I moved my few possessions and myself across the country again. Supporters of international adoption frequently mention the enormous numbers of orphans in the world -- UNICEF estimates there are 151 million orphans. What most people don't realize is that when the United Nations determines the figures for orphans, they include children who have lost just one parent (the U.N. estimates only 18 million have lost both parents). I assure you that I did not consider myself an orphan. My sisters and I had a father, a brother and older sisters, plus a large extended family that cared for us and loved us. We were middle class by Ethiopian standards, not poor.  We, and many other adoptees like us, should never have been placed for adoption. All the lies and deception comes down to money. I have discovered since my adoption, the price paid by adoptive parents is exorbitant and feeds the corruption. Had my father's friends not made money from the placement of my sisters and me for adoption, none of this ever would have happened. They were basically paid to create orphans. Depending upon the country, an adoption can cost upwards of $50,000.  Imagine what that kind of money could do to help struggling families in developing nations keep their children! Adding the horror of being sold for profit, I now know that parents pay far more to adopt a white child than an African-American child. A 2010 study by Caltech, the London School of Economics, and New York University showed that parents are willing to pay an average of $38,000 more for a non-African American baby. Let me call that what it is: Racism. In spite of everything I have suffered, I am determined to make something good out of my life. I just started college and I am writing a book about my experiences. I am fighting to change the way adoption agencies do business. I am fighting to make sure that families and adoptive families know the truth about the possibilities of fraud and human trafficking in adoption. I am fighting to make sure that no other child will have to endure what I have been through.  And I am saving up money so that I can reunite with my family in Ethiopia, whom I haven't seen for seven years. And I went to court and got my real name back.","Tarikuwa Lemma: When she was 13, she went to the U.S. thinking she would be studying abroad .

"Germany is sending senior intelligence officials to Washington, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Saturday, amid outrage over claims the U.S. National Security Agency monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone. Among them will be the heads of Germany's foreign and domestic intelligence services and the coordinator of the federal intelligence services, the government's press office said. The trip comes amid a series of reports that have challenged relations between the two long-time allies. The latest is a story in the German magazine Der Spiegel that -- citing a secret U.S. intelligence file -- claimed Merkel's phone had been monitored for more than 10 years, stretching back before her current post. The same database indicated the United States was spying on many others in Berlin's political district, at least up to when U.S. President Barack Obama visited Berlin this year, Der Spiegel reported. Asked about these claims, U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said her agency does not ""comment publicly on every specific intelligence activity."" ""And, as a matter of policy, we have made clear that the United States gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations,"" said Hayden, echoing comments she and others have made in recent days. Still, it remains to be seen if citizens and leaders in Europe will accept such explanations -- and whether recent efforts by the Obama administration to address their concerns will be successful. Spokesman: U.S.-German talks ongoing for months . The German government's deputy spokesman said Friday that its officials heading to Washington would seek to push forward talks with the White House and the NSA as they seek more information about the alleged U.S. spying. The German representatives will be in the U.S. capital ""very soon,"" said the foreign ministry spokesman, who is not named in line with department policy. The spokesman said it is most likely that the intelligence officials will meet with their respective counterparts, although he did not know exactly who they would see. The United States has been in talks with German intelligence officials for the past several months, and leaders of both countries have agreed to increase cooperation, said Hayden of the National Security Council. ""We understand that German officials plan to travel to Washington in coming weeks, and the U.S. government looks forward to meeting with them,"" she said. Germany and Brazil are also drafting a U.N. resolution regarding the protection of privacy in electronic communication, according to the German foreign ministry spokesman said. Diplomats from those two countries met Thursday to discuss the possible U.N. resolution, government officials in Brazil said. ""It is very general, but we think this is a very important topic, that's why we are drafting it. It is still at a very early stage, so we don't know when it will be presented or if other countries will join,"" the German spokesman said. Europe falls out of love with Obama over NSA spying claims . U.S. relations have soured with Brazil over reports that the United States spied on President Dilma Rousseff and her advisers. Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden reportedly leaked the documents cited in Brazilian media reports about the alleged espionage operations, as well as those in European media outlets. 'Significant challenges' U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki referred to the leaks from Snowden in comments Friday in Washington. ""These unauthorized disclosures of classified information have of course led to criticisms of our intelligence activity by many of our friends and partners,"" she said. ""It's created significant challenges in our relationships with some of our partners and has been, of course, a public distraction."" Obama has directed the government to review its surveillance capabilities, including with regard to its foreign partners, she said. Obama promises changes . ""We want to ensure we're collecting information because we need it and not just because we can,"" she said. ""We will of course continue to gather the information we need to keep ourselves and our allies safe. We of course will factor in the views of our friends and partners as we have those discussions with them, and we'll continue to balance our security needs with privacy concerns."" The U.S government fully expects that ""more allegations will surface given the quantity of classified information leaked by Mr. Snowden,"" Psaki added. 'Deep concerns' in Europe . Anger over the claims of widespread spying by the NSA on its European allies overshadowed an EU summit held in Brussels on Thursday and Friday. EU leaders said the allegations had raised ""deep concerns"" among Europeans and could affect the cooperation needed for effective intelligence gathering. ""A lack of trust could prejudice the necessary cooperation in the field,"" the leaders said in a joint statement issued at the conclusion of the European Council meeting. Germany and France intend to seek talks with the United States ""with the aim of finding before the end of the year an understanding on mutual relations in that field,"" the EU leaders' statement said. Other nations are welcome to join these talks, it noted. Merkel said the assertions that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on her and other world leaders had ""severely shaken"" relationships between Europe and the United States, and that trust would have to be rebuilt. Merkel: Relations with U.S. 'severely shaken' over spying claims . Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced Friday that Madrid had summoned U.S. Ambassador James Costos over the matter, a day after Germany summoned the U.S. envoy to Berlin over its concerns. The German spying allegation came in the same week that the French daily newspaper Le Monde reported claims that the NSA intercepted more than 70 million phone calls in France over a 30-day period. French President Francois Hollande said Friday there is an ""ongoing dialog"" with the United States over its past actions, but the priority is establishing a ""code of conduct"" for the present and future.","Der Spiegel: U.S. spied on Merkel for more than 10 years, at least until June .

"Washington (CNN)  -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday sharply defended his government's plan to build new housing on disputed land in East Jerusalem, a decision that has put Israel at odds with its leading ally. In a defiant speech to the leading pro-Israel lobby in the United States, Netanyahu said Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem are ""an integral and inextricable part of modern Jerusalem."" ""The connection between the Jewish people and Jerusalem cannot be denied,"" Netanyahu said to prolonged applause. ""The Jewish people were building Jerusalem 3,000 years ago, and the Jewish people are building Jerusalem today. Jerusalem is not a settlement. It is our capital."" Netanyahu's Monday night speech to the U.S.-Israel Public Affairs Committee came nearly two weeks after Israel announced the planned construction of 1,600 new housing units in a disputed area claimed by both Israelis and Palestinians. That announcement came during U.S. Vice President Joe Biden's visit to Israel and has strained ties between Netanyahu's government and the Obama administration, which is pushing for new talks to end the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But Netanyahu said his government's policies are in line with those of previous Israeli administrations, and that nearly half of Jerusalem's Jewish population now lives in East Jerusalem, which Israel has occupied since 1967. ""Everyone -- Americans, Europeans, Israelis, certainly Palestinians -- everyone knows that these neighborhoods will be part of Israel in any peace settlement,"" Netanyahu said. ""Therefore, building them in no way precludes the possibility of a two-state solution."" Palestinian leaders have refused to rejoin peace talks until Israel freezes the construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Netanyahu said his government has lifted roadblocks and checkpoints in the West Bank, temporarily halted construction and called on the Palestinians to come back to the negotiating table without delay. The prime minister met earlier with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who has called the Israel announcement insulting. In her own speech to AIPAC, she said the U.S. commitment to Israel's security was rock-solid but added that as ""Israel's friend, it is our responsibility to give credit when it is due and to tell the truth when it is needed."" ""Our credibility in this process depends in part on our willingness to praise both sides when they are courageous, and when we don't agree, to say so, and say so unequivocally,"" Clinton said. ""We objected to this announcement because we are committed to Israel and its security, which we believe depends on a comprehensive peace -- because we are determined to keep moving forward along a path that ensures Israel's future as a secure and democratic Jewish state living in peace with its Palestinian and Arab neighbors."" The United States is Israel's leading ally and provides nearly $3 billion a year in aid to the Jewish state, about three-quarters of which goes to purchase U.S. military equipment. AIPAC has called on the Obama administration to step back from its ""public demands and unilateral deadlines directed at Israel,"" but Clinton defended the administration's call for Israel to stop building in largely Arab East Jerusalem. Netanyahu met with Clinton for close to two hours Monday afternoon, a senior State Department official and an Israeli official said. Most of the session was one-on-one between Clinton and Netanyahu, though Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak joined the talks at the end, the officials said. Netanyahu had dinner with Biden on Monday evening and will meet with President Obama at the White House on Tuesday, the prime minister's office said. Clinton focused much of her speech to AIPAC on the threat presented by Iran, telling her audience that ""Elements in Iran's government have become a menace, both to their own people and in the region."" ""The United States is determined to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons,"" she vowed. ""Our aim is not incremental sanctions, but sanctions that will bite. It is taking time to produce these sanctions, and we believe that time is a worthwhile investment for winning the broadest possible support for our efforts."" And Netanyahu reiterated his government's hard line regarding Iran, which has refused international demands to halt its production of nuclear fuel. He called the threat of an Iranian nuclear weapon a threat not only to Israel, but ""a grave threat to the region and to the world."" He received another prolonged ovation when he declared that Israel, which is widely believed to have its own nuclear arsenal, ""must always reserve the right to defend itself."" CNN's Jill Dougherty and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","NEW: Netanyahu tells Israeli lobby that Jewish building in East Jerusalem will continue .

"(CNN)It's just secured a whopping $8 billion dollar TV deal and now the English Premier League is cleaning up in shirt sponsorship revenue. Driven by a contract with car manufacturer Chevrolet, Manchester United's $70m a year deal is a big part of the EPL's 36% rise in shirt sponsorship income on the 2013/2014 season, reports Repucom. Factor in a kit deal with manufacturers like Nike and Adidas and leading clubs can generate over $75 million a year from this revenue stream, according to recent data from Forbes. But it not just English clubs that are benefiting from these kind of deals to ensure brands' names are splashed across the front of their kits. Spain's Primera Division showed a 30% rise, Italy's Serie A was up 21%, with France's Ligue 1 and Germany's Bundesliga experiencing 13% and nine percent increases respectively. Only the Netherlands' Eredivisie bucked the trend as its shirt sponsorship income value dropped five percent to $47 million as European clubs reaped the benefits of sponsors forking out $777m to get their brand on the front of some of the world's biggest clubs' kits. ""With investment in 2014/15 growing 20% over last season, the investment in shirt sponsorship has increased faster than at any time in the last 15 years"" said a Repucom spokesman. It's an investment that's being fueled by oil-rich Middle East countries, with the United Arab Emirates and Qatar based companies -- Qatar Airway's logo adorns the front of Spanish club Barcelona's shirt -- spending $181 million this season. While the EPL likes to see itself as the ""best league in the world,"" Spain's Primera Division tops the table for the percentage of income for these deals coming from foreign companies with 86% of all shirt sponsorship revenue coming from outside Spain. It's not just airlines and banks -- Standard Chartered's logo is on the front of Liverpool's shirts -- that want to be associated with football. Even countries are getting in on the act with oil-rich Azerbaijan's ""Land of Fire"" slogan emblazoned across the front of Spanish champions Atletico Madrid's shirts. ""We are two traveling companions who embark on a common path that allows them to develop multiple joint actions,"" said Atletico president Enrique Cerezo at the time the deal was renewed until the end of this season. ""In just one year, we have been able to project the image of Azerbaijan for the world and promote bilateral relations between our countries."" Not that all kit sponsorship deals arguably work out so harmoniously. Newcastle United's partnership with payday lender Wonga attracted plenty of negative headlines as the deal sparked protests from fans' groups and debt campaigners. Wonga's logo on children's kits -- including those for two-month-year-olds -- will now be dropped in the 2016-17 season. Looking further afield, American newcomer MLS is also attracting big business with shirt sponsorships totaling $55.8m -- about $3m more than the Netherlands' Eredivisie, which perhaps is another signal of the strengthening of interest in football in the U.S.","The English Premier League sees a 36% rise in shirt sponsorship income .

"When the love child of the doughnut and the croissant was created by the Dominique Ansel Bakery in New York, fans queued for hours to sample the tasty hybrid snack. With only 300 cronuts made each day sold at $5 a pop, they are so coveted that they can go for up to $40 on the pastry black market. Even supermodel Heidi Klum had to wait weeks to try one. Though the cronut has gained worldwide attention on social media since its debut in May, few in the UK have had the chance to taste the unique pastry -- until now. ""It just went viral because it's new,"" Dominique Ansel told CNN'. ""It's fun; it's unusual; it's good."" One British bakery described it as the most exciting pastry launch since the sausage roll. But although they have proved extremely popular with British customers, the intense enthusiasm for cronuts in New York is unlikely to be replicated in London. ""Cronuts are called ""Yum Yums"" in this country and you can buy them in [the supermarket Waitrose. We've had them for decades,"" wrote Richard Turner, the owner of London's Hawksmoor steakhouse, in an email to his business partner. Adalat Hussain, co-owner of the Wild and Wood cafe in Central London says British cronut-eaters are attempting to master the treat with a knife and fork. ""I think using your hands is the best way,"" he says. Back across the pond, a young woman in the queue outside the Dominique Ansel Bakery declared the cronut a typically American invention. ""A croissant is a great pastry in the morning; a doughnut is a great pastry in the morning. Really to combine the two is representative of the American way. It's really efficient and delicious and fattening and great."" Dominique Ansel has copyrighted the term ""cronut,"" prompting bakeries to come up with alternative names like ""doissant"", ""croissant-doughnut"" and ""doughssant"". The much-loved British bakery chain Gregg's launched the Greggsnut in September. ""There's nothing unique about it,"" says Hussain. ""It's just a simple thing that's really taken off."" Now bakeries in the UK are desperate to create their own viral dessert -- anybody fancy a waggle (waffle meets bagel)? Or a crookie (croissant meets cookie)? How about a townie (tartlet meets brownie)? Whatever your preference, it looks like this particular trend will be with us for a while.","The cronut - half croissant, half doughnut - has finally arrived in UK bakeries .

"On Sunday there will once again be millions of eyes trained on the red carpet and the usual slew of beautiful faces parading along it. But behind the cream of Hollywood's stars will be an army of nominees whose craft is just as vital to the creation of the industry's feted films. ""I think that the red carpet and the glamor is all fine but it doesn't really apply to me because I'm not a movie star,"" says Jay Cassidy, a three-time nominee who is back at the Dolby Theater on Sunday. Cassidy is in the running for the Best Film Editing Oscar, alongside his colleagues Crispin Struthers and Alan Baumgarten, for their work on David O. Russell's ""American Hustle."" For the veteran editor, the occasion is not so much about the celebrity ephemera and who's-wearing-what, but it's an ""enormous big deal"" for other, more tangible reasons. ""You're nominated by the members of your branch (of the Academy), so there's maybe 300 other editors in Hollywood and around the world who ... nominate the five nominees each year so it's a huge honor -- it's your direct peer group. ""For those who are movie stars it's part of the game,"" he said. ""They're used to the press thing that goes on, and there's probably no more special occasion (than the Academy Awards). It's the big one of the year."" Cassidy is hoping to pick up that elusive statuette this time. Last year, he was nominated for ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and in 2008, was on the shortlist for his work on Sean Penn's adaptation of ""Into the Wild."" Both times, he came up short. But despite third-time-lucky exhortations, he says there are no expectations. ""You can never know what's going to happen and you certainly don't expect anything. Anybody who does is kind of delusional. So you just go into it with an attitude that you're glad to be included in this clump of movies that are being recognized and honored and if it works out for you, wonderful but don't be surprised if it doesn't."" While the major categories generally hog the limelight -- and his ""American Hustle"" colleagues are up for the big ones including all four major acting categories, Best Director and Best Picture -- he says that the technical categories are far from unsung these days. ""There is certainly, in the years I've been in the industry a growing appreciation for the technical side,"" he says. ""I think there's a lot more attention paid to it by the media so I think people have a level of awareness that they didn't used to have. ""That's maybe not such a good thing on a certain level because you want the movies to be magic -- you don't want to pull the man out from behind the curtain."" He says that the peer recognition is important, and while it ""remains to be seen"" what a win would do for his career options, the recognition from the Academy means that he is afforded more choice in what he makes. ""I've been very fortunate in the past few years to work on a string of really interesting films and then when I haven't had an interesting film, that hasn't been a problem. I've done some interesting documentaries, which have been wonderful."" But back to Sunday and the hush that comes over the expectant crowd as the envelope containing the name of the winner -- or winners -- is opened. ""I have no predictions. How can you have predictions? I'm the wrong person to ask -- you need to find someone on the outside, someone with a colder eye. (If) you've been through all this stuff, you have a vested interest in one of the films, you're a little addled at this point."" And while the Best Film Editing award may mean more to a handful of old Hollywood hands sitting in darkened editing booths than it does to those watching on E! news, the occasion is undiminished for Cassidy. ""The ritual is all fine, and part of it, you know, in a sense you're continuing a Hollywood history, and what movies mean to people around the world, I think it's a vindication of that.""","Jay Cassidy is in the running for Best Film Editing Oscar for ""American Hustle""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The story of a king overcoming a speech impediment to lead his people through World War II took top honors at the 83rd Annual Academy Awards. ""The King's Speech"" won the best picture, best actor, best director and best original screenplay Oscars at Hollywood's Kodak Theatre Sunday night. The saga of how a college student created Facebook, which is now credited helping citizens overthrow their leader in the Mideast, lost out on the big awards, but ""The Social Network"" did win Oscars for best musical score, film editing and best adapted screenplay. Natalie Portman, who played a ballet dancer in ""Black Swan,"" was given the best actress Academy Award. Portman also won Golden Globe and SAG best actor trophies in recent weeks. When ""King's Speech"" director Tom Hooper accepted the best director Oscar, he noted that it was his mother who found the script for him. ""The moral of this story is listen to your mother,"" Hooper said. ""King's Speech"" writer David Seidler pointed out that at 73, he was the oldest person to ever win best original screenplay. ""My father always said to me I would be a late bloomer,"" Seidler said, noting that at 73 he is the oldest winner ever in the category. ""I hope that record is broken quickly and often."" Colin Firth, who portrayed the stuttering King George VI in ""The King's Speech,"" completed his sweep of best actor honors with the Oscar win.""I have a feeling my career has just peaked,"" said Firth, who also won a Golden Globe and the SAG award. Christian Bale repeated his Golden Globe and SAG award wins by taking the best supporting actor Oscar for his role in ""The Fighter."" Melissa Leo, who played the mother and manager of two boxers in ""The Fighter,"" completed her trifecta of major awards when 94-year-old Kirk Douglas handed her the best supporting actress Oscar. Leo also won Golden Globe and SAG best actress trophies. Douglas, who walked with a cane and spoke slowly with slurred speech, managed to upstage Leo with his humor, jokingly delaying reading what was in the envelope. His stand-up routine was rewarded with big laughs. Leo, whose acceptance speech included a censored expletive, used Douglas's cane to walk off stage. ""Inception, "" a film that explores the human mind and dreams, won four Academy Awards, including for cinematography, sound mixing, sound editing and visual effects. The film was also a best picture contender, although most of its eight nominations are in the technical categories. Two awards went to ""Toy Story 3"" for animated feature film and best original song. It is also a best picture contender. ""The Lost Thing"" won for short animated film. ""True Grit,"" based on the same book as the 1969 John Wayne film, failed to win in any of the 10 categories for which it was nominated. ""Alice in Wonderland,"" which was not among the 10 best picture nominees, was rewarded Sunday night with two Oscars, for costume design and art direction. ""Inside Job, a film about the 2008 financial system meltdown, won the best feature documentary Oscar. Producer Charles Ferguson used his acceptance speech to say that ""not a single financial executive has gone to jail and that's wrong."" The short documentary Oscar went to ""Strangers No More, a film about an Israeli school that includes students from 48 countries. The romantic comedy ""God of Love"" won the live action short film Oscar. A Danish movie, ""In a Better World,"" won the best foreign language film Academy Award. The Oscar for best makeup was given to ""The Wolfman.""","NEW: ""King's Speech"" wins best actor, picture, director and screenplay Oscars .

"(CNN)In honor of the Oscars, this story will be 7,633 words long, padded out with flowery phrases and belabored metaphors, leavened with a surprise adjective or two and summed up by a yawning and expected conclusion. Just kidding. Well, at least about the number of words. We can't promise anything about the rest. But that's the thing about the Oscars. So much of what they present (and represent) is predictable: amusement and pageantry, self-importance about the role of movies and occasional stretches of dullness. (Well, there ARE 24 awards to give out.) Still, you never know when the show will surprise -- and even entertain. This year, for the 87th Academy Awards, the ""entertainment"" portion will be helped immeasurably by the inclusion of host Neil Patrick Harris, who has proven himself to be an all-star performer with his turns at the Tonys and Emmys. And a number of award categories -- including best picture -- are still undecided, unlike recent years when many top winners seemed preordained. So grab some popcorn and an Oscar ballot. Here's what you can expect from this year's show. Who should win an Oscar? Cast your vote . Joan Rivers is gone. The comedian and longtime red-carpet maven died last September, and love her or hate her, she always added some zip to the red-carpet procession, from popularizing the question ""Who are you wearing?"" to calling out faux pas on ""Fashion Police."" This year's red carpet -- coverage begins at 7 p.m. ET -- is less colorful for her loss. Nevertheless, plenty of color (and color commentary) will remain. Ryan Seacrest and Giuliana Rancic are hosting on E!, while ABC will trot out Robin Roberts, Lara Spencer and Michael Strahan. The weather forecast calls for a partly cloudy day with temperatures in the mid-60s and a 10% chance of rain. Sparkling Oscar weather, in other words. When Neil Patrick Harris hosts your show, you know you're in for a good time. His song-and-dance moves at the Tonys -- which he's hosted four times -- have earned raves. And though the 2013 Emmys proved unexpectedly dull, he wasn't blamed. So now Doogie Howser is hosting the Oscars. It won't be Harris' first time on the Academy Award stage -- he opened the show in 2010 -- but it's his debut as the show's emcee. He's aware of the challenges. Ellen DeGeneres did a good job last year, but all anyone remembers is her selfie. And Hugh Jackman, another ace song-and-dance man, hosted the show in 2009. He got nice reviews. Recall anything else? ""In many ways, it's lose-lose,"" Harris told the Los Angeles Times. ""There's so much scrutiny. And so much anticipation, and so many (Oscar-viewing) parties where people are hoping that things go wrong. It's not really an audience wanting you to win."" The 42 people scheduled to hand out awards Sunday range from 80-year-old Shirley MacLaine to 18-year-old Chloe Grace Moretz, from perennial nominee Meryl Streep to newcomer Ansel Elgort. Perhaps in an effort to appeal to younger viewers, only five of the presenters are over 50. And the academy may be mindful of complaints this year about the all-white slate of acting nominees. More than one-quarter of the scheduled presenters are black, including Oprah Winfrey and perceived best actor snubee David Oyelowo, both from ""Selma."" Yes, reading off lists of nominees can be a little dull. So who's going to bring the funny? We're pinning our hopes on Kevin Hart, Jason Bateman and Eddie Murphy. Count on Oscars for Julianne Moore (best actress, ""Still Alice""), J.K. Simmons (best supporting actor, ""Whiplash"") and Patricia Arquette (best supporting actress, ""Boyhood""). After that things get less predictable. Best actor is a two-way race between sentimental favorite Michael Keaton (""Birdman"") and upstart Eddie Redmayne (""The Theory of Everything""). And best picture? ""Birdman"" appears to have a slight edge over ""Boyhood,"" with ""The Imitation Game"" as a long-shot contender. Some people think ""American Sniper's"" blockbuster status gives it a chance, but liberal Hollywood may be loath to reward a movie so beloved by right-wing America. Oscars 2015: Who will win and who should win . If you're looking for a full slate of predictions for your Oscars pool, Gold Derby is a pretty good handicapper. By now, after the Golden Globes, the SAG Awards and other awards shows, we have some idea of what the front-runners might say if they win. Based on recent history, Keaton may get teary and thank his handsome son Sean, while Redmayne and Moore might dedicate their awards to people coping with ALS and Alzheimer's, respectively. Arquette might mention her lineage as a descendant of actors, and Simmons may thank ""Whiplash"" co-star Miles Teller for how he ""inspired me every day to want to scream at him and hit him in the face."" In recent years, the academy hasn't really known what to do with the songs. Occasionally they're a highlight -- Bob Dylan's ""Things Have Changed"" and Robin Williams' ""Blame Canada"" come to mind -- but, more often, they're an excuse for a bathroom break, or not performed at all. This year features five songs with intriguing back stories. You've got ""Glory,"" the gospel-tinged Common-John Legend collaboration that's one of just two nominations received by ""Selma""; Tegan and Sara's puckish ""Everything Is Awesome!"", the only nomination for ""The Lego Movie""; ""I'm Not Gonna Miss You,"" a wrenching swan song from the Alzheimer's-stricken Glen Campbell; ""Grateful,"" from the overlooked ""Beyond the Lights"" but written by the anything-but-overlooked Diane Warren; and ""Lost Stars,"" from ""Begin Again,"" which was directed by ""Once's"" John Carney and performed by Maroon 5's Adam Levine. ""Glory"" will probably win -- it's been justifiably celebrated -- but for once, best song may be one of the strongest categories at the Oscars. (All except for Campbell's song are being performed by the original artists; Tim McGraw will sing ""I'm Not Gonna Miss You."") Find other moments to go to the bathroom. Producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron have also promised ""several musical sequences"" featuring such names as Jennifer Hudson and Lady Gaga, according to the academy's website, and ""Let It Go"" songwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez are writing a number for Neil Patrick Harris. Did we mention John Travolta is back? A year after he mangled singer Idina Menzel's name as ""Adele Nazeem,"" Travolta has somehow been invited back to redeem himself as a presenter. (Maybe they'll ask him to introduce best live action short film, where Oded Binnun, Hu Wei and Talkhon Hamzavi await.) Let's be honest: Many of us watch the Oscars not for the awards but for the high-wire risks of live TV: the fumbled speeches, the wardrobe malfunctions, the chance that someone will do or say something crazy. Jack Black, Jared Leto and Matthew McConaughey will be speaking live, too. Just saying.","The 87th Academy Awards air Sunday night on ABC .

"Mayor Rob Ford's surprise appearance in Hollywood may be the biggest thing from Toronto since Justin Bieber. Ford has become infamous well beyond Canada for his antics, including an admission that he smoked crack cocaine. Toronto's mayor was walking down Hollywood Boulevard checking out Canadians with stars on the Walk of Fame when a CNN camera crew covering the Oscars spotted him. He flew into Los Angeles Saturday night, greeted at LAX airport by TV host Jimmy Kimmel dressed as a chauffeur.  He's scheduled to appear on Kimmel's late night show Monday, he said. When CNN asked him why he came to Hollywood during the Academy Awards weekend, he delivered a combination Chamber of Commerce and re-election campaign speech. ""We are Hollywood North and we have a great city and we want people to come and visit our city, and make movies, and see the great theaters and restaurants we have and sporting venues and, you know, we have a responsible government there, too."" Ford said.  ""It is responsible and accountable too, and I have a proven track record and I just can't wait for this election."" Ford couldn't score a ticket to the Oscars ceremony Sunday, but he said he has been invited to an Oscar party.  ""I'm looking forward to it,"" he said. Along with promoting Toronto with movie producers, Ford is doing some sightseeing.  ""Having fun,absolutely, walking on the Walk of Fame here,"" he said.  ""Saw Mike Myers from Scarborough, so makes us very proud."" He's using his Twitter account to keep citizens back home informed on his activities. ""CNN checking in, I'm busy telling people what a great destination #Toronto is for the movie & tourist industries,"" he tweeted after the interview, including a photo of him talking to CNN.","Ford has become infamous for his antics, including an admission that he smoked crack .

"A day after he allegedly opened fire in the lobby of a Washington office building, in an act that increasingly appears to be politically motivated, Floyd Lee Corkins II remains largely an enigma. Corkins, 28, was reportedly a volunteer at an organization in Washington serving the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities. CNN was unable to discern a known job or source of income for Corkin and he did not appear to leave a significant online presence. He had no significant criminal record. But a court filing Wednesday suggests that Corkins may have had something else -- an ideology. And those political leanings could have been behind the Tuesday morning shooting at the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian policy group. Finger-pointing follows shooting . Corkins' parents, interviewed by the FBI following the shooting -- ""informed the FBI Special Agents that Corkins has strong opinions with respect to those he believes do not treat homosexuals in a fair manner,"" according to the affidavit. Corkins' antipathy towards those opposed to homosexuality could explain his alleged actions presence at the Family Research Council headquarters, a group that has been outspoken in its opposition to abortion, same-sex marriage, and other hot-button social issues. After the gunman entered the building, he allegedly shot a security guard without warning, and after being wrestled to the ground, allegedly said words to the effect of ""I don't like your politics,"" according to the affidavit. Corkins lived with his mother and father in a middle class single-family home in Herndon, Virginia, a Washington bedroom community minutes from Dulles International Airport. Six years ago, Corkins earned an advanced degree from a college not far from that home. ""We can confirm that Floyd Corkins graduated from George Mason with a master's degree from our college of education and human development,"" said George Mason University spokesman Dan Walsch. The Washington Post quoted Allan P. Chan, a former George Mason student, as saying he lifted weights and socialized with Corkins. Chan said Corkins was secretive and somewhat odd, and displayed an intense interest in the 19th-century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, according to the Post. Mental health evaluation ordered . Prosecutors said they are still investigating the motive behind the shooting, and the motive could determine whether Corkins is charged with domestic terrorism or hate crimes. Corkins is charged with the federal offense of interstate transportation of a firearm and ammunition, along with the District of Columbia offense of assault with intent to kill while armed. The offenses carry the following maximum penalties: 10 years imprisonment on the federal offense and 30 years imprisonment on the District of Columbia offense. The District of Columbia offense also carries a mandatory-minimum term of five years imprisonment. On Thursday, leaders on all sides of the same-sex marriage issue disavowed the use of violence. ""I was shocked to hear that someone who has volunteered with the DC Center could be the cause of such a tragic act of violence. No matter the circumstances, we condemn such violence in the strongest terms possible,"" David Mariner, executive director of the DC Center for the LGBT Community said on a note posted on the center's door. ""We hope for a full and speedy recovery for the victim and our thoughts are with him and his family.""","Floyd Lee Corkins II, 28, volunteered at an LGBT center in Washington .

"Cairo (CNN) -- A senior Egyptian general admits that ""virginity checks"" were performed on women arrested at a demonstration this spring, the first such admission after previous denials by military authorities. The allegations arose in an Amnesty International report, published weeks after the March 9 protest. It claimed female demonstrators were beaten, given electric shocks, strip-searched, threatened with prostitution charges and forced to submit to virginity checks. At that time, Maj. Amr Imam said 17 women had been arrested but denied allegations of torture or ""virginity tests."" But now a senior general who asked not to be identified said the virginity tests were conducted and defended the practice. ""The girls who were detained were not like your daughter or mine,"" the general said. ""These were girls who had camped out in tents with male protesters in Tahrir Square, and we found in the tents Molotov cocktails and (drugs)."" The general said the virginity checks were done so that the women wouldn't later claim they had been raped by Egyptian authorities. ""We didn't want them to say we had sexually assaulted or raped them, so we wanted to prove that they weren't virgins in the first place,"" the general said. ""None of them were (virgins)."" This demonstration occurred nearly a month after Egypt's longtime President Hosni Mubarak stepped down amid a wave of popular and mostly peaceful unrest aimed at his ouster and the institution of democratic reforms. Afterward, Egypt's military -- which had largely stayed on the sidelines of the revolution -- officially took control of the nation's political apparatus as well, until an agreed-upon constitution and elections. Mubarak denies ordering shootings . The March 9 protest occurred in Tahrir Square, which became famous over 18 historic and sometimes bloody days and nights of protests that led to Mubarak's resignation. But unlike in those previous demonstrations, the Egyptian military targeted the protesters. Soldiers dragged dozens of demonstrators from the square and through the gates of the landmark Egyptian Museum. Salwa Hosseini, a 20-year-old hairdresser and one of the women named in the Amnesty report, described to CNN how uniformed soldiers tied her up on the museum's grounds, forced her to the ground and slapped her, then shocked her with a stun gun while calling her a prostitute. ""They wanted to teach us a lesson,"" Hosseini said soon after the Amnesty report came out. ""They wanted to make us feel that we do not have dignity."" The treatment got worse, Hosseini said, when she and the 16 other female prisoners were taken to a military detention center in Heikstep. There, she said, she and several of other female detainees were subjected to a ""virginity test."" ""We did not agree for a male doctor to perform the test,"" she said. But Hosseini said her captors forced her to comply by threatening her with more stun-gun shocks. ""I was going through a nervous breakdown at that moment,"" she recalled. ""There was no one standing during the test, except for a woman and the male doctor. But several soldiers were standing behind us watching the backside of the bed. I think they had them standing there as witnesses."" The senior Egyptian general said the 149 people detained after the March 9 protest were subsequently tried in military courts, and most have been sentenced to a year in prison. Authorities later revoked those sentences ""when we discovered that some of the detainees had university degrees, so we decided to give them a second chance,"" he said. The senior general reaffirmed that the military council was determined to make Egypt's democratic transition a success. ""The date for handover to a civil government can't come soon enough for the ruling military council,"" he said. ""The army can't wait to return to its barracks and do what it does best -- protect the nation's borders.""","17 women were arrested at a March 9 protest in Cairo, after Mubarak's ouster .

"(CNN) -- The urban planning equivalent of a Rorschach test, a ""Smart City"" can be taken to mean almost anything. But by the most popular criteria; sustainable energy and development, open data and government, and integrated information, communications and technology (ICT) serving wide areas of a city, these ultra-modern hubs are on the rise. Industrial analysts IHS claim predict there will be 88 cities that fit the description by 2025, up from 21 today, taking in contenders far from the usual suspects of Vancouver and Barcelona. These dynamic new players hope to redraw the map. Bogota, Colombia . While sister city Medellin has been lauded for its sustainability practices, the capital has used pioneering data analysis to address its longstanding issues with pollution and congestion. Improvements in walkways and a widespread bike-sharing scheme have led to reduced car use, with noise pollution falling almost 10 decibels since 2005. The city has also benefited from the Transmilenio mass transit bus system and a fleet of electric taxis. Masdar, UAE . The new oasis in the Abu Dhabi desert was supposed to have been the first zero carbon, zero waste city, and if such ambition is yet to be realized there is still much to admire. It is home to the region's largest solar power plant, serving all its energy needs with 17,500 MWh of clean electricity each year. Autonomous vehicles handle transportation needs, while water and electricity use is monitored for efficiency with high-tech sensors. Accra, Ghana . A recent IBM paper on infrastructure in the Ghanaian capital indicates some of the radical improvements to be undertaken, including mass transit systems fitted with intelligent technologies to better regulate the city's traffic issues. Locally-sourced renewable energy will tackle blackout problems and enable growth, such as for the $40 million Ghana Cyber City, intended to become a world class tech hub. Yachay, Ecuador . President Rafael Correa's ""City of Knowledge,"" which he describes as the grandest national initiative for a century. His government is investing over $1 billion in the north highlands site, anticipating its gains would extend the rest of the nation. A new university campus, modelled on South Korean tech cities, would develop elite engineering, energy and biotechnology projects, complete with extensive education and research facilities. Guadalajara, Mexico . The ""Mexican Silicon Valley"" is already a hub of over 100 software companies, from startups to Intel and IBM branches, with thousands of local students graduating with STEM degrees. It will soon receive a major upgrade through the Ciudad Creativa Digital development on a 400 hectare grid, wired full of advanced communications, data-gathering sensors, renewable energy, and transport networks. Dholera, India . With India set to become the world's most populous nation, ambitious plans are underway for new urban development with Prime Minister Narendra Modi promising 100 smart cities. Dholera, in the western state of Gujarat, would serve as test case. A smart grid is to be constructed on an area twice the size of Mumbai, designated a special investment region (SIR), which would be managed from central command centers with high speed transit routes. Lima, Peru . The government's commitment to open data means that citizens can access most municipal services online, and that figured can be analyzed as a basis for policy initiatives. This has enabled intelligent transport management systems and a plan for energy efficiencies that could cut carbon emissions by 19% by 2030. The city has committed to tie infrastructure development to carbon reduction, including ""area greening"" in residential areas. Lusail, Qatar . The Gulf state's efforts to expand beyond Doha before World Cup 2022 could hinge on this brand-new metropolis to the North. A reported $45 billion will be spent on Lusail, powered by one of the world's most extravagant hydrocarbon centers, completed with luxury marina, commerce and entertainment zones. Vilnius, Lithuania . One of Eastern Europe's most upwardly mobile hubs benefits from one of the fastest Internet connections in the world, and recently received an IBM grant as part of the 'Smart Vilnius' project. This is earmarked for upgrading transport and its management, as well the development of data-based infrastructure. A new tech park for gaming, big data, and cyber security companies will press its credentials further. Kalkara, Malta . The island is developing a technology and business park in the village of Kalkara at a cost of almost $300 million, with ICT and robotics among the emerging businesses. The special zone uses advanced monitoring systems to manage energy and water, with buildings architecturally designed to maximize efficiency. Ultra-fast broadband and a low tax, pro-business government are also geared to attracting new investment.","'Smart cities' are set to quadruple over the next decade .

"A male U.S. citizen who contracted the Ebola virus in Sierra Leone arrived Tuesday at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. The patient could be seen walking, apparently with some help from one person, into the facility. The patient, whose name has not been released publicly, was taken from Africa in an air ambulance. The State Department described the patient as a U.S. citizen. On Monday, the World Health Organization said a doctor working for the agency in an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone tested positive for the virus. WHO would not reveal the doctor's nationality nor where he or she would be evacuated to for treatment. WHO officials would not say whether the doctor is the American Ebola patient, citing a confidentiality policy. Last month, two Americans infected with Ebola were flown to Atlanta after being given an experimental drug to fight the virus in Liberia. They were treated at the Emory hospital for several weeks before being released. Other American improves . Another American doctor infected with Ebola arrived in Nebraska for treatment last week. Doctors on Tuesday said that Dr. Rick Sacra's condition continues to improve. ""We are pleased with his progress,"" said Phil Smith, medical director at the Biocontainment Unit at the Nebraska Medical Center. ""His lab values are improving and he's becoming more alert and interactive. We continue to be encouraged by what we're seeing up to this point."" Sacra's family said more of his personality has emerged each day. They speak with him on a regular basis through video conferencing. The Ebola virus causes viral hemorrhagic fever, which refers to virus types that affect multiple organ systems in the body and are often accompanied by bleeding. Humans contract Ebola through contact with the bodily fluids of infected animals or the bodily fluids of infected humans. No vaccine or medicine has been proved to cure the disease, but the first human trial of an experimental Ebola vaccine began last week. Ebola by the numbers . More than 4,200 cases of Ebola have been reported since the first documented case in December, WHO has said (pdf) Tuesday. Of those cases, there have been more than 2,200 fatalities. The official numbers are believed to be dramatically under-reported. More than 40% of the cases have been diagnosed in the past three weeks, the agency said. This is considered the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history.  The bulk of the cases are in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone. Infected people have also turned up in Nigeria and Senegal. WHO said Monday the rapid spread of the virus in Liberia shows no sign of slowing. ""The number of new cases is increasing exponentially,"" WHO said, calling the situation a ""dire emergency with ... unprecedented dimensions of human suffering."" It's a crisis unlike any other during previous Ebola outbreaks, according to WHO. Taxis packed with families who fear they've contracted the deadly virus crisscross the Liberian capital, searching for a place where they can be treated, WHO said. But there are no free beds. ""As soon as a new Ebola treatment facility is opened, it immediately fills to overflowing with patients,"" the U.N. group said. U.S. sending additional help . To help ease some of the burden on West Africa's already over-taxed medical system, the U.S. announced Tuesday it will send $10 million additional funds. That's in addition to the $100 million the U.S. has already sent to help fight the outbreak.  USAID also announced it will make $75 million extra available. The new funds will pay for transportation and support to send 100 more health care workers to help fight the epidemic.  The staff will run Ebola treatment units. The staff will be sent to Liberia, Nigeria, Guinea and Sierra Leone. The WHO and several nonprofit agencies on the ground have repeatedly called for the international community to send additional trained help. If you are a trained nurse, physician assistant or doctor who wants to help, USAID has created a website where people can sign up to help. USAID funding has already provided 130,000 sets of personal protective equipment, 50,000 hygiene kits, and 1,000 new beds.","An American Ebola patient arrives at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta .

"Two Palestinian teens killed in the West Bank presented no direct threat when they were shot last week, the United Nations said Friday in a preliminary report. Nadeem Nouwarah, 17, and Mohammad Odeh Salameh, 16, were killed during protests on May 15 on the anniversary of the ""Nakba,"" a day commemorating the displacement of Palestinians that accompanied the creation of Israel after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Six hours of raw video distributed by advocacy organization Defense for Children International and reviewed by CNN shows the boys were shot on the same patch of asphalt. Their deaths were 73 minutes apart. The boys' relatives blame the Israeli military for the killings. ""The killings may amount to extrajudicial executions under human rights law as well as willful killings under international humanitarian law, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement on Friday. It called for a prompt, independent, impartial and transparent investigation. ""Our office has repeatedly raised its concerns about the excessive use of force by Israeli security forces and the lack of accountability for such incident,"" the statement said. ""We also urge Israel to make public the findings of this investigation and any steps regarding accountability that are taken."" But an Israeli military spokesman said its forces fired no live rounds during clashes where the boys were killed. ""During that demonstration that was extremely violent, the Israeli Defense Force used crowd-control methods and riot-dispersal means to prevent and control the overflow of the violence,"" Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said. ""The preliminary IDF inquiry indicates that no live fire was shot at all Thursday during the riots in Beitunya, and we have to determine what caused this result,"" Lerner added. The State Department joined several human rights groups calling for an investigation.","The boys' relatives blame the Israeli military for the killings .

"Abbottabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The United States will be given access to Osama bin Laden's wives and children, Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik told CNN on Tuesday. On Monday, a senior Pakistani intelligence source had said the United States could question bin Laden's wives only if their ""country of origin has been asked for permission."" One of bin Laden's wives is from Yemen. A well-placed U.S. official who would not speak on the record said the other two wives are from Saudi Arabia. Malik, in an interview Tuesday with CNN, said Pakistan is giving the United States access ""so they can interrogate them, they can interview them."" Malik did not say when or where the United States would have such access. Pentagon spokesman Col. Dave Lapan said Tuesday U.S. and Pakistani officials were discussing the matter. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the administration is optimistic that U.S.-Pakistani cooperation ""will continue with regards to"" access to bin Laden's wives ""and also to the materials that were collected by the Pakistanis after the U.S. commandos left"" the compound where they killed bin Laden. Carney described the U.S.-Pakistani relationship as ""important and complicated."" Malik, in his interview with CNN, said allowing the wives to be interviewed should make clear to the United States that Pakistan has nothing to hide -- and put to rest any suspicions that the world's most-wanted terrorist might have had a support network inside the Pakistani government, military or intelligence services. If Pakistan had ""skeletons"" to hide, ""do you think we would allow access to the wives and the children of Osama?"" he asked. Malik called the decision ""proof"" that Pakistan is ""very clear that we didn't know"" bin Laden was living in a compound in Abbottabad, a Pakistani city with a major military presence, rather than in mountainous areas which Pakistani and U.S. officials often said were believed to be bin Laden's hiding place. U.S. President Barack Obama told CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" ""We think that there had to be some sort of support network for bin Laden inside of Pakistan. But we don't know who or what that support network was."" Malik said there is ""not an iota of doubt"" in his mind that bin Laden had ""no support network from official sources."" Acknowledging an intelligence failure, he said the investigation that Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani has ordered will explore what went wrong, and the answers ""will be made public."" One U.S. official said ""both sides understand the importance of the relationship,"" but expressed concerns over Pakistan's control over all of its political participants. ""The boat is moving, but there is some chop in the water."" The official said that CIA Director Leon Panetta and Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence Chief Lt. Gen. Ahmad Shuja Pasha ""have always had productive exchanges, even though there have been disagreements."" Pasha's position atop the ISI is considered valuable to the U.S., the official said, because of his close connection to chief of army staff, Gen. Ashfaq Pervez Kayani. Meanwhile,Pakistani officials have said bin Laden's family members will be repatriated to their home countries after their initial interrogations. All three wives and eight of his children were taken into Pakistani custody after the May 2 raid by U.S. commandos that killed bin Laden, the leader of the al Qaeda terrorist movement. The 29-year-old Yemeni wife, Amal Ahmed Abdulfattah, was wounded during the raid. The U.S. official identified the other two women as Khairiah Sabar, also known as ""Umm Hamza,"" and Siham Sabar, or ""Umm Khalid."" Although U.S. officials have warned of possible reprisal attacks by bin Laden supporters, there has been no surge of attacks inside Afghanistan, the commander of NATO forces in eastern Afghanistan said Tuesday. ""There has been a lot of talk about revenge, about (insurgents) coming at both the coalition and the Afghan forces here, but we have not seen that here since the first of May,"" said Regional Command East Commander Maj. Gen. John Campbell. U.S. and coalition forces were already on guard against an expected Taliban spring offensive even before bin Laden's death, Campbell added. Campbell said he hoped that bin Laden's death, and the images of him inside the compound that the United States released, may discourage insurgents. But he also cautioned that bin Laden will certainly be replaced with a new al Qaeda leader. ""I don't think that one person makes the war on terror here,"" Campbell said. But he added that he expects insurgents to face some difficulties raising money without bin Laden's ""charisma"" as part of the effort. The commander also noted al Qaeda is just one of the insurgent groups that NATO and U.S. forces are fighting in Afghanistan.

"(CNN) -- USA Swimming on Monday suspended Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian ever, for six months and said he won't be on next year's U.S. team at the world championships. The 22-time Olympic medalist also won't be paid his monthly stipend, USA Swimming said on its website. The organization said Phelps, who was charged with DUI last week in Maryland, had violated its code of conduct. ""Michael accepts USA Swimming's sanctions. He has apologized for his actions and, as he shared yesterday, is taking steps to address them,"" a spokesperson from his management company, Octagon, told CNN. Octagon said Phelps had entered a six-week, in-patient treatment program. Phelps announced Sunday on Twitter that he is taking a break from the sport ""to attend a program that will provide the help I need to better understand myself."" According to his official Twitter account, ""Swimming is a major part of my life, but right now I need to focus my attention on me as an individual."" The decision comes after he was charged last week with driving under the influence of alcohol, excessive speed and crossing double lines on Interstate 95 in Baltimore. The four-time Olympian, 29, was arrested last Tuesday about 1:40 a.m. and later released, police said. According to media reports, police said his blood-alcohol content was .14. ""Michael's conduct was serious and required significant consequences,"" USA Swimming Executive Director Chuck Wielgus said Monday in a written statement. The chief executive officer of the United States Olympic Committee said he thought the sanctions were appropriate, . ""And we are glad that Michael is seeking help,"" Scott Blackmun said in a news release. ""We are grateful that nobody was hurt and appreciate the speed at which USA Swimming and Michael took action."" Last week's arrest is not Phelps' first run-in with the law . In 2004, he was arrested on charges of driving under the influence in Salisbury, Maryland. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 months probation. He also issued an apology after that incident. Five years later, a photograph of him smoking marijuana at a party surfaced. ""I'll make a million mistakes in my life, but as long as I never make the same mistake again, then I've been able to learn and grow,"" Phelps said in 2012. He also said that the incident made him realize who his real friends were. He retired after winning four gold and two silver medals at the 2012 Olympics. Phelps returned to competitive swimming in April and raced for the United States in August at the Pan Pacific Swimming Championships, his first international meet since the London Games (and two years before the next Games in Brazil).

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A federal judge on Tuesday set aside the conviction of Republican former Sen. Ted Stevens while excoriating the case's prosecutors. A courtroom sketch shows ex- Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens at Tuesday proceedings, where he said he had ""new hope."" District Judge Emmet Sullivan also appointed an independent, nongovernment attorney, Henry Schuelke III, to investigate possible misconduct by the government lawyers who prosecuted the 85-year-old former senator from Alaska. ""In nearly 25 years on the bench, I've never seen anything approaching the mishandling and misconduct that I've seen in this case,"" Sullivan said. In October, Stevens was found guilty of seven counts of lying on Senate ethics forms. He lost his bid for re-election in November to Democratic challenger Mark Begich, then mayor of Anchorage. In December, an unnamed FBI whistle-blower accused prosecutors of withholding evidence from the defense. The whistle-blower reported that someone with the government had an inappropriate relationship with Bill Allen, an oil industry executive who was the government's key witness. In a dismissal motion filed Wednesday, the Justice Department acknowledged that Stevens was not given access to the notes taken by prosecutors during an April 2008 interview with Allen. The notes show that responses by Allen were inconsistent with testimony he gave against Stevens and that information from the interview could have benefited Stevens at trial, according to the motion. ""When we were finally given [the notes], you might have thought my reaction would be to celebrate, do high-fives, that we were right,"" Brendan Sullivan, an attorney for Stevens, said Tuesday. ""It was not like that at all. I was sick to my stomach. How could they do that? Then my revulsion turned to rage, silent rage for a number of days."" The revelation also helped prompt Attorney General Eric Holder to drop the case. ""In light of this conclusion, and in consideration of the totality of the circumstances of this particular case, I have determined that it is in the interest of justice to dismiss the indictment and not proceed with a new trial,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement last week. ""If I were Sen. [Robert] Byrd, I'd say 'hallelujah,' "" a triumphant Stevens said after leaving the courthouse Tuesday. Stevens maintained his innocence throughout a government investigation that led to an indictment and conviction for failing to disclose hundreds of thousands of dollars of ""freebies"" from an oilfield services company on Senate ethics forms. In a statement read to the court Tuesday, Stevens said that his faith in the justice system had been restored. ""Until recently, my faith in the criminal justice system was unwavering. But what some members of this prosecution team did nearly destroyed my faith. Their conduct has consequences they must know can never be reversed,"" he said. ""But [I now have] new hope that others may be spared from similar miscarriages of justice."" Stevens added that he would ""encourage the enactment of legislation to reform laws relating to the responsibilities and duties of those entrusted with the solemn task of enforcing federal criminal laws."" Paul O'Brien, one of the new government attorneys assigned to the case, made no attempt to the justify the conduct of the previous prosecution team. ""We deeply regret this occurred,"" he said. ""We apologize to the court."" In issuing his ruling, Sullivan noted the Justice Department's investigation into potential misconduct by government prosecutors had gone on for six months with no result. ""The silence is deafening,"" Sullivan said.  See what the reversal means for the Justice Department » . The judge previously had excoriated prosecutors during the trial and held the prosecution in contempt at one point. One of Stevens' longtime friends, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, said last weekend that Stevens was ""screwed by our own Justice Department."" Hatch praised Holder for ""standing up and fixing this foul situation."" ""I think he's more than shown integrity and decency in this matter, and it's not an easy thing for him to do that,"" Hatch said. ""He has, in looking at it, realized now what people like myself have been saying is 100 percent right."" In the days that followed the Justice Department's dismissal motion, Alaska state Republican leaders, including Gov. Sarah Palin, called on Begich to step down and allow a rematch without what has been called the ""taint"" of a criminal case against Stevens. ""There's no way [Stevens] can just 'put this behind him' as some have suggested he should,"" Palin said in a statement released Tuesday.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Supporters of an accused assassin of a Pakistani politician brought him Valentine's flowers and cards Monday, the same day a judge charged him with murder and terrorism acts, his lawyer said. Pakistani police have said Mumtaz Hussain Qadri confessed to gunning down Salman Taseer, the governor of Punjab Province, outside an outdoor market in Islamabad last month. The suspect was serving as Taseer's security guard at the time of the shooting. Police said Qadri shot Taseer because of the liberal politician's campaign to amend Pakistan's controversial blasphemy laws. The charges of murder and committing an act of terrorism each carry the possible death penalty in Pakistan. When the judge asked Qadri to enter a plea, he denied committing a crime, said Raja Shuja Ur Rehman, his lawyer. ""I acted against a blasphemer per the guidelines of the Quran and the teachings of the prophet Muhammad,"" Qadri told the judge, according to his lawyer. ""I didn't kill an innocent person."" Pakistani authorities held Monday's hearing inside the jail where Qadri is being kept for security reasons. Around 50 people stood outside the jail bearing flowers and Valentine's wishes for the accused assassin, his lawyer said. It wasn't clear whether jail officials delivered the flowers to Qadri. Since the shooting, Pakistan's hard-line religious groups have congratulated Qadri and held demonstrations calling him a hero, while condemning anyone who tries to change Pakistan's blasphemy laws. The next court date for Qadri is scheduled for February 26th when the prosecution is scheduled to present its evidence.","The suspect was serving as the politician's security guard .

"(CNN)  -- Honduran authorities on Monday clashed with supporters of deposed President Jose Manuel Zelaya, but the extent of the unrest appeared limited. Zelaya supporters burn tires Monday near the presidential palace in the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa. The Telesur TV network showed soldiers advancing on some streets of the capital, Tegucigalpa, and blue-helmeted police clashing with noisy demonstrators, one day after military troops detained Zelaya and sent him into exile. Other images showed troops, tanks and other military assets deployed around the presidential grounds. The station, a conglomerate formed by several Latin American governments and partially funded by the pro-Zelaya Venezuelan government, also aired images of demonstrators setting fires in the streets. Gauging the size and scope of the demonstrations and clashes was difficult because of limitations that journalists reported. Adriana Sivori, a reporter for Telesur, reported that she and other journalists were briefly detained and mistreated by Honduran soldiers. She was live on television as she described the troops transporting them at gunpoint. Two national television stations were taken off the air following Sunday's military-led coup, and a third station told CNN en Español that its content was being limited by authorities. CNN en Español correspondent Krupskaia Alis, who witnessed Monday's protests, said the demonstrators numbered in the hundreds. At least 15 were injured Monday, the newspaper La Prensa reported. iReport.com: Are you there? Share your photos, videos . The military deposed Zelaya early Sunday and flew him to Costa Rica. Roberto Micheletti, president of the Congress, was sworn in as provisional president. Zelaya had been at odds with the other branches of government over a referendum he wanted to hold Sunday. The nation's Supreme Court ruled the referendum was illegal and Congress voted not to hold it. The Supreme Court also overturned Zelaya's dismissal of Honduras' top general, who said the military would not participate in the referendum. The court ordered he general be reinstated immediately. Zelaya disregarded those actions and vowed to hold the vote Sunday anyway.  Watch details on ""curious situation"" in Honduras » . On Monday, Micheletti began to build his provisional government. He named seven new members to his cabinet, which he said will be in place until the planned presidential elections slated for November of this year. Micheletti, formerly the president of Congress, has said the change in power was not a coup, but a democratic process that saw the ousting of a president who had exceeded his power. The Honduran Supreme Court said after the coup that it had authorized the military action. The United States and most Latin American nations have condemned the coup, the first in Latin America since the end of the Cold War. While military interventions were once routine in Latin America, civilian governments have held sway across the region since the 1980s, and previously all-powerful militaries have receded into the background. ""That history is a thing of the past, and it should be buried so that it never happens again,"" Jorge Arturo Reina, Honduras' ambassador to the U.N. told CNN en Español, following a meeting of the General Assembly to address the issue. The head of the Organization of American States also condemned the coup. President Obama on Monday called the turmoil in Honduras a step backward from the ""enormous progress of the last 20 years in establishing democratic traditions in Latin America.""  Watch what Obama has to say about the coup » . ""We believe that the coup was not legal and that President Zelaya remains the president of Honduras,"" Obama said. Though deposed, Zelaya continued to carry out his presidential duties, attending a special meeting of the leftist group ALBA, the Spanish acronym for Bolivarian Alternative for the Peoples of Our Americas, in Nicaragua. ALBA, founded by Cuba and Venezuela in 2004 to counter U.S. influence in Latin America, said member nations would withdraw ambassadors and top diplomats from Honduras until Zelaya is restored to power. Zelaya is expected to travel to the United Nations on Tuesday. Despite widespread condemnation for the coup, analysts see plenty of blame to go around -- and no easy solution. iReport.com: Are you there? Share your photos, videos . ""There are no heroes in this story,"" said Larry Birns, director of the Washington-based Council on Hemispheric Affairs. ""These people are caricatures of rectitude rather than examples of it."" The Honduran Supreme Court, he said, is ""one of the most corrupt institutions in Latin America."" And Zelaya overplayed his hand, Birns and others said. ""Zelaya was part of the problem,"" said Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue policy institute. ""He's partly responsible for what happened. He was pushing too hard on a very fragile political institution. He was just plowing ahead against the wishes of every political institution, including his own political party."" Zelaya's removal also raises larger issues for many fragile Latin American democracies. ""What happens when the Supreme Court decides against the president and the president ignores it? Who enforces it?"" asked Robert Pastor, a Latin America national security adviser for President Jimmy Carter in the late 1970s. What happens next is clearly unknown. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Monday that an OAS delegation would travel to Honduras as early as Tuesday to begin working on restoring a constitutional government. That might not be an easy task. ""According to mainstream Honduran media sources, Zelaya's removal has the widespread support of the political and business elite and the military, and it appears doubtful that he will be able to return to power,"" said Heather Berkman, an analyst with the Eurasia Group consulting firm. ""An exit strategy is needed,"" Birns said. ""But it's going to be extremely difficult to come out with an exit strategy unless they get consent of key players like the national legislature."" Pastor holds out some hope. ""I don't think it's impossible,"" he said. Said Hakim: ""You can never put the toothpaste back in the tube. But you can provide a peaceful transition process.""

"The phone of the first officer of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was on and made contact with a cell tower in Malaysia about the time the plane disappeared from radar, a U.S. official told CNN on Monday. However, the U.S. official -- who cited information shared by Malaysian investigators -- said there was no evidence the first officer, Fariq Abdul Hamid, had tried to make a call. The official told CNN's Pamela Brown on Monday that a cell-phone tower in Penang, Malaysia -- about 250 miles from where the flight's transponder last sent a signal -- detected the first officer's phone searching for service roughly 30 minutes after authorities believe the plane made a sharp turn westward. The details do appear to reaffirm suggestions based on radar and satellite data that the plane was off course and was probably flying low enough to obtain a signal from a cell tower, the U.S. official said. The revelation follows reporting over the weekend in a Malaysian newspaper that the first officer had tried to make a telephone call while the plane was in flight. Asked Sunday by CNN about the newspaper report about a purported effort to make a call by the first officer, Malaysia's acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein said, ""As far as I know, no, but as I said that would be in the realm of the police and the other international (authorities) and when the time comes that will be revealed. But I do not want to speculate on that at the moment."" U.S. officials familiar with the investigation told CNN they have been told that no other cell phones were picked up by the Penang tower. Pilots are supposed to turn off their cell phones before pushing back from the gate. ""It would be very rare in my opinion to have someone with a cell phone on in the cockpit,"" safety analyst David Soucie said. ""It's never supposed to be on at all. It's part of every check list of every airline I am familiar with."" When the plane first went missing, authorities said millions of cell phone records were searched, looking for evidence that calls had been made from the plane after it took off, but the search turned up nothing. Underwater search is shortened . Efforts to find the missing plane and the 239 people aboard were focused beneath the choppy surface of the southern Indian Ocean on Monday as Australian authorities sent a U.S. Navy-contracted submersible diving toward the sea floor. But after completing just six hours of searching for underwater debris, the autonomous underwater vehicle Bluefin-21 returned to the surface, according to the Joint Agency Coordination Centre in Perth, Australia. It should have taken the probe and its operators 24 hours to map the first portion of the search area: 16 hours to map, four hours' travel time to just above the ocean floor and back, and four hours for analysts to examine the data gathered. It is unclear how much of the area -- 5 kilometers by 8 kilometers (3.1 miles by 4.9 miles) -- the Bluefin scanned. It could take up to two months to scan the entire search area. Officials said a built-in safety feature recalled the underwater search vehicle after it exceeded its operating depth of 4,500 meters (14,763 feet). Capt. Mark Matthews, who heads the U.S. presence in the search effort, said the Bluefin aborted so the crew could refine the mission parameters. Charts indicated the ocean was at most 4,400 meters (14,436 feet) deep, so when the Bluefin went deeper than that, it was returned to the surface. ""It happened in the very far corner of the area it's searching, so they are just shifting the search box a little bit away from that deep water and proceeding with the search,"" he told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" The decision to put the Bluefin-21 into the water for the first time in the 38-day search comes nearly a week after listening devices last heard sounds that could be from locator beacons attached to the plane's ""black boxes."" ""We haven't had a single detection in six days,"" Australian chief search coordinator Angus Houston said. ""It's time to go underwater."" The probe is equipped with side-scan sonar -- acoustic technology that creates pictures from the reflections of sound. Such technology is routinely used to find sunken ships and was crucial in finding Air France Flight 447, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009. Houston cautioned against hopes that the underwater vehicle will find wreckage of the plane, which disappeared on March 8 on a flight between Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Beijing that should have taken about six hours. ""It may not,"" he said. ""This will be a slow and painstaking process."" The bottom of the search area is not sharply mountainous -- it's more flat and almost rolling, Houston said. But he said the area probably has a lot of silt, which can ""complicate"" the search. The search area for the Bluefin is in what officials labeled the most likely area the plane could be. ""It was the site of the highest signal strength or the loudest received signal,"" Matthews told CNN, referring to the pings detected by a towed pinger locator, a wing-shaped listening device connected to the ship by a cable. ""It was also where we had an increase in signal strength as we drove through the area and then a decrease as we drove out of the area."" New clue on the surface of the water? Another possible clue into the plane's disappearance emerged Monday. Australian officials announced the Australian ship Ocean Shield had detected an oil slick Sunday evening. It is unclear where the oil came from. A 2-liter sample has been collected for examination, but it will take a few days to analyze. ""I stress the source of the oil has yet to be determined, but the oil slick is approximately 5,500 meters (3.4 miles) downwind ... from the vicinity of the detections of the TPL on Ocean Shield,"" Houston said. CNN Aviation Analyst Les Abend, who flies a Boeing 777, said the engines on the plane have about 20 quarts of oil each. ""It could be slowly dripping up to the surface,"" he told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""They're saying an oil slick. I'm wondering if it's just some sort of a fluid slick. It could be (from) hydraulics."" If it is oil, it's not the first oil slick detected as part of the search. A similar find in the first days of the search was determined to be fuel oil from a freighter. Surface search nearing end . Twelve aircraft and 15 ships participated in Monday's search efforts on the surface, covering an 18,400-square-mile (47,600-square-kilometer) area. The surface search was among the last, Houston said. ""The air and surface search for floating material will be completed in the next two to three days in the area where the aircraft most likely entered the water,"" Houston said. That search was energized last week when searchers using the Navy-owned pinger locator and sonobuoys detected sounds that could have been from the plane's black boxes, or data and voice recorders. But after a week of silence, the batteries powering the locator beacons are probably dead, a top official from the company that manufactures the beacons told CNN on Sunday. They were certified to last 30 days, a deadline that's already passed. That means searchers may not be able to detect any more pings to help lead them to those pieces of the missing plane. ""More than likely they are reaching end of life or already have. If (a beacon) is still going, it is very, very quiet at this point,"" Jeff Densmore told CNN's ""State of the Union with Candy Crowley"" on Sunday. The time is ripe to move on to other search techniques. ""Every good effort has been expended, but it's now looking like the batteries are failing, and it's time to start mowing the lawn, as we say, time to start scanning the sea floor,"" said Rob McCollum, a CNN analyst and ocean search specialist. Catherine Tamoh Lion, the mother of the missing plane's chief steward Andrew Nari, said the news that no more pings have been heard is upsetting. ""Our sadness is now just prolonged,"" she told CNN. ""I feel like they are somewhere,"" she said of the passengers. ""I don't know where. Just praying to God. Miracles can happen. "" How do underwater sonar subs work? What happens after the pingers die? Listening for pings, water plays tricks .","CNN aviation analyst says surface slick could be fluid leaking from underwater plane .

"(CNN) -- Just when you thought it was impossible for ISIS to become any more contemptible, the group in a recent publication boasted of its success in bringing the return of slavery. More specifically, it announced and provided elaborate justification for the enslavement of women. We didn't need a new propaganda effort from the self-appointed Islamic State to know the nightmare that has befallen women in territories captured by its fighters. Now we've had a look at the twisted logic that rationalizes sexual exploitation, killing and enslavement of women and young girls. Is it any wonder then that women in Iraq and Syria have moved to the forefront of the war against ISIS? They have taken up arms, organized civil protests and warned the world about the threat that ISIS poses. A woman is leading Kurdish forces fighting ISIS in the city of Kobani, Syria. And a substantial number -- more than one third -- of the Kurdish battlefield troops in Syria are women. One reason they fight is that women have more to lose than anyone else. For a time, the rumors seemed so extreme, so outlandish, that they were met with a dose of skepticism: Talk of slave markets, mass kidnappings, women treated as spoils of war distributed among the victorious fighters, sounded like tales from a historic account, not of a 21st-century conflict. But in 2014, using the Internet, ISIS described what it did with members of Iraq's Yazidi minority: ""After capture, the Yazidi women and children were then divided according to Sharia amongst the fighters of the Islamic State. ..."" The explanation included ""scholarly analysis"" to justify the religious logic and social benefits of reviving the slavery of women. ""One should remember that enslaving the families of the kuffar -- the infidels -- and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of the Sharia, or Islamic law."" It seems pointless to discuss religious doctrine with a group determined to kill its way into the imposition of seventh-century norms more than 1,400 years after they were written. A number of top Muslim clerics have rejected ISIS' interpretation of Islamic law. And some Muslims argue the Quran is actually egalitarian. ISIS, in contrast, finds slavery and the holding of concubines a beneficial practice, writing that ""a number of contemporary scholars"" say the end of slavery has led to an increase in ""adultery, fornication, etc."" The latest publication confirms what human rights investigators and survivors of ISIS have reported. The United Nations says slave markets now operate in Raqqa, the ISIS ""capital"" in Syria, and in Mosul, until recently a modern city in Iraq. U.N. investigators interviewed witnesses, who told of women taken captive by ISIS, sexually abused and handed to slave traders. The United Nations estimates there are at least 2,500 victims. Others say the number may be much higher. When Kurdish forces recaptured Mosul Dam, they reportedly said they found a woman naked and tied up, who had been raped repeatedly by ISIS men. Similar reports have come from other ISIS-controlled areas. Just like the publicized beheading of captives has a strategic purpose, the treatment of women as battlefield loot is a way of enticing new recruits. But it is also a powerful motivation for women to join the fight. In the battle over Kobani, just across the border from Turkey, ground troops are led by two top officers of the YPG, the Kurdish People's Protection Units. One of them is a woman, Mayssa Abdo, known in the battlefield as Narin Afrin. About 35% of YPG's forces are women. Then there is YPJ, the Women's Protection Unit, counting 7,500 uniformed fighters, some barely bigger than their rifles. Kurdish women from Turkey have volunteered to fight alongside their Kurdish brethren in Syria. Inside Mosul, women organized resistance against ISIS' oppressive rule. The women's rights activist Sameera Salih al-Nuaimy denounced ISIS atrocities on social media. She was arrested, tortured and executed by an ISIS firing squad . Women physicians in Mosul organized a strike when ISIS ordered them to cover their faces. At least one of the strikers was executed, as have been countless female lawyers, doctors and other professional women. A turning point in global attention to the threat posed by ISIS came in August, when a woman, a Yazidi legislator, took the floor in the Iraqi parliament, saying ISIS was committing genocide against Iraq's Yazidis. ""Mr. Speaker,"" cried out Vian Dakhil, the only Yazidi member of parliament, ""We are being slaughtered. We are being exterminated."" Since then, while the United States helped save thousands of Yazidis and started bombing ISIS without putting ""boots on the ground,"" countless women, mostly Kurdish, have laced up their boots and headed to the battlefield. The worst of ISIS treatment is reserved for ""infidels,"" or for those defying their orders. In areas under ISIS control, women are required to observe strict clothing rules and are not allowed to leave the house without a male relative. Violators can be whipped or even executed. It's worth remembering that many of the women facing these restrictions had been living modern lives. Just when it seemed ISIS could not be more offensive and threatening, it has provided everyone, especially, women even more reasons to fight back.","ISIS publication justifies reasons for enslavement of women in captured areas .

"Just days before the Nobel committee announces the winner of this year's Nobel Peace Prize, the world found out who stands at the opposite extreme on the quest for peace and justice. We have discovered who the biggest cowards on the planet are today. The competition for the mark of shame is hard fought, but the title goes to the men who approached a van carrying girls home from school in Pakistan on Tuesday and asked for one very special 14-year-old. Then shot her in the head. The world's worst cowards are the members of the Pakistani Taliban. Perhaps they believe their thick dark beards, dangerous weapons and fanatical religious pronouncement make them fierce warriors. But their actions tell the true story: The Pakistani Taliban are terrified of a 14-year-old girl named Malala Yousufzai. And why are they so afraid of Malala? Mostly, because she is not afraid of them. And because Malala is a relentless advocate of education for girls, something the Taliban find very threatening. The Taliban, with all their bravado, seem to fear women most of all. News: Pakistan enraged over attack on teen blogger . The cravenness that has come to define the group -- also known as the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP -- is easily matched by Malala's stunning bravery. The fearless activist for girls' education now lies in a hospital bed trying to recover from serious injuries to her head and neck. Overnight doctors performed emergency surgery to remove a bullet near her spinal cord and to relieve swelling in her brain. Malala knew she was on a TTP hit list, but she did not back down. The Taliban, whose religious, social and political views are founded on a brutally anti-woman ideology, cannot countenance even a young girl challenging their ideas on a blog. Shortly after Tuesday's assassination attempt, which also left two of Malala's school friends wounded, TTP spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan acknowledged the group tried to kill her and vowed they will try to do it again if she survives. As is common, he couched the threats in extreme interpretations of Islam and on repression and intimidation of women. ""Any female that, by any means, plays a role in the war against the mujahedeen,"" Ehsan declared, ""should be killed."" News: 'I Am Malala' -- a chorus of support across the world . The TTP spokesman called Malala's advocacy for education ""a new chapter of obscenity,"" adding, ""We have to finish this chapter."" He also accused her of being pro-West and admiring President Barack Obama. Malala started to become a problem for the TTP when she was just 11. The Pakistani Taliban, who hold the same ideology but are not directly affiliated with the Afghan Taliban, had taken over Pakistan's Swat Valley. Pakistani politicians were turning a blind eye to what had become an increasingly brutal regime. They executed their critics, ordered all men to grow beards and whipped women in public as punishment for real, imagined or fabricated offenses. It was all about imposing their will, their version of Islamic law, and subjugating the entire population, but women in particular. The Taliban reportedly had destroyed more than 200 schools and ordered all girls' schools shut down when Malala slowly emerged from obscurity. In 2009, she started writing a blog for the BBC under a pseudonym, talking about her dreams for the future and how the Taliban were pushing those aspirations further and further out of reach. Learn more about how you can help at CNN Impact Your World . Her story helped bring attention to the disaster befalling the population of the storied Swat Valley. At about the same time, the videotaped beating of a 17-year-old girl by a group of Taliban went viral in Pakistan, adding chilling images to a girl's lament. Until then, Pakistan had treated the fight against the Taliban as an American problem, something going on across the border in Afghanistan. Malala helped Pakistanis realize their own country, their own way of life were threatened by the TTP. The government fought back and regained control of the region. She continued to speak out and was the first recipient of her country's National Peace Award last year. She and her cause became celebrated throughout the country, and increasingly despised by extremists and their supporters. Rural areas of Pakistan and the districts near the Afghanistan border include deeply traditional regions from where the Taliban took much of their social views. Many practices, particularly regarding women, are horrifying to more modern Pakistanis living in places such as the capital, Islamabad. The country has become a dangerous incubator of fanatically enforced prejudice. A prominent politician who opposed Pakistan's controversial blasphemy laws was killed last year. Just last month a Christian girl was sent to prison after her neighbors concocted blasphemy charges against her. The country has become one of the front lines of the struggle between modernity and the deeply intolerant, misogynistic practices dating back centuries. Malala, despite her young age, stands at the battle line of the push for equality. iReport: Your views on girls' education . The rule of the Taliban in Afghanistan between 1996 and 2001 showed just how the outcome in Pakistan could affect everyone, but especially women's lives. The TTP aims to impose precisely the kind of rules the Taliban forced on Afghans. Afghan women were barred from working, studying, leaving their homes without a male companion. Even laughing out loud was prohibited. They became nonentities, stoned and beheaded at the local stadium, banned from showing their faces, speaking their voices or earning a living. In 2002, just after the regime was toppled, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study of mental health in the country found a vast majority of Afghan women suffering from depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. A decade later, in bordering Pakistan, in the aftermath of the assassination attempt against Malala, many question if the threat has receded to the extent the authorities claim. By trying to kill a bright and admired young girl in cold blood, the Taliban have revealed not only their own moral makeup. They have also reawakened the Pakistani people to the threat posed by extremists and the choices the country faces. Pakistanis are pressuring their populist politicians to speak out against the crime, to take sides. Pakistan is home to the world's worst cowards. But it's also Malalai's home. Let's hope she makes it, and inspires many to follow in her small but indelible footsteps. There's something -- and someone -- for the Nobel committee to consider.

"In the age of personalization, a Finnish company is bringing 3D technology to the world of bespoke men's footwear. Inside the London store of the Left Shoe Company -- just one of seven locations around the world -- a space-age platform sits among scaling shelves decked with beautifully made, traditional men's shoes. Next, customers are invited to sport a pair of bright yellow and green socks and stand on the Sci-Fi-like scanner as it produces a virtual 3D picture capturing the volume of their feet. After selecting the model and style from the store's catalogue, the shoes are made by traditional craftsmen in Portugal and delivered to the customer anywhere in the world in up to 6 weeks. Bespoke 3D innovation . What's more -- shoppers looking to purchase another pair of shoes can easily order them online thanks to their 3D foot-scan stored in the company's digital archives. ""It enables me to stay in contact with customers all over the world,"" says Christian Haugaard, director of the London store. ""They may have visited the store once in their entire lives, but they can shop with us forever."" The simplicity for the customer is also an added bonus, explains Hauggard: ""It allows you to shop online and know exactly what you're going to get, whereas if you go to other e-commerce sites you may have to buy two or three sizes and return two of them. It doesn't make a lot of economic sense."" The digital scan gives shoppers a custom fit made in seconds at virtually no cost allowing them to skip the made-to-wear tradition of having a wooden model made of their feet -- an expensive and time consuming process. In turn, the savings is passed on to the customer. The Left Shoe Company's footwear costs around $640, about half of what a traditional shoemaker might charge. Luxury embraces digital . By combining a tech-savvy business model with old-school artistan tradition, the Finnish company is making bespoke craftsmanship accessible to a customer that craves authenticity in the digital era. ""It's a sector that doesn't really embrace change and that includes technology and e-commerce,"" says Allegra Perry, a senior analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. But, she says, across the board, technology is becoming an increasingly big feature in the luxury goods sector. CEO Erkan Fere says that using technology to streamline a traditional business model has as many advantages for the business as it does for the customer. The benefit of made-to-measure footwear, he says, is that it involves minimum waste. ""We make the shoes one by one when an individual customer orders them. If we don't sell many of a certain style, it doesn't matter."" He's convinced that tradition with a tech twist will catch on: ""We have adopted this technology early, but I have no doubt that other companies will catch up quickly."" And the demand for bespoke is growing, says Paul Alger, head of the UK Fashion and Textile Council: ""For many years consumers have been rather passive about what they'll buy, but now there's a whole generation of new consumers that say 'I will buy less, but I will buy better.'"" There is still an important place for bespoke in this world of ready-to-wear, says Haugaard. ""We had a gentleman in the other day and he ordered one shoe in a size 9 and one in a size 7. Where else would you go? The only alternative is to buy two pairs of shoes."" A majority of the population, he points out, have different sized feet and, by bringing together high-technology and traditional craftsmanship, the Left Shoe Company is making high-end, made-to-measure shoes a more attainable dream.","Finnish shoemaker is combining tech and tradition to create bespoke footwear for clients .

"In May 2013, authorities in Myanmar's Rakhine state issued a directive placing a two-child limit on Rohingya couples in two predominately Muslim townships in the region -- in blatant disregard of the recommendations of a commission set up to investigate the recent violence between Muslims and Buddhists in western Myanmar. As political reforms slowly took hold in Myanmar following years under the rule of the military junta, longstanding tensions exploded into sectarian violence in Rakhine in 2012, instigated by Rakhine Buddhists against Rohingya Muslims. Hostility toward the Rohingya has deep roots, fueled by prejudicial and competing notions of the role of race and religion in Myanmar's national identity.  Successive regimes and Myanmar society at large perceive the Rohingya as a product of recent migration and Islamic expansion from overpopulated Bangladesh.  Antagonism towards Islam has lately spiraled into anti-Muslim strife in other parts of the country. During military rule, the Rohingya were subject to a gradual process of marginalization and exclusion through discriminatory policies and restrictions, particularly in Northern Rakhine State.  Denial of citizenship has legitimized arbitrary treatment against them and exacerbated hatred. The two-child policy emerged from this context and from local orders issued by the NaSaKa and other local authorities since the early 1990s. The NaSaKa, established as a border security force in December 1992, was tasked, among other things, with controlling Rohingya population growth.  Restrictions on movement and regular population checks were imposed to prevent imaginary infiltrations from Bangladesh, while regulating marriages and family size aimed at curbing birth rate from within. Q&A: What's behind violence? In January 1994, the NaSaKa introduced a local order requiring official permission to marry, contradicting customary marriage practice.  This order later included penalties for non-compliance.  In practice, marriage authorizations can take up to several years to obtain and are only granted against the payment of bribes.  Infringement such as cohabitation or sexual contact out of wedlock can result in up to 10 years' imprisonment.  Currently, 535 Rohingya men are serving sentences for unauthorized marriages in Buthidaung Jail, according to research by the Arakan Project. To avoid prosecution, many young women resort to induced and illegal abortion. Local orders limiting the number of children for newly married couples were first issued by township administrations in Maungdaw and Buthidaung in April 2005.  They imposed stringent conditions for applying for marriage permission and added that ""Those permitted to marry according to this Order should control the birth rate and limit the number of children for livelihood sufficiency.""  The number of children was not specified.  However, the limitation was enforced when newly-married couples were asked to sign a declaration.  Initially, the pledge was no more than three children, reduced to two children in 2007. Consequently, Rohingya women giving birth to a third child are unable to register the newborn and could be prosecuted under Section 188 of the Penal Code for disobeying orders from a civil servant, which carries a prison sentence of up to 6 months.  Most often, they become victims of never-ending extortion by local authorities. The Rakhine Investigation Commission estimated that 60,000 Rohingya children are currently unregistered, born out of unauthorized as well as authorized marriages.  Some parents are too poor to cover travel expenses and bribes for birth registration, or experience administrative hurdles.  An absent father precludes the mother from registering her baby, or the newborn is above the permissible number of births. Unregistered children are not recorded in the family list as they do not exist administratively.  They will not be issued with a temporary ID card and will thus be unable to attend school, to apply for travel permits or ultimately to marry. The Commission report cites high birth rates among Rohingya as a key factor of insecurity among Rakhine.  It recommends family planning education to mitigate these concerns but stresses that authorities should refrain from implementing forcible birth control measures. Lack of awareness but also poor access to family planning is prevalent, particularly in rural areas where reproductive health services are often unavailable.  Elsewhere, a growing number of Rohingya families have actually adopted birth spacing methods. This Rakhine State Government directive also violates Myanmar's international obligations under the Convention for the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. In a speech on May 6, President Thein Sein pledged that his government would ensure the basic rights of Muslims in Rakhine State, enforce the rule of law and ""provide genuine and decisive leadership in resolving the conflict.""  Leading pro-democracy activist and lawmaker Aung San Suu Kyi also condemned the two-child restriction on Rohingya couples as ""discrimination not in line with human rights."" Following international outrage, Ye Htut, the President's spokesperson, timidly responded that the government is re-examining this order. Thein Sein's words must urgently be translated into action and he should immediately repeal the two-child policy and other discriminatory orders against the Rohingya. If left unchallenged, more directives will be issued that could trigger renewed violence.

"The Moroccan government has urged African soccer's governing body to delay its flagship bi-annual continental competition over fears that it could help to spread Ebola. Morocco is slated to host the African Cup of Nations, organized by the Confederation of African Football [CAF],  in January next year. The 16 team competition has run since 1957 and the north African country has spent millions of dollars upgrading its stadiums for the event as well as December's FIFA Club World Cup. But the outbreak of ebola in west Africa, which has claimed at least 5,000 lives, has raised fears in Morocco that traveling fans and players could help to spread the disease further. Of the three countries affected, only Guinea is likely to qualify. The statement called any postponement ""from 2015 to 2016 ... a strictly health linked case of force majeure."" Morocco had already called on CAF to push back the tournament. But African football bosses had refused to change the dates and set Morocco a deadline to confirm its hosting of the tournament, which has passed. Officials from CAF will now meet on Tuesday to decide its next steps and decide who, if anyone, is prepared to host the tournament.

"FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke has apologized to Brazil's minister of sports for a ""misinterpretation in the translation"" of his comment saying the country needs a ""kick up the backside"" to be ready in time for the 2014 World Cup. Valcke's letter of apology to Aldo Rebelo came hours after the country had sent official notice to FIFA that it would no longer accept Valcke as liaison. ""We received with astonishment the inappropriate statements by Mr. Jerome Valcke in recent days to the international press. The form and content of statements escaped the patterns of harmonious coexistence between a sovereign country such as Brazil and an international organization, such as FIFA,"" wrote Rebelo. Valcke, in his letter Monday, explained that in French, ""se donner un coup de pied aux fesses"" means ""to pick up the pace."" Unfortunately, he wrote, the expression had been translated so that in Portuguese it used much ""stronger words."" The translation was a literal one. ""There is certainly an air of concern at FIFA, and as the person who is ultimately responsible for delivery of the FIFA World Cup, I am under quite some pressure,"" he said. Valcke and a large team of FIFA representatives are due to visit Brazil next week. FIFA President Sepp Blatter also sent his own apology. The Sports Ministry said in a news release that it had it received a letter from Blatter on Tuesday. According the ministry, Blatter said: ""My only comment in relation to this issue is to apologize to all of those whose honor and pride were injured, especially the Brazilian government and President Dilma Rousseff."" On Friday, Valcke had once again criticized Brazil's progress, saying the country is more worried about winning the World Cup that preparing for it. FIFA has repeatedly voiced its concern that stadiums and other infrastructure, such as airports, are not being built quickly enough. Among other issues, Brazilian lawmakers have balked at approving the sale of beer at games, which is illegal there. Valcke stressed that he has no doubt that the 2014 FIFA World Cup will be held in Brazil and that he holds great respect and admiration for the nation. According to Brazilian state run news agency Agencia Brasil, the Ministry of Sports will decide whether to accept the apology after reviewing Valcke's letter.","FIFA President Sepp Blatter also sent his own apology to Brazil .

"(CNN) -- As media outlets Monday circulated security-camera video of Ray Rice punching his then-fiancee in a hotel elevator, many wondered why the woman -- now his wife -- would remain with the fallen NFL star. The answers came in a rush, on Twitter. By Tuesday the social media platform was flooded with affecting stories from women explaining why they remained in abusive relationships and why they finally left. The outpouring was collected under two hashtags, #WhyIStayed and #WhyILeft. Writer and domestic abuse survivor Beverly Gooden said she started the campaign #WhyIStayed on Monday because she wanted to ""change the tone of the conversation."" Gooden said she married her husband after he hit her because she loved him -- and, she wanted to ""protect"" him. ""I was thinking about him and not myself, and I think that's the story of a lot of people out there,"" she said. ""The hashtag shows that there are people out there who have lived this, and like me, have come out of this."" By Tuesday afternoon, the hashtag had been used more than 46,000 times, according to Web analytics tool Topsy, captivating participants and observers alike. The tweets came in response to stark footage showing Rice knocking out Janay Palmer in February in an Atlantic City, New Jersey, hotel elevator. The video shows him knocking her to the floor and then dragging her unconscious body out of the elevator. Why I stayed: My domestic abuse story . The couple went forward with their plans to marry. Rice underwent pretrial diversion instead of facing criminal charges, and the NFL suspended him for two games -- a punishment criticized by many as too lenient. But the incident returned to the the spotlight Monday with the release of the elevator video. Amid the public outcry, people began asking questions about Janay Rice's motivations. Why didn't she leave? Why did she marry him? Why did she stay? Janay Rice posted a statement on Instagram on Tuesday defending her husband and criticizing the media and the public for making her family ""relive a moment in our lives that we regret everyday."" And on Twitter, the stories reflected many of the reasons domestic violence victims stay in abusive relationships. Eventually, people began sharing why they left, in an evolution that added dimension to the conversation, feminist and media critic Jill Filipovic said. Hashtag campaigns often focus on ""raising awareness"" without providing solutions or activist strategies, Filipovic said. When it comes to helping women in abusive relationships, we need to understand why they stay in the first place, ""instead of contributing to the stigma of staying by shaking our heads and asking why,"" she said. If a woman knows that her actions will be picked apart ""she has little incentive to rock the boat and make a change,"" Filipovic said. ""The power of this hashtag is that abuse survivors volunteered the answer to the 'why did she stay?' question so that, hopefully, friends and family members of other survivors won't have to ask they can just provide support."" The reasons women stay in abusive relationships are ""complex and varied,"" said Sandra Hawken Diaz of Interval House, a Toronto women's shelter. ""Too many people assume that if a woman is in an abusive relationship that she is making a choice to stay, and that she has the power to end the abuse if she just leaves,"" she said. ""We need to begin to understand, support and believe victims -- not blame them. ""Instead of asking why doesn't she just leave, we should be asking different questions when we read those headlines. We should be asking, 'Why is he abusive?' or 'How can we break the cycle of violence?' or 'How can I support her to be safe?'"" Fear is one reason partners stay, especially if children are involved, said Katie Ray-Jones, chief executive officer of the National Domestic Violence Hotline. Ray-Jones, who is not connected with the Rice incident, offered some general thoughts on what motivates victims of domestic violence when it comes to staying in the relationship or leaving. ""The fear a woman feels is real. The threats her partner makes are real. When a woman's husband tells her he will kill her if she leaves, she believes that. We all know it is possible, we see the stories on TV and the Internet,"" she said. In most domestic violence situations, the abusive partner blames the victim and the victim believes it, Ray-Jones said. ""Outside the home, this man appears to be a great man. Many woman describe it as Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde: 'Great guy to everyone else, so I must be the problem,'"" she said. Ray Rice's fame could have affected his wife's decision-making, Ray-Jones said. ""I can't imagine how Janay Rice may have felt. Fans were blaming her on social media, sportscasters made comments somehow indicating she must have provoked the violence, and then she has to sit next to her abuser and apologize,"" Ray-Jones said, referring to a press conference earlier this year. ""We would never ask a person who was mugged on the street to apologize for walking down the street where their assailant was."" Love and hope also can play into the dynamic, she said. The abusive partner is not abusive all the time, and the victim sees the person with whom she fell in love. ""Victims remember how it used to be and they see that person throughout the relationship. The abusive partner continues to tell them that they will change, that the abuse will not happen again,"" she said. ""Everyone deserves a relationship that is based on dignity and respect. We want victims to be able to reach out and talk to an advocate so they know they have choices.""","Video of NFL's Ray Rice punching future wife prompts questions about her behavior .

"(CNN) -- This week, as we mark the 13th anniversary of horrific attacks on our home soil, Americans should have no illusions about the terrorists who have repeatedly declared their intent to strike America again. We know the threat of the vicious terrorist organization known as ISIS has concerned the intelligence community for more than a year. And the group's atrocities have been well-documented since it began attacking northern Iraq, and it is deeply concerning that it has taken President Barack Obama so long to develop any kind of strategy to address these increasingly powerful terrorists who have now gruesomely killed two American journalists before the world stage. On Wednesday evening, the President will finally share with the American people his ""game plan,"" as he calls it, to combat ISIS. It is my hope that he will propose a clear plan, consistent with the Constitution, to keep Americans safe, and that it is not laden with impractical contingencies, such as resolving the Syrian civil war, reaching political reconciliation in Iraq or achieving ""consensus"" in the international community. Analysis: Obama speech a do-over on 'no strategy' comment . There are three specific steps that should be taken. First and foremost, Washington should resolve to make border security a top priority finally, rather than an afterthought, of this plan in light of concerns about potential ISIS activities on our southern border, cited in a Texas Department of Public Safety bulletin reported by Fox News. As long as our border isn't secure, the government is making it far too easy for terrorists to infiltrate our nation. Second, Congress should make fighting for or supporting ISIS an affirmative renunciation of American citizenship. Numerous Americans have joined ISIS along with hundreds of others from the European Union. We know that some of them are trying to return to their countries of origin to carry out terrorist attacks. How do we know that? It's already been attempted. On May 24, a suspected French jihadist with possible ISIS ties traveled to Belgium, where he is accused of attacking innocent visitors at the Jewish Museum of Belgium in Brussels and slaughtering four people -- and it was reported earlier this week that he allegedly had been plotting a larger attack on Paris on Bastille Day. In August, an accused ISIS sympathizer, Donald Ray Morgan, was arrested at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York trying to re-enter the United States. On Monday I filed the Expatriate Terrorist Act of 2014, which would amend the existing statute governing renunciation of U.S. citizenship to include fighting for a hostile foreign government or foreign terrorist organization as an affirmative renunciation of citizenship. By fighting for ISIS, U.S. citizens have expressed their desire to become citizens of the terrorist group, which calls itself the Islamic State. We should not permit them to return to America, with a U.S. passport, to carry out acts of terror at home. It is my hope that this legislation will attract bipartisan support, and will bring Washington together with one united voice in support of keeping Americans safe from ISIS acts of terror. Third, we should do everything possible to make ISIS understand there are serious ramifications for threatening to attack the United States and for killing American civilians. While damaging ISIS' financial assets is certainly a part of this action, because of the very nature of ISIS, the response must be principally military. We should concentrate on a coordinated and overwhelming air campaign to destroy the capability of ISIS to carry out terrorist attacks on the United States. Gingrich: 10 questions for Obama on ISIS . The President's previously stated goal -- to ""shrink"" ISIS' ""sphere of influence"" until it is a ""manageable problem"" -- is not encouraging. The objective should not be to make ISIS ""manageable""; the objective should be to protect the United States and to destroy the terrorists who have declared jihad on our nation. The White House's suggested ways of countering ISIS have, so far, been naive and ineffective. Now, faced with the growing threat of the group, Americans are being told Syria and Iran may suddenly be our friends, and ISIS is now our enemy. This is nonsense. The enemy of our enemy is not always our friend. Other possible objectives the White House is considering are equally worrisome. We must reject the notion that any U.S. action be contingent on political reconciliation between Sunnis and Shiites in Baghdad. The Sunnis and Shiites have been engaged in a sectarian civil war since 632. While we all wish the Iraqis success in their most recent attempt to form a government, it is the height of hubris and ignorance to make American national security contingent on the resolution of a 1,500-year-old religious conflict. Likewise, any action we take to stop ISIS should not be contingent on any consensus from the so-called international community. Obama to Congress: No vote needed on ISIS strategy . America is blessed to have good friends and allies who understand the threat of ISIS, and we welcome their support. Indeed, this is an opportunity to reverse the destructive policy of the last five years of reaching out and appeasing our enemies while giving our allies the cold shoulder. Instead, we should partner closely with our friends in the region who are already engaged in this fight, notably Israel, Jordan and the Kurds. This mission must be led by the United States if it is to be done right, and we cannot make the assembling of a coalition a higher priority than the execution of our mission. National security hawks call for airstrikes targeting ISIS leaders . And, leading that mission requires a clear articulation of the mission. Finally, the President appears to have ruled out making any formal authorization request from Congress to take military action. This is wrong. I ask the President to reconsider. Only Congress has the authority to declare war. While our commander in chief has constitutional authority to respond to an imminent danger, Obama has not suggested that is the case. He is reportedly planning a mission that could last as long as three years and may require a range of actions. Therefore, congressional authorization is required by the Constitution. Making this formal request would provide the President with an opportunity to present the American people with a clearly defined military objective, tethered to national security, to protect our nation and to unite everyone in the mission to eradicate ISIS.","Sen.

"They want all of us to cringe -- and they have succeeded. The Islamic radicals suddenly barreling across Iraq want to make sure people are horrified at their deeds. Leaders of the organization that calls itself ISIS, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, have launched a sophisticated propaganda campaign that turns the most basic principles of public relations on their head. No PR executive would advise a client to shout to the world details of his most gruesome acts and the extent of his cruelty, but that is precisely what ISIS is doing, and doing so very deliberately. The images of mass executions, of men digging their own graves before being shot in the back of the head, are splashed on the world's newspapers, television news and social media. And that's exactly what ISIS wants. It is an important strategic tool that's already paying off in the battlefield. But it also points to a weakness that brings into question the long-term viability of ISIS's territorial gains. There is no way to fully verify that the photographs and videos are real, but there is reason to believe they are. After ISIS bragged about committing a massacre, claiming it executed 1,700 Iraqi security personnel, the U.N.'s human right chief said the militants have conducted an ""apparently systematic series of cold-blooded executions (which) almost certainly amount to war crimes."" Multiple sources confirm that ISIS executed hundreds of Iraqis, including many who had surrendered. When ISIS posted chilling images of mass executions on a Jihadi website, an Iraqi military spokesman, Lt. Gen. Wassim al-Moussawi, reportedly verified their authenticity. By advertising its brutality, ISIS is frightening at least some of its enemies into surrender. The tactic has proved effective, but recent history shows the plan sows the seeds of its own defeat, ultimately creating more enemies and closing off any possibility that the population will embrace the group's rule. Combining a campaign strategy with battlefield advances is easy to see. A few weeks before ISIS launched its lightning attack on Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, it had already softened the ground with their gasp-inducing campaign. The objective was clear and the results were a rout, a disaster for the Iraqi government. A professionally-produced video, ""The Clanging of the Swords IV"" -- the fourth in a series -- opened with a map of the target region, including Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, the Palestinian territories and Israel. Then it went on to show ISIS gunmen executing Iraqi soldiers. Iraqi Shiite men with shovels digging their own graves, drivers at ISIS roadblocks pulled out of their cars and shot. When ISIS launched its offensive, demoralized and frightened Iraqi soldiers terrified of ISIS and feeling little loyalty to the government in Baghdad, shed their uniforms and fled. The media campaign helped capture Mosul, but the group was just getting started. One grisly tweet showed the head of a decapitated Iraqi officer and read, ""This is our ball. It is made of skin. #WorldCup."" It was another warning in the advance towards Baghdad. ISIS wants to establish a caliphate, an Islamic state governed by its extreme interpretation of Islamic law. The group has already conquered parts of Syria and is ruling there by its version of Sharia, but its territorial objectives are larger. The shocking images are also meant to trigger an explosion of sectarian hatred between Sunnis and Shiites so that ISIS can emerge from the fighting with an expanded Islamist state. The tactic, which ISIS has used in Syria and its predecessors used in Iraq, shows how difficult this battle will be for those aiming to stop the Islamists' advance. ISIS will observe no limits in killing civilians and terrorizing the population. But experience shows that ISIS extremism provokes popular revulsion, which engenders a blowback against the group. The organization had it start in Iraq, when its videotaped beheadings of hostages and its bombings of civilians in the streets proved too much even for Al Qaeda. Named ""Al Qaeda in Iraq"" then, under Jordan's Abu Mussab al Zarqawi, AQI was so brutal that Al Qaeda chief Ayman al Zawahri sent Zarqawi a remarkable letter urging him to ease up. ""The Muslim populace...will never find palatable the scenes of slaughtering the hostages."" Could he stop with the (justified) decapitations of Shiites, he asked. ""Is it something that can be put off until the force of the Mujahed movement in Iraq gets stronger?"" Resentment against AQI's viciousness spawned extremism among Shiite militias and stoked an Iraqi civil war. The Sunni side was dominated by AQI, and the Shiites formed death squads of their own. By late 2006, Sunni tribal leaders fed up with the killings started the Sunni Awakening, which ultimately partnered with the United States and largely defeated AQI. AQI, renamed the Islamic State of Iraq and later the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant -- ISIL), joined in the civil war in Syria. It tried to join other Islamist groups, even declaring it had merged with the Nusra front, Al Qaeda's proxy in Syria. But Nusra and al-Qaeda rejected the merger.  Eventually, the clash with Al Qaeda ended in a dramatic clash between ISIS and other Syrian opposition groups and a total break with Al Qaeda. Incredibly, al Qaeda, the perpetrator of 9/11 and countless other mass murders of civilians around the world, criticized ISIS for being too ruthless. The horrifying ISIS videos and photographs presage much more carnage ahead for Iraq. But they also signal that this twisted PR campaign will spawn a wave of popular resentment that will no doubt undermine and weaken the group's hold on the country.","Frida Ghitis: ISIS has launched a sophisticated PR campaign to scare Iraqis .

"The contractor responsible for providing security guards for the Olympic Games said Saturday it stands to lose up to $77 million after failing to recruit enough staff, less than two weeks before the event opens in London. G4S chief executive Nick Buckles said he was ""deeply disappointed"" the firm was unable to live up to its contract with the London 2012 organizing group, LOCOG. The company has come under heavy scrutiny this week after the government was forced to announce the deployment of 3,500 extra military personnel to cover the shortfall. London Olympics organizer defends security contractor . The deployment means that 17,000 troops will be on duty in the United Kingdom during the Games, compared with the 9,500 currently in Afghanistan. G4S had been expected to recruit a staff of about 10,400 as part of a total security force of 23,700 for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The contractor said this week that while 4,000 are already at work across 100 venues, more than 9,000 are still going through the training and vetting process. In a statement Saturday, the company said it had ""encountered significant difficulties in processing applicants in sufficient numbers through the necessary training, vetting and accreditation procedures.  As a result, we will be unable to deliver all of the necessary workforce numbers."" UK: 3,500 extra troops called in for Olympic security . That failure is likely to cost the firm between £35m and £50m ($54 million -$77 million), it said. G4S ""deeply regrets that, despite the relentless efforts of so many of its people, it is unlikely to deliver in full its obligations to LOCOG, to the government and to everyone with an interest in these Games."" The company will meet the cost of the additional military deployment, it said, and ""is also incurring other significant costs as it endeavours to meet the contract challenges."" It also expressed its gratitude to those military personnel who will be deployed on short notice to fill the gap. ""In partnership with the military and LOCOG, we are working flat out around the clock to resolve the situation.  We are determined that together we will deliver a successful and secure Games,"" Nick Buckles said, quoted in the statement. Britain is on a heightened state of alert ahead of the Games, which open on July 27. Home Secretary Theresa May said Thursday that ""there is no question of Olympic security being compromised."" But opposition lawmakers have described the situation as a ""shambles,"" saying it raises concerns over the government's grip on the preparations for the Olympics and Paralympics. LOCOG chairman Sebastian Coe said Friday he was ""extraordinarily impressed with"" private contractor G4S so far. Coe said he was happy with the security staff on site and that while G4S has ""challenges,"" it would get there. Olympic organizers have agreed to give 10,000 tickets to the armed forces to compensate for the short-notice deployment, the Ministry of Defence said. The questions over security staff come as Britain gears up to welcome many of the visiting teams' officials this weekend ahead of the athletes' arrival on Monday. One headache was removed for organizers with the reopening Friday of the main highway linking Heathrow airport with central London. The busy M4 motorway had been closed for a week for emergency repairs to a viaduct.

"Iraqi troops, security forces and tanks surged into Baghdad on Sunday as political turmoil deepened over who should lead the country. Military tanks were deployed to several neighborhoods in central Baghdad, two Iraqi police officials told CNN. The officials said there are also significantly more troops in Baghdad's Green Zone, the secure area where many government buildings, the military headquarters and the U.S. Embassy are located. The stepped-up troop presence comes as Iraqi forces battle Islamist militants in northern Iraq, and just after Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki accused Fuad Masum, Iraq's newly elected President, of violating the country's constitution by extending the deadline for Iraq's biggest political coalitions to nominate a candidate for prime minister. The precise reason for the growing number of troops in the Iraqi capital was unclear. But CNN military analyst retired Lt. Col. Rick Francona described it as an ""ominous"" development that signals the Iraqi Prime Minister doesn't want to hand over power. ""You've got Nuri al-Maliki refusing to step down. Now he's mobilized not just security troops loyal to him, but now he's mobilized army units to put tanks in the streets. Some of the bridges have been closed,"" Francona said. ""It looks like he's trying to lock down the city in some sort of confrontation with the President, so this does not portend well."" Retired Marine Gen. James Williams said the stepped up security could also be a response to advances by militants from ISIS, the Sunni Muslim extremist group that has now declared itself the Islamic State. ""It could be a show of force. If you're talking about protecting government buildings, there may be a sense that ISIS forces may be closer than everybody thinks at this point, and so  depending on what the undercurrent in Baghdad right now, that could be a great sign for concern,"" Williams said. ""But it may also be a concern that there's a coup afoot."" CNN's Michael Holmes said al-Maliki could be digging in his heels for a political battle. ""It's not in his DNA to go without a fight. This is a man who's really feeling besieged at the moment. He's cornered on all sides, if you like,"" Holmes said. ""He's got ISIS on his doorstep, in a military sense. He even had the Grand Ayatollah the other day saying politicians should not cling to their posts. But this is a guy who seizes onto power. He holds it."" In a televised speech Sunday, al-Maliki said he would file a complaint against Masum for allegedly violating Iraq's constitution. Lawmakers elected Masum, a veteran Kurdish politician who's been a member of the Iraqi parliament since 2005, to the presidency last month. Choosing a prime minister is a key next step for Iraq's leaders. Critics of al-Maliki have called for him to pull his name out of the running, but he's repeatedly refused. Al-Maliki and his Shiite-dominated government have been under enormous international pressure to be more inclusive of the country's minority Sunni population, who say they have been marginalized and cut out of the political process. Obama administration officials have talked repeatedly about how their priority is a political settlement that creates a more inclusive government in Iraq. A deadline to agree on a new prime minister had been set for last week and was extended on Sunday. In a statement Sunday, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the United States is closely monitoring the situation and supports Iraq's President. ""The United States fully supports President Fuad Masum in his role as guarantor of the Iraqi constitution,"" she said. ""We reaffirm our support for a process to select a Prime Minister who can represent the aspirations of the Iraqi people by building a national consensus and governing in an inclusive manner. We reject any effort to achieve outcomes through coercion or manipulation of the constitutional or judicial process."" U.S. officials who put their faith in al-Maliki for years may have misjudged him, Francona said. ""Most people thought that there would be this peaceful transition to the new government. He served for two terms,"" Francona said. ""Now he's refusing to step down. ... This looks very bad, like he's going to refuse to go.""

"A key U.S. senator said Monday he has high hopes for a positive resolution soon to the growing diplomatic crisis revolving around 19 American overseas aid workers facing charges as part of an Egyptian crackdown on nongovernmental organizations. ""Quite frankly, I'm very optimistic we're going to get this episode behind us,"" GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told CNN. ""It's my hope (this will happen) sooner rather than later."" Graham spoke from Cairo after meeting with top Egyptian military and political leaders. He's joined on the trip by Arizona Sen. John McCain, chairman of the board of the International Republican Institute, one of the organizations affected by the Egyptian crackdown. McCain said he had an ""excellent conversation"" with several accused American workers now receiving shelter and protection at the U.S. Embassy.  But there is naturally a ""certain amount of concern,"" he added.  He stressed that he's not personally negotiating the workers' release, instead leaving those discussions to diplomats in the Obama administration. The Americans are among 43 people accused in a case involving foreign funding. They are scheduled to appear in a criminal court next Sunday, a spokesman for the Egyptian general prosecutor's office said. Among the Americans is Sam LaHood, director of Egypt operations for the International Republican Institute and the son of U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. Sam LaHood is doing ""fine,"" but ""he's grown a full beard and he's not nearly as good looking as he used to be,"" McCain joked after meeting with the American workers. In December, authorities carried out 17 raids on the offices of 10 organizations, including the U.S.-based Freedom House, National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute. The latter group describes itself on its website as a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that ""advances freedom and democracy worldwide by developing political parties, civic institutions, open elections, democratic governance and the rule of law."" Freedom House's website says it ""supports democratic change, monitors freedom and advocates for democracy and human rights around the world,"" supporting nonviolent civic initiatives in societies where freedom is threatened.  The National Democratic Institute says it works to support and strengthen democratic institutions worldwide ""through citizen participation, openness and accountability in government."" Adel Saeed, a spokesman with the Egyptian general prosecutor's office, said the raids were part of an investigation into allegations that the groups had received illegal foreign financing and were operating without a proper license. The groups have denied any wrongdoing. The International Republican Institute has said the prosecution is a ""politically motivated assault"" that ""reflects escalating attacks against international and Egyptian democracy organizations."" While Egypt may call the situation ""a legitimate judicial process ... the continued assault on American, German and Egyptian civil society is not a 'legitimate judicial process,' "" the group said. ""We're being accused of things we've never done,"" institute President Lorne Craner said last month. ""We are told we have operated without registration, and that is true because we filed our registration papers 5½ years ago.  We were told the papers are complete, and we're still waiting."" Similarly, the National Democratic Institute said it applied for registration in 2005 through the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ""and has fulfilled all of the registration requirements for the past six years, including a number of updates provided in January."" The group said it will ""vigorously defend the accused personnel."" ""Despite promises made by Egyptian authorities to the highest levels of the U.S. government, we remain closed, our computers, files and cash still in the possession of the Ministry of Justice, and our staffs face hostile interrogations by investigating judges, and now the prospect of arrest and imprisonment,"" Freedom House President David Kramer testified last week before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. ""Nowhere else in the world has any of our offices been treated as they are in Egypt,"" Kramer said. The U.S. State Department said last week it had received a 24-page document from Egyptian authorities that lays out the specific charges against the staff of U.S. and international democracy-building groups. The employees of the American and European NGOs have been charged with operating in Egypt without licenses.  An investigation by authorities revealed that the organizations received millions of pounds from abroad under the names of NGO employees and not through their official bank accounts. Ashraf El-Ashmawi and Sameh Abu Zeid, the two judges handling the cases, said the charges could lead to five-year prison sentences. ""These organizations conducted unlicensed and illegal activities without the knowledge of the Egyptian government,"" said El-Ashmawi.  ""Documents confiscated during the raids on the NGOs offices confirm illegal foreign funding."" Documents also showed that foreign workers employed by the NGOs deliberately had tourist -- not work -- visas and did not pay taxes, prosecutors said. Egyptian officials have blamed continuing unrest in their country on foreign interference they attribute, in part, to the organizations. The crisis has jeopardized U.S. aid to Egypt and strained relations between the two nations. In a February 2 letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, 41 members of Congress urged the Obama administration to withhold further aid to Egypt until the country's leadership lets the organizations reopen and returns seized property. The situation may have been fueled by a sense of nationalism on the part of Egypt's military-led government, which assumed control following the ouster of longtime President Hosni Mubarak a year ago, said Isobel Coleman, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""It's better in the short term to be seen as standing up to the Americans,"" she said this month. ""... As the situation continues to be very unsettled in Egypt, the powers that be will look for a scapegoat. Blame your problems on outside powers. That's how it has been throughout history."" But both sides have ""painted themselves into a corner,"" said Marina Ottaway, a senior associate at the Middle East program of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The Egyptians have made a legal case, she said, and the Americans will find it difficult to tell them to interfere with the work of the judiciary when they are trying to push democracy. Briefing reporters Friday, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the agency's legal team has held a number of meetings on the situation. ""We continue to work very hard on these issues. So we need to let that work go forward and hope we can solve this,"" she said. Nuland has said no speedy resolution of the case was expected.","Sen. Lindsey Graham says he is ""very optimistic"" a resolution to the crisis is near .

"Brazil is hoping to make the 2014 World Cup ""one of the most protected sports events in history,"" the government said on Wednesday as it announced a $900 million investment in its security forces. It plans to have one police officer for every 50 people attending the soccer matches, and one for every 80 people at public viewing events around the country. ""The government has made a program to compile the measures needed for everyone's security. This is an item that we face with much importance,"" said sports minister Aldo Rebelo. World football's ruling body FIFA has expressed concerns about Brazil's increasing crime rate, particularly in Sao Paulo, as well as worries that the South American nation's infrastructure is behind schedule. ""We are seeing a big wave of crime in Sao Paulo, which is not good for its image or tourism,"" FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke said last month. Brazil's 'sugar seats' solution . Rebelo said the issues are being addressed. ""The Sao Paulo government adopted measures and responses for security together with the federal government, who offered help. The actions are being adopted together for the World Cup,"" he said. Valcke made few friends in Brazil earlier this year when he criticized the lack of progress being made in providing sufficient hotels and transport facilities, and was forced to apologize. He said last month that the problems remain, but acknowledged that steps are being taken. ""In one unnamed city there are 17,000 hotel bedrooms and a 45,000 capacity stadium,"" said Valcke, suggesting that tourists may struggle to find accommodation. ""But we have now moved from talking about the problems to talking about the solutions."" Brazil gang's slaughter of police sparks fightback . The Brazil World Cup bid team has increased its security budget as the country prepares to host the tournament for the first time since 1950, as well as next year's precursor Confederations Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics. It is investing in hi-tech vehicles, helicopters and surveillance equipment, with the $900 million to be spent coming from a wider $15 billion budget for infrastructure. ""Security has become an ever-increasing issue for major sporting events in the past decade,"" the World Cup organizers said in a statement. ""This has increased the level of information exchange between countries that have recently hosted events to ensure public safety."" The last World Cup was held in South Africa, another country with crime problems. Its government said it invested 640 million rand ($70 million) to deploy 31,000 police officials during the tournament. It set aside a total budget of R1.3 billion ($150 million) for security, and said after the 2010 event it had spent R572 million ($65 million) on crowd control equipment, crime scene trainers, helicopters, water cannons, new body armor and 100 BMWs for highway patrol. More recently, the British government budgeted £553 million ($890 million) on security for the London 2012 Olympics, plus £475 million ($760 million) for army, security services and police spending. It caused outrage with plans to put anti-terrorist rocket launchers on the roofs of civilian homes. London 2012 organizers were forced to bring in armed forces after the Games' private security contractor, G4S, was unable to fulfill its obligations as it did not recruit sufficient workers. Brazil has been taking advice from Canada, which hosted the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. ""That's how it should be done, as we did: learn from those who were in charge of security for other events before us,"" Royal Canadian Mounted Police superintendent Kevin Bruyckere said.

"Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Thursday the United States would be willing to negotiate with the leader of Afghanistan's Taliban if he met conditions that have been laid out. Testifying at a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Clinton did not dismiss the prospect when asked by Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, whether reconciliation talks with the Taliban and other insurgents would include talking with Taliban leader Mullah Omar. ""You don't make peace with your friends,"" she said, speaking days after concluding a weeklong trip that included stops in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. There first would have to be a demonstrated willingness on the Taliban's part to negotiate and to meet the conditions already laid out for joining negotiations, she said. ""We have been clear,"" she had told the committee earlier, ""about the necessary outcomes of any negotiation: Insurgents must renounce violence, abandon al Qaeda, and abide by the constitution of Afghanistan, including its protections for women and minorities.  If insurgents cannot meet those red-lines, they will face continued and unrelenting assault."" But she said it is important for an inclusive Afghan-led peace and reconciliation process, in which the parties talk to former insurgents who are ready to renounce violence. Pressed during questioning about what makes her certain that insurgents will change course and renounce an extremist ideology, Clinton said she is ""very realistic,"" and recognizes not all of them will. Some 2,500 fighters have already begun the process of reintegrating and have expressed weariness with the Taliban, she said.  In that vein, she said, there have been recent threads of intelligence showing a debate in these societies on issues such as letting girls go to school that she finds promising. Talks have not yet reached the stage where it is known how many insurgents harbor a desire to reintegrate, she said. Clinton last week disclosed a meeting this past summer between the United States and a representative of the Pakistan-based Haqqani insurgent network at the request of Pakistan's intelligence service.  She said such meetings are part of a strategy in which ""we want to fight, talk and build all at the same time."" ""Part of the reason for that is to test whether these organizations have any willingness to negotiate in good faith,"" she said. ""There's evidence going both ways, to be clear. Sometimes we hear that they will, that there are elements within each that wish to pursue that. And then other times that it's off the table.  So I think that with respect to the Haqqani network, it illustrates this point."" In her opening remarks, Clinton said that while ""serious challenges"" remain, work in both Afghanistan and Pakistan has ""yielded significant results,"" noting that the success of the U.S. presence in the region sometimes gets lost in the public debate. ""Osama bin Laden and many of his top lieutenants are dead,"" she said. While ""the threat remains real and urgent, especially from al Qaeda's affiliates,"" al Qaeda's ability to conduct operations has been greatly diminished through cooperation on and off the battlefield, she added. ""Many of our successes against al Qaeda would not have been possible without close cooperation between the United States and Pakistan,"" she said. In Afghanistan, where security forces still have a long way to go before they can take on added responsibility, and where extreme poverty and corruption remain key challenges going forward, Clinton noted that there are 7 million more children in school a decade after the United States went to war in the country.  Nearly 40% of Afghan girls are in school today, she said, a sharp reversal from when the Taliban ruled the country and prohibited girls from attending school. ""Working with our Afghan and Pakistani partners is not always easy, but these relationships are advancing America's national security interests,"" Clinton said. ""And walking away would undermine those interests."" The secretary of state expanded on the  ""fight, talk, build"" strategy that she unveiled on her trip. As coalition and Afghan forces have increased pressure on the Taliban and Haqqani network operations inside Afghanistan, Clinton said, commanders remain concerned about the ability of these groups to launch attacks on coalition forces from safe havens in Pakistan.  In meeting with their counterparts in Pakistan last week, Clinton, CIA Director David Petraeus and the Joint Chiefs chairman, Gen. Martin Dempsey, urged Pakistan to help squeeze the Haqqani network on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistan border. ""We're not suggesting that Pakistan sacrifice its own security.  Quite the opposite,"" Clinton told the House committee, noting the sacrifices the Pakistan military has made in the fight. Pakistan has a huge stake in getting Taliban and other insurgents to the negotiating table as well, Clinton said, and called on the Pakistanis to do so through public statements and closing off the safe havens inside Pakistan. ""For our part, the United States is working with the Afghan government to conclude a new strategic partnership that will provide a framework for cooperation long after the transition is concluded in 2014,"" she said.  ""It will send a strong signal about our enduring commitment to the people of Afghanistan and the future of the region."" The military battle against the Haqqani network continues, Clinton said, with a major military operation in Afghanistan launched last week that captured or killed more than a hundred Haqqani operatives.  As the United States steps up its own efforts to pressure the Haqqani network both financially and operationally, Pakistan plays a critical role in ratcheting up pressure on militants operating on its soil, she said. ""We're already working with the Pakistanis to target those who are behind a lot of the attacks against Afghans and Americans,"" Clinton said.  ""And I made it very clear to the Pakistanis that the attack on our embassy was an outrage and the attack on our foreign operating base that injured 77 of our soldiers was a similar outrage. And it was in both instances terrible, but the fact is we avoided having dozens and dozens of wounded or killed."" Lt. Gen. Curtis Scaparotti,the deputy commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, told reporters at the Pentagon on Thursday that Pakistani officials have told him ""they simply don't have the capacity to take on"" the Haqqani network. But more worrying, he said, may be ""indications"" seen by coalition forces that Haqqani attacks have originated from locations ""in close proximity to some Pakistani outposts."" ""I think the collaboration is, at least in some cases, local collaborations with the insurgents, and we talk very bluntly with our Pakistan counterparts about this,""  Scaparotti said. Regarding Afghanistan, Clinton addressed questions about the reliability of Afghan President Hamid Karzai following comments last week in which Karzai said he would side with Pakistan if a war between it and the United States ever broke out.  She said she asked U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker to decipher the meaning behind Karzai's remarks.  Those comments, Crocker told her, were ""taken out of context and misunderstood,"" and harkened back to the long history of cooperation between Pakistan and Afghanistan going back to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Clinton said she had had a ""productive meeting"" with Karzai last week in Kabul, one that continued to build on cooperation on fighting insurgents while closely monitoring the success of the Afghan-led reconciliation efforts with insurgents. As Afghanistan and Pakistan both move to address change in their society, Clinton said religious minority populations must be protected along with women, and racial minorities. ""This is one of our biggest problems in the world right now,"" she said. ""There needs to be a greater acceptance of religious tolerance and in so many places there is  no history of religious tolerance."" Clinton told the committee it is important to build capacity for sustained economic growth and development in Afghanistan, Pakistan and the rest of the region as a means to building lasting stability and security. ""People need a realistic hope for a better life, a job and a chance to provide for their family,"" she said.  ""So it is critical to our broader effort that civilian assistance continues in both Afghanistan and Pakistan."" As the administration works to strengthen oversight and effectiveness of its programs in the region, Clinton told the committee she will be sending a comprehensive status update on civilian assistance to Afghanistan and Pakistan next week that would detail plans for both short-term stabilization and long-term development programs. As coalition forces draw down their numbers ahead of a planned pullout in 2014, Clinton said, it is important for the United States and its partners to support an Afghan-led economic strategy that will improve agricultural productivity, develop natural resources, increase exports, and strengthen the country's financial sector. She also noted the importance of promoting trade between Afghanistan, Pakistan and its neighbors through the building of new infrastructure and other ways to move goods that will create new jobs across the region. As the United States gradually reduces its military footprint in Afghanistan over the next few years, Clinton told the members of Congress, Washington must still remain engaged in the region.  ""America paid a heavy price for disengaging after the Soviets left in 1989,"" she said.  ""We cannot afford to make that mistake again.  We have to be smart and strategic.  And we have to work together to protect our interests.""","A U.S. general notes concerns about Haqqani attacks launched near Pakistani outposts .

"(CNN) -- By now it should be painfully obvious that this latest round of the Israeli-Palestinian crisis in Gaza is fundamentally different than its predecessors. Unlike the two previous rounds in 2008-09 and in 2012, which ended after three weeks and one week, respectively, this round, now in its fourth week, is infinitely more complex. The rapid failure of the cease-fire put in place by Thursday's agreement only emphasizes that fact. Getting to de-escalation, let alone a durable endgame, will be hard. And here are the five reasons why: . 1. Hamas, the political/military paradox: One of the reasons the conflict has dragged on for so long is Hamas' anomalous situation. It entered the crisis -- indeed may have helped to trigger it -- because it was weak, financially bankrupt and politically isolated, and thought it could get Israel and the world's attention through violence. This political weakness has now raised the stakes. Hamas can't stand down without major deliverables that will justify to its supporters and residents of Gaza the death and destruction its rockets have courted. And right now as attacks against Israeli forces attest, the military wing is dominant. Indeed, militarily it has the power to continue the fight. So there's no real urgency to back off without big gains. Political desperation, combined with military resilience, ensures the conflict will go on. Indeed, Hamas' goal is probably to launch more rockets against Israel the day before the cease-fire is concluded than on the first day the conflict began. 2. Iron Dome buys space and time: Perhaps the most stunning success of this crisis on the Israeli side has been the Iron Dome missile defense system's capacity to neutralize the threat of Hamas' high trajectory weapons. With only three civilian casualties, economic damage that is relatively limited and not that dramatic a change in the routine of most Israelis (at least those who don't live close to Gaza) the anti-missile defense system has reshaped the basic contours of the conflict. On one hand, Iron Dome has pre-empted or at least delayed the need for a large-scale ground incursion into Gaza. But on the other it has given Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the political elites and the public the latitude to continue to achieve Israel's objectives. In short, for Israel, too, there's no real urgency to stand down. With the home front secure, the government needs to worry about two things: Israel Defense Forces casualties (so far apparently tolerable at more than 60 even though that's four times the number in both previous confrontations) and international pressure as a result of the horrific Palestinian civilian death toll in Gaza. And both of these could become magnified in the event Israel decides to launch a massive ground incursion into Gaza. 3. No good mediator: In 2008-09, Israel withdrew its forces and unilaterally declared a cease-fire that held more or less; in 2012, the Egyptians brokered one pretty quickly to end that round. This time around you have plenty of would-be mediators, including the United States, the United Nations and Egypt, all of which were involved in the Thursday agreement. But that agreement reflects the reality that none of these mediators had much influence with Hamas' military wing. Moreover, all of them misjudged the degree to which Hamas on the ground in Gaza was prepared to end the fight. There is not a single mediator among them that's trusted by both sides. Egypt -- no longer run by the pro-Hamas Mohamed Morsy -- is bent on squeezing the Islamists and is working closely with Israel. And the United States has no ties or influence with Hamas. And we don't even have a situation where one mediator can work on Israel and party X could mediate with Hamas in a kind of diplomatic tag team. Indeed, the flaws of trying to negotiate a cease-fire by committee were all too apparent in the collapse of the Thursday accord. 4. Expectations, the real problem: Unlike the two previous confrontations or even the second intifada where Israel and Hamas squared off, this crisis is driven by expectations on each side that will be hard, if not impossible, to meet. Even if the two sides wanted to stand down, they have raised the hopes among their respective publics that can only constrain each of them and prove disappointing to Israelis and Palestinians as well. Netanyahu wants to avoid a massive ground incursion, yet he's identified an endgame -- demilitarization of Hamas -- that would require the forceful disarming of an organization that isn't going to agree to give up its weapons voluntarily. And the Israeli public, which has backed the current strategy of trying to pummel Hamas into submission, expects an outcome that is more decisive than in previous rounds. Hamas, on the other hand, seems -- in a cosmic roll of the dice -- to be holding out at all costs and somehow banking that if it does so, Israel will be forced to agree to open up Gaza (or will do so willingly), release Hamas prisoners and expand fishing rights and that Egypt will agree to open up the Rafah crossing. The more death and destruction in Gaza, the more Hamas needs an explanation at the end of the day to justify the sacrifices and the pain of Gaza's 1.8 million residents. And it's not even clear what the objectives of Hamas' military wing really are. The real tragedy is that the odds against any lasting trade-off of demilitarization for economic freedom seem long indeed without some dramatic change in either Israel's or Hamas' calculations or Hamas' total collapse and defeat. 5. Not enough urgency: It's an inconvenient fact, but the reality is that right now, there doesn't seem to be enough urgency, let alone an imperative for Israel or Hamas to back down. Gaza's public doesn't have much say in the matter when it comes to the Hamas military wing's strategy, and the Israeli public, according to opinion polls, seems enthusiastic about keeping up the pressure. Israel's calculations seem to be to neutralize the tunnel threat and pummel Gaza with air and artillery until Hamas agrees to a cease-fire on Israel's terms. Hamas wants to survive with its military and political leadership intact, and it hopes that massive Palestinian casualties will galvanize the international community to press Israel to stop and that more IDF deaths will cause Israel to sour on the operation. So where is this headed? In both previous confrontations, we might have confidently predicted some diplomatic endgame. Not now. For the moment, the focus has shifted from a brief foray into diplomacy back to escalating conflict. The prospects of some kind of an expanded Israeli operation into Gaza are highly likely, with all the casualties that could entail. What separates this round of the Israel-Hamas battle from the others is that there's no predictable path away from much more bloodshed. And that -- given the tragic loss of life -- is the terrifying truth. Note: This article was updated to delete references to the capture of an IDF soldier; Israeli authorities now say the soldier was among those killed by a suicide bomber.","Cease-fire fails in Gaza after less than two hours .

"Libya on Tuesday set a date for parliamentary elections in a move intended to stave off the possibility of civil war, even as the U.S. military remained poised to evacuate Americans amid escalating violence. Libya announced elections will take place June 25 in a bid that some observers hope may help defuse rising tensions, the state news agency LANA reported. The latest developments come as increasing military might appears to be rallying behind a renegade local general who is taking the fight to Islamist militias. The country's burgeoning political process has been mired in near paralysis amid divisions between Libya's political forces. Hostilities have increased since Gen. Khalifa Haftar bombed the bases of Islamist groups on Friday, including the one blamed for the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi on September 11, 2012, that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. The retired officer, who fought to overthrow former dictator Moammar Gadhafi, launched a land and air offensive in Benghazi against Ansar al-Sharia and Islamist militias loyal to the interim national government. He has vowed to not stop until the extremists groups are ""purged."" The resulting battle claimed 75 lives. Parliament itself is polarized, with Islamists on one side and their opponents on the other.  Fighting has paralyzed the government, hindered elections and cost the interim administration its legitimacy in the eyes of many Libyans. As of Tuesday, only 1.3 million Libyans out of an estimated 3.4 million eligible voters had registered to vote in the elections, according to the website for Libya's Higher National Elections Commission. During the country's last election in February, only 14% of eligible voters participated. Boycotts and violence in some cities affected that vote. U.S. prepares evacuations . The U.S. military is preparing to evacuate American citizens out of harm's way. As violence spread on Sunday and Monday, the U.S. military doubled the number of aircraft standing by in Italy if needed to evacuate the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli. Four additional U.S. V-22 Osprey aircraft at the naval base in Sigonella were to join the four V-22s and 200 Marines that had been moved there last week, a U.S. defense source said. Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said at a briefing Tuesday that about 250 Marines plus seven Ospreys and three C-130 planes were in place as ""a precaution, a  prudent measure."" He said that no decision had been made to close the embassy but that one of the lessons of the Benghazi incident was the ""need to be more agile."" The planes can be in the air on six hours' notice. With the additional aircraft, the military should be able to evacuate more than 200 people from the embassy. Gathering pressure on Islamists . Haftar has vowed to rid Benghazi and the rest of Libya of Islamist militants with his self-declared Libyan National Army. Other members of the army and militiamen were quick to declare allegiance to the newly conceived army. And on Sunday, fighters armed with heavy weapons stormed the General National Congress, forcing it to adjourn and putting lawmakers on the run in Tripoli. Later that evening, a commander appeared on television to declare that Parliament would be suspended. He claimed to represent Haftar's Libyan National Army. It's unclear whether there was any coordination of the attacks in Tripoli and Benghazi by forces claiming loyalty to the Libyan National Army. But their common enemy is clear: Libya's Islamists. Islamist pushback . The Parliament's attackers met with swift opposition when congress speaker Nuri Abu Sahmain, who is backed by Islamist militias, ordered troops of the Central Libya Shield Forces to deploy to the capital Monday. But the local council in the city of Misrata, east of Tripoli, and the city's Central Libya Shield Forces released statements on Tuesday evening indicating that they were not taking sides in the crisis. In the statement, the Misrata council said that it stood by the Libyan people against ""terrorism and fundamentalism"" but that it would not accept a ""military dictatorship."" The council said it was ready for ""national dialogue"" to lift the country ""out of this dark tunnel."" One of the Islamists' main rivals, the al-Qaaqaa Brigade, said it was involved in the attack on Parliament. The militia is based out of the city of Zintan but active in Tripoli and linked to elements in government. Gunfire from armed skirmishes spread through town Sunday and crackled through its outskirts into Monday night. At least four people died and 90 sustained injuries in the fighting, the Health Ministry said. Turmoil in Libya: Fighting sweeps across Tripoli following violence in Benghazi . Rallying point . The interim government immediately condemned Haftar's assault on Friday and his vendetta, but his movement has gained clout with Libyan special forces battling Islamist militias. On Monday, a well-respected military commander in the east came out in support of Haftar's Operation Dignity, the name for the anti-Islamist campaign. Col. Wanis Bukhamada of the al-Saeqa special forces placed the soldiers and officers under his command behind the Libyan National Army offensive. He vowed to join the fight against ""criminal Takfiri gangs that are toying with the country's security ... carrying out kidnappings, assassinations, killings, beheadings and burning the bodies of members of the police and army and civilians."" Ansar al-Sharia was already a thorn in Buhkamada's side, as he has fought the Islamists in recent months. Militia loyalties became fractured after Gadhafi's fall. During the revolution, Libya became awash in weapons, and militias formed with sundry affiliations with tribes, towns or religious extremism.

"All-conquering Spain marched on at the Confederations Cup Sunday with a 3-0 win over Nigeria to top Group B. Two goals from Jordi Alba and a further strike from substitute Fernando Torres made it a comfortable night in Fortaleza for the World and European champions. Copa America winners Uruguay also confirmed their passage to the semifinals with a 8-0 rout of Pacific Islanders Tahiti in Recife, but both sides had a man sent off. Uruguay will now face hosts Brazil in Belo Horizonte Wednesday in a potentially explosive all South American semifinal. Spain take on fellow European powerhouses Italy in Fortaleza the following night. Their third victory in a row was almost guaranteed from the moment left back Alba opened their scoring in the third minute with a superb solo effort. African champions Nigeria briefly rallied, but Spain took total command in midfield and might have added further to the scoreline before the break. Chelsea's Torres eventually emerged from the bench to score with a brilliant diving header from Pedro's cross just past the hour mark. It was his fifth goal in the tournament. Alba rounded off the proceedings with another fine lone effort, sprinting clear from halfway to beat the Nigeria offside trap. Abel Hernandez was in the goals for Uruguay, who merely needed to beat Tahiti to progress. His 79-second strike was the fastest in Confederations Cup history. The Palermo striker headed home Nicolas Lodeiro's corner and went on to grap three more goals. Diego Perez, Lodeiro and substitute Luis Suarez with a late double were also on target. The red cards came in the second half, the first to Andres Scotti for a second yellow after he had seen his penalty saved by Gilbert Meriel. Tahiti were also reduced to 10 men when Teheivarii Wagemann picked up a second yellow. The defeat marked the end of their fairytale inclusion in a top level FIFA tournament, losing to Nigeria, Spain and now Uruguay and conceding 24 goals to just one scored. But they have proved ever popular underdogs and provided a rare lighter note in a tournament marked by mass demonstrations outside stadiums by Brazilians protesting against poor public services and corruption.","World champions Spain beat Nigeria 3-0 .

"Former U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati has been convicted in Iran by a secret court of ""practical collaboration with the U.S. government"" and sentenced to 10 years in prison, his sister told CNN on Friday. The news follows a public campaign by Hekmati's family to win his release from Iran, where he has been held for nearly three years under Iran's claim that he was an American spy. Hekmati's attorney, Mahmoud Alizadeh Tabatabaei, told The New York Times on Friday that client had never been informed about the retrial, conviction or sentence. Tabatabaei told the newspaper he learned of the conviction during recent discussions with judiciary officials. He then telephoned to inform Hekmati, who has been held in Tehran's Evin prison, and with family members on the United States. Hekmati, 30, has long maintained his innocence, saying he had gone to Iran to visit his grandmother when he was arrested in August 2011, and accused by Iran's Intelligence Ministry of working as a CIA agent. Days before his arrest, Hekmati called his mother from Iran to say he would be coming home soon. He told them he would leave two days after a final farewell party his Iranian relatives were having on August 29. Hekmati never showed up at the party. Televised confession . For three months, no one in his family knew anything his whereabouts. Then one day in December 2011, Iranian state television aired Hekmati's purported confession that he was a CIA spy, and announced that he was imprisoned. Hekmati wrote a letter to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry saying a confession he made to the spying charges leveled by Iran were ""false"" and ""based solely on confessions obtained by force, threats, miserable prison conditions, and prolonged periods of solitary confinement."" The initial charge and detention has stretched to a two-year ordeal. Weeks after his on-air confession broadcast on Iranian television, Hekmati was tried in an Iranian court and sentenced to death. Months later, Iran's Supreme Court overturned his death sentence and ordered a retrial. During his imprisonment, Hekmati spent 16 months in solitary confinement and went on a month-long hunger strike. Enlisted in the Marines . Hekmati was born in Arizona and raised in Flint, Michigan, after his parents emigrated from Iran. His parents came to the United States in 1979 as the Islamic revolution spread across Iran. Hekmati joined the Marines after high school, and served four years, becoming a rifleman and also serving in Iraq. Two years ago Hekmati surprised his parents by telling them he wanted to visit Iran for the first time, to meet relatives he had never seen -- including his ailing grandmother -- and find his roots. The Hekmati family has tried to bring public attention to Amir Hekmati's plight, hoping to secure his release. Other Americans detained . Hekmati is the latest American in recent years to face arrest and prosecution in Iran: . • In 2007, Iran arrested several Iranian-Americans -- including Kian Tajbakhsh, Ali Shakeri and Haleh Esfandiari, who were all later released. (That same year retired FBI agent Robert Levinson went missing after last being seen on Iran's Kish Island. Despite photos from his captors, his whereabouts are still unknown.) • In May 2008, retired Iranian-American businessman Reza Taghavi was arrested on suspicion of supporting an anti-regime group. He was released more than two years later. • In 2009, three U.S. hikers, also accused of spying, were arrested but ultimately released. • Tajbakhsh was re-arrested in July 2009 amid post-election protests and a massive government crackdown. In March 2010, he was allowed a temporary release that was later extended, according to the website freekian09.org. The Iranian-American scholar is not allowed to leave the country, the website says. • Journalist Roxana Saberi was arrested in January 2009 and convicted of espionage in a one-day trial that was closed to the public. She was freed in May that year. • Literary translator Mohammad Soleimani Nia was detained in January 2012. • Christian pastor Saeed Abedini was reportedly detained in September 2012.","Amir Hekmati's attorney says his client was never told about the trial .

"In a ""wake-up call,"" climate change scientists contend rising seas endanger America's newest and oldest landmarks such as the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral and the first English colony at Virginia's Jamestown, portending a new century of disasters if Americans don't act. Listing 30 at-risk sites, the Union of Concerned Scientists notes how heritage sites such as Liberty and Ellis Islands have already prepared themselves for ""human-induced climate change."" But many historic treasures from Florida to Hawaii will be imperiled in the 21st century to bigger oceans and more wildfires and floods, the group asserted. Critics of climate change research aren't as dire and say the warming that the Earth now feels could have happened naturally in the ancient past. Critics contend that current studies advancing man-made influences on global warming are too short-sighted by covering only the past 1,500 to 2,000 years. The Union of Concerned Scientists, however, said all its case studies ""draw on observations of impacts that are consistent with, or attributable to, human-induced climate change based on multiple lines of scientific evidence."" The group urged Americans to protect the landmarks and ""to reduce the carbon emissions that are driving up the planet's temperature,"" the group's report said. ""The historic legacy of the United States is at stake."" Those landmarks include sites where the ""first Americans lived,"" Spaniard conquistadors ruled, slaves fled their masters, and a launch pad put the first man on the moon, the group said. ""You can almost trace the history of the United States through these sites,"" Adam Markham, the group's director of climate impacts and a report co-author, said in a statement. ""The imminent risks to these sites and the artifacts they contain threaten to pull apart the quilt that tells the story of the nation's heritage and history."" For example, massive fires and floods have destroyed ancient pueblo masonry, pottery, petroglyphs, adobe buildings and trails at Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado or Bandelier National Monument in New Mexico, the report said. Among landmarks likely to be submerged in rising seas by century's end are Jamestown, where English colonialists made their first permanent settlement in the Americas, and portions of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument in Cambridge, Maryland. Historic districts in Annapolis, Maryland, Charleston, South Carolina, and St. Augustine, Florida, are also at risk to a swollen ocean and possible worsening storm surges, the group said. In Florida, prehistoric communities made of oyster and clam shells are also in peril, such as the Ten Thousand Islands, a community dating to 1,000 B.C., the group said. The Florida Everglades holds landmark communities built on wetlands out of oyster shells. In one case, the National Park Service and the University of Central Florida have established a ""living shoreline"" of oyster mats, Spartina grass and mangroves to protect the 1,200-year-old Turtle Mound, made of shells, in Canaveral National Seashore, the group said. But elsewhere in Florida, the Kennedy Space Center, site of the historic Apollo 11 launch, has seen recent restoration and protection efforts ""undone"" by storm surges. Those protections had sought to shore up dunes near the launch pads, and NASA is now evaluating climate change and further protective measures, the group said. Prehistoric relics are falling into the ocean in Alaska, where melting ice caps and permafrost are allowing storms to erode the coastlines of Cape Krusenstern National Monument and the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve, where ""irreplaceable prehistoric artifacts"" are falling out of the shorelines into the sea, said Markham. On the west coast of Hawaii's Big Island, coastal flooding connected to rising seas threaten ancient trails, seawalls, fish traps and sacred places, the report said. The American Southwest and its landmarks are also vulnerable to a one-two punch of big wildfires and then monsoon flooding, the report said. For example, New Mexico's second largest wildfire in its history -- which destroyed 156,000 acres in 2011 -- damaged more than more than 16,000 forested acres belonging to the Santa Clara Pueblo, a federally registered Native American tribe and National Historic Landmark. Disaster struck it again when heavy rains flooded local canyons, barren from the fire. The Pueblo is home to ancient rock carvings and cliff dwellings. ""Cutting carbon emissions significantly and quickly can slow the pace of sea level rise, limit the temperature increases, and slow the expansion of the wildfire season,"" Angela Anderson, director of the group's climate and energy program, said in a statement.","Some landmarks now see damage such as the Florida launch pad for the first man on moon .

"The mother of an American on trial in Iran denied allegations that her son is a spy for the CIA, saying that anything he confessed to was coerced. Iranian authorities allege that Amir Mirzaei Hekmati entered the country to infiltrate its intelligence system in order to accuse Iran of involvement in terrorist activities, according to the semi-official Fars news agency. ""We are deeply concerned for the fate and well-being of Amir,"" Hekmati's mother, Behnaz, said in a statement Wednesday. ""We are also disturbed by the video and reports coming from the Iranian court that describe Amir admitting to being a spy.  It is clear to me and our entire family that Amir is speaking under duress."" The United States also has called the accusations false. According to Fars, Hekmati told a judge Tuesday that he worked for the CIA and that he was to get paid for delivering information to Iran's intelligence ministry. He also told the judge he felt he had been duped and that he had planned on not returning to the United States, Fars reported. Hekmati's mother called the reported admission ""totally false."" ""It is an indication that he is not speaking freely but being forced to say something that isn't true,"" she said.  ""Amir has many financial and business investments in the U.S. and would never walk away from them."" Hekmati, a former U.S. Marine, was arrested in August while visiting his grandmother and other relatives, his family in Michigan said last week. Up until Wednesday, they had remained quiet about the arrest at the urging of Iranian officials, who promised his release, they said. ""In this environment Amir is a victim,"" his mother said.  ""We are convinced that there is a mistake or misunderstanding.  We pray and hope he will be allowed to come home soon."" The Hekmatis said their son served in the Marines from 2001 to 2005. Later, he started his own linguistics company and contracted his services to the military as well as civilian businesses. His military contracts included cultural competency training. He worked with troops at military bases to promote understanding of, and positive communication, with people of other cultures, his family said. Fars reported that Hekmati said he worked for the U.S. Army for four years and later the CIA, where he was sent to Afghanistan and had access to secret documents. Hekmati was supposed to give his information to the Iranians in two parts -- the first part for free, and if they liked it he would ask for $500,000 for the second part, according to Fars. Hekmati said he was to get a receipt from the intelligence ministry for the money, Fars reported. The judge speculated whether the receipt would later be used as evidence linking Iran to terrorist activities, Fars reported. If Iran had paid, Hekmati told the judge, he would have kept the money and lived in Iran, according to Fars. Hekmati's attorney told the judge his client had been tricked by ""Satan"" -- referring to the United States -- and argued that intent to commit a crime isn't a crime in itself.","The U.S. and his family say Amir Mirzaei Hekmati is falsely accused of spying .

"Kenneth Bae, a U.S. citizen being held in North Korea, told reporters on Monday that he had committed a ""serious crime"" in the secretive nation and that he had not experienced abusive treatment by the regime. ""I would like to plead with the U.S. government, press and my family to stop worsening my situation by making vile rumors against North Korea and releasing materials related to me, which are not based on the facts,"" he said before video cameras in Pyongyang. ""I want to be pardoned by the North as soon as possible and return to my beloved family,"" Bae told journalists from several news organizations. ""For that, I ask the U.S. government, press and my family to make more active efforts and pay more attention."" Bae's family did just that.  His sister Terri Chung released a statement that later Monday, at one point, addresses North Korean leaders. ""We understand that Kenneth has been convicted of crimes under (North Korean) laws. Our family sincerely apologizes on Kenneth's behalf. Kenneth has also acknowledged his crimes and has apologized. He has now served 15 months of his sentence, but faces chronic health problems. We humbly ask for your mercy to release my brother."" Chung said the video showed that her brother was worn down. ""In his eyes, I could see that he was distressed,"" she said. Any statement made by Bae in captivity would be sanctioned by the North Korean government, whose widespread human rights abuses are known to the world. The country has a long history of exacting false ""confessions."" In December, 85-year-old Merrill Newman, a veteran of the Korean War, was freed from captivity in North Korea after being forced to give a false confession, he said afterward. ""Anyone who has read the text of it or who has seen the video of me reading it knows that the words were not mine and were not delivered voluntarily. Anyone who knows me knows that I could not have done the things they had me 'confess' to,"" he wrote. Bae, of Lynwood, Washington, was arrested in November 2012 in Rason along North Korea's northeastern coast. The devout Christian and father of three operated a China-based company specializing in tours of North Korea, according to his family and freekennow.com, a website friends set up to promote his release. ""Several years ago, Kenneth saw an opportunity that combined his entrepreneurial spirit with his personal convictions as a Christian,"" the site said. ""He believed in showing compassion to the North Korean people by contributing to their economy in the form of tourism.""

"Anti-Chinese protests in Vietnam have turned violent with demonstrators setting on fire a number of factories in a southern Vietnamese industrial park. Properties in the Vietnam-Singapore Industrial Parks (VSIP) I & II in Binh Duong were targeted Tuesday by thousands of protesters demonstrating over China's deployment of an oil rig into waters that both countries claim as sovereign territory. Reports suggest the demonstrators targeted factories owned by Chinese firms, although CNN received a report that the arson was indiscriminate, with Korean-, Taiwanese- and Japanese-owned properties also torched by the angry mob. Speaking to CNN, the CEO of a foreign-owned factory, who asked not to be named, relayed information from his employees that ""600"" protestors entered the company's factory building in the park and caused minor damage but did not set it alight. He said that neither local police nor the government were responding to the violence, reportedly claiming that there was nothing they can do to control the situation. A Taiwan-based employee of Asama Bicycles, whose factory was damaged in the riot, told CNN that ""all personnel have been evacuated from the factory and we can only learn the situation after the protesters leave the area."" The Singaporean Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement Wednesday, saying that the government had been informed that ""a number of foreign companies have been broken into and set on fire."" ""Singapore views this issue very seriously given our close economic cooperation with Vietnam,"" the statement read, requesting that ""the Vietnamese government to act immediately to restore law and order in the two (parks) before the security situation worsens and investor confidence is undermined."" Vietnamese protesters target Chinese embassy . 'China's inherent territory' The destruction of property comes after a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) spokesperson called on the Vietnamese government to protect Chinese interests in the country. ""The Xisha (Paracel) Islands are China's inherent territory,"" MoFA spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a briefing Monday. ""The Chinese company's normal operations fall within China's sovereignty. China ... has required the Vietnamese side to take all necessary measures to protect the safety and lawful rights of Chinese citizens and institutions in Vietnam."" The escalating protests come after hundreds of protestors took to the streets in Vietnam over the weekend as the territorial dispute exacerbated relations between the neighboring communist states. Vietnamese officials say Chinese military and civilian ships have been harassing their vessels near the Paracel Islands -- which are controlled by Beijing but claimed by Hanoi -- since the previous Sunday, even accusing the Chinese of repeatedly ramming into them and shooting water cannon. A rally, which drew around a thousand protesters in Hanoi Sunday, focused local ire on the Chinese embassy, while smaller protests in Danang and Ho Chi Minh City echoed the anti-Chinese sentiment emanating from the political capital. While public protests are rare in Vietnam, where the one-party system is wary of public gatherings, there have been several anti-Chinese protests in recent years. That this weekend's actions went ahead unobstructed by police is seen as a sign that the government tacitly approves of the protests. 'Provocative' decision . The U.S. Department of State released a statement last week, calling China's decision to send the oil rig, accompanied by a flotilla of government vessels, ""provocative,"" and an act that ""raises tensions."" ""This unilateral action appears to be part of a broader pattern of Chinese behavior to advance its claims over disputed territory in a manner that undermines peace and stability in the region,"" the statement said. The language was echoed by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in a telephone call this week between the diplomat and his Chinese counterpart. It also raised concerns about the conduct of the Chinese vessels in the area, calling some actions by Chinese ships ""dangerous."" Exclusion zone . Relations between China and Vietnam soured on Friday, when a Chinese platform began drilling for oil near the Paracel Islands. The oil rig, Haiyang Shiyou 981, is owned by state gas and oil company CNOOC. The Maritime Safety Administration of China (MSAC) declared a three-mile exclusion zone around the rig, while military vessels have been deployed to patrol the area. ""At present, the number of escorting ships of China has reached 60, including military ships,"" Tran Duy Hai, Vice Chair of Vietnam's National Boundary Commission, said in a statement Wednesday. ""These vessels have intentionally hit and collided with Vietnamese law enforcement ships, including those of the Maritime Police and Fisheries Control, causing damage in human and property."" (sic) China maintains that its current drilling activities are legitimate and blames the Vietnamese for provoking the conflict. ""The drilling activities of this rig are within China's territorial waters. The harassment by the Vietnamese side is in violation of China's sovereign rights,"" said Hua Chunying, spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. She did not confirm the boat collisions. According to CNOOC, a third of China's oil and gas resources are under the South China Sea, most of which it claims as its own, refuting rival claims from Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Brunei.","Factories in industrial park burned down by anti-Chinese protesters .

"The woman's eyes were swollen and red after she got off a plane in this violence-plagued Central American city Monday. She told CNN she'd cried the whole way on the flight from New Mexico. Her 6-year-old daughter was beside her. They were among a group of about 40 mothers and children deported from the United States to Honduras on a chartered flight Monday -- the first group of Central Americans sent home under stepped-up U.S. efforts to crack down on illegal immigration. Asked about their journey to the United States, her 6-year-old daughter described the dangerous trek north in vivid detail: Stowing away on freight trains. Walking through a forest at night. Seeing monkeys and snakes. Despite the dangers, her mother told CNN she'll probably make the trek again. There is nothing left for them in Honduras, she said. Officials from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security displayed similar resolve Monday, saying the flight was a sign of future deportations. ""Our border is not open to illegal migration and we will send recent illegal migrants back,"" the department said in a statement. ""We expect additional migrants will be returned to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador in the coming days and weeks."" The group deported Monday had recently crossed the U.S.-Mexico border and had been held in a new temporary immigrant detention facility that opened up in Artesia, New Mexico, late last month, Homeland Security officials said. In the Artesia facility, which can house up to 700 people and had about 400 within its confines Friday, officials say undocumented immigrants will be held until their legal cases are decided. The goal, officials said last week, is to process their cases in two to four days. Video conferences with judges have helped speed up the process, officials said. Before the facility opened up, groups of women with children from Central America were released on parole, dropped off at bus stations throughout the Southwest and told to report to Immigrations and Customs Enforcement Offices across the country in about a month. After meeting with House Democrats on Monday, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said authorities are building additional detention centers to house adults traveling with children. Officials are working to correct misinformation from smugglers, who've claimed that there are ""free passes"" for those coming to the United States. ""Beginning this week, we are sending family units back to Central America, so the message is 'We will send you back,' "" he said. The plane arrived Monday afternoon in San Pedro Sula, where violence has earned the city a reputation as the world's murder capital. There were 18 mothers and 22 children on the plane that arrived in Honduras on Monday, first lady Ana Garcia de Hernandez told reporters, according to CNN affiliate Televicentro. The youngest child on the plane was just months old, she said, while the oldest one was 15 or 16. She called for Hondurans to chip in to help the returning families and said officials were developing plans to better support them. ""These are people with dreams, with illusions, and who come (back) in very difficult conditions, who are seeing that their dreams were not made a reality, seeing their aspirations frustrated. Many of them return empty-handed,"" she said. ""And the only thing they have are debts to pay because before leaving, they got rid of everything they had."" Hernandez, who spoke as busloads of Honduran children sent back from Mexico also were expected to arrive, said she was concerned that children were being deported. ""Clearly it worries us,"" she said, ""because we have always spoken about ensuring the best interests of the children."" Sor Valdette Willeman, who heads the Honduran government's program for returning migrants, says there's no second flight of families deported from the United States scheduled yet, but officials are expecting more to come soon. Already, flights packed with Honduran adults deported from the United States arrive daily, she said. She said that she expected the children to arrive in good condition and that the United States has been doing everything possible to care for them and treat them in a dignified manner. President Obama has asked Congress for $3.7 billion in emergency funds to fortify the U.S. Border Patrol and strengthen other programs for dealing with those crossing into the United States illegally as a surge of Central American women and children arrive on America's doorstep. But the Republican-led House is not expected to move fast on the measure and doesn't want to give Obama everything he wants. Some say tweaking a 2008 law combating immigrant trafficking might be enough to stem the flow. The White House has called the situation a ""humanitarian crisis."" Republicans prefer to call it one of the Obama administration's making, and blame it for not being prepared and for an underwhelming response.","One deported Honduran woman says she may head back to the United States .

"An Iranian court has dismissed a lower court's death sentence for an American ex-Marine accused of espionage in Iran, state media reported Monday. A lower court sentenced Amir Mirzaei Hekmati to death in January, but the nation's Supreme Court annulled that sentence and ordered a retrial, state-run Press TV said. The lower court previously had convicted the 28-year-old of ""working for an enemy country,"" as well as membership in the CIA and ""efforts to accuse Iran of involvement in terrorism,"" the semi-official Fars news agency has reported. The U.S. State Department has strongly condemned his conviction. ""Allegations that Mr. Hekmati either worked for or was sent to Iran by the CIA are simply untrue,"" department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said earlier this year. ""The Iranian regime has a history of falsely accusing people of being spies, of eliciting forced confessions, and of holding innocent Americans for political reasons."" Hekmati's family also denies the allegations. Hekmati was arrested in August while visiting his grandmother and other relatives, his family in Michigan said. The Hekmatis said their son served in the U.S. Marines from 2001 to 2005. Later, he started his own linguistics company and contracted his services to the military as well as civilian businesses. His military contracts included cultural competency training. He worked with troops at military bases to promote understanding and positive communication with people of other cultures, his family said.","Iran's Supreme Court orders a retrial in the espionage case, state media report .

"A State Department special envoy will travel to North Korea this week to try to free Kenneth Bae, the U.S. citizen detained there since November, the State Department and White House said Tuesday. Ambassador Robert King, the president's special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, will head to Pyongyang at North Korea's invitation, the State Department said. King, currently traveling in the region, will go to the capital Friday, the White House said. North Korea's supreme court sentenced Bae in April to 15 years of hard labor. His sister, Terri Chung, told CNN two weeks ago that Bae was recently moved to a hospital because of a serious decline in his health. The court found Bae guilty of carrying out ""serious crimes"" against North Korea, including setting up bases in China for the purpose of toppling the North Korean government, encouraging North Korean citizens to bring down the government, and conducting a smear campaign, according to the country's state media. Kenneth Bae: Please help me . The media also say Bae planned an operation to bring down the government through religious activities. Chung says her brother was the owner of a tour company who was in North Korea for work. King will ask Pyongyang to pardon Bae and grant him special amnesty on humanitarian grounds ""so that he can be reunited with his family and seek medical treatment,"" the State Department said. Bae suffers from severe back and leg pain and has lost more than 50 pounds, Chung told CNN earlier this month. Chung said she received the information from the State Department, which told her the Swedish ambassador visited Bae in the hospital. Sweden represents U.S. interests in North Korea because the United States has no diplomatic presence there. Bae also suffers from kidney stones, dizziness, blurred vision and loss of vision, Chung said. He was already dealing with other health problems, including diabetes.

"Goodbye, free plastic toys inside Happy Meals -- at least in one major California city. A new San Francisco law goes into effect on Thursday that prevents fast-food restaurants from giving away trinkets, action figures and other toys in their kid's meals unless their food meets nutritional requirements. Parents who order Happy Meals at the 19 McDonald's locations in San Francisco will have to request the toy and pay 10 cents.  That amount will be donated to the Ronald McDonald House of San Francisco. Burger King, which has 13 restaurants in San Francisco, announced that it will also offer kids meals' toys for 10 cents. McDonald's kid's meals do not meet the law's nutritional standards. The meals have to be less than 600 calories and contain fruits (a half-cup) and vegetables (3/4 of a cup).  They must have less than 35% of the total calories coming from fat, less than 640 milligrams of sodium and less than 0.5 milligrams of trans fat. The current Happy Meal consisting of a hamburger, kid's-size fries and a cola would meet the calorie, calories from fat, sodium and trans fat requirements under the San Francisco law. It would contain 500 calories, 125 calories from fat and 600 milligrams of sodium. But it would not meet the fruit and vegetable quota. The pickle and onion on the hamburger does not come near the required ¾ cup of  vegetables. The French fries do not count as a vegetable, according to the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The new law will affect about 50 fast-food restaurants in San Francisco such as Burger King, Carl's Jr. and Subway. ""Our efforts are geared towards addressing childhood obesity epidemic,"" said San Francisco City and County Supervisor Eric Mar, who proposed the ordinance. About one-third of children in the United States are either overweight or obese, according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Health advocates have long accused fast-food restaurants of enticing children to eat fast-food meals high in fat and sodium by using toys tied to characters in new movies. McDonald's said in a statement: ""While we will fully comply with this law, we also have a responsibility to give our customers what they want. ""Parents have told us they'd still like the option of purchasing a toy separately for their child when they buy them a Happy Meal or Mighty Kids Meal."" The announcement that the money from toys would go to charity was met by skepticism by Corporate Accountability International, a corporate watchdog group. ""As McDonald's long has, it is again using a charity that helps children get well to defend a practice that contributes to a range of diet-related conditions like diabetes. Currently McDonald's uses its contributions to the charity to defend the hundreds of millions it spends marketing its junk food brand to kids each year,"" according to the group's statement. The new ordinance has had a greater impact beyond San Francisco, Mar said. ""We inspired other local cities, parent activists and health organizers to take up the issue too,"" he said. ""We started a national dialogue in San Francisco. It has become a national issue."" Similar initiatives have been proposed in New York in an effort to curb childhood obesity. And Santa Clara County initially passed the ban early last year. Mar said he met with several franchise owners in the city regarding the ordinance.  Despite initial opposition to the law last year, he said that there's growing awareness that having healthy options is good business practice. Earlier this year, hamburger chain Jack-in-the-Box announced it would discontinue kids' toys in their meals for children. Also this summer, McDonald's announced that it would revamp its iconic Happy Meal to contain healthier options. The meals will carry apple slices, reduced portion of French fries and a choice of beverage, including new fat-free chocolate milk and 1% low-fat white milk, instead of defaulting to soda.  The changes started in September  and will spread nationwide by the end of March 2012. However, the new version of the Happy Meal still does not meet the requirements of the San Francisco law. Although the San Francisco law has been criticized as legislating health and nutrition, Mar said the responsibility ultimately falls on the parents.  But, fast-food restaurants play a role and ""benefit from the pester power of the kids of young ages,"" he said. ""It's our job as a local legislator to protect public health,"" he said. ""Nothing is more important than children's health."" He said the momentum for this law came from pediatricians and mainly parents who live in the lowest income neighborhoods. ""They were the main voices of our campaign,"" he said. The long-term goal is to move children's meals toward lower fat, sodium and calories, Mar said.","Law putting nutritional requirements on kids' meals goes into effect Thursday .
McDonald's will no longer give free toy in Happy Meals in San Francisco .

"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- The Peruvian woman who died in Joran van der Sloot's hotel room was killed after she discovered information on his laptop linking him to the disappearance of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway, a source with direct knowledge of the investigation told CNN. Van der Sloot, the longtime suspect in the Holloway case, confessed Monday night to the killing of Stephany Flores Ramirez, 21, whose body was found in a hotel room last week, Peruvian authorities said. He could be formally charged as early as Wednesday, the authorities said. Van der Sloot was interrogated for seven hours Monday, the source with direct knowledge of the investigation told CNN. The Dutch citizen told investigators that he left the hotel room to buy bread and coffee at a gas station next to the hotel, the source said. Upon his return, he found Flores going through his laptop, where she found something linking him to the disappearance of Holloway, the source said. At that point, Flores wanted to leave, and the pair started arguing, according to the source. Flores slapped van der Sloot, and he hit her back, and then grabbed her neck, the source said. Van der Sloot told investigators he was intoxicated on marijuana when all this happened, the source said. Although Flores' body was found half-dressed, there was no evidence that she had sexual intercourse that night, the source said. Van der Sloot had access to a public defender, but it was unclear whether he had used his services. Attempts by CNN to reach the public defenders' office were unsuccessful. Van der Sloot, 22, was arrested twice in connection with Holloway's disappearance in Aruba but was released for lack of evidence. He has denied any involvement and has not been charged. He was originally slated to show authorities Tuesday a re-enactment of the crime at the Hotel Tac, where he was staying. Because of security reasons, however, the re-enactment has been delayed, authorities said Tuesday. Peru National Police Col. Abel Gamarra said the re-enactment could happen as early as Wednesday. Flores' body was found in the room registered to van der Sloot. Video from hotel security cameras shows van der Sloot and Flores entering his room at 5:33 a.m. on May 30. He emerged alone and left the hotel more than three hours later, the video shows. He was arrested in Chile on Thursday and returned to Peru on Friday. At van der Sloot's first court appearance, the judge may set a hearing date and order additional investigations. The Peruvian justice system often issues a lighter sentence in cases in which the suspect confesses. Van der Sloot could get up to 35 years in prison. There is no death penalty or life sentence in Peru. A Peruvian police report leaked Monday said Flores' body was found on van der Sloot's hotel room floor, half-dressed. The report also provides new details about the hours before the body was found. According to the document, the Hotel Tac received a call from someone looking for van der Sloot about 11 p.m. June 1. The receptionist forwarded the call, but no one answered. The hotel worker assumed that van der Sloot was asleep because the room key was with him and not at the front desk. About an hour later, according to the police report, the receptionist noticed that van der Sloot owed money for two nights and went up to his room, where her knocks went unanswered. The television was blaring, so the hotel employee figured he was resting, the report says. Afterward, the hotel supervisor told the employee to go back to van der Sloot's room and enter using a spare key. When the employee went in, she found Flores' body on the floor, dressed in a black T-shirt and red panties, half-covered with a piece of white clothing, the police report said. Flores had bled from her nose, the report said. The hotel employee became frightened and went to alert her supervisor and the police, turning off the television and lights on her way out of the room, the report said. The developments in the van der Sloot case came as the Natalee Holloway Resource Center opened Tuesday in Washington. The nonprofit center is located at the National Museum of Crime and Punishment. Natalee's mother, Beth Holloway, attended the opening. She urged supporters to keep the Flores family ""in our hearts and in our prayers."" The center says it will provide families of missing persons help with managing their crises and give students advice on traveling safely.

"Investigators found two fully functional pipe bombs and believe that a three-week manhunt may be taking a toll on suspected cop killer Eric Matthew Frein, Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Tuesday. ""Over the last few days we have found several items that undoubtedly confirm Eric Frein is hiding in our search area,"" Bivens told reporters. ""We have found a number of items belonging to Frein, some of which were hastily discarded."" Those items include a pair of pipe bombs found in the last two days that could be detonated via trip wire or fuse -- consistent with what Bivens called ""Frein's non-confrontational and gutless efforts to kill or injure law enforcement from a distance."" The bombs were capable of causing significant damage, he said. ""I can't get into his head but I'm sure that he is stressed at this point,"" Bivens said. ""It's been a couple of weeks and I am certain that he is not sleeping well at night."" Frein may have been spotted within the past 24 hours in the rugged area where he has been sighted numerous times, Bivens told reporters. The suspect was wearing dark clothing and was seen between 75 and 100 yards away. ""We're confident that he's in the area,"" Bivens said. Frein is sought in the death of Cpl. Bryon Dickson in a September 12 ambush outside the state police barracks in Blooming Grove. Trooper Alex T. Douglass was wounded in the attack. Authorities have located several structures where they believe the suspect has stayed. Some items were found in a location that Frein may have used as an ""overnight accommodation,"" Bivens said. 'We are not going anywhere' As he has in the past, Bivens, who is spearheading the manhunt, had a personal message for Frein: ""I am calling on you, Eric, to surrender. You are clearly stressed. You are making significant mistakes. We continue to take your supplies and your weapon stockpiles. While you are no doubt weakening our troopers' resolve is very strong. We are not going anywhere."" Bivens said Frein may have placed other explosive devices in the area and warned people to be very careful, especially since archery hunting season is about to begin. The self-styled survivalist may have planned the ambush and retreat for months or years, police have said. The search area is a wooded area around the border of Pike and Monroe counties. The area is not far from Frein's family home in Canadensis, in the Pocono Mountains. The suspect has the advantage of knowing the terrain where he is hidden, officials said. Poring through a variety of clues . Last week, police said a  review of a computer hard drive used by Frein showed he planned the attack and his retreat into the woods for a couple of years. The hard drive which Frein had access to indicated extensive Internet research on topics such as ""how to avoid police manhunts, use of various law enforcement technologies and skills related to survival,"" Bivens said. Police also were able to track Frein through his cell phone when he called his parents one time earlier this month, a federal law enforcement official told CNN. Frein hung up after one ring, the source said. The search has yielded an empty pack of Serbian cigarettes, Bivens said. Frein claims to have fought with Serbians in Africa and has studied Russian and Serbian languages, according to the FBI, which last week named him one of its Ten Most Wanted fugitives. Soiled adult diapers were also found, perhaps used by Frein to stay in a stationary position for long periods of time. Authorities have said that Frein hated law enforcement and that they believe that he's solely focused on hurting more officers but not civilians. ""I do think that we have significantly degraded his ability ... to adapt,"" Bivens said Tuesday.

"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- Joran van der Sloot has a low tolerance for frustration and ""doesn't value the female role,"" according to excerpts from a psychological investigation report given to a judge by prosecutors Monday. According to the document, van der Sloot, suspected of killing a Peruvian woman late last month, ""does not tolerate when someone tries to contradict him. It generates in him a challenging attitude."" The report calls him ""emotionally immature,"" which elicits strong changes in behavior that can send him out of control. ""He reflects a certain dominance over the opposite sex. He doesn't value the female role,"" the document states. Its adds, ""he presents traits of an anti-social personality"" and is ""indifferent towards others' well being."" Despite this, the report says, ""he doesn't show any psychopathological trauma that impedes him from perceiving and evaluating reality."" Also Monday, Van der Sloot told the judge that his rights and due process were violated after his arrest in connection with the killing of Stefany Flores Ramirez, his attorney told CNN. The judge will decide on the legality of van der Sloot's incarceration by Wednesday, lawyer Maximo Altez said. If the ruling is unfavorable to van der Sloot, Altez said he is prepared to appeal to the highest court. While in front of the judge, however, van der Sloot declined to give a formal statement on the facts of the case, according to the court. The reason he gave was the ongoing motion for habeas corpus, which he hopes will nullify the statements he gave to police that led to his imprisonment. Van der Sloot's decision will not hold up the legal proceedings against him, the court said. Meanwhile, in a Dutch newspaper article published Monday, van der Sloot says he was ""tricked"" into confessing to the murder of Flores. Peruvian police told him that if he signed the papers they gave him, he would be transferred to the Netherlands, he told De Telegraaf in a jail interview. ""In my blind panic I signed everything, but never knew what was written on them,"" he said. Van der Sloot was twice arrested over the disappearance of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway in Aruba in 2005, but never charged. His mother said Saturday he was mentally unwell, De Telegraaf reported in what it called an exclusive interview with her. Van der Sloot went to Peru to escape having to enter the high security section of a psychiatric hospital, Anita van der Sloot said. She said he suffered severe psychological distress at the early death of his father, for which he blamed himself, she said, without giving further details. She did not deny that he killed Flores. She said she spoke to him shortly before Flores died and soon after and that he sounded paranoid, saying he was being ""followed and watched,"" De Telegraaf reported. Van der Sloot's attorney, Altez, has maintained that the judge in the case should strike down van der Sloot's confession because he was not properly represented when he was interrogated. But Peruvian police have defended the interrogation and said van der Sloot's confession was acquired legally. According to transcripts of his confession, van der Sloot said he elbowed Flores in the face before strangling her and then suffocating her with his shirt. The transcripts -- provided to CNN by a police source -- provide shocking details and give the public its first glimpse of why van der Sloot says the alleged murder took place. The source has not been named because he was not authorized to pass along the material. ""There was blood everywhere,"" van der Sloot said in the transcripts. ""What am I going to do now. I had blood on my shirt. There was also blood on the bed, so, I took my shirt and put it on her face, pressing hard, until I killed Stephany."" Peruvian authorities have charged van der Sloot with murder. Van der Sloot told authorities he attacked Flores on May 30 after she read an e-mail on his computer connected with the Holloway case. In the transcript, van der Sloot said that after Flores read the e-mail, she punched him in the face. ""At that moment impulsively, with my right elbow I hit her in the face exactly on top of the nose,"" van der Sloot said. ""I think she started to faint. It affected me so that I grabbed her from the neck and strangled her for a minute."" Van der Sloot said he had a quick thought to try and hide the body but instead fled. He was arrested in Chile on June 3 and was returned the next day to Peru. Along with killing Flores, who had a broken neck, he took money and bank cards from her wallet, police said. Van der Sloot told police in Chile a different story of how Flores died when he was arrested there, according to transcripts. He blamed the death on robbers who had waited for him at his hotel in Peru. ""There was a man coming from the access door with a knife in his hand,"" van der Sloot said. ""The man with the knife hit her in the face, making her bleed through the nose."" But Peru authorities said they had overwhelming evidence pointing to van der Sloot, and when he was transferred to Peru, van der Sloot confessed to the crime, police said. Van der Sloot said he was in Peru for a poker tournament and had met Flores while he was gambling. Police have said they think van der Sloot killed Flores to steal money she won from gambling. Van der Sloot offered a different motive. ""After I responded with hitting her, I feared that she would go to the police and they would detain me for what was an impulsive act,"" van der Sloot said. ""I think I wanted to kill her because I wasn't thinking."" Van der Sloot is being held in a high-security area of the Miguel Castro Castro prison where only two of 10 cells are occupied, and he has no contact with inmates in the general prison population. He is under guard 24 hours a day, authorities have said. The only other inmate in the area is alleged Colombian hit man Hugo Trujillo Ospina. The two have spent some time together in a common area where there is a television set and weights made of broomsticks and soda bottles, authorities said. There is the possibility that van der Sloot will be integrated with other segments of the prison population. CNN's Francesca Church, Mayra Cuevas and Jean Casarez contributed to this report.","Psychological tests concluded Joran van der Sloot is 'emotionally immature'

"Last week, millions of Americans stood up against the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Senate's related anti-piracy bill. Given the public outcry, it is not surprising that all four Republican presidential candidates have come out against them. But online censorship in the name of fighting piracy is only one of many issues affecting Americans' digital freedom. Americans who care about their online freedoms should also be asking tough questions about the government's expanding surveillance powers. As we grow increasingly dependent on the Internet and cell phones for all aspects of our lives, government abuse of citizens' privacy requires the cooperation of the private sector. This includes companies running our Internet and wireless service providers, e-mail, and social networking services, as well as manufacturers of the devices we use to connect. Google's announcement earlier this week that it will integrate user information across its search engine, Gmail, YouTube and its 57 other services stirred criticism from privacy groups and some members of Congress. People have good reason to be unhappy about losing control over who and what services know what about them. But that is far from the only way in which we are losing control. Under two successive administrations, new laws, policies and corporate practices have made it much easier for government agencies to track and access citizens' private digital communications from their storage ""in the cloud"" than it is for agents to search or monitor our physical homes, offices, vehicles, and mail. The erosion of privacy rights under the Fourth Amendment, written to protect us against unreasonable search and seizure, began in earnest under President George W. Bush. The Patriot Act, passed overwhelmingly but hastily after 9/11, allows the FBI to obtain telecommunication, financial, and credit records without a court order. Moreover, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act's 2008 amendment act grants U.S. companies immunity from being sued by their customers when they comply even with blatantly illegal government surveillance requests. As a presidential candidate in 2008, Barack Obama pledged to reform the Patriot Act and rescind the FISA Amendments Act, but as president he reversed his position. The Obama administration has fought bipartisan efforts in Congress to bring the change he once championed. The result is the ""new normal"": surveillance, often of questionable legality and sometimes clear illegality, against which Americans have little effective recourse, on the rare occasions that we even know that violations are taking place. Most of what we do know is thanks to whistle-blowers, activists, academics and a few committed journalists. In 2004, Mark Klein, a technician who had just retired from AT&T, disclosed that in 2003 the National Security Agency built a secret room at the San Francisco facility where he worked, routing all e-mail and phone traffic through it. Another whistle-blower, Justice Department attorney Thomas Tamm, confirmed that similar interception points were set up around the country to gather and analyze the e-mails and phone calls of Americans who were not suspected of any crime. While the federal government is required by law to document publicly its wiretapping of phone lines, it is not required to do so with Internet communications. Over 50,000 National Security Letters, a kind of administrative demand letter requiring no probable cause or judicial oversight, are issued each year. Yet we know few details. Companies complying with these secret letters were barred from even informing customers about them until 2009 when Nick Merrill, an entrepreneur who ran a small New York-based Internet service company, successfully enlisted the help of the ACLU in challenging a blanket gag provision of the Patriot Act. Last year, the Electronic Frontier Foundation published a report analyzing the FBI's use of National Security Letters from 2001 to 2008, concluding that the FBI might have violated the law as many as 40,000 times during that period. In many cases the companies involved -- including phone companies, Internet service providers, financial institutions, and credit agencies -- ""contributed in some way to the FBI's unauthorized receipt of personal information."" In the Internet age, it is inevitable that corporations and government agencies will have access to detailed information about people's lives. We willingly share personal information with companies for the convenience of using their products. We accept that a certain amount of surveillance is necessary in order to protect innocent people from crime and terror. But as a nation we have failed to address the resulting dilemma: How do we prevent the abuse of the power we have willingly delegated to government and companies? If anything is clear from the political arguments raging throughout the country, it is that Americans worry, with good reason, about manipulation and abuse by both the private and the public sector. The Republican primary field is not unified on how to handle surveillance: Romney and Gingrich advocate expanding the Patriot Act's surveillance powers. Ron Paul would repeal it. In Congress, debates about surveillance cross party lines. The Patriot Act and FISA Amendments Act have staunch supporters as well as fierce opponents among Republicans, Democrats, and independents. The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act of 2011, which exempts companies from liability for sharing data with the government, is one of several bills introduced in Congress last year that civil liberties groups -- and in this case even the White House -- warn will lead to further erosion of consumer privacy. The advent of the Internet does not change a bedrock truth upon which our nation was founded: The survival of American democracy depends as much on the defense of liberty as it does on the defense of our physical security. Those two ideals always have been and always will be in tension; but without a healthy balance between them -- online as well as offline -- we cannot live free of fear. Fortunately, the Supreme Court takes our Fourth Amendment rights seriously -- even when the executive and legislative branches of our government fail to do so -- as demonstrated by Monday's unanimous ruling that these rights were violated when police secretly planted GPS devices on a suspect's vehicle without a court order. Rather than waiting for the Supreme Court to reverse bad law and unconstitutional law enforcement, however, Americans can exercise their power through the ballot box to prevent violations from happening in the first place. In 2012, the American people rightly expect presidential and congressional candidates to explain how they plan to protect us from crime and terror. In the Internet age, that inevitably requires some degree of surveillance. Yet it is equally vital we demand a clear vision of how they will protect us from abuses of government surveillance power through the corporate-run digital platforms upon which we are increasingly dependent.

"You're settling into your tiny coach seat on your next business trip, and the person next to you starts coughing. In the past, you might have grumbled about him flying with a cold. But now travelers may want to know: Does your seatmate have Ebola? Probably not. But given the news of the past week, it's hard not to worry. Affected passengers may not show symptoms for up to 21 days, said CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta. Case in point: Thomas Eric Duncan, the first Ebola patient diagnosed in the U.S., was screened for the virus before departing Liberia for the United States on September 19, but he didn't show symptoms until he had been in Dallas for a few days. People who came into contact with him in the United States are being tracked down for monitoring. How can air travelers stay calm? Travel blogger Johnny ""Jet"" DiScala, reached on Thursday at 35,000 feet flying from Toronto to Honolulu via Los Angeles, takes a few additional steps to keep calm. DiScala, who visits 20 countries and flies about 150,000 miles annually, knows how Ebola is transmitted and isn't concerned about catching it. But he refuses to read stories about the disease to avoid panicking. DiScala also carries surgical masks, which he will wear and offer to travelers ""coughing and sneezing on me."" Several airlines report they are following all U.S. Centers for Disease Controls protocols for keeping people with contagious diseases off their aircrafts. But a handful declined to give specifics about whether they're now doing anything differently on U.S. domestic flights. Airplanes are given light cleanings between flights, a much heavier daily cleaning and even more on down time, experts tell CNN. This is done to prevent transmission of common diseases, like the flu, via surfaces such as armrests. And it is much tougher to catch Ebola than the flu. How Ebola spreads . In one CDC study, the Ebola virus lived in a perfectly controlled environment for up to six days. But the environment at an airport, for example, is not perfectly suited to support viruses. It's unlikely the virus would spread on an airplane unless a passenger were to come into contact with a sick person's bodily fluids, said Dr. Marty Cetron, director of CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine. ""This is not an airborne transmission,"" Cetron told CNN. ""There needs to be direct contact frequently with body fluids or blood."" Your Ebola questions answered . Guidance for travelers . It's no surprise that the U.S. government recommends that travelers avoid areas experiencing outbreaks and avoid contact with Ebola patients. Most people who have become infected with Ebola lived with or cared for an ill patient, said Stephen Monroe, deputy director of CDC's National Center for Emerging Zoonotic and Infectious Diseases. ""It's very unlikely that they would be able to spread the disease to fellow passengers,"" he said. Ebola symptoms include fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat; followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and at advanced stage, both internal and external bleeding, according to the World Health Organization. ""It is highly unlikely that someone suffering such symptoms would feel well enough to travel,"" the International Air Transport Association said in a statement. Duncan flew on United Airlines for two legs of his journey, and passengers on those flights are not in danger, said a United spokesperson, noting the CDC advice on symptoms. ""The ill person did not exhibit symptoms of Ebola during the flights from West Africa and CDC does not recommend that people on the same commercial airline flights undergo monitoring, as Ebola is contagious only if the person is experiencing active symptoms,"" advised the CDC, in a statement. The CDC is advising people to avoid all non-essential travel to Liberia, Guinea or Sierra Leone. In addition, everyone leaving those three countries has their temperature checked before they're allowed to board a plane.

"Whatever the outcome of Facebook's public offering of stock, the social network has already enriched  quite a few — as well as famously offered many hundreds of millions of people a new virtual social world.  Yet critics claim that Facebook is hastening the demise of privacy, which as the cliché goes, is already on life support. Jeff Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy says that ""Facebook has purposefully worked to erode the concept of privacy by disingenuously claiming users want to share all of their personal information.""  Human Rights First CEO Elisa Massimino argues, ""Facebook's privacy policies are prohibitively confusing, make it difficult for users to protect personal information, expose to disclosure information users believe is private, and are changed without adequate warning or consent from users."" Mark Zuckerberg has responded to such criticisms in two rather different ways. On the one hand he argued that privacy is an obsolete social norm,  echoing the (then) CEO of Sun Microsystems who stated, ""You have zero privacy anyway. ... Get over it.""  On the other hand, Facebook has improved its privacy settings, for example, by allowing users to ""untag"" themselves from previous posts  and giving them greater control over what information can be accessed by third-party apps. From the viewpoint of privacy advocates such as New York Law School professor James Grimmelmann,  Simon Davies of the UK-based Privacy International,  Dany Nativel in France, and Malte Spitz in Germany,  privacy is already on its last legs. Facebook merely adds to the major inroads made by the CCTV cameras that are ubiquitous in many cities around the globe, along with surveillance satellites, tracking devices, spy malware and, most recently, drones used not for killing terrorists but for scrutinizing spaces heretofore considered private, like our backyards. Corporations keep detailed dossiers on what we purchase.  No wonder privacy advocates argue that we live in a surveillance society  and privacy ""ended with Facebook."" Opinion: 'Facebook parenting' is destroying our children's privacy . Actually if you look beyond all these alarmed pronouncements, you will find that: . (a) Many of these devices are applied to public spaces, where it is unclear how much of a right to privacy we have in the first place. They do what a police officer does, only using technology instead. In free societies, in which this debate largely rages,  when the police do spy on someone's home, personal phone or car, the courts still generally hold that the authorities need a warrant — that is, they need to show a judge that they have reasonable evidence to assume the person has committed a crime. Under those conditions, privacy was not protected from the day the Constitution was written. (b) Our communications are now much more secure from prying eyes and ears — that is, much more private — than they were before the cyberage. The main reason is that most of our sensitive online transactions — financial, medical, etc. — are encrypted, often automatically.  The default option for Gmail user accounts also encrypts communications between users' browsers and Google's servers.  The NSA is surely able to read encrypted communications, but few, if any, others can. Compare today's messaging to those that were made by letters (that could be readily steamed open and resealed), faxes and telegrams, and you see how much more private communications have become. (c) These days, our information is routinely stored in computers and protected by passwords.  Those, especially when we are lazy (and use — as a surprising number of people do — 123456, abc123, or ""password"" ) or do not bother to reset them regularly, can be broken. However, most times they hold.  Compare this storage of information to what it was before the cyberage, when it was kept in paper files in drawers and locked offices, which often could be opened with a letter opener or even a credit card, not to mention a burglar's tools. (d) Before 2000, the most intimate and private information, medical information, could be bought and sold. Health insurance companies could disclose information to employers,  corporations profited as clearinghouses of buyers and sellers of medical records,  and pharmaceutical companies used patient information to more successfully market prescription drugs to individuals.  In 2000, a new federal right to medical privacy was established in the United States. Those who share such information now, without proper authorization, can be tried as criminals.  No wonder now there are very few reports of violations of medical privacy. Indeed, if you read closely the various alarmist articles about the death of privacy, you soon will note that many deal either with public spaces or with hypotheticals. They claim that police could abuse these tools, might use them to ill effect and so on.  The American Civil Liberties Union, for example, criticized the use of drones by law enforcement by arguing that such use ""could eventually eliminate the privacy Americans have traditionally enjoyed in their movements and activities."" Facebook has been caught in the same crossfire between strong privacy advocates and the social benefits it generates for hundred of millions who use it to communicate with their families and friends, close and not so close. It improved its privacy settings, though it still takes a considerable amount of effort to set them at the specific level one prefers. However, if Facebook users choose to ignore the risk to their privacy when they log in to this domain, which is known for its openness, their complaints must be taken with a grain of salt. The same holds for the argument that privacy in general is on its way out. It surely faces new challenges in the cyberage, but also unprecedented protections.

"San Diego Padres fans remember Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn's hitting prowess: 3,141 hits, a .338 batting average and an intense focus at the plate. What they probably don't remember is Gwynn using smokeless tobacco throughout his career -- a habit, Gwynn told ESPN in 2010, that he believed gave him cancer. Gwynn's use doesn't specifically come to mind because so many of his fellow Major League Baseball players had the same habit. A survey administered in 1999 found that close to one-third of rookies starting in the major leagues were already regular smokeless tobacco users. More than two-thirds had tried smokeless tobacco. Other studies found similar rates -- about 30% -- in the majors in the '70s and '80s, though smokeless tobacco use among players began declining in the late 1990s (PDF). But it wasn't until 2011 that MLB implemented rules related to smokeless tobacco products. Worried about the message it was sending to young fans, MLB collaborated with the Major League Baseball Players Association to prohibit teams from providing tobacco to players. Players cannot have tobacco tins in their uniforms or do interviews while using chewing tobacco. Yet the players' union stopped short of banning tobacco use on the field. Smokeless tobacco is the general term for two products: chewing tobacco and snuff. Though snuff can be inhaled, most users place smokeless tobacco in their mouth and suck on it, periodically spitting out the juices. Smokeless tobacco contains 28 carcinogens, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and is a known cause of oral cancer. Smokeless tobacco is primarily a male habit, the CDC says. In 2012, approximately 11% of high school boys used smokeless tobacco; only 1.5% of girls did. Nationally, an estimated 6% of adult men use smokeless tobacco, compared with just 1% of adult women. ""Current use of smokeless tobacco is about half of what it was in the mid-1990s,"" the CDC Youth and Tobacco use website states. ""However, only a modest decline has occurred since 2010 and no change occurred between 2012 and 2013."" Gwynn was diagnosed with cancer in 2010. ESPN reported at the time that the then-50-year-old faced chemotherapy and radiation to fight the ""slow-moving but aggressive"" cancer in his salivary gland. There is no scientifically established link between smokeless tobacco and salivary gland cancer, according to the American Council on Science and Health. Doctors don't know what causes salivary gland cancer, but the Mayo Clinic lists old age and radiation as known risk factors. ""The kind of chewing tobacco Gwynn used does have some risk of oral cancer, but not parotid (salivary) gland cancer, which is the kind that took his life at such a young age,"" said Dr. Gilbert Ross, the council's medical director. Gwynn isn't the only former ballplayer to battle oral cancer. Most notably, Babe Ruth, Brett Butler and Bill Tuttle were all diagnosed after years of chewing tobacco use. Butler became a passionate advocate against tobacco after he returned to the field following treatment, according to the Oral Cancer Foundation. Still, players say the habit is hard to break. ""I use it as a stimulator when I go to hit,"" Boston Red Sox star David Ortiz told the Boston Globe. ""But the minute I finish my at-bat, I spit it out. It keeps me smooth and puts me in a good mood. I don't do it in the off season. I don't really like it that much, to be honest with you."" Nicotine, the addictive substance found in cigarettes, occurs naturally in all tobacco. ""Over time, a person becomes physically dependent on and emotionally addicted to nicotine,"" according to the American Cancer Society. Those who do try to quit experience withdrawal, often for weeks after their last spit or chew. Withdrawal symptoms can include irritability, dizziness, depression, headaches and weight gain, according to the American Cancer Society. Baseball Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn dies .

"San Diego (CNN) -- As we try to grasp the enormity of the crisis involving at least 57,000 unaccompanied minors from Central America who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border looking for safe haven, Americans should stop casting blame and be realistic. We always look for an endpoint, a limit, a boundary. When we're told about a budget shortfall, we want the exact numbers so we can assess the damage. We'll settle for an approximation. ""Give me a ballpark figure,"" we say. But sometimes, it's not that simple. Recently, my sources in Texas who have been close to the border kids story since the start -- and have batted 1.000 in terms of the accuracy of their reports -- have been giving me a dire warning. It's the equivalent of: ""You ain't seen nothing yet."" Many Americans are angry and frustrated over the government's handling of the border kids calamity. The Obama administration -- which, according to Texas Gov. Rick Perry, was warned by state officials in the Lone Star State that this was happening as early as 2012 and obviously didn't do enough to prepare -- estimates that by the end of this year, as many as 90,000 young people will have crossed the border into the American Southwest. Opinion: Send U.S. marshals to the border . Then there are the tag-alongs. Looking for jobs, and seizing on the opportunity presented by the fact that so many border patrol agents are preoccupied caring for the children, an unknown number of adults from Mexico are riding the kids' coattails right into the United States. It's a total mess. But what if what we're witnessing now is just the beginning? What if the real wave is yet to come? My sources tell me that it is well-known that in the Rio Grande Valley, there are tens or even hundreds of thousands of people from Central America -- mostly women and children -- in northern Mexico right now, waiting for their chance to cross into the United States. We should stop looking for an endpoint. This story has no end in sight. As a journalist, every week, I start with a dozen new angles to explore. By the beginning of next week, there will be a dozen more. Make no mistake. We will be dealing with this crisis not for weeks or months but probably for years. People will keep coming. And with every wave, new angles will appear. It is hubris for U.S. officials to believe that any one course of action can stop the flood of desperate people fleeing violence, poverty and oppression. The most we can hope for is to be able to manage this crisis for the next few years. Only six weeks ago, this story was limited to how we were going to respond to a mass exodus of brave and desperate children and teenagers being ferried across the U.S.-Mexico border by unscrupulous Mexican smugglers after escaping the clutches of ruthless street gangs in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. Then it grew to involve the perils of a porous border and the litany of horrible things that can happen, on both sides of the line, when you advertise to the world that your country's backdoor is unlocked and you don't have the manpower to keep order and prevent violence, crime and lawlessness. Now that -- heaven help the children -- the politicians have become involved, the story has become about how neither the White House nor Congress, neither Democrats nor Republicans, have the foggiest idea about how to deal with the problem, since all we're hearing are bad and simplistic solutions that tell us that most of our leaders don't know the first thing about what they see as the foreign world of the U.S.-Mexico border. Speaking of simplistic solutions, the Obama administration this week deported the first batch of undocumented women and children to Honduras. Don't expect the deportees to even bother unpacking. Unless the horrendous violence and poverty that pushed them out has been magically eradicated in the past several months, they will soon return to the United States. Opinion: What Obama could learn on the border . Here's what this chapter of the story is really about: The scope of the problem. It's about numbers and tally sheets that we're afraid to imagine. It's about how many people will come and how long this surge will go on. Many Americans, particularly those in the Southwest, are in full panic mode. And so they're doing what they always do in the face of adversity: They're digging in their heels, rolling up their sleeves, stiffening their backbones -- and blaming Mexico. They demand to know why Mexico isn't stopping the border kids from going north. To be fair, from media reports and interviews with Central American kids who tried to get out but were captured in Mexico and deported back home, it does seem like our neighbor is stopping some of them. Yet Mexico couldn't stop all of these kids at its southern border any more than we could stop them at ours. There are just too many of them. In both countries, we're learning the same lesson: Walls and guards can't stop the determined and the desperate, the oppressed and the hungry. Americans couldn't stop the first wave of child refugees, and it's not clear if we can stop the second or third. But let's at least be ready for it and make sure we don't repeat our mistakes. Politicians like to talk about how we have to ""do right"" by these kids, but doing the right thing requires staying ahead of this story and bracing for the least desirable outcome. Let's stop looking for simple solutions and a finish line. This crisis doesn't have either one.

"In 1986, with control of the United States Senate up for grabs, The Economist dispatched a reporter to Nevada, an important battleground that year, to survey the race between then-Rep. Harry Reid and his Republican opponent, James Santini. ""Mr. Reid's performance in Las Vegas could well turn on the Mormon vote,"" the correspondent noted, spotlighting Reid's religion. ""Though only some 12% of Nevadans are Mormons, they punch more than their weight. Less than half the state's eligible voters bother to register, but Mormons almost always do, which gives them about a quarter of the likely turnout."" Members of the Jesus Christ Church of Latter Day Saints still punch more than their weight in Nevada politics, holding a broad array of elected offices and deep sway within the business community. But the portrait of Nevada as a sparsely populated desert locale where elections hinge on the Mormon vote now seems quaint. The state's dramatic population growth over the last two decades -- two-thirds of all registered voters in Nevada registered to vote after the 2000 presidential election, for instance -- has diluted the influence of Mormon voters on statewide elections. Nevada had just 375,000 registered voters in 1998 when Reid won his first Senate race. Now, more than a million voters are on the books. There are nearly 700,000 voters in Clark County alone. At the same time the state's population was exploding, Nevada's Mormon population slipped from 12% in 1986 to an estimated 7% today. Mormon vote 'almost always over-hyped' Although Mitt Romney is certain to energize Mormon voters this election season as the first member of his church to helm a major party's presidential ticket, political watchers here say the LDS vote in Nevada rarely lives up to its billing in the national media. ""The Mormon vote here is almost always over-hyped,"" said veteran Las Vegas Sun columnist Jon Ralston. ""It's not going to be a huge factor unless the election here is very, very close, because you have to assume that 90% to 95% of them are going to vote for Romney. But it's still relatively insignificant compared to other demographics, like Hispanics."" The impact of LDS voters is felt mostly inside the Republican Party, a dynamic that came into focus during the GOP primary fight, when Mormons showed up at polling places in robust numbers to help push Romney to victories in Western states like Wyoming, Idaho and Arizona. In exit polls conducted during the Nevada caucuses in February, 25% of the electorate identified as Mormon, and nearly all of them voted for Romney. A similar story unfolded during the caucuses in 2008, when Romney first ran for president. The state does not keep tabs on voter registration by faith, and religious affiliation was not exit-polled during the 2008 or 2010 elections. Strategists in both parties, though, operate under the assumption that the Mormon share of the vote drops off sharply in Nevada's general elections, and that most of their support goes to GOP candidates. Republicans and Democrats in Nevada, including members of the church, agree that Mormon voters can no longer swing a statewide election on their own. But Republicans hope that in a tight election -- as the presidential race is expected to be in Nevada and the small number of states that will decide the election -- even the slightest uptick in Mormon turnout with Romney on top of the ticket could provide an edge. ""It's going to be a close state, so whatever difference you can make up somewhere is going to be very important,"" said Danny Tarkanian, the Republican candidate in Nevada's 4th Congressional District. Most of Nevada's Mormons live in and around Clark County, the most populous in the state. They are also prevalent in rural communities in the southern part of the state and in the east along the Utah border, precincts that usually vote Republican. Mormons register and vote at higher rates . Former Nevada Gov. Bob List, a Republican, said Mormons tend to register to vote and participate in elections at higher rates than other demographic groups, usually to the GOP's benefit. ""There are Mormon Democrats, Harry Reid being Exhibit A, but of those who are LDS, most tend to be Republicans, and they are quite cohesive in their voting patterns,"" List said. ""They always have a significant turnout compared to the voting public, giving them an additional piece of power and influence. They are a force, and I think they will be very helpful to Gov. Romney in the end."" Political observers here are quick to point out that the economy -- not faith, gender or race -- is the central issue for Nevada voters, as it is in other key states. Nevada's unemployment rate is 11.6%, the nation's highest. The foreclosure crisis devastated suburban communities in the state, and Democrats have eagerly seized on Romney's interview with the Las Vegas Review Journal last October, when he said he preferred to let the housing market ""run its course and hit bottom"" instead of intervening to help homeowners. But few here expect external factors to dampen Romney's support among Mormon voters. There are also a number of Mormon candidates running for office this year up and down the ballot, which may spur church members to show up in greater numbers come November. Sen. Dean Heller, whose re-election fight against Democratic Rep. Shelley Berkley is among the most closely watched Senate races in the country, is a member of the church. There are also five competitive state Senate races that could decide which party controls the upper body of the legislature in Carson City. In four of those races, the Republican candidates are LDS. Romney campaign aides, notoriously guarded when discussing their candidate's faith, say they are not approaching Mormon voters differently than anyone else. ""Nevada has been disproportionately hurt by President Obama's policies,"" said Ryan Erwin, Romney's top adviser in the state. ""Regardless of your age or gender or religious affiliation or geographic location, within this state you have been touched in a negative way by some Obama policy."" Mormon backers build support for former bishop . But the official line from Romney-world isn't stopping his Mormon supporters from tapping into their own ready-made church networks -- which are organized locally into wards, stakes or branches -- to build support for the former Massachusetts governor, who was once a bishop in Boston suburb of Belmont. Dave Isbell, a Clark County Mormon who was active in Ron Paul's campaign but said he is nonetheless ""pretty proud"" of Romney, said several of his fellow church members are cross-checking church directories with voter registration data to identify and contact potential Romney backers. Isbell said a popular smartphone app called LDS Tools, which lists phone numbers and addresses for local stake members, has become a reliable resource for enterprising Romney volunteers doing voter outreach, despite church rules that forbid the use of LDS resources for political purposes. ""The church makes it really easy for you to get a hold of anyone in your ward,"" Isbell said. ""If you are a Romney supporter in the church, you have an opportunity to talk to everyone in your ward that already has a relationship of trust with you."" He added, ""I'm sure the campaigns and the church are saying 'you can't do that,' but people will fall on their sword for Mitt Romney and some people will justify the means."" Romney's support among Mormons may also be felt in Nevada outside the voting booth. Romney supporters traveled all the way to Iowa and South Carolina from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, to assist in the victory effort during the primaries -- and Republicans expect that to happen again this fall, particularly in the Western swing states of Nevada and Colorado. Several Nevada Republicans told CNN they are counting on a flood of Mormon volunteers from reliably red Utah and reliably blue California to travel into Nevada for the get-out-the-vote effort. One LDS member involved in election planning, who did not want to be identified revealing party strategy, said the arrival of out-of-state Mormons in Nevada ""will happen in a huge way"" this fall. Another veteran Republican operative in the state who was not authorized by his organization to speak on the record said Mormon volunteers will be a fundamental part of the Romney ground game in Nevada. ""You tell them to be there at 8 a.m., and they are there at 7:55,"" said the operative. ""Romney is their guy. They are committed.""","Nevada's rapid population growth has diluted Mormon influence on elections .

"The newest Medal of Honor recipient, former Army Staff Sgt. Ryan M. Pitts, said he wanted the nation not to remember his name, but those of the nine men who were killed in one of the fiercest fights of the war in Afghanistan. ""Valor was everywhere that day and the real heroes are the nine men who made the ultimate sacrifice so the rest of us could come home,"" Pitts told reporters in a short statement after receiving the nation's highest award for valor in combat. President Barack Obama awarded Pitts the medal on Monday in a White House ceremony, saying the former Army sergeant represented the best of America's military. Pitts, severely wounded while serving as a forward observer six years ago in a fierce battle in Afghanistan's Kunar province, is the  the ninth person to receive  for actions during wars in Afghanistan or Iraq. ""In Ryan Pitts, you see the humility and the loyalty that define America's men and women in uniform,"" Obama said. In the predawn hours of July 13, 2008, Pitts, who was wounded in one arm and both legs and near death, lobbed grenades at militants so close he could hear them talking, and he fired a machine gun at the enemy. He tossed grenade after grenade under a hail of enemy gunfire as comrades fell. He also asked other soldiers to fire at his position to prevent the enemy from gaining ground, according to the Army's account of events. By the time fellow soldiers reached his position, Pitts was bleeding profusely yet firing furiously as he struggled to defend his post. ""It just seemed like the only option,"" Pitts told CNN before the ceremony. ""Stay and fight. For whatever reason."" Nine soldiers died in the battle. Pitts read their names: Spc. Sergio Abad, Cpl. Jonathan Ayers, Cpl. Jason Bogar, 1st Lt. Jonathan Brostrom, Sgt. Israel Garcia, Cpl. Jason Hovater, Cpl. Matthew Phillips, Cpl. Pruitt Rainey, and Cpl. Gunnar Zwilling. ""Thank you, chosen few,"" he said. Twenty-seven others were injured. The chaotic Battle of Wanat was later the subject of a military investigation. The President paid tribute those who died, mentioning them by name. ""It is remarkable that we have young men and women serving in our military who day in and day out are able to perform with so much integrity, so much humility and so much courage,"" Obama said. ""Ryan represents the very best of that tradition. And we are very, very proud of him."" Marine who took grenade blast for comrade receives Medal of Honor . Pitts has since retired from the military and lives in Nashua, New Hampshire, where he works for the computer software industry and is the father of a 1-year-old son. Monday was his second wedding anniversary. For Pitts, who has ""always wanted to serve"" since age 17, the award also recognizes the efforts of his fallen comrades. ""They were incredible soldiers. I mean they were warriors that day,"" Pitts said. ""But they were also great people."" He remembers how Zwilling, Phillips and Rainey all ""loved to play poker."" ""They were all pretty good at it. Rainey was probably the best. He had won quite a bit of money playing poker in Afghanistan."" Bogar ""was very introspective and reflective on our time there. Probably more so than the rest of us,"" he recalled. Abad was deployed before he could wed so ""he married his wife over the phone in Afghanistan."" Brostrom was a father who loved to surf and who adored his alma mater, the University of Hawaii, he said. Hovater ""was probably the funniest guy in the platoon. Great sense of humor. He'd make fun of himself just as much as he'd make fun of anybody else. Nobody was safe,"" Pitts said. ""We were like family,"" he said. Garcia ""loved his wife, his family. He was a happy guy. A very infectious smile."" Pitts remembers holding Garcia's hand as he died and promising him that he would tell his wife and mother that he loved them. ""There wasn't a whole lot that I could do for him, so I just held his hand and -- I couldn't tell you much of what we talked about or even if we talked that much. I just know that he told me to tell his wife and mom that he loved them,"" Pitts said. After his deployment, Pitts kept his promise. ""I went back to Italy and his mom -- Mary Cruz and his wife, Leslie, (were) there. So I was able to sit down -- (Spc. Michael Denton) came with me. We were both able to sit down and told them."" Pitts said he wouldn't do anything differently because a brotherhood was forged through battle. ""The term brother is the best to describe our relationship -- but it almost ... seems to fall short of, you know, how we feel about each other and the people I've met,"" he said clearing his throat. ""The impact they had on my life -- personally and professionally, the experiences that I went through with them -- I wouldn't trade anything for it.""

"To be a politician today is to live in some ways like a citizen of North Korea. A politician must assume that he or she is under 24-hour audio-visual surveillance. Any objectionable remark, any untoward joke, any awkward facial expression may be recorded and broadcast. Professional and personal ruin can strike at any moment. If George Allen's ""macaca"" moment didn't drive home the point, Scott Prouty's 47% video certainly should. But it's not only politicians who live under perpetual surveillance. We all do! Earlier this month, researchers at Carnegie-Mellon University detailed how Facebook systematically erodes users' privacy wishes. ""Researchers found that during the first four years, users steadily limited what personal data was visible to strangers within their school network. Yet through changes Facebook introduced to its platform in 2009 and 2010, the social network actually succeeded in reversing some users' inclination to avoid public disclosure of their data. In fact, the social network's new policies were not only able to partly override an active desire not to post personal details publicly, but they have so far kept such disclosures from sinking back to their lower levels, according to the study. They also found that even as people sought to limit what strangers could learn about them from their Facebook profiles, they actually increased what information they shared with their friends. Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg has famously said that privacy is no longer a social norm. He's worked mightily to make those words self-fulfilling, and in tandem with other technologies (smartphones) and social media (notably YouTube), Zuckerberg has succeeded. The demise of privacy as a social norm is leading to the demise of privacy as a legal right. Scott Prouty likely won't face legal sanctions for videotaping Romney. Mike Edmonson, spokesman for the Palm Beach County State Attorney, explains why not: ""For the law to be broken, the person being taped must have a reasonable expectation of privacy."" Once upon a time, a speaker might have expected that an off-the-record, closed-door speech in a private home would be ""private."" No longer. The less privacy we have, the less we have a legal right to -- and the less we have a legal right to, the less we will have. For those accustomed to older ways, this new world of compulsive and compulsory self-revelation is a strange place in which to live. Yet it could be said that we are in fact reverting to the oldest way of all. Through most of human existence, human beings had little to no privacy. For most of the past 10,000 years, most people lived in tiny farming villages, where everybody knew everything about them and about all their family. Privacy was born in the city, as E.B. White famously observed when urban life was still a new experience for most Americans. ""On any person who desires such queer prizes, New York will bestow the gift of loneliness and the gift of privacy."" It's a paradox, but also a fact: the only way to experience privacy is in the midst of a crowd. The theme song to the 1980s situation comedy ""Cheers"" celebrated an urban bar as a place where ""everybody knows your name."" Through most of human history, most people would take it for granted that the people they met would know their name -- name singular, since for most of human history, most people only needed a single name to identify themselves. When White celebrated urban anonymity in his 1949 essay, ""Here is New York,"" urbanism was still a relatively new experience for most Americans. The United States had become majority urban as recently as 1920, and then only by the U.S. Census definition of urban as a settlement of more than 2,500 persons. Will we in retrospect come to see the urban anonymity celebrated by White as a brief interval in human history? Already in 1962, the prophetic scholar of media Marshall McLuhan foresaw the coming of a ""global village"": a planet in which information spread as fast as in the farming village of yore. A Google search of the phrase reveals that most users of the phrase imagine the global village as a friendly, tranquil place. McLuhan knew better. The old village was a place in which conflict could never be escaped, in which the public and the private could never be separated. So it has become in the new. What happened to Mitt Romney can happen to anyone who has ever said or done anything improper or stupid in the vicinity of any electronic device. It can happen to anyone who has ever sent an e-mail that might cause offense to a third party. It can happen to anyone who has ever posted a later-regretted photo or video online. Granted, most of us are protected somewhat by others' lack of interest in our secrets. But that can change in an instant if our oafish behavior is oafish enough. A few seconds of oafish video can generate a lifetime of humiliation -- that will torture the humiliated person long after it has ceased to amuse the people who once laughed at him.

"Masked men with metal rods and Molotov cocktails prowl the Russian flag-draped balcony, surveying the crowds below. Stacks of tires topped with ribbons of razor wire line a makeshift barricade around the main entrance. Two days after smashing their way in, hundreds of protesters have transformed this government building in the industrial city of Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, into the self-declared ""People's Republic of Donetsk."" From the clumsily erected bulwarks to the lack of a leader or concrete plan, the scenes are similar to the pro-European rallies in Kiev's Maidan Square in recent months, with one major difference: Many of these protesters say they want to join Russia and have called for a referendum on secession from Ukraine to be held by May 11. The protesters who let us into the building are eager to show they are here entirely peacefully, but it is clear they are prepared for a fight. Doors have been locked and stairwells blocked at the top of the building to prevent the Ukrainian military from storming in from above. They've smashed the pavement outside the building to use as stones. A makeshift hospital and temporary cafe have been constructed, and locals are keeping the men and women inside stocked up on food and medical supplies. Some of the protesters inside the building are happy to see us; others seem ready to attack us with their bats at a moment's notice. Some are aggressively anti-American. One of the older men asks us why Americans are sticking their nose into Ukrainian affairs. Russia warns of civil war if Ukraine uses force to quell eastern revolts .

Others are hopeful that a vote to secede from Ukraine can be held sooner than protesters announced Monday. When the power went out Monday night, many inside believed Ukraine's special forces were coming to retake the building. But the Ukrainian military is nowhere to be seen, and the mood of the protesters is growing ever more defiant. Donetsk is the hometown of ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, whose pro-Russian government was toppled in a popular revolt in February. Nobody knows for sure what role, if any, Russia is playing in this latest bout of unrest in Ukraine. Acting Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov blames ""separatist groups coordinated by Russian special services"" for the revolts in eastern Ukraine, which he said echoed events leading to the Russian annexation of Crimea three weeks ago. Since then, Russia has amassed thousands of troops on its border with eastern Ukraine. And Russia's Foreign Ministry said reports that protesters are facing a crackdown by Ukrainian authorities are of particular concern. ""We are calling for the immediate cessation of any military preparations, which could lead to civil war,"" it said in a statement on its official website. Protesters say that local complaints, not Moscow, are driving anti-government sentiments here in Donetsk. One man, who calls himself Andre, says that Ukraine's ongoing political crisis has hit his wages and that he can no longer afford to feed his family. He tells me that he has simply had enough. Ukrainian officials say they won't storm the building for now. But the acting President says those who have seized buildings will be treated as ""terrorists"" and prosecuted with the full force of the law. In the meantime, protesters say they will continue to fortify their makeshift fortress in Donetsk, and their tiny pocket of grievances and whims, despite its size, seems to now be on the front line of a massive struggle for the future of Ukraine.

"Arizona spent two hours killing death row inmate Joseph Wood  this week, an unusually long time for an execution. Wood's death has reopened the debate about capital punishment and lethal injection. Lethal injection is used in all 32 states that have the death penalty. Some witnesses said Wood was gasping for breath and seemed to be in pain. Others said he was simply snoring. The state of Arizona said Wood didn't suffer. Either way, there are renewed concerns that executions, which are supposed to be quick and painless, are neither. Typically executions are performed using three drugs in stages. The first drug is an anesthetic. The second drug is called a paralytic and the third drug is supposed to stop the heart. For years, executioners used a drug called sodium thiopental as the first drug, the anesthetic, until the only U.S. producer of the drug stopped making it. Then the United States turned to European manufacturers, but they refused to sell the drug for use in executions. Since sodium thiopental was taken off the market for executions, states have turned to a drug called midazolam for the anesthetic. But experts believe there have been problems with the drug in at least three executions. The problems described by witnesses included gasping, snorting or choking sounds and, in one execution, the inmate was described as speaking. Wood was injected with midazolam on Wednesday, as well as hydromorphone, a narcotic painkiller that, with an overdose, halts breathing and stops the heart from beating. It is one of the new combinations that states have tried, with some controversial results. What would qualify as a botched execution? Michael Radelet, a professor of sociology and law, said an execution is botched when it looks like the inmate endured ""prolonged suffering"" for 20 minutes or more. Whether they're ""botched"" or not, plenty of executions don't go by the book. Most of the executions listed here were compiled by Human Rights Watch. Dennis McGuire, executed January 16, 2014, in Ohio. Columbus Dispatch reporter Alan Johnson said the execution process took 24 minutes, and that McGuire appeared to be gasping for air for 10 to 13 minutes. He had been injected with midazolam and hydromorphone, a two-drug combination that hadn't been used before in the United States. McGuire, 53, was convicted in 1994 in the rape and murder of a 22-year-old pregnant woman. Clayton Lockett, executed April 29, 2014, in Oklahoma. Lockett was injected with midazolam, but instead of becoming unconscious, he twitched, convulsed and spoke. The execution was halted, but Lockett died after 43 minutes. A team that prepared Lockett for execution failed to set a properly functioning IV in his leg, according to preliminary findings of an independent autopsy. Lockett was convicted in the 1999 death of an Oklahoma woman who was buried alive after she was raped and shot. Jose High, executed November 7, 2001, in Georgia. This execution illustrates a common problem. The execution team had trouble finding a usable vein and spent 39 minutes looking before finally sticking a needle into High's hand. A second needle was inserted between his neck and shoulder by a physician. Sixty-nine minutes after the execution began, he was pronounced dead. High was convicted in a 1976 store robbery and the kidnapping and murder of an 11-year-old boy. Claude Jones, executed December 7, 2000, in Texas. The execution team spent 30 minutes looking for a suitable vein, a difficult task because of Jones' history of drug abuse. He was convicted in the 1990 murder of a liquor store owner. Joseph Cannon, executed April 23, 1998, in Texas.  The needle popped out and Cannon said to witnesses, ""It's come undone."" The needle was reinserted and 15 minutes later a weeping Cannon made his second final statement. He was convicted of murder. John Wayne Gacy, executed May 10, 1994,  in Illinois. Lethal chemicals solidified and clogged in the IV tube leading to Gacy's arm. A new tube was installed and  the execution proceeded. Gacy, one of America's most notorious killers, was convicted in 1980 of raping and killing 33 boys and young men he lured into his home. Charles Walker, executed September 12, 1990, in Illinois. The execution was prolonged because a kink in the plastic tubing stopped the flow of chemicals into Walker's body and an intravenous needle pointed at Walker's fingers, instead of his heart, said a Missouri State Prison engineer hired to assist in the execution. Walker was convicted of two counts of murder. Raymond Landry, executed December 13, 1988, in Texas. The catheter dislodged and flew through the air two minutes after injection of drugs into Landry's body. The execution team spent 14 minutes inserting it again and Landry was pronounced dead 40 minutes after being strapped to the gurney. He had been convicted of murder.","Prolonged death of Arizona inmate sparks renewed concerns about capital punishment .

"When I was at CIA or NSA, my public affairs staff would sometimes enlist me to intervene with an editor to stop the publication of what we viewed to be classified information. I would invariably begin the conversation with the journalist by pointing out that I knew that, ""We both have a job to do protect American security and liberty, but how you're about to do yours is going to make it harder for me to do mine."" That introduction reflected my true feelings, so—like most Americans—I am conflicted about the current row over protecting press freedom and protecting national secrets. Let me be clear.  The two prominent cases being debated were indeed serious leaks, because they touched upon sources, not just information. In the case of the Associated Press report on a Yemen-based bomb plot, the source had apparently penetrated an al Qaeda network and there were hopes that he could continue to be exploited. In the Fox News report on North Korea's intention to test a nuclear weapon, James Rosen told us not just that the United States judged that Pyongyang would respond to impending sanctions with a test.  He pointedly added that a source in North Korea had told us so. These kinds of stories get people killed.  While at CIA I recounted to a group of news bureau chiefs that, when an agency presence in a denied area had been revealed in the media, two assets had been detained and executed.  The CIA site there wrote: ""Regret that we cannot address this loss of life with the person who decided to leak our mission to the newspapers."" And, since the Yemen source appears to have actually been recruited by a liaison partner, the impact of a leak goes far beyond our own service.  In that same talk with bureau chiefs, I pointed out that several years before 9/11, one chief of station reported that a press leak of liaison intelligence had ""put us out of the (Osama) bin Laden reporting business"". In both stories, investigations were in order.  Journalists, of all people, should understand the need to protect sources and relationships. But the investigations have been very aggressive and the acquisition of journalists' communications records has been broad, invasive, secret and—one suspects—unnecessary. A quick survey of former Bush administration colleagues confirmed my belief that a proposal to sweep up a trove of AP phone records or James Rosen's e-mails would have had a half-life of about 30 seconds in that administration.  And, although Rosen seems to have worked his source with tradecraft and elicitation techniques more reminiscent of a case officer than a press conference, charges of co-conspiracy and flight risk are quite a stretch. If this had been a Predator strike rather than an investigation, we would have judged the target (leaks and leakers) to have been legitimate, but the collateral damage (squeezing the First Amendment and chilling legitimate press activity) to have been prohibitive. Which brings me back to being conflicted and to a sense of resignation that this legitimate free press-legitimate government secrets thing is a condition we will have to manage, not a problem that we will solve. When the press decides to publish something that the government considers classified, it is assuming for itself an inherently governmental function.  And as David Ignatius once pointed out, ""We journalists usually try to argue that we have carefully weighed the pros and cons and believe that the public benefit of disclosure outweighs any potential harm.  The problem is that we aren't fully qualified to make those judgments."" True enough, but no one who has served in government would claim that the public release of every document marked with a classification stamp would actually harm American security.  Over-classification is common. Government confuses things further with controlled releases of formerly classified data for both policy and political reasons.  So many anonymous government officials have commented on drones and targeted killings in recent years that I told a Senate committee last summer that I simply did not know what of my personal knowledge of those programs I could or could not publicly discuss. If there exists a body of information that can fairly be labeled ""publicly known but still officially classified,"" the protection of truly secret data will be eroded.  When lines are not bright, it is more likely that even well intentioned people will end up on the wrong side of them. The problem promises to get harder, not easier.  While at CIA I asked my civilian advisory board to consider whether America would be able to conduct espionage in the future within a political culture that seemed to every day demand more transparency and more public accountability from every aspect of national life.  They weren't optimistic. Beyond this cultural trend, modern technology arms inquisitive journalists with powerful tools to gather and link disparate data, to turn what were once globally dispersed shards of glass into revealing mosaics.  Many things intended to be secret, like the airlift of Croatian weapons to Syria, simply don't stay that way. So, how do we limit the damage?  Well, journalists will have to expand the kind of sensitivities to the national welfare that some already show.  In those calls I made to slow, scotch or amend a pending story, most on the other end of the line were open to reasonable arguments.  In one case a writer willingly changed a reference that had read ""based on intercepts"" to ""based on intelligence reports,"" somewhat amazed that that change made much of a difference. (It did.) The government may also want to adjust its approach to enforcement.  The current tsunami of leak prosecutions is based largely on the Espionage Act, a blunt World War I statute designed to punish aiding the enemy.  It's sometimes a tough fit.  The leak case against former National Security Agency employee Thomas Drake collapsed of its own overreach in 2011. Perhaps in many of these cases the best approach is not through the courts or the Department of Justice.  Intelligence agency heads should be urged to make fuller use of their administrative authorities to suspend or dismiss employees or to lift clearances—actions with a lower threshold than criminal prosecutions but whose promptness, frequency and certainty could still deter many unauthorized disclosures. Finally, we should (belatedly) admit that there is some common ground here.  Intelligence agencies often act on the edges of executive prerogative and move forward based on a narrow base of lawfulness and limited congressional notification—and these are often sufficient to underpin a one-off covert action. But democracies don't get to do anything repeatedly over a long period (like drone strikes and targeted killings) without political support—and political support is the end point of a process that begins with informed debate.  Informed debate depends on information, the kind that most journalists seek. We cannot make public the nation's legitimate secrets, but Americans need a broad outline of what is being done on their behalf.  Ironically, the public dialogue generated by a free press may be one of the best guarantors that the Republic will, in the future, be able to act boldly (and occasionally secretly) in its own defense.","Ex-CIA director Hayden says the AP, Fox leaks were serious, and related to sources of intelligence .

"(CNN)""Birdman"" soared late at the 87th Academy Awards, winning the big prize: best picture. The film, about a onetime superhero actor -- played by Michael Keaton -- making a comeback bid through a Broadway play, was filled with unusual touches: filmed as if all one shot, scored with a jazzy-drum soundtrack, shaded with magical realism, largely the vision of director and co-writer Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu. ""This guy is as bold as bold could be,"" Keaton said of the director as he took a turn at the microphone during the best picture acceptance. The film won three other honors: directing, cinematography -- the second straight Oscar for cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, who won last year for ""Gravity"" -- and original screenplay. Iñarritu is the second Mexican director to win in two years, after ""Gravity's"" Alfonso Cuaron. ""Two Mexicans in a row, that's suspicious,"" Iñarritu joked. Full list of winners . ""Birdman"" had appeared to take the lead in the Oscar race in recent weeks, cementing its front-runner status with wins at the Producers Guild and the Independent Spirit Awards. Its main competition was ""Boyhood,"" a chronicle of a youth's life shot over 12 years by director Richard Linklater. ""Boyhood"" ended up with one Oscar, for best supporting actress. Activist messages . Indeed, the Oscars were pretty much as the handicappers predicted. Eddie Redmayne won best actor for his performance as the ALS-afflicted scientist Stephen Hawking in ""The Theory of Everything."" Julianne Moore won best actress for her performance as a professor suffering from early-onset Alzheimer's in ""Still Alice."" ""Boyhood's"" Patricia Arquette won best supporting actress -- and made sure that her award was a call for equality. ""We have fought for everybody else's equal rights. It's our time to have wage equality once and for all. And equal rights for women in the United Stares of America,"" she said, to rousing applause. Her activist message also resonated online. Also resonating was a stirring speech by Common and John Legend, who won best song for ""Glory."" Their performance of the song brought the film's star David Oyelowo to tears. 'Call your mom; call your dad' The best supporting actor Oscar went to J.K. Simmons of ""Whiplash."" The longtime character actor -- known to audiences for his roles in Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" films as J.Jonah Jameson, the TV show ""The Closer"" and ads for Farmers Insurance and M&Ms, among many others -- paid tribute to his family in his speech, praising his wife and his ""above-average"" children. He also put in a plug for actual phone calls. ""Call your mom; call your dad; don't text; don't email; tell them you love them,"" he said. Host Neil Patrick Harris tweaked him by humming the Farmers theme as Simmons left the stage. ""Whiplash"" won three Oscars, winning sound mixing and film editing along with supporting actor. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" tied ""Birdman"" with four Oscars: for score, production design, costume design and makeup. ""Big Hero 6"" won best animated feature. ""Citizenfour"" won best documentary feature. Director Laura Poitras thanked the film's subject, Edward Snowden, the NSA contractor who leaked classified files and earned the ire of the government. An attempt at a pun from Harris -- Snowden couldn't be at the Oscars ""for some treason"" -- got immediate pushback online. ""The Imitation Game"" won adapted screenplay. ""Ida"" won best foreign language film. NPH leads with jokes . The Oscars -- the ""epicenter of noise and world attention,"" as ""Ida"" director Pawel Pawlikowski called them -- wasted no time in poking fun at some of the big issues facing Hollywood: diversity, economics and self-involvement. Harris led off the show with a joke about the lack of diversity among the acting nominees. ""This year we honor Hollywood's best and whitest -- sorry, brightest,"" he joked. Then, in a mammoth opening number, he and Anna Kendrick were joined by Jack Black, who angrily hopped on stage to throw a sarcastic wet blanket over their hailing of ""Moving Pictures,"" noting that the business is as much about ""raising tents with tentpoles and chasing Chinese bucks"" than it is about art. He was summarily dismissed by Harris. The host also wandered into the audience, greeting two seat fillers among the celebrities, and at one point parodied ""Birdman"" by walking through the backstage area in his underwear -- right onto the stage. #AskHerMore . Some unexpected rain didn't dampen the spirits of the celebrities arriving for Hollywood's biggest night. However, there was little burst of color this year among the red-carpet walkers. Instead, there were lots of whites, blacks, silvers and grays. Lady Gaga added some red with what appeared to be exaggerated dishwashing gloves. HLN: Live Oscar blog! Arquette decided to split the difference between black and white, with her gown consisting of a white top and black skirt. So did comedian Kevin Hart, who was wearing a tuxedo featuring a white jacket with black lapels, along with a black shirt, black tie and white pants. ""When you're on the red carpet, you might as well pop,"" he told CNN. However, the Twitter hashtag #AskHerMore was encouraging interviewers to ask celebrities more than just ""Who are you wearing?"" One wonders what the late Joan Rivers would have thought of that. Rivers was also trending, however, for being left out of the ""In Memoriam"" montage. Well, it's the Oscars.

"Since last week's Boston Marathon bombing, some people have called for placing more surveillance cameras in America's cities. This would be a mistake. It would be dangerous to our civil liberties, and it would be bad policy. I felt last week's tragic events personally -- as a parent of young children, a runner and a graduate of Bedford High School in the Boston area. And it's easy to see why those extraordinary images made us all more sensitive to the everyday possibility of danger. But the big picture is this: In a very unusual set of circumstances, two bad guys set off bombs.  They killed three people, and injured many more. The people of Boston refused to be terrorized, and they worked with the police to catch those responsible in a few short days.  Even under these extraordinary circumstances, our system worked. Bad people did bad things, but we found the suspects and we caught them. Surveillance cameras of course played a part. They probably allowed the suspects to be identified more quickly, and they will surely provide useful evidence at the surviving suspect's criminal trial. Would more cameras have meant quicker apprehension of the suspects?  There's no evidence to suggest this. And it's important to remember that there are already lots of cameras in Boston. And though some may believe that blanketing our public areas with video surveillance will make us safer, we should reject this call. First, surveillance cameras are expensive. They are costly to install and maintain, and in a time of limited budgets, they could be mistaken for an adequate substitute for human police officers on the street.  Should we trade off the cost of human police (or schools, or roads, or lower taxes) for even more robotic surveillance eyes?  I don't think so. Second, surveillance cameras don't necessarily deter serious crimes.  Boston's numerous cameras didn't stop the crime at the Boston Marathon, nor did London's more extensive network of cameras deter the 2005 subway bombings.  Boston's talented police commissioner, Edward Davis, put it best right after last Monday's events when he said that despite the city's extensive security preparations, little short of a ""police state"" could have stopped the attacks.  It is to Davis' great credit that as police commissioner he didn't want a police state. This brings me to my third point.  Surveillance cameras, or other government surveillance technologies, have costs in civil liberties as well as in money.  Surveillance cameras like we already have in Boston are like having a police officer with perfect memory on every street corner.  It might be relatively easy to say that even more video cameras would amplify that effect while posing little threat to privacy. But surveillance cameras are getting better, and it's now possible to pair them with facial recognition technology linked to state driver's license databases. When this technology matures, it'll give the police the power to monitor all of our movements in public linked to our real identities, not just to our anonymous faces. Such a system would conceivably give the government increased power over us, power that could be used not just to monitor, but in some cases, potentially, to blackmail, persuade or discriminate.  Police on every corner might be one thing, but police who can instantly see your identity papers and constantly track you are another.  We might decide we want a limited version of this system, but we need to talk about these things now, before well-meaning local governments make the decision for us. It might be difficult to hear, but we can't be perfectly safe all the time.  And part of living in a free and open society means that occasionally some people will abuse that freedom.  That's why we have a criminal justice system in which the police investigate crimes.  It's better to punish the people who abuse their freedom and harm others than to take everyone's liberties away and subject us all to the eye of the state. Less privacy, less civil liberties.  Being constantly observed might make us feel slightly safer, but this would be only an illusion of safety.  History has shown repeatedly that broad government surveillance powers inevitably get abused, whether by the Gestapo, the Stasi, or our own FBI, which engaged in unlawful surveillance (and blackmail) of ""dangerous"" people like Martin Luther King Jr. Last week's events gripped our attention because they were extraordinary.  Terror attacks, plane crashes, even school shootings stick in our head out of all proportion to the danger they pose to us as individual citizens precisely because they are extraordinary. But remember the big picture.  How many people do you know who have been the victims of terrorism?  On the other hand, how many people do you know who have suffered from cancer, or obesity, or gun violence?  If we're interested in safety, public health and gun control are much more important issues than terrorism.  They, not surveillance, should be our safety priority. We should honor last week's victims.  We should praise the Bostonians, police and private citizens, who helped find the culprits.  But we should also rest secure that our system of government is working.  We should reject, like Edward Davis did last week, any call to move further towards a police state.","Neil Richards: After Boston terror attack, some call for more surveillance. That's a bad idea .

"Victoria's Secret is synonymous with sultry femininity, and if Carmen Carrera had her way, that would include transgendered women as well. Fans have petitioned for the transgender burlesque performer and model to join the ranks of Heidi Klum, Gisele Bundchen and Miranda Kerr as Victoria's Secret's newest Angel. The Change.org petition, which calls Carrera ""a force to be reckoned with,"" says such a move by Victoria's Secret would ""show the entire community that they embrace trans patrons."" The petition has received more than 36,000 signatures, but Carrera told CNN en Español that she has yet to hear from the lingerie company. ""Trans women are a part of the female population and I think that they deserve a respectful representation,"" Carrera said. ""It would be pretty amazing for Victoria's Secret to be that huge corporation that embraces trans women. We shop there as well. I can only hope and dream, but I think it's time. And, I meet most of the requirements and have credibility as a model. They should do it."" Victoria's Secret declined to comment. Before Carrera became ""Carmen,"" she was Christopher Roman from New Jersey. She first garnered fame on Season Three of ""RuPaul's Drag Race"" on the LOGO network. She began her transition to a woman after the show wrapped, and has since been signed by Elite Model Management, appeared on ""What Would You Do?"" and in W magazine, and worked with famed photographer Steven Meisel on a film. For five seasons ""RuPaul's Drag Race"" has demystified drag queens and redefined a standard of beauty. ""RuPaul's Drag Race"" executive producer Tom Campbell told CNN, ""The first face of MAC VIVA GLAM was RuPaul, (who) was a pioneer for drag performers. Now it's Carmen Carrera's chance to break the 'beauty barrier' for trans people."" While the LGBT community has made some strides around the nation, Carrera said she still comes across many people who simply don't understand the transgender community. ""For a long time trans people have always been a joke. Our reputation has always been the bottom of the barrel and it's not fair,"" she said. Carrera confessed that her transition to a woman was both a physical and emotional uphill battle. ""I run into a lot of ignorance and stupidity,"" Carrera said. ""It gets really frustrating, but you have to take yourself out of it and realize what's happening in the bigger picture. A lot of people are still uncomfortable with this idea, I don't know why. I think most of the country and the world haven't gotten to know trans people. If you don't know me, get to know me. I'm open, honest and genuine."" ""It's difficult for people (who) don't know trans men and women to wrap their head around the whole thing,"" Campbell said. ""That's why it's so important that more trans people have a chance to tell their stories and, as is the case with Carmen, to give a face ... to the trans movement."" Model and designer Isis King was the first trans woman to compete on ""America's Next Top Model,"" and said that while the petitioners' hearts might be in the right place, the petition itself might not be the best approach. ""I don't want any special treatment because I'm trans unless there's a particular role made for it. I want my legacy to be that I was hard-working and good at what I did,"" King said, ""Should Victoria's Secret have a trans model? Sure, why not. But should they be pressured into hiring one? No, I don't think it's fair."" King isn't offended that the lingerie company doesn't have a trans model. She knows firsthand how difficult it is for any woman to land a spot in the elite group of Victoria's Secret models. ""If trans people are going to make any strides in society it shouldn't be forced, but if anyone can make it as a Victoria's Secret model it's Carmen. She's beautiful and just did a runway show with Marco Marco and was amazing,"" King said. While Carrera didn't join the Angels for the Victoria's Secret runway show in New York on November 13, she said she has the love and support from those that matter most: her family, friends and fans. ""I have an education, stepdaughter and go to PTA meetings. I live my life as a woman does in this country,"" Carrera said, ""That's what people need to know."" If Carrera ever does become an Angel, Campbell said she would bring RuPaul's trademark charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent to Victoria's Secret, and thinks she's on the right path. But, if he had to give any advice he would say, ""To quote RuPaul: I have one thing to say. You better work!"" Do you think Victoria's Secret should hire Carmen Carrera?

"If you use Google, and I know you do, you may have noticed a little banner popping up at the top of the page announcing: ""We're changing our privacy policy and terms."" It gives you the choice to ""Learn More"" or, another option, the one I'm betting most people followed, to ""Dismiss."" Who wants to read about what Google plans to do with all that information it has about us? I, too, clicked ""Dismiss."" That's because the very idea of considering what Google knows about me can give me heartburn. And if that happens, I may want to Google ""heartburn,"" and then I'll wonder if my insurance company will find out that I was searching ""heartburn,"" or, worse, that one day I will apply for a new insurance company and the side effects of having considered what Google knows will result in a denial of coverage. But I digress. When Google announced its new policy, lovingly explaining its reason as ""our desire to create one beautifully simple and intuitive experience across Google,"" the authorities in Europe immediately told the Internet leviathan to put off its March 1 start date until European Union officials had a chance to review Google's new quest for beauty and simplicity. Europeans, it turns out, are much less trusting of invasions of our electronic privacy than Americans are. Americans have an intense aversion to government intrusion. If the FBI wanted to examine Google searches, the left and the right would come together -- the ACLU, Tea Party, liberals and libertarians would raise their fists together to fight for freedom of privacy. The Supreme Court would join in, as it did in the case of GPS surveillance, and conclude the people have a right to privacy, a right against any ""unreasonable search,"" as the Constitution says. But in the case of Google's latest move to consolidate user's data, however, most Americans paid little attention. MacKinnon: We're losing control of our digital privacy . If Americans -- or people anywhere -- decided to take up Google's offer to check out its new policy, they would discover something so troubling, so frightening, really, that it would override the national tendency to leave companies alone to make money how they see fit. At least in the case of companies such as Google -- and now Facebook -- which know more about us than even our closest friends. Here's what Google knows about you, what it stores right there on its servers, waiting for a hacker: . Google has every e-mail you ever sent or received on Gmail. It has every search you ever made, the contents of every chat you ever had over Google Talk. It holds a record of every telephone conversation you had using Google Voice, it knows every Google Alert you've set up. It has your Google Calendar with all content going back as far as you've used it, including everything you've done every day since then. It knows your contact list with all the information you may have included about yourself and the people you know. It has your Picasa pictures, your news page configuration, indicating what topics you're most interested in. And so on. If you ever used Google while logged in to your account to search for a person, a symptom, a medical side effect, a political idea; if you ever gossiped using one of Google's services, all of this is on Google's servers. And thanks to the magic of Google's algorithms, it is easy to sift through the information because Google search works like a charm. Google can even track searches on your computer when you're not logged in for up to six months. Facebook has even more interesting stuff: your pictures, your comments, your likes, your friends, your un-friends. Andrew Keen: We must avoid Facebook's 'creepy' cult of transparency . You've done it, said it, clicked it, searched it, Googled it. You can never undo it or unclick it. It stays there forever. Unless the people demand that government order a stop to it. The European Commission has a new privacy proposal known as the ""Right to be forgotten."" It would allow Internet users in 27 countries of the European Union to demand Internet companies delete their personal data. Google's famous motto is ""do no evil."" I won't accuse Google of deliberately doing evil. It has done much to improve our lives. It makes no secret of the fact that it seeks to make profits, which it richly deserves.

"(CNN) -- Continental Airlines has matched Delta Air Lines' recent checked-luggage fee increase, a Continental spokeswoman says. Delta and Continental passengers paying online for checked bags will be charged $23 for the first bag and $32 for the second. Delta's online fees are rising by $8 for the first checked bag and $7 for the second. Continental's fees are rising by $5 for each bag. The new Delta rates start Tuesday and apply to tickets purchased on or after January 5. Passengers who bought tickets before that date will pay the old rates, Delta spokeswoman Susan Elliott said. Continental matched Delta's updated fees late last week, spokeswoman Mary Clark said. The increase on Continental applies to passengers who purchased tickets on or after January 9 for travel on or after January 16. Those checking in bags at the airport will shell out even more: $25 for the first bag, $35 for the second on both airlines. Some passengers -- such as first-class fliers, some frequent fliers and military personnel on deployment -- are exempt from most checked-luggage fees. Delta and Continental luggage fees now are among the highest in the industry. US Airways also charges $25 for the first checked bag and $35 for the second bag when checked in at the airport. Online, the airline charges $20 and $30 for the first and second bags. United Airlines charges $20 for the first checked bag and $30 for the second bag at the airport, and $15 and $25 online for the first and second bags, respectively. American Airlines charges $20 for the first checked bag and $30 for the second bag, both online and at the airport. Most major air carriers started adding checked-bag fees in 2008. The airlines reported collecting nearly $740 million in baggage fees in the third quarter of 2009, according to U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics. On discount carrier Southwest Airlines, the first and second checked bags are free. JetBlue offers a free first checked bag and charges $30 for the second.","Online charges for checked bags will be $23 for the first bag, $32 for the second .

"A tranquil town in North Dakota could lose its serenity if one man has his way. Paul Craig Cobb wants to transform Leith, population 24, into a community that mirrors his white supremacist views. This weekend, white supremacists and others are expected to descend on the town in a show of support for him. Cobb said he envisions Leith as a place where white nationalist banners will be flown, where white culture would be celebrated, and where minorities would not be welcome. His white power takeover would begin with getting political control over Leith. But his ambitions go way beyond this one small town. Cobb said he wants this movement to spread to other communities, other nations, even around the world, though he does not explain how he would do this. ""I don't understand why all the different other people don't say 'whitey' is pretty darn nice and clever,"" Cobb said. ""There are many organizations (in) which whites have to support other cultures... Where is the organization of people from around the world that says let's keep these white people?... They're pretty darn good, all in all."" Cobb is one of the best known white supremacists in North America, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. ""He believes whites should be separate from other races,"" said Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center. ""He's also an anti-semite, a raging anti-semite... And he's a member of the creativity religion, which is a religion that literally worships the Aryan man instead of God."" Cobb's quest to change Leith began about two years ago with the purchase of property. Leith, a quiet town where you can hear the crickets chirp and the grain elevator run, is 70 miles southwest of Bismarck. It is part of Grant County, North Dakota's third largest county by land mass at more than 1 million acres, according to its website. The communities there once buzzed with activity from nearby railroads, but all that is gone. Cobb, 61, said he picked Leith because it was beautiful and cheap. He has bought 12 plots of land for as little as $500 each. He wants like-minded people affiliated with white nationalist organizations to take up residence on his properties. ""We hate that which threatens what we love,"" he said. ""And we're being genocided in our own country. Wouldn't you? Wouldn't you be bitter about it?"" Reaction of other residents . Other residents of Leith are trying to make sense of the developments. ""It is very shocking, because I didn't ever know groups like this existed,"" said Mayor Ryan Schock, who has lived in the town his whole life. Miller Ferrie, a Leith resident for seven years, said the town's peace has been shattered. ""It saddens us, because of what they stand for,"" she said. ""If they were coming to hold a rally for Christ we would be thrilled, but what they stand for is the opposite of what we believe."" Leith's lone black resident, Bobby Harper, feels under threat. Harper's wife said she has received messages from hate groups calling for her to leave her husband and join Cobb's movement. ""It made me afraid,"" Sherill Harper said. ""If his goal is to just have only white people here, where do my husband and I go?"" Bobby Harper said he had no plans to leave, even if Cobb's supporters came in and started controlling the town. The sheriff of Grant County said he is keeping a close eye on the situation. ""I'm a firm believer that everyone has a right to believe what they want, just not the ability to force the issue on someone else,"" said Steven Bay, also a lifetime resident of Grant County. He said because Cobb has not broken the law, there is not much he can do. Bay has talked to Canadian authorities several times, because Cobb is a wanted man in Canada -- where he faces hate speech charges over a blog. ""They're not going to extradite,"" Bay said. ""It's not a crime for which they will extradite someone from the U.S. back to Canada."" Town hall meeting . This Sunday the National Socialist Movement, a white supremacist group, will hold a meeting in Leith. On its website, the group calls the gesture a show of goodwill ""as we plant the seeds of national socialism in North Dakota."" Jeff Schoep, the commander of the movement, who claims to have property in Leith, wrote an open letter to Leith's mayor announcing the group's decision to head to Leith on September 22 and 23 in a show of support for Cobb. He said Cobb's efforts are a chance to revitalize the community. Nationalist online message boards such as WhiteNations.com and Stormfront have also applauded Cobb for ""doing a great job"" and jibing critics as ""laughable."" Anti-racist activists are also expected to descend on Leith this weekend. One of this effort's organizers told the Bismarck Tribune that he and others are hoping people will join them for a peaceful show of solidarity. Meanwhile, town and county officials said they would consider extreme measures to avoid  Leith being taken over by white supremacists. Mayor Schock said he would consider dissolving the city in order to save the city. But he hopes it doesn't come to that. Meanwhile, is there anything that would persuade Cobb to depart the town? If the government decides the ""send four dozen Somali families to Leith,"" Cobb said, that would convince him to leave.","Paul Craig Cobb has been trying to turn Leith into a white nationalist community .

"DHAKA, Bangladesh (CNN)  -- More than 1,000 people have died in Bangladesh after a devastating tropical cyclone ripped through the western coast of the country, and the toll is expected to rise, a government spokesman tells CNN. Families stand amid the wreckage caused by the cyclone Friday in southern Bangladesh. As flood waters recede, aid workers say they expect to find scores more bodies when remote villages are finally reached and the counting is done. They face debris-blocked roads, no electricity and almost nonexistent communications. In addition to the dead, another 15,000 were hurt and 1,000 people were missing, according to a relief official. The government said Saturday that at least 1,000 bodies had been recovered, but news media, including a United News of Bangladesh report, put the death toll at 2,000. United News said it had reporters deployed across the cyclone region. Cyclone Sidr, with sustained winds of at least 131 mph (210 kph), made landfall Thursday night along the western coast of Bangladesh near the border with India, unleashing floodwaters. ""We still don't really know the extent of the damage. There are so many areas inaccessible,"" World Vision spokesman Vince Edwards, who is in the capital Dhaka, told CNN. Adding to the tragedy is the loss of rice crops, normally harvested in December, Edwards said. In Dhaka -- about 200 miles north of the worst-hit region -- there were power outages, massive traffic jams and spotty phone service, CNN's Cal Perry said from the city. ""From an infrastructure perspective, the country absolutely has been brought to its knees,"" he said. Areas along the coast received the brunt of the storm, which made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane. The worst-hit districts were Patuakhali, Barguna and Jhalakathi. Sixty percent to 70 percent of homes in those areas were destroyed, according to local officials.  See victims pick up the pieces after the storm » . Nabiha Chowdhury, spokeswoman for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said 150 fishing boats were missing. The fishermen may have been caught in the storm and were unable to return to land, she added. Chowdhury said about 600,000 people had fled, adding about two million people lived along the coast. She said the latest number of people injured was 15,000 with 1,000 missing. Sidr had weakened significantly by the time it reached eastern India Friday night -- but the hard-hit areas could flood again late in the weekend, a forecaster said. The storm was moving northeast, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. ""It's now a rainmaker, snowmaker,"" as it moves to higher elevations, and winds have dropped to 35 mph to 50 mph -- below hurricane strength -- according to CNN meteorologist Kevin Corriveau. Forecasters predicted dry, clear weather with no wind in Bangladesh over the next two days, but Bangladesh was not entirely safe, Corriveau added. He said it's possible rainfall from mountains will swell rivers, and by Sunday night or Monday the surge could reach already flooded locations in Bangladesh. ""It's hard to say how much. They've flooded once and could be flooded again,"" Corriveau said. He said the storm sped up as it approached shore and reached land before forecasters had predicted it would. As it crossed over land, it began to weaken but still brought torrential rainfall and floods to the low-lying areas. Sidr's powerful winds and lashing rain uprooted trees, leveled homes and even damaged buildings where residents sought shelter. Video footage from the height of the storm showed high, rolling waves along the coastal areas and winds blowing so hard palm trees were flattened. Video footage shot from a helicopter Friday showed villages flattened and large numbers of people without shelter. The U.N. World Food Programme announced it has enough high-energy biscuits to feed 400,000 people for three days. Members of the Bangladesh army and navy were trying to help.  Watch how the cyclone spawns a large relief effort » . U.S. military officials said Friday that Defense Secretary Robert Gates was ready to dispatch Navy vessels carrying 3,500 Marines to the region to help in recovery efforts. It is expected that the USS Kearsarge and USS Wasp would move from the Gulf of Oman. The USS Tarawa recently left Hawaii, and it could go to Bangladesh as well, officials said. The U.S. Department of State issued a written statement Friday pledging ""to work with the government and foreign donors to assist in relieving the effects of the disaster."" Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the U.S. Mission in Bangladesh, anticipating the storm, pre-positioned 16 Zodiac boats, water treatment systems, water ambulances and food for a more rapid response. Bangladesh has a long history with deadly cyclones. In 1991, a devastating cyclone killed at least 140,000 people, according to the United Nations. And in 1970, Cyclone Bhola struck Bangladesh -- then East Pakistan -- killing 500,000 people. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration considers that storm to be the 20th century's ""greatest tropical system disaster."" While the storm was one of the worst in the last hundred years to hit the country, improved warning systems and shelters have kept the number of deaths far lower than the disastrous cyclones of 1970 and 1991, when the death tolls were in the hundreds of thousands.

"(CNN) -- Barack Obama touched hearts during an impassioned speech to a 200,000-strong crowd in Berlin, German newspapers agreed, but suspicions remain about the White House contender's motives for courting a European audience. Barack Obama addressed a huge and friendly crowd in Berlin on Thursday. Berlin's Der Tagesspiegel wondered whether so many young people had ever gathered for a political event in Germany and said that Obama's address -- which echoed speeches by former U.S. presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan when the divided city was in the Cold War frontline -- could only have been made in the German capital. ""Barack Obama's address might not have been statesmanlike and it definitely wasn't worldly-wise. But with its symbolism and the message of this 46-year-old, it certainly was the signal of a new era for a new generation on both sides of the Atlantic,"" the newspaper said. ""What better thing could have happened to us than the potential next president of the U.S. sending this message to the world from here?"" Obama moved on from Germany to France on Friday where he was due to hold talks with President Nicolas Sarkozy. He is also slated to meet British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and opposition leader David Cameron in London later Friday. German tabloid Bild said Obama had articulated his version of the American dream -- the idea that politics can change the world: ""Unlike George W. Bush, he wants to do this in cooperation with others, especially Europe. That's his message from Berlin: Let's try this together!"" But Bild warned that an Obama presidency would place fresh demands on traditional allies such as Germany, which fell out with Washington over the war in Iraq and has refused to contribute combat troops to NATO operations in Afghanistan. iReport.com: View photos from the scene . ""He didn't say what he expects, but it's not hard to figure it out. He'll call for more German participation during international crises; he'll call for more German soldiers,"" said Bild. But it concluded: ""No matter how you might feel about this: A President Obama would be Germany's friend -- and a fan of Berlin!"" Munich's Sueddeutsche Zeitung sounded a more cautious note, warning that an Obama presidency would be ""expensive for Germany."" ""He explicitly called for German soldiers for Afghanistan -- he did not say 'more soldiers' but that was what he meant,"" said commentator Reymer Kluever. ""And Obama also indicated this: he will want support as president to wind up the Iraq adventure."" The paper noted too that the speech had been intended less for the crowds gathered in Berlin's Tiergarten park than for ""hesitant white voters in Ohio and Pennsylvania, Colorado and Virginia"" and said that Obama had proved himself to be a clever tactician, capable of shifting positions to suit his audience. ""He wants to convince (voters) that the world will also listen to a black president... And there's one other thing one shouldn't forget when talking about Obama: He easily reworks even positions that have been written in stone and adjusts to new requirements."" But nobody in the German press appears to have been quite as smitten by their visitor as Bild reporter Judith Bonesky, who had the opportunity to work out with Obama in the gym of the Ritz Carlton Hotel earlier in the day. ""Obama (with toned arms and a strong back) puts on his headphones for his iPod to listen to pop music. He hums quietly. Then he jumps on a fitness bike. He pushes three times on the pedals -- but then can't be bothered with it. ""He picks up a pair of 16 kilo weights and starts curling them with his left and right arms, 30 repetitions on each side. Then, amazingly, he picks up the 32 kilo weights! Very slowly he lifts them, first 10 curls with his right, then 10 with his left. Quickly I ask: ""Mr. Obama, could I take a photo?"". ""Of course!"" he answers, before asking my name and coming over to stand next to me. ""My name's Judith"" I reply. ""I'm Barack Obama, nice to meet you!"" he says, and puts his arm across my shoulder. I put my arm around his hip -- wow, he didn't even sweat! WHAT A MAN!""","German papers agree that Barack Obama won hearts with Berlin speech .

"(CNN) -- Estudiantes de La Plata shocked Brazilian home side Cruzeiro on Wednesday to capture South American club football's greatest prize, the Copa Libertadores. Juan Sebastian Veron is showered in confetti in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, as he hoists the Copa trophy. The 2-1 aggregate win by Estudiantes marked the first Copa trophy claimed by the Argentinean team in 39 years, as they came from behind in a tense match that saw all goals scored in the second half. The teams played to a scoreless draw in last week's first-leg game in Argentina. Cruzeiro's Henrique scored the game's first goal in the 52nd minute, striking a long-range shot that deflected off Estudiantes defender Leandro Desabato, according to Goal.com. But five minutes later Gaston Fernandez tied the score from short range, giving the Argentinean team the edge on away-goals. Boselli headed in a corner from captain Juan Sebastian Veron in the 78th minute to seal the Copa trophy. The Copa final this year marked the first time for Estudiantes to reach the championship round in 39 years. The small club won the Copa Libertadores for three consecutive years,1968-1970. This year also marked the 50th birthday of the Copa Libertadores, South American football's equivalent of Europe's Champions League. The Libertadores is the most prestigious tournament in South American club football, seeing the best 32 teams in the continent battle for supremacy. For years it was dominated by Argentina, with a team from the country making it to every final between 1963 to 1979, and Buenos Aires team Independiente winning six times in that period. Since the early 1990s, it's been the Brazilian clubs that have excelled. Brazil has provided 10 Libertadores finalists in the last 10 years, but since the tournament's inception, every country except Peru and Mexico has supplied a winner.","Estudiantes defeats Cruzeiro to claim Copa Libertadores trophy .

"The son of U.S.-born militant cleric Anwar Al-Awlaki was among those killed in a trio of drone attacks in southern Yemen on Friday night, a security official said. The attacks, carried out in the Shabwa district, killed seven suspected militants, the defense ministry said. It would not confirm that Abdul Rahman Anwar Awlaki was among them. The senior security official in Shabwa, who did not want to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media, said the younger Awlaki had been hiding in the mountains of Shabwa for more than eight months. He had first-hand knowledge of the death, he said. The Awlaki family did not want to comment. On September 30, a U.S. drone strike killed Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born miltant cleric who was a key leader of the terrorist group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). President Barack Obama hailed that death as a ""major blow"" for the terror group.

"The man who dared to boldly go where no one had gone before has revealed that he can't go as many places as he used to. ""I'm doing OK,"" Leonard Nimoy tweeted Friday. ""Just can't walk distances. Love my life, family, friends and followers."" Nimoy announced last week that he has been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease -- 30 years after having given up cigarettes. ""Not soon enough,"" tweeted the 82-year-old actor and director who played Spock, the half-human science officer aboard the Starship Enterprise from 1966 to 1969 on the TV series ""Star Trek"" and in movies during the decades since. ""I have COPD. Grandpa says, quit now!!! LLAP."" The last reference is to his signature phrase, ""Live long and prosper."" Nimoy, who told an interviewer last year that he flunked chemistry in high school, may not have grasped the long-term risks associated with smoking, but his announcement is not surprising, said Dr. Richard Casaburi, a pulmonologist at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute in Torrance, California. Smoking could very well be responsible for the appearance of symptoms of COPD decades after quitting, because it is a progressive disease and lung function declines with age, said Casaburi, who is not involved with Nimoy's treatment. COPD is the third-leading cause of death in the United States -- after heart disease and cancer -- and smoking is responsible for the vast majority of cases, he said. Some 12 million people in the United States have been diagnosed with the disease, and perhaps another 12 million have it, but don't know, he said, adding that about 30% of people who smoke will get clinically significant COPD. ""The mystery really is why everybody doesn't get it."" Initial symptoms can include cough, sputum production and shortness of breath, especially on exertion, which limits their activity. But medications typically can ease the symptoms, he said. ""It's a disease of the older person, but the damage is started when they're young."" Though smoking rates have declined in the United States in recent years, COPD takes years to develop, so the incidence is rising, said the 66-year-old doctor. ""We're now seeing the results of people my age who started smoking in the 1960s and now are reaping the consequences."" He predicted the incidence will decline sharply over the next 20 to 30 years. More severe symptoms can require oxygen therapy and may lead to pneumonia and heart failure, said Dr. Norman Edelman, senior medical consultant to the American Lung Association. He praised Nimoy for his announcement and his admonition to stay away from tobacco. ""We're delighted,"" Edelman said in a telephone interview. ""The more people speak out, the more ammunition we have to fight -- for not only smoking cessation but for research that will lead to better treatment of COPD."" Funding has been limited by the belief among some that patients have only themselves to blame, a point of view that is unfair, he said. ""These people deserve the best treatment that we can provide,"" he said, adding that most smokers take up the habit before they are adults. But Nimoy's illness has not interfered with his goal of living long and prospering. In 2010, life expectancy at birth for someone born in the United States reached 78.7, and Nimoy, who is 82, appears to be continuing to prosper, too. ""Just taped my comments for Star Trek Fest to be aired on EPIX Feb. 16th,"" he wrote. ""Still enjoying my life. LLAP.""","At 82, Leonard Nimoy reveals he has lung disease -- 30 years after quitting smoking .

"Officials temporarily locked down the White House late Tuesday afternoon after a man followed a motorcade into a secure area of the heavily guarded complex, authorities said. Around 4:40 p.m., the driver entered the restricted area, behind a motorcade that included President Barack Obama's two daughters, who go to school nearby, according to a source familiar with the incident. Obama was inside the White House at the time, with his schedule indicating he was meeting with Secretary of State John Kerry. The driver was stopped by uniformed officers at the outer perimeter of a checkpoint at 17th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue and taken into custody, according to a U.S. Secret Service spokesperson. The Secret Service later identified the 55-year-old man as Mathew Evan Goldstein, who was charged with unlawful entry. The source familiar with the incident said the driver holds a pass for the U.S. Treasury building, which sits next to the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue. About one hour after it began, journalists inside the White House were told the lockdown had been lifted. Video from the scene showed a gray Honda Civic with its doors, hood and trunk opened as authorities looked in and around it. Due to tight security at the home of the President, even minor breaches can bring a lockdown. In February, for instance, there was a lockdown after a man tried to jump the White House fence. Authorities gave an all-clear after checking his briefcase and taking him into custody. A more intense situation occurred last October, when a woman drove a black Infiniti with her 1-year-old child inside into a security barrier and Secret Service officer near the White House. Police pursued her through some of Washington's most famous streets until she was shot and killed by police near the U.S. Capitol; her child was unharmed and taken into protective custody.","Secret Service identifies the driver as Mathew Evan Goldstein .

"Thinking about picking up a Wii U this Sunday when it goes on sale? Already have one preordered? Maybe you're planning to brave the lines in hopes of lucking out? It's not too late to change your mind, one way or the other. I've had a Wii U for the past week, and while I'm not allowed to tell you what I think about the system overall until Sunday, I've pulled together a list of points worth considering before you pull the trigger. It's pre-sold out, everywhere. Really. Visit the website of any major retailer that carries video games and you'll find the Wii U is either long gone or wasn't being pre-sold in the first place. The only way to guarantee a system, day one, is to purchase through an auction site like eBay or through retailers that allow third-party sales like Amazon. It's likely you'll pay dearly if you do, of course — from $400 or $500 to upwards of $3,000. You can always stand in line. Many retailers held units back to have on hand, day one, or simply didn't offer pre-sales. You'll want to check with your local stores for their launch day plans, but this is arguably the best route to nab a Wii U at launch if you didn't preorder and don't want to pay scalper prices. Nintendo says it should have plenty to go around. Not on day one, but Nintendo has publicly committed to having more Wii U units in stores during the first week than it did for the Wii six years ago, and it's doubled down on that claim by stating it'll replenish systems ""much more frequently"" during the holiday than it did for the Wii. The Wii U isn't just a Wii plus a DS. It may look like a Wii plus a DS, and it clearly shares second-screen DNA with the DS, but it's not a DS. The DS is about what you can do when you put a second screen right next to the first screen and both of those in a device that fits in your hands. The Wii U is about what you can do if you make one of the screens your TV, snap off the other, then let it wander. And it's not really possible for more than one person to play a DS, whereas multiple players (in the same room) are a key part of the Wii U experience. It's also more than just a souped up Wii. The Wii was arguably just a souped up GameCube with a motion sensor. The Wii U is much more than just a souped up Wii with a tablet controller. It still supports Wii-style motion controls, but its insides are totally different — either as or more powerful than (depending which developer you talk to) current-gen systems like the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3. It's also the first HD-capable Nintendo console in the company's history, and so far I'm finding that makes a pretty big difference for the visual artistry, say, in a game like New Super Mario Bros. U. Initial game port fidelity varies, but this tells us little. Running visual comparisons of Batman: Arkham City, I found that while it looks great on the Wii U, the Xbox 360 version's textures tend to be sharper, especially when viewing distant objects. I've also noticed significant slowdown in the Wii U version of Epic Mickey 2 (it was only added as a launch title in early October). What does that mean? It's hard to say. Arkham City is a port of a year-old game that wasn't handled by the original developer. New systems can have steep learning curves, especially when it comes to ports. So while we're probably about to be inundated with visual and performance comparisons, I don't think they'll tell us much about what the Wii U can or can't do, long term. The games only support one Wii U GamePad. The Wii U comes with just one Wii U GamePad, and Nintendo isn't selling the GamePad as a separate SKU (not yet, anyway). There's been plenty of speculation about why this is, but regardless of the real reason, you'll want to be aware that wielding the GamePad is a one-person affair (though it's still possible for up to four other local players to tap into a supported game using Wii Remotes). According to Nintendo: ""In the future, the Wii U console will support, depending on the software, two Wii U GamePad controllers."" Both the Basic and Deluxe models come with an HDMI cable. And only an HDMI cable. You'd expect the Wii U to forego Component or S-Video, but game consoles usually include a low-end composite cable (red and white for stereo audio, the yellow connector pooling the red, green and blue video signals, which causes color bleed, creating a fuzzier image). Nintendo gets credit for being first to ditch composite entirely, which is kind of historic, since the composite standard came into existence back in 1954. The $350 Deluxe model is a significantly better deal than the $300 Basic model. NintendoLand, the Wii Sports-like showcase game that comes with the Wii U, sells for $60 standalone, so that it's a pack-in with the Deluxe model justifies the extra $50 alone. But the Deluxe also includes 32 GB of internal storage (the Basic only has 8 GB, and roughly 4 GB of that is earmarked for system data), a Wii U GamePad charging cradle, a Wii U GamePad stand and a Wii U console stand. Nintendo's so clearly aiming buyers at the Deluxe model, it'll be a wonder if they sell any Basic systems at all. The Wii U is backward compatible with the Wii. I can't confirm this yet, because the system update necessary to allow the Wii U to play Wii games hasn't arrived, but Nintendo says it's a sure thing. One feature the Wii U won't offer: visual benefits, say upscaling or post-processing, as Sony did for PS1 games on the PS2 and PS2 games on the PS3. According to Nintendo: ""It's possible to play your Wii games on the Wii U, but no, we haven't announced anything about making any changes to those games in any way or changing how they would appear on the Wii U."" It has no built-in achievement or aggregate scoring system. Love or hate gamer scores and achievements? You'll either love or hate the Wii U. While developers are free to include in-game achievements, Nintendo offers no overarching mechanism for tracking games you've completed or accomplishments within. A possible upside for achievement-lovers? If you're secretly tired of the compulsive, competitive achievement grind, the Wii U offers liberation — a chance to go back to playing games for love of the games instead of an arbitrary number. Wii U games are more expensive than Wii games. Wii games sold on average for $50. Wii U games will sell on average for $60. Nintendo's just playing catchup here, so it's hard to fault the company for raising prices. Just bear in mind that the total cost of owning a Wii U over time is going to be notably higher than it was for owning a Wii. The GamePad is also a TV remote. Nintendo places a TV button right on the Wii U GamePad. Press it, and a touchscreen overlay appears, allowing you to change the channel, bring up your TV guide, turn the power on or off, or adjust the volume, all without reaching for your TV's native remote. It's a modest convenience, but a convenience nonetheless. It's exactly as mobile (or not) as Nintendo says it is. Nintendo claims the Wii U GamePad works away from the base station up to 24 feet. That sounds about right, based on my tests. Your mileage will vary depending on what's in your walls, where you put the base station, what else you're doing (wirelessly speaking), etc. But 24 feet isn't a lot of space, range-wise, meaning the layout of your residence is going to determine whether you can play it in a separate room away from the main one. We still have no idea what the online experience is like. TVii, Miiverse, Nintendo eShop and Wii U Chat are all missing in action at this point, so we have no idea how they work, if they work or what they'll add to the bottom line. With a little luck, Nintendo will remedy this in time for us to talk about this stuff pre-launch, but it's entirely possible day-one reviews will be limited to commenting on the system and games only. Bear that in mind if you're interested in the online features — especially stuff like TVii — and awaiting impressions or verdicts.","Wii U, Nintendo's new gaming system, goes on sale Sunday .

"(OPRAH.com) -- At first glance, Jeanne, Amy, Nikki and Desiree don't seem to have much in common. Jeanne is a 31-year-old hotel clerk, and Amy is a 26-year-old working mom. Desiree is an 18-year-old who dreams of becoming an FBI agent, and Nikki is a 26-year-old bartender. Despite their differences, these women are bonded by the horrors they say they experienced as children. Jeanne, Amy, Desiree and Nikki were all born into the Tony Alamo Christian Ministry, which, some say, is a cult. Oprah.com: What's it like inside a polygamist ranch? In the 1980s, Alamo, a self-proclaimed prophet of God, had thousands of devoted followers in the United States, including the parents of Jeanne, Amy, Desiree and Nikki. ""When Tony would say that God spoke to him, everyone believed it,"" Jeanne says. At the height of the ministry's popularity, many followers lived in compounds, including one in Fouke, Arkansas. Outsiders had no idea what was going on beyond the barred windows, but these four women know all too well. Ex-followers say that by the late 1990s Alamo was living in this sprawling compound with more than a dozen women, some of whom he called his ""spiritual wives."" Though no legal documents were ever signed, Jeanne, Amy and Desiree say they were three of Alamo's ""wives."" But when they said their vows, they hardly qualified as women -- they were still girls. Oprah.com: A former polygamist speaks out . Jeanne says that when she was 15 years old Alamo, who was 59 years old and her pastor at the time, forced her to become his spiritual wife and have sex with him. Amy says Alamo made her say vows and submit to his sexual desires when she was 14. Then, Alamo reportedly did something that reportedly shocked even his most devoted followers. Desiree says Alamo made her his youngest spiritual wife when she was just 8 years old. Desiree says Alamo then forced her to have sex with him. Nikki says she was 15 years old when she realized Alamo planned to make her his next ""wife."" Nikki escaped the compound and fled before Alamo had the chance to act. Jeanne, Amy and Desiree say they lived as Alamo's ""wives"" for years and endured abuse before they were able to leave. They eventually fled the compound and left the church that once ruled their lives. Then, in July 2009, these four young women came face-to-face with Alamo once again. This time, in federal court. Despite pressure from family members and friends who still belong to Alamo's church, they testified against their former leader. A jury found Alamo guilty of transporting minors across state lines with the intent to have sex, and he's now serving 175 years in prison. Alamo's attorneys are planning to appeal the case. Oprah.com: Polygamy in America today . Many Americans have never heard of Alamo or his ministry, but Lynn LaRowe, a Texarkana Gazette reporter who's been covering Alamo's story for years, says he began making a name for himself in Los Angeles in the late 1960s. ""Tony Alamo said God appeared before him in his body and told him that he needed to go spread the Lord's message or that he would surely die,"" Lynn says. In 1966, Alamo married Susan Lipowitz and established the Tony and Susan Alamo Christian Foundation. ""Susan Alamo actually operated a television ministry,"" Lynn says. ""Tony Alamo would make cameo appearances as a gospel singer."" Their ministry gained thousands of followers and became a huge success. Then, in 1982, Susan died of cancer. Former members say that's when Alamo's dark side was unleashed. Alamo reportedly put his wife's dead body in his dining room, and former church members say he made men, women and children pray over her corpse for almost two years. They were told their prayers would raise Susan from the dead, but when it didn't work, a former member says Alamo blamed his faithful followers. Oprah.com: She escaped a polygamist community . Over time, Alamo began to exert more control over members of the Tony Alamo Christian Ministry. He turned his church it into a multimillion-dollar business, built on the backs of devoted followers. ""They spent all of their time either praying or working in some capacity for the ministry,"" Lynn says. ""They were completely physically, if not psychologically, as well, exhausted. So there was no time for independent thinking."" Emboldened by his success, Alamo wasn't afraid to share his radical views with the world. During a 2008 interview with CNN anchor Rick Sanchez, Alamo ranted against the Catholic Church and argued that the Bible implies that puberty is the age of consent. ""I don't know when girls reach puberty. Most of them around 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,"" he said during the interview. ""God inseminated Mary at the age of around 10 to 12. Should we get him for having sex?"" Jeanne, Amy, Nikki and Desiree say that when they lived in Alamo's Arkansas compound, he controlled every facet of his followers' lives, and threatened violence and eternal damnation if they dared to disobey him. ""He was the one who laid down the rules,"" Desiree says. Nikki says Alamo decided everything, from who could get a driver's license to whom a member could marry. Jeanne, Amy, Desiree and Nikki say that when Alamo set his sights on a young girl in his congregation, her parents couldn't say no. In fact, some believed becoming one of his spiritual wives was an honor. ""My mom had told me the only person I was going to marry was Tony Alamo,"" Amy says. Once Alamo ""married"" a girl, Jeanne says he used her to fulfill his sexual desires. ""Tony Alamo had up to 13 wives. About, I would say, half were minors, and he had had sex with every single one of us,"" she says. ""He preferred the younger ones."" Four days after Alamo exchanged vows with Jeanne, his eighth ""wife,"" she says he made her have sex with him. ""I did believe that God was telling him that I was supposed to have sex with him, that I was supposed to be his wife, that anything he asked of me, I was supposed to do,"" she says. When Desiree was an 8-year-old little girl who loved playing with dolls, she believed Alamo was a prophet. But, she says, she still felt that what was happening was wrong. ""I just remember Tony bringing me into his room at one point. He laid me on the bed, said the marriage vows, said 'I do,' got a wedding ring, and after that, what actually made it final was, instead of a marriage license, you had sex,"" Desiree says. ""I didn't know about sex. I didn't know about any of that. What kept going through my mind was: 'How can this be right? Isn't this wrong?'"" Despite what she'd been taught all her life, Nikki says she also felt that Alamo's manipulation and teachings were wrong. ""I thought, 'If this is heaven and this is what's going to get me to heaven, I'm going to have to go to hell,'"" she says. Nikki says that in 1999, after she realized she would become Alamo's next spiritual wife, she took action. Although Alamo had taught her to fear the outside world, she found the courage inside herself to run. Oprah.com: Island holds most dangerous child sex offenders . One afternoon, Nikki says she fled the compound. She eluded Alamo's security guards by running through thick brush for hours. ""He sent every person out to look up and down the highways,"" Nikki says. ""They went through every store, every fast food place."" After running for miles through the woods, Nikki was exhausted and terrified. Finally, she spotted a house across a field and hurried to the front door. Vince and Karen Coker, strangers who lived in the house, took a leap of faith and invited her to stay the night. The Cokers offered Nikki a change of clothes, a warm bath and a bed to sleep in. ""I remember laying in the bed. I felt a little bit safe,"" Nikki says. ""I thought, 'Maybe, maybe they will really help me.'"" Oprah Show producers reached out to Alamo for a statement, but he never responded. But Alamo's church, which is still in business, sent a message. This is part of it, verbatim. ""Tony Alamo has no secret world or child brides. He is the least secret person in the world. His church and he are open daily to the public, and he is very outspoken, as an open book. Oprah and the government media and the Roman Catholics are in conspiracy against him and his whole church."" From The Oprah Winfrey Show © 2010 .

"The U.S. military races to the moon to build a base -- to beat the Russians to the punch. Maybe test a nuclear weapon on the surface. Consider a lunar-based bombing system to target earthbound foes. That was the plan in the 1960s, according to declassified national security documents released this week -- some of them stamped as ""SECRET."" Today those schemes may sound as outlandish and dusty as a relic black-and-white episode of ""Space Patrol."" But consider this: . Currently, a vision of sending humans to Mars has begun to form in our collective imagination. Technological advances are swelling our anticipation of touching that dream in a decade or two. And already, the wild idea has sprouted of sending up a crew to Mars who would die there. Hold that mindset. Now, transport it back 55 years to the Cold War, when rockets born out of World War II had grown into skyscrapers with such enormous power that it was becoming clear they would put a trip to the moon within reach. It was only a matter of time before humans would set foot on a celestial body for the very first time. But the same rocket technology made for intercontinental ballistic missiles tipped with nuclear warheads, propelling an arms race against the West's opponent, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. One slip could result in a global nuclear holocaust. Neither side wanted to get behind, and in 1959, the Soviet Union was already ahead in the space race -- putting the first unmanned spacecraft on the moon, the Luna 2. Protecting the American way . The U.S. Army brainchild ""Project Horizon"" was born. Its proposal to leap beyond the Soviets opened with the line: ""There is a requirement for a manned military outpost on the moon."" The paper argued that it was imperative for the United States to develop and protect its potential interest on the Earth's natural satellite -- and to do so quickly to protect the American way of life. ""To be second to the Soviet Union in establishing an outpost on the moon would be disastrous to our nation's prestige and in turn to our democratic philosophy,"" the paper surmised. It should have the kind of priority and authority given to the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb, the Army said. ""Once established, the lunar base will be operated under the control of a unified space command."" The space around the Earth and moon would be considered a military theater. Lunar nuclear power plants . After a thorough justification of the scientific, political and military need for the base, the proposal -- two documents and more than 400 typewritten pages -- calculated out the details of what could be done on the outpost and what it would take to make it reality. It offered graphs and mathematical formulas; considerations for low gravity and magnetic field, lack of water and air, and ballistic dynamics on the moon's surface; and design drawings of spacecraft, lunar bulldozers, modular moon cabins and special space suits. It contained photos of the moon with desirable spots for a colony mapped out on them. Project Horizon would start out with 10 to 20 crew members on a mission to build a somewhat self-sustaining colony capable of producing its own oxygen and water. Supply ships would bring the rest. Page after page was dedicated to the future capabilities of the Saturn rockets that would boost the supplies there. With expansion would come lunar nuclear power plants. Construction of the basic outpost would start in 1964 and be completed five years later. The visions were a bit ahead of schedule. Humans did not land on the moon for the first time until July 1969. And in the end, it wasn't the military, but NASA that sent them there. Lunar nuclear detonation . The nuclear arms race was omnipresent in the '60s, and Project Horizon made room for its possible expansion to the moon. It pondered the pros and cons -- scientifically, militarily and psychologically -- of detonating a nuclear device on the moon or nearby. And it reflected on the possibility of using nuclear weapons in space. Technological advances accelerated the Cold War and the space race through the 1960s, and U.S. military and intelligence agencies expounded in further papers on how the moon could be used for military purposes or intelligence gathering. George Washington University has collected the papers and published them on its National Security Archive website. The U.S. agencies also documented their space rivalry with the Soviet Union, how U.S. intelligence picked up Soviet anti-ballistic missile radar images, when their signals reflected off the moon. Intelligence officers feverishly studied Soviet space capabilities and intercepted pictures their spacecraft signaled back to Earth. And in 1967 the CIA documented how operatives ""borrowed"" a Lunik space capsule, analyzed it and returned it to the Soviets. The purpose of a nuclear detonation near or on the moon would be for show, a document said. Its ""foremost intent was to impress the world with the prowess of the United States."" The security archive said that Air Force leaders scrapped the idea after deciding that it was too risky. In 1967, the U.N. adopted the Outer Space Treaty banning the use of nuclear weapons from space -- including from the moon. Out of this world: The best selfies from space .

"""For every Southern boy fourteen years old, not once but whenever he wants it, there is the instant when it's still not yet two o'clock on that July afternoon in 1863."" So starts a powerful passage by William Faulkner in ""Intruder in the Dust."" The Mississippi novelist and poet poignantly painted the scene of dry-mouthed young men anticipating battle. But the Confederate attack, known in the annals of history as Pickett's Charge, ended about a mile away in failure, gray-clad troops blunted by determined Union troops at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Those young boys recalled by Faulkner were stopped at the Angle, a stone wall considered the high-water mark of the Confederacy -- perhaps the last chance for victory in the U.S. Civil War. Instead, the Union prevailed at Gettysburg, a turning point in the four-year war that claimed at least 620,000 lives. This weekend and through July 7,  between 200,000 and 300,000 visitors -- more than the number of combatants -- will flock to the town and fields of Gettysburg National Military Park to mark the 150th anniversary of the three-day clash, which cost an incredible 51,000 casualties. Pickett's Charge will be the climactic event of a large re-enactment this weekend outside of park boundaries. On July 3, the actual anniversary of the attack, National Park Service rangers will guide thousands of visitors in loose formation across a gently rolling field. Others will stand where Federal regiments poured rifle and artillery fire into the arc of Confederates. The event ends with the playing of Taps by multiple musicians, a solemn remembrance of selfless sacrifice by the warriors at Gettysburg. Times have changed since previous anniversary observances, including the 1938 reunion, at which grizzled veterans of the battle met at Gettysburg one last time in an event known for reconciliation. They shook hands across that famous wall at the Angle. Some let out the haunting Rebel Yell. The 150th commemoration of the battle will tell a wider story than previous observances, officials told CNN. ""For decades, people came here for military and black powder,"" said Carl Whitehill, media relations manager for the Gettysburg Convention & Visitors Bureau. ""Now they want to know about the civilians and what they endured during and after the battle."" Mike Litterst of the National Park Service said interpretations at federal Civil War battlefields have evolved in the past 25 years. Besides telling the story of the battles and the homefront, exhibits increasingly stress the importance of the conflict to civil rights and the role of African-Americans, thousands of whom served in the Union Army. About 400 events are planned over 10 days, including a second battle re-enactment next weekend. Gettysburg National Military Park on Sunday will hold one of its 150th anniversary signature events, an evening program entitled ""Gettysburg: A New Birth of Freedom."" The keynote speaker is historian Doris Kearns Goodwin. Country music singer Trace Adkins and a military band will perform the national anthem. The ceremony concludes with a procession to the Soldiers' National Cemetery, where luminaries will mark each of 3,500 graves of soldiers who died at Gettysburg. ""I think it is an opportunity for people to have a deeper understanding of what happened here and how it is still relevant in 21st century America,"" said Litterst. 12 fascinating Civil War sites . Small town made way into history books . Gettysburg, then a bucolic town of 2,400 souls, found itself directly drawn into the Civil War during the first days of July 1863. Southern troops took the war to the North after a resounding victory at the Battle of Chancellorsville two months before. Gen. Robert E. Lee's soldiers on the first day of battle pushed Union troops through the town and onto hills and ridges that eventually played a large part in the battle's outcome. ""There was street fighting in the inside (of Gettysburg),"" said Whitehill. ""Throughout the town, a lot of people were shooting muskets out of windows."" Jennie Wade, while kneading dough, was fatally shot in the back on July 3, the only civilian casualty at Gettysburg, . Gettysburg, now with a population of about 7,800, and surrounding Adams County anticipate a $100 million economic impact from 150th anniversary observances. Whitehill has spent much of his time assisting nearly 700 journalists from across the United States and abroad. Among international media are German, UK, Australian and Swiss companies. ""One of the things that amazes international visitors and media is why we re-enact this war. It is such a pivotal and painful time for this country but every year we bring it to life and re-enact it."" The area's 2,600 rooms and 1,800 campsites are largely filled, although a few are left. ""A  lot of people move to this area for the history,"" said Whitehill. ""A lot of people just love being close to it."" First aid tents all over town will assist any visitors and event participants who run into problems from the muggy and warm temperatures. Visitors can take free shuttles into downtown and re-enactments. The National Park Service  also offers shuttles and satellite parking. Traffic flow on Friday, the first full day of 150th events, went well. 'Living history' on Civil War battlefields . Thousands of re-enactors go back in time . Don Ernsberger led the building of a replica Pickett's Charge stone wall for this weekend's re-enactment at Bushey Farm. Seventy volunteeers shaped 88 tons of stone to re-create the focal point of the march. ""The Confederates captured that angle for about five to eight minutes and the Union reinforcements came in and pushed them out."" Ernsberger, who authored a book about the wall and the attack, will portray a Union lieutenant on Sunday. ""I wrote this book three years ago and I hope to see it happen before my eyes,"" he said. An estimatetd 10,000 re-enactors are on hand at Bushey Farm this weekend, said Kris Shelton, media and marketing coordinator for the Blue Gray Alliance, which is sponsoring the event. The first mock battle went well Friday, said Shelton, who said organizers have detailed logistics plans for the maneuvering of troops at the site. There's a chance of rain for the next several days. ""We are historically accurate, but we don't control the weather,"" Shelton said. Organizers expect tens of thousands of spectators on Saturday and Sunday. Besides portrayals of the fighting, the re-enactment will include about 200 individuals representing the town of Gettysburg in 1863. ""The civilians living there have done careful research of the residents of the town and they have taken on their identities, including their trade and craft,"" said Shelton. Safety of participants and guests comes first, but authenticity also is a priority. ""People are here to recognize and honor and commemorate what these people went through, the sacrifices of both soldiers and civilians,"" said Shelton. The battles draw re-enactors devoted to donning the proper uniforms and equipment. They can get caught up in the heat of the battle and emotional or significant moments. ""That intensity is something that really sparks re-enactors,"" she said. ""That combined with leaving electronics and the modern world behind."" Visitors and participants alike understand that real people died in battle -- that freedom had a cost. Making the battlefield historically accurate . While battle re-enactments are not permitted on National Park Service sites -- the commemorative clashes will be on privately owned land -- such events and the visitor experience at Gettysburg National Military Park are ""not mutually exclusive,"" said Litterst. ""We want that excitement to spill over to the sites and grounds where the events actually took place,"" he said. The National Park Service does not provide crowd estimates or projections, but it's clear the park will be busy over the next week, given ranger-led hikes and special programs. ""We will probably see crowds we probably haven't seen before, or since the centennial,"" said Litterst. ""For the next couple weeks, there won't be many places to get some alone time here."" But for those who want to get away from at least some of the hustle and bustle, he recommends a visit to the East Cavalry Battlefield Site east of town and the park's Big Round Top, which has a great walking trail. The battlefield looks much different from even 20 years ago as the NPS worked to make it look much closer to its 1863 appearance. Trees have been removed in some places and orchards planted. Thousands may make the July 3 Pickett's Charge commemorative march, timed to the actual assault. Those with younger legs may be in front. And, like battles of old, there will be stragglers. ""There will be not be a shortage of people with stories and pictures of great-great grandfathers who made that march,"" said Litterst. ""That is a neat part of the story.""","Gettysburg expects between 200,000 and 300,000 visitors .

"(CNN)Everything was going to plan for Cowdenbeath during its Scottish Championship clash with table-topping Heart of Midlothian Saturday. The game was 25 minutes old and the relegation threatened-side, ironically and lovingly nicknamed the Blue Brazil by Scottish football fans, had managed to shut-out their hosts and in-form opponents. Then, the goals began to arrive. Minutes 26, 27 and 29 saw Hearts Dutch striker Genero Zeefuik grab a quickfire hat-trick, the third after a penalty and red-card to Cowdenbeath defender Lewis Toshney. A brief lull followed before Hearts scored again in minutes 33 and 39 through Sam Nicholson and Jamie Walker respectively. And while half-time provided Cowdenbeath some brief respite, another torrent of goals was to come when play resumed. By the end of the 90 minutes, Hearts had scored five more times to ensure an astonishing 10-0 victory. Morgaro Gomis, Alim Ozturk Danny Wilson and substitute Osman Sow (twice) did the second-half damage. ""I've never been involved in a result like that in my entire career,"" said Hearts head coach, Robbie Neilson after the game. ""I spoke to the players at half time and told them to keep going, try to score more,"" he added. The result matches Cowdenbeath's heaviest ever loss, an 11-1 reverse to Clyde way back in 1951. But that's still nowhere near the record of the biggest defeat ever recorded in senior Scottish football. That distinctive honor remains in the possession of wonderfully named Bon Accord who were trounced 36-0 by Arbroath in 1880. It might be little consolation to Cowdenbeath tonight, but at least they were along way off Bon Accord levels of ineptitude.","Heart of Midlothian score ten goals in Scottish Championship match .

"(CNN)A ruthless Roger Federer confidently dispatched World No 1. Novak Djokovic 6-3 7-5 to take the Dubai Tennis Championships title Saturday in little over one hour and 36 minutes. The Swiss master, appearing in his 126th tour final (of which he has now won 84) was at his imperious best, frustrating Djokovic who could do little to stem the variety of forehand, backhand and volleyed winners coming from the other side of the net. ""I don't think I could have played much better,"" Federer said on court after the match. Federer edged ahead in game seven of the first, breaking Djokovic before confidently serving out for the set. A critical double fault by Djokovic at 5-5 in the second handed his on-form opponent the upper hand. Federer then took the final game on serve to ensure he would win the Dubai title for the seventh time. The match also saw Federer serve up the 9,000th ace of his career, becoming only the fourth man to achieve the feat since 1991. ""Clearly it is nice to get past that so now I don't have to think about it ever again for the next 9,000 or so,"" he joked . A magnanimous Djokovic later congratulated Federer on his victory.

"Major airports aren't typically the coolest places to kick back and have some fun. Thousands of passengers herded toward departure gates and lengthy security queues manned by stoney-faced stewards rarely equates to a joyful time. But an increasing number of airports are attempting to liven up the pre-flight experience by providing a variety of weird and wonderful distractions to keep the weary traveler entertained. From live music concerts to contemporary art exhibitions and from IMAX cinemas to public ice rinks, some have so much going on they're on the verge of becoming travel destinations in themselves. See also: Record breaking airports . So, where are these happening aviation hotspots? We've selected seven of the world's biggest and busiest airports where entertainment and leisure services are taking off. Singapore . Singapore's Changi Airport may claim to be Southeast Asia's premier air cargo hub, but it's also one of the original innovators in the field of airport entertainment. The giant facility was one of the first to introduce free WiFi areas whilst a roof-top pool and jacuzzi has been open to passengers since the late 1990s. Amenities introduced in recent years include an interactive art gallery, children's fun slide and an on-site nature trail. Free city tours of Singapore are also available to any passenger with a stopover of five hours or more. Nashville . Nashville has long been considered one of the cradles of American music. Elvis Presley, Dolly Parton and Johnny Cash have all been fixtures of the city's famed recording studios. Keen to play up this lively musical past, Nashville International Airport puts on regular live concerts for travelers and music enthusiasts alike. Four stages -- one located outside security and three more beyond -- host upwards of 100 free events every year. See also: How good is your airport sign language? Country music and jazz performances are staples here, but rock bands and traditional Celtic acts are also a common sight. San Francisco . Elaborate art installations are now a common fixture at airports around the world, but San Francisco International (SFO) was offering travelers an insight into the aesthetic more than 30 years ago. The SFO Museum -- which is comprised of more than 20 galleries across four terminals -- was inaugurated in 1980 and continues to host an ever-changing schedule of exhibitions on a diverse range of subjects. Passengers are free to browse the airport's myriad exhibits while non-flying visitors on day trips from the San Francisco Bay Area are also able to stop by. See also: The world's transport hubs . Recent events include a collection of pan-Asian ceramics dating as far back as the seventh century AD and a photographic expose on the secret life of plants. Seoul-Incheon . Incheon Airport on the outskirts of Seoul, South Korea, has earned a reputation for travel excellence. The sprawling complex is one of the world's busiest passenger and cargo hubs, snapping up the Airports Council International world's best airport in air service quality award for seven consecutive years. Integral to this success is the wide selection of fun activities and facilities to keep waiting passengers occupied. An ice rink, casino, spa and sauna represent just a few of the cool distractions on offer. A five-minute shuttle drive away from the airport, travelers can tee off for a relaxing round on the airport's 18-hole Incheon Golf Club course. Munich . Munich is famed for its Oktoberfest beer festival and the city's airport aims to bring a sample of the alcohol-fueled fun to thirsty passengers.

"(CNN)Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez combined to ensure Barcelona returned to winning La Liga ways by overcoming lowly Granada 3-1 Saturday on a far from perfect pitch at the Estadio Nuevo Los Cármenes. Ivan Rakitic pounced to open the scoring from close-range midway through the first half before Suarez added to the Catalan's advantage just after half-time. Fran Rico pulled one back for Granada from the penalty spot but Lionel Messi restored Barcelona's two-goal advantage 20 minutes from the end when set up by Suarez. After losing at home to Malaga last weekend, Luis Enrique's men were keen to ensure they fell no further behind arch rivals Real Madrid in the La Liga standings. The result means Barca moves to within one point of Real who play Villarreal Sunday. ""I am very happy and satisfied with the work the players did in very special conditions,"" Enrique told reporters after the match. ""The teams have to be commended for the game they played on grass like that. They both tried to play a passing game, and that's worth highlighting."" Enrique had rotated his squad after midweek victory at Manchester City in the Champions League. Barcelona legend Xavi returned to the starting lineup but the potent attacking triumvirate of Messi, Suarez and Neymar remained in place. The purposeful, all-action performance of Suarez, who scored twice in midweek against City, came in for particular praise from Enrique. ""Ever since he arrived, Suárez has been playing top class football and working very hard,"" he said. ""He may look more spectacular now and people are seeing more of him, but he has always been a special player that does a lot for the team."" With Chelsea and Tottenham contesting the League Cup final at Wembley Sunday, there was a reduced fixture card in England Saturday. Wayne Rooney scored two second half goals as Manchester United overcame ten-man Sunderland at Old Trafford to keep up its chase for a Champions League spot. But United old-boy Wes Brown was sent off under controversial circumstances after it appeared referee Roger East mistook him for team-mate John O'Shea who looked to have fouled Red Devils' striker Radamel Falcao. Although Sunderland players complained that Brown had not touched Falcao, East stood by his decision after consulting with his assistants. Elsewhere, relegation threatened Burnley fell 1-0 at home to Swansea City while Stoke City overcame Hull City by the same scoreline at the Britannia Stadium. Newcastle United ensured Tim Sherwood's tricky start to life as Aston Villa manager continued with Papiss Cisse scoring as the only goal as the Magpies won 1-0 at St. James' Park. An early goal from West Brom's young striker Saido Berahino, meanwhile, was enough to ease out Southampton at the Hawthorns. In the Premier Leagues early fixture Crystal Palace upset West Ham 3-1. Striker Glen Murray scored twice for Palace before being sent off for a second bookable offense late on. Borussia Dortmund's Bundesliga resurrection continued with a 3-0 home victory over local rivals Schalke in the Ruhr derby. Although the scoreline and performance were ultimately convincing, Dortmund didn't break the deadlock until Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored in the 78th minute. Henrikh Mkhitaryan added a second four minutes from the end before Marco Reus rounded off the scoring in injury time. The win is Dortmund's fourth in a row in the league and pushes Jurgen Klopp's men further clear of the relegation zone they occupied only a matter of weeks ago.","Barcelona defeats Granada 3-1 with goals from Rakitic, Suarez and Messi .

"While much of the world is focused on the Russian incursion into the Crimean Peninsula of Ukraine, another long-term move may allow the former Soviet navy to dominate U.S. interests to the north: the Arctic. The rapid melting of the Arctic Ocean is quickly creating a new variety of challenges that have the potential to cause significant global damage if they remain unaddressed. The Obama administration's policy correctly recognizes that the United States has profoundly important economic and cultural interests in the Arctic but regrettably reveals very little about what the federal government will be doing outside of the science field. While recent U.S. policies either dance around the core issues, or worse, do not acknowledge that they exist, the Russians are taking the lead on Arctic policy. After all, the Arctic is in their backyard, too. Moreover, Russia -- as if to highlight the value they place on their navy and renaissance as a maritime nation -- took control of the strategic Crimean Peninsula, assuring and securing warm water Russian Navy access to the global commons. In light of these recent events, it would be wise for Washington to seriously consider the economic potential and security vulnerabilities that exist on or near the U.S. Arctic coastline. Overwhelmingly, the U.S. Arctic policy debate echoes past concerns of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Consequently, many in the policy community are pushing a heavy science and no-development agenda to preserve the pristine character of the region. The recently issued Department of Defense Arctic Strategy is a case in point: It talks extensively about the DOD scientific mission and uses the terms ""sustainable development"" and preservation of the unspoiled area as important national goals. But just saying ""no"" ignores the fact that the precious Arctic mineral and oil and gas resources will help assure the United States is able, over time, to achieve and then maintain its energy independence. Science is incredibly important, as is safe and responsible development of the Arctic, but our agencies and scientists need to approach these issues with a greater sense of urgency.  Arguably, the science needs to be a component of a detailed national action, but that's only a fraction of good U.S. policy. U.S. Arctic policy should prioritize four things: . One: Demonstrate leadership in the Arctic and develop a strategy and policy to match. The U.S. has no leadership in the high north and Russia does, which is a great concern for our allies. Two: Invest in infrastructure, Navy and Coast Guard to support U.S. security and commercial interests in the Arctic. The key here is to develop the policy that drives those requirements so we are not ""late to need."" Three: Demonstrate leadership in the maritime domain worldwide -- and not retreat as we are doing by default in the Arctic. Four: Facilitate and further develop offshore natural resources in the high north/Alaska and the national, international, maritime and geopolitical governance structures that will underpin those enterprises. Washington, in less than two years, will assume a leadership role when it becomes Chair for the Arctic Council. Unfortunately, the DOD policy and U.S. Navy Arctic Roadmap 2014 do not articulate what the U.S. Arctic leadership agenda will entail. The reality is ignoring the issues and choosing not to participate in the Arctic will not make the issues go away. Yes, budgets are challenging, but the Arctic is no different from any other international frontier or global common where the U.S. has interests. We need to protect it and demonstrate leadership in the maritime domain -- not retreat. So, too, our policy makers need to be looking beyond our shores to Moscow, Ottawa, Oslo, Copenhagen, the Arctic Council, international oil companies and Lloyds of London for help in solving this governance challenge. The last thing that any of the Arctic states can afford is to back into a Russian-generated crisis with no resources or a plan. The time is now for more U.S. leadership to ensure the Arctic becomes a safe, secure and prosperous region in which to live and work. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","David Slayton, Mark E.

"A pregnant woman is beaten to death by her relatives outside a court building. And for what? She eloped with the man she loved rather than marry the groom chosen by her family. The terrible fate of Farzana Parveen, 25, is one shared by all too many women in Pakistan and elsewhere. She was killed in the name of ""honor,"" on the grounds her actions had brought shame on her family. ""I do not even wish to use the phrase 'honour killing': there is not the faintest vestige of honour in killing a woman in this way,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said in a statement condemning the killing. Pillay called on Pakistan's government to work harder to stop such killings and protect women from violence. According to a report published in April by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, 869 women in the country were the victims of honor killings last year. And activists say the true number may be much higher. Parveen's killing is all the more shocking because it was so public. She was beaten to death with bricks close to the high court in the eastern city of Lahore by a group of about 20 people, including her brothers, father and cousin, police said. One family member made a noose of rough cloth around her neck while her brothers smashed bricks into her skull, said Mushtaq Ahmed, a police official, citing the preliminary report into the killing. She was three months pregnant, he said. So-called honor killings often originate from tribal traditions in Pakistan but are not a part of Islam. Although they're common in rural areas, Tuesday's attack in a public area of a big city was unusual. Police officials said Parveen, who came from a village in Punjab, had refused to wed the cousin whom her family had selected for her, choosing instead to elope with a widower named Mohammad Iqbal. The cousin intended for her husband was among the people who attacked her, police said. Sudanese woman sentenced to death for her Christianity gives birth . 'Barbaric' attack . The family had challenged Parveen's marriage to Iqbal in the courts, accusing him of abducting her. The attack took place as she was on her way from her lawyer's office to the high court in Lahore, where she was expected to make a declaration that she had married Iqbal of her own volition. One of Pakistan's leading newspapers, The Nation, expressed outrage over Parveen's killing. ""The familiar brand of barbaric 'justice' yet again triumphs over the written law of the land,"" it said in an editorial Wednesday. ""Another case is settled outside the courts. Another woman, in search of justice, stoned to death, in the name of honor."" Farzana Bari, a human rights activist based in Islamabad, said the real number may be far higher than the Human Rights Commission's official count since many families don't report the crimes. She said that in many cases, people outside the family don't step in to protect the victim. ""I've seen in the past people stand around and watch, and don't intervene because it is a private matter,"" she told CNN on Wednesday. ""I think honor killing is very much part of our culture. It is a cultural form of violence which is quite prevalent in certain parts of Pakistan."" Honor killings happen more often in rural, tribal areas, Bari said, but urban cases occur, too. Since many cases are not reported, police have no record and rights groups that try to document what's happening must do so through media reports and incomplete data. ""There is no systematic information gathered in Pakistan that tells us the extent of the problem,"" she said. Impunity said to encourage killers . And the killers often avoid prosecution. Under an Islamic element of Pakistani law, known as the law of Diyat, the family of a victim is allowed to forgive the perpetrator, according to the human rights commission's report. ""Thus the victim's family usually is related to the perpetrator as well, and conveniently forgives their kin, absolving them of the murder,"" the report said. That possibility of impunity has ""continued to encourage others to follow suit,"" it said. Bari gave a similar picture and called for a change in Pakistan's laws to protect women and the vulnerable. ""Basically, the people have no fear of law because there is a culture of impunity and, as a result of that, people feel free and they can commit such acts outside the courts of justice,"" she said. She blames such actions also on violent and extremist attitudes which, she said, drive people to act even if they are aware of the potential consequences. ""I think we must generally reflect on the sick mindset of the society,"" she said. Police said they had arrested Parveen's father, whose name they gave only as Azeem. They said he had admitted to the killing and expressed no regret. Search warrants are out for the other men accused of attacking her. Why marrying for love should never mean death .

"(CNN) -- The tween who took the Internet by storm last year starring in the hilarious and empowering ""Camp Gyno"" ad, about a girl who is the first at her summer camp to get her period, is back. Nearly 10 million video views later, Macy McGrail, now a sixth-grader, returns, but this time her focus is on middle school and the consequences of some very bad decisions her character makes along the way. In a unique twist, 11-year-old McGrail plays the character from tweenhood into adulthood. In the opening scene, we hear a few gunshots ring out and then see McGrail's character racing out of a motor home wearing heels and a leather jacket. She hops into a car with a guy who looks like bad news, telling herself, ""Look at me, 38 years old and I'm running out of this place in this dress to this moron. ""At moments like this, you can't help but do a little soul-searching and ask yourself, 'How did I end up here?' "" she says, at which point we go back in time. We see her when she was six months pregnant at 24 and took back her partner, a serial cheater, before taking a drag on a cigarette. At 15, when her friend told her getting high was ""awesome."" When she faced a choice, that very first day of middle school, between joining the group of kids sporting angry looks, dressed in black and smoking versus another group smiling and waving, carrying books titled ""Language and Gender."" ""I guess there's no way to pinpoint that one moment where it all started to fall apart, but if I had to do it all over again, you bet your sweet ass I'd make some different choices."" Period Power: Talking to girls about 'Aunt Flo' Sure, it's a tad over the top, but don't you remember kids who went with the wrong crowd in middle school and never quite recovered? The video, which I'd love to show my girls when they get closer to middle school, is a unique trailer for McGrail's father's new book ""Surviving Middle School: An Interactive Story for Girls."" Dave McGrail said the book was in the works long before his daughter's viral fame, but the trailer was, in fact, inspired by that success. The idea came from Tommy Henvey, a relative who is an executive creative director for the ad agency Ogilvy and Mather, during a holiday party about a year ago. ""He offered on the spot to assemble a team, the best in the business, to try to create something that would star Macy, so how could I say no?"" said McGrail, whose day job is running a two-person law firm from his home. Replace the 'sex talk' with the 'tech talk'? ""It fit in really nicely with the book because it could convey the same point: that choices matter going all the way back to middle school."" The book, modeled around the ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books McGrail enjoyed as a child, lets the reader decide what to do and tackles some pressing issues affecting today's tweens and teens, who are growing up in a digital age. For instance, do you stick up for a female classmate from India who is being bulled in person and online by a mean girl who makes fun of her name and her Indian jewelry collection, or do you decide to stay out of it, knowing that if you speak up you might invite the attention of the bully? ""The idea was give them a decision that, at least, I think there's a right or wrong answer ... and then couch it in a way so it looks really tantalizing to them to do the wrong thing and then see what they do,"" said McGrail. Another choice readers of the book face centers on getting an Instagram account and becoming friends with a sixth grader in Ohio, who turns out not to be a sixth grader but a grown man. Do you continue the friendship or do you cut things off once you learn the truth and start feeling a bit uncomfortable? ""You can make the wrong choice and you can be down this road and you're stuck, and it's not a great outcome,"" said McGrail. What parents can learn about the Internet from Kim Kardashian . ""I think that something parents have to acknowledge these days is that with technology and earlier puberty and a whole host of other factors, girls are forced to make really tough choices that have serious consequences at a much earlier age than when we were kids and I'm seeing that on a day to day basis with my daughter."" The father of two (Macy has a younger sister) says he hopes his book and trailer will both entertain and spark conversation about issues affecting middle schoolers just as the ""Camp Gyno"" ad got people talking about menstruation and girl empowerment. ""In my ideal world, kids are standing around the playground discussing how they chose or bringing it up with their parents or disagreeing with one of the outcomes in the book,"" he said. ""The discourse that was created and generated by 'Camp Gyno' is the same sort of thing that I would love to happen and be generated from the book."" ""I mean, these are heavy issues, and I think that the best way to get kids talking about them is to present them with something they enjoy."" Chances are, your teen has sexted . As for Macy, life is pretty much back to normal after her ""Camp Gyno"" fame. Her classmates have for the most part been supportive, with the exception of some snickering by the boys from time to time, and she's now focused on middle school and continuing her acting career, said McGrail . ""She's clearly got a nickname for life. It'll probably be the beginning of her college essay as well,"" said her proud dad. ""She's embraced it, but she's moved on.""

"(CNN)It's December 23, 2022. It's the last Friday before Christmas and it's carnage on the streets of London. This is ""Black Friday"" and then some. Thanks to the huge numbers of office Christmas parties, paramedics, bouncers and doctors are struggling to scrape binge drinking Britons off the pavement. Tuesday saw a commission set up by FIFA, world soccer's governing body, recommend what was already the worst held secret in sport: that the 2022 World Cup finals in Qatar should be moved from the oppressive heat in the summer to the cooler winter months. Some initial reports suggest that December 23 could be the day of the World Cup final. If the right-leaning British tabloid Daily Mail thought Black Friday 2014 was bad, it might find December 23, 2022 really will signal the end of days. At least that's the impression you get from the reaction to a possible winter World Cup. Discounting the fact that ""winter"" is a relative term (there have already been six World Cup finals hosted during winter months in the southern hemisphere,) the reaction has been almost universally negative; a sign not just of Qatar's perceived ability to change the rules of the game, but also of FIFA's mendacity. Ever since Qatar was announced as host in December 2010, questions have been raised about its ability to host the finals in June and July when the temperature can reach 50 degrees Celsius. Other dates were mooted such as February/March 2022, but that drew a strong reaction from the International Olympic Committee as it clashed with the Winter Olympics. Broadcaster Fox, which had paid an inordinate sum to secure World Cup broadcast rights, must be angry with that possibility too, as it coincided with one of the biggest advertising paydays in world sport: the Super Bowl. And UEFA, Europe's governing body, was also against that date as it clashed with the Champions League, the richest competition in world football. May was suggested, when the temperatures were lower, but not low enough. So, the battle was set for November and December, a date that UEFA appears to have begrudgingly accepted as the best of a bad bunch. Most European leagues have a winter break that could be moved forward a month to accommodate the finals. The main loser appears to be the English Premier League who will have to find a month long hole in its schedule, plus recovery time. Richard Scudamore, the league's CEO who has just signed a record £5.1 billion TV deal, is livid. He's a man that's not accustomed to being dictated to. ""FIFA keep their international dates, they keep their World Cup intact, even UEFA, who, I think, let us down a little bit, clearly pushed,"" he said after the meeting. The 2022 dates means English football's traditional Christmas football period -- where a quick succession of matches would be played starting the day after Christmas Day -- would go out of the window. But would a winter World Cup really be the disaster it is being painted as? Surely, as the European nights draw in and in the run up to Christmas, a schedule of international matches on free to air television would be a huge draw to viewers in Europe? Given the public's affinity with football TV ratings records would be smashed. A World Cup in November and December might arguably also provide the impetus for English football to reform itself. The lack of a winter break has meant that the national team rarely performs well at big international tournaments after a long grueling season. Germany who won last World Cup, took a six week winter break December to January. Over that time, English Premier League teams played seven league matches, plus cup games. It would be an opportune time to introduce one. One other issue is the global aspect of the game. Insisting on June-July for every World Cup finals excludes much of the world from ever hosting the tournament, including the Middle East. A Qatar World Cup in December would be a unique experience for those who travel there, if a little cold. In reality, this isn't an argument about the timing of the finals as much as represents deep anger at FIFA and by extension Qatar. There are still huge, unanswered questions surrounding the corruption allegations that have surrounded the successful bid. And why exactly did the likes of UEFA president Michel Platini vote for a summer World Cup when the issue of temperature were well known, including in FIFA's own technical report which deemed a Qatari World Cup high risk? And then there's an issue of migrant worker rights. Qatar has promised changes to the Kafala system and rightly so. No World Cup should ever be built by workers with such a tenuous grasp over their own destinies. But Qatar winning the bid to host the 2022 World Cup has, by accident and under pressure from the intense media glare that followed it, enhanced visibility of this exploitation, not diminished it. The World Cup has made reform of the system more likely, not less. Until Qatar won the bid in 2010, reporting on the issue was negligible. Previously the Kafala system would be routinely dismissed as a necessary step towards global development, like migrants arriving in the U.S. to build the American dream. That view is now not heard. Take Qatar out of the equation and you are left with one question: what would actually be wrong with a winter World Cup? We talk big about football being a global game, why not make it truly global? Worry less about the cash-rich English Premier League having to make alterations to their schedule, and worry more about the paramedics, bouncers and doctors on 23, December 2022. And brace yourself for the blackest of Black Fridays.","A winter World Cup has some positives, argues football writer James Montague .

"The Obama administration has unveiled a plan to spend millions of dollars to stem the tide of undocumented children streaming across the U.S.-Mexico border, announcing a coordinated government-wide response to the situation Friday. The plan includes almost $100 million in aid to the Central American governments of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to help reintegrate the illegal migrants whom the United States will send back, and to help keep them in their home countries, according to a White House statement. The administration also announced it will set aside $161.5 million this year for the Central American Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) programs because the programs ""are critical to enabling Central American countries to respond to the region's most pressing security and governance challenges."" ""Our assistance will help stem migration flows as well as address the root cause of the migration,"" the statement said. The Obama administration has accused syndicates in Latin America of waging a deliberate campaign of misinformation that has caused people in poor Central American countries and Mexico to risk their lives to head for the United States, where they expect to stay. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the administration is addressing the problem in several ways. ""We're going to open up some additional detention facilities that can accommodate adults that show up on the border with their children. And we're going to deploy some additional resources to work through their immigration cases more quickly, so they're not held in that detention facility for a long time, and hopefully be quickly returned to their home country,"" Earnest said. Earnest said the administration is also working with Central American countries to address the problem at its root. ""Some of that is an information campaign and countering this intentional misinformation campaign that's being propagated by criminal syndicates. But also working through a host of USAID programs and the host governments, or the governments in these countries to try to meet some of the citizens' security needs that are so acute in these countries right now. Biden meets with Central American leaders . Vice President Joe Biden traveled to Guatemala on Friday for talks with Central American leaders as part of the White House strategy. A large number of the recent surge of undocumented children, 29%, are from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, according to the government. Biden's objective in the meeting with leaders from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico was to emphasize that ""children and adults arriving with their children (in the U.S.) are not eligible to benefit from the passage of immigration reform legislation or from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) process."" Most of the children crossing the border would not qualify for ""amnesty"" under the federal DACA  program that defers deportation for children brought to the United States previously by their parents or guardians illegally. Biden spoke with Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez during his flight to Guatemala. He asked Hernandez to work closely with the other leaders to help develop a plan to address the root causes of unlawful migration from Central America, according to a statement from the office of the vice president. The vice president discussed the same topics in a meeting in Guatemala later with Guatemalan President Otto Pérez Molina, President Salvador Sánchez Cerén of El Salvador, and representatives from the Honduran and Mexican governments. Obama administration unveils new response . Biden's visit to Central America was part of the Obama administration's response to what it calls an ""urgent humanitarian situation."" U.S. authorities estimate that between 60,000 and 80,000 children without parents will cross the border this year alone. The majority of the children apprehended by the U.S. Border Patrol along the southwest border this month have been concentrated in the Rio Grande Valley sector of Texas, according to a congressional advisory Friday. As of June 18, 3,103 unaccompanied children from 11 countries were in U.S. Customs and Border Protection custody along that border, the majority being from Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico and Guatemala, the advisory said. The federal government does not have the processing capabilities to handle this kind of influx of illegal human traffic. But the Obama administration has now coordinated a governmentwide response to the crisis. The new plan announced Friday includes a big influx of spending to the USAID program, including $40 million dollars to Guatemala to improve security, $25 million to El Salvador to help with a crime and violence prevention program and at-risk youth, and $18.5 million to the Central American Regional Security Initiative in Honduras for crime and gang prevention efforts. The Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security are also taking additional steps to try and mitigate the still unfolding immigration crisis. The agencies are ""surging government enforcement resources to increase (the) capacity to detain individuals and adults who bring their children with them and to handle immigration court hearings as quickly and efficiently as possible while also while protecting those who are seeking asylum."" ""This is an extraordinary interagency effort to deal with an urgent humanitarian situation,"" said Cecilia Muñoz, the White House director of domestic policy, in a conference call on the new administration plan. Opponents of the Obama administration remain skeptical of the immigration policies leading to the boarder crossings of minors. On Friday, Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin toured a temporary shelter at Fort Sill housing about 600 unaccompanied minors -- ages 12 to 17 -- who crossed the United States' southern border illegally. Fallin criticized President Barack Obama for the ""lax immigration policies that have lead to an illegal immigration crisis."" ""This facility is designed for our soldiers to train and prepare to protect our nation,"" said Fallin. ""Instead, the federal government is using it as a cross between a boarding school and detention center for illegal immigrants. President Obama should not be using our military facilities as a tool to cover up his failed immigration policies."" The Obama administration aims to close the Fort Sill housing facility for undocumented children in the next 120 days. Crossroads of hope and fear: Stories from a desert bus station .

"(CNN)An American missionary once held hostage by Colombian rebels has been accused by local authorities of collaborating with his former captors. Russell Martin Stendal was born in Minneapolis but has spent much of his life in Colombia. He was kidnapped in 1983 by the left-wing rebel group FARC, which has been locked in conflict with government forces for decades. Stendal was released by the rebels after five months and has continued his missionary work around the South American nation since then, including trips into rebel-controlled areas. But his activities appear to have run afoul of Colombian authorities, who announced Thursday that they had arrested Stendal, accusing him of supporting the FARC. Police alleged that he was posing as a missionary. A video posted online appeared to show Stendal speaking after his arrest. ""Somebody set a trap for me, and I walked into it. And there was a secret order out for my arrest. And here I am,"" he says in the video, which was purportedly filmed by one of his daughters. ""They're accusing me of rebellion for the missionary trips and the visits that I made into rebel-held territory, distributing Bibles and Galcom radios,"" he says, referring to solar-powered portable radio sets that are fixed to receive Christian broadcasts. Colombian authorities described his actions differently, saying he installed mobile devices ""to transmit propaganda about terrorist activities."" ""He also transported those wounded in combat and gave medical help to members of the guerrilla group,"" said the prosecutor's office in the Colombian department of Cundinamarca. A judge ordered Stendal's release late Thursday night in a court proceeding shown on CNN affiliate Cablenoticias. The judge said the prosecutor's case against Stendal was lacking in proof and underdeveloped, ruling there was no reason to keep him in jail. But the judge cautioned that the American isn't free of all charges and that authorities will continue their investigation. Stendal's lawyer, Eder Castro, told the Colombian newspaper El Tiempo that his client was committed to ""distributing Bibles and preaching the word to everyone."" The U.S. State Department wasn't immediately available for comment on the matter Thursday. The Colombian rebels said authorities had got the wrong end of the stick. ""It leaves much to be desired of the intelligence department of the police of Cundinamarca to confuse evangelizing with rebellion,"" said the statement from the FARC, which is known in English as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. ""This citizen always preached peace between armed and unarmed contestants, including insurgents, army and paramilitaries,"" the rebels said. During his time as a FARC hostage, Stendal appears to have tried to provide spiritual succor to his kidnappers. He released a book about his experience entitled, ""Rescue the Captors,"" in which he talks about ""how God worked in the hearts of the rebels,"" according to the Colombia Para Cristo website. After his release, he took part in evangelical campaigns across Colombia and set up radio stations to broadcast gospel preaching and music into the conflict zones.

"(CNN)The MotoGP cavalcade trooped into Malaysia this week for three days of testing at a sultry Sepang circuit. While there were no surprises about the man leading the pack, results further down hint at an interesting season ahead in motorcycle racing's top class. Repsol Honda's Marc Marquez blew away the winter cobwebs with a typically imperious blast around the track. The youngest-ever double world champion's best lap of one minute 59.115 seconds was more than three-tenths of a second clear of the field -- a blink of an eye, perhaps, but a significant gap in a sport of fine margins. The Catalan's appetite for success appears undiminished and he was in the mood for work, clocking up 73 laps on the final day of testing -- more than anyone else on the grid. ""We're finished today with our homework done,"" Marquez said. ""I do not think there are many more new things to try."" Behind the Spaniard there were several eye-catching rides in track temperatures that reached a scalding 49 degrees Celsius (120 ˚F). Movistar Yamaha's Jorge Lorenzo finished second on his Movistar Yamaha despite struggling with the intense heat. ""It was really difficult to keep a good lap time and pace,"" Lorenzo said. ""The bike felt not so good with so much temperature. I decided to stop as I wasn't feeling confident in braking."" Reportedly in the shape of his life, the man from Majorca clocked a satisfying one minute 59.437 seconds -- his fastest ever lap at the track -- and looks set to be Marquez's closest challenger this year, especially as both his teammate Valentino Rossi (5th) and Honda's Dani Pedrosa (7th) left Malaysia with work to do. While no eyebrows were raised at the top two riders, the man in third place will have got them twitching. Britain's Cal Crutchlow endured a miserable 2014 for the most part with Ducati, but was getting to grips with the Italian bike before he departed for CWM LCR Honda. He appears to have settled immediately, and an impressive showing in Sepang bodes well for the combative Manxman's season. Not a fan of the circuit, Crutchlow departed with a smile on his face after registering a hugely impressive one minute 59.658 seconds. ""For a track that I dislike, that's my fastest ever lap around here by nearly eight-tenths of a second,"" Crutchlow said. ""I felt good and comfortable on the bike, and it's not a bad lap considering the conditions of the circuit today."" Fellow Briton Bradley Smith, on the Monster Tech3 Yamaha team, also performed well. On day two he already felt the team was ""95% there,"" and his sixth place on day three was promising. The progress of two teams in Malaysia was under particular scrutiny with Ducati debuting its new Desmosedici GP15 bike and Suzuki stepping up for its eagerly anticipated return to the sport with its GSX-RR. Ducati team principal Gigi Dall'Igna was satisfied with the GP15's showing. ""It seems that everything is going well: we lapped for three days without any major reliability issues and this is surely important for a completely new bike,"" Dall'lgna said.  New recruit Andrea Iannone impressed with an outstanding fourth place on the final day. ""I'm happy with the way it's improved in such a short period of time,"" Iannone remarked. Suzuki's Aleix Espargaro was also satisfied with his machine's progress. On Monday, he said that he had been surprised by the speed and power of the GSX-RR, and was also content with its performance in that day's wet conditions. ""I feel very comfortable,"" the Spaniard said. ""It is small and easy to handle so I feel confident."" One more test remains for the teams, at Qatar's Losail circuit, before the season gets underway at the same track on 29 March.","MotoGP teams and riders in Sepang, Malaysia for three days of testing ahead of 2015 season .

"(CNN)FIFA presidential hopeful Luis Figo is selling, but can he tempt 209 football federations to buy into his campaign to topple Sepp Blatter? The Portuguese great outlined an eye catching $3.5 billion giveaway as he seeks to build a base to challenge Blatter in the May election. Figo's ""For Football Manifesto"" promised that 50% of FIFA's revenues -- $2.5 billion -- would be handed to the national associations over four years to help fund global grassroots football development. The former Barcelona and Real Madrid star also wants to redistribute $1 billion of FIFA's $1.5 billion reserves to the member associations. ""After many conversations with football leaders, one of the consistent themes fed back to me is the way FIFA currently distributes revenues to its member associations is very inefficient and ineffective -- especially for developing football across all associations,"" said Figo at a media conference to launch his campaign at Wembley Stadium. ""FIFA belongs to its member associations and it is only natural that FIFA's revenues and reserves are distributed back to them directly. ""The impact of my proposals would mean between $8m-$10m being distributed to each member association across a four-year period."" ""If done in the right way, with a clearly defined strategy that is centrally audited and monitored, this investment will radically enhance football opportunities for boys and girls and directly benefit all of FIFA's 209 Member Associations."" Having dealt with FIFA's finances, Figo faced questioning over his knowledge of the world governing body's executive committee members. Asked to name the 25 committee members he came up with four names -- haltingly. Moving on, Figo floated the idea of expanding the World Cup to 48 teams in a bid to include more countries outside of Europe. Currently there are 32 teams that compete in the international extravaganza but Figo believes an extra three or four days of play would allow more nations to be accommodated. ""By increasing the number of teams participating in the World Cup, we not only make sure that we include more countries from across the world, but also enable FIFA to raise significant increased revenues that can be used to invest in the growth of the game globally. As for the game itself he wants to put an end to ""triple punishments,"" trial out sin bins for unsporting behavior, and revert to the old offside rule -- where players are judged offside whether directly involved in play or not. Ethical issues arguably have been a bit of minefield for FIFA in recent years and Figo pledged to ""lead by example, with the highest ethical and moral standards."" He's up against Jordanian Prince Ali Bin-Al Hussein who is using the same campaign company -- Vero Communications -- which also works for UEFA, the European confederation within FIFA. ""All I can say is thank God in my life I have had a successful career... I can stand on my own two feet,"" said Figo, who is funding his campaign out of his own pocket.","Luis Figo plans to give national and member states $3.5 billion of FIFA's funds to help grassroots developments .

"(CNN)It was supposed to be a silent march when demonstrators packed the streets of Buenos Aires. But it didn't take long for the chanting to start at Wednesday's march through the Argentine capital. Some demonstrators called out, ""Nisman is here!"" Others chanted, ""Long live the motherland!"" The march was organized by six prosecutors to honor the memory of Alberto Nisman, a special prosecutor whose mysterious death a month ago has shaken the South American nation. Police said hundreds of thousands of people turned out for Wednesday's march. Many of them walked with umbrellas through a torrential downpour. Nisman was found with a gunshot wound to his head in his apartment on January 18, a day before he was scheduled to testify before lawmakers about his accusations of a government cover-up that he said reached all the way up to the country's President. Authorities have yet to determine if his death was suicide or murder. Among those attending Wednesday's demonstration was Sandra Arroyo Salgado, Nisman's ex-wife, a judge who has maintained that he never would have ended his own life. She marched with their two teenage daughters at her side. Nisman had alleged that President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner shielded Iranian officials accused of masterminding the bombing of a Jewish community center in 1994 that left 85 people dead. His death has spurred a number of protests and speculation that the government could have had something to do with it. Fernandez has denied the accusations against her and suggested forces conspiring against her government had him killed. ""They used him while he was alive, and then they needed him dead,"" she wrote last month. ""It's that sad and terrible."" The prosecutor who replaced Nisman formally accused the President of a cover-up last week. But government officials say the accusations are politically motivated and that Nisman was killed in an effort to destabilize democracy in their country. At an event with supporters last week, the President criticized the organizers of the march. ""We choose singing and happiness,"" Fernandez said, ""and leave silence to them."" CNN's Mariano Castillo and journalist Iván Pérez Sarmenti contributed to this report.","Police say hundreds of thousands of demonstrators packed the streets of Buenos Aires .

"(CNN)  -- If we learned that the government was planning to limit our First Amendment rights, we'd be outraged. After all, our right to be heard is fundamental to our democracy. Well, our free speech rights are under assault -- not from the government but from corporations seeking to control the flow of information in America. If that scares you as much as it scares me, then you need to care about net neutrality. ""Net neutrality"" sounds arcane, but it's fundamental to free speech. The internet today is an open marketplace. If you have a product, you can sell it. If you have an opinion, you can blog about it. If you have an idea, you can share it with the world. And no matter who you are -- a corporation selling a new widget, a senator making a political argument or just a Minnesotan sharing a funny cat video -- you have equal access to that marketplace. An e-mail from your mom comes in just as fast as a bill notification from your bank. You're reading this op-ed online; it'll load just as fast as a blog post criticizing it. That's what we mean by net neutrality. But telecommunications companies want to be able to set up a special high-speed lane just for the corporations that can pay for it. You won't know why the internet retail behemoth loads faster than the mom-and-pop shop, but after a while you may get frustrated and do all of your shopping at the faster site. Maybe the gatekeepers will discriminate based on who pays them more. Maybe they will discriminate based on whose political point of view conforms to their bottom line. We don't have to speculate. We can look to the history of the media gatekeepers for examples. Back in the 1990s, Congress rescinded rules that prevented television networks from owning their own programming. Network executives swore in congressional hearings that they wouldn't give their own programming preferred access to the airwaves. They vowed  access to the airwaves would be determined only by the quality of the shows. I was working at NBC back then, and I didn't buy that line one bit. Sure enough, within a couple of years, NBC was the largest supplier of its own prime-time programming. To take advantage of this new paradigm, Disney bought ABC, Viacom (the parent company of Paramount) bought CBS and NBC merged with Universal. And since these conglomerates owned both the pipes through which Americans received information (in this case, TV networks) and the information itself (in this case, TV shows), they developed a monopoly over what you could watch. Today, if you're an independent producer, it's nearly impossible to get a show on the air unless the network owns at least a piece of it. Now Comcast, the nation's largest cable provider, and NBC/Universal want to merge. This new behemoth would be able to charge other cable carriers more for NBC, MSNBC, CNBC, Bravo and the 35 other cable networks it will own in whole or in part. This means that other carriers won't be able to afford as many choices -- and it means that your cable bill will go up. Comcast is also the nation's largest home internet service provider. And as more and more of our television is provided through the internet, other internet giants such as Verizon and AT&T will have to look toward merging with CBS/Viacom or ABC/Disney. We'll end up with a few megacorporations in control of the flow of information -- not just on TV, but now online as well. From my seat on the Judiciary Committee, I plan to do everything I can to stop these mergers or at least put rigorous restrictions on them. But if this trend toward media consolidation continues, the free and open internet will be a thing of the past unless we write the principle of net neutrality into law right now. This isn't a liberal or conservative issue. Everyone has a stake in protecting the First Amendment. And it isn't even strictly a political issue. The internet's freedom and openness has made it a hotbed for innovations that change our lives. It's been an incredible engine of job creation. The internet was developed at taxpayer expense to benefit the public interest. If we let corporations prioritize some content over others, we'll lose what makes it so valuable to our economy, our democracy and our daily lives. Net neutrality may sound like a technical issue, but it's the key to preserving the internet as we know it -- and it's the most important First Amendment issue of our time. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sen. Al Franken.","Al Franken: Trend of media consolidation  will mean end of free and open internet .

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday, millions of Americans visiting their favorite websites will encounter the same dreaded image: the spinning wheel of death. This is the symbol of the great ""Internet Slowdown"" -- a coordinated day of action among hundreds of organizers and some of the world's largest tech firms, including Netflix, Twitter, Etsy, Kickstarter, Mozilla, Foursquare, Reddit, and WordPress. Together they are showing the American public what most of the Internet would look like in a world without ""net neutrality."" In a word: slow. These spinning wheels of death foreshadow a future that could be right around the corner. If the Federal Communications Commission adopts its proposed rules, Internet service providers like Comcast or Verizon will be allowed to provide ""fast lanes"" to websites and services that pay, and slow lanes to the rest. This means that it will be harder for Americans to access those sites that can't afford to pay fees -- including those of new businesses, nonprofits, educators, artists, activists, and faith groups. The result? Startup innovation, free expression, and democratic discourse in America will suffer. The good news is that it's not too late to save the Internet as we know it. The FCC is legally obligated to listen to the American people before adopting its rules. The deadline for submitting comments is September 15, so this is our chance to speak up. There is much at stake. The FCC's proposed rules threaten our ability to access the applications, content, and services of our choice -- the very principle behind ""net neutrality,"" the idea that high-speed Internet providers should treat all types of Web content equally. Net neutrality explained . Companies that provide gateways to the Internet shouldn't interfere with our ability to access what we want online, whether through blocking, discrimination, or giving better service to those who can pay. The FCC's current proposal would allow them to do just that. This means that we could encounter the spinning wheel of death on any site that can't afford to pay. ""Slow lanes"" spell doom for innovation. On the Internet, the costs of innovation are incredibly low, and entrepreneurs don't need massive upfront funding or permission to pursue their ideas. The proposed rules would change that. If established companies can pay so that their content loads faster or does not count against users' monthly bandwidth caps, then that student working on a bright idea in a dorm room doesn't have a chance to compete. Many of today's popular applications -- Google, Facebook, Skype, or eBay -- were developed by innovators with little or no outside funding. In a world where such innovations are stuck in the slow lane, they would have never seen the light of day. Innovation isn't the only thing that will suffer. Today, the open Internet is also a space where all Americans, no matter the color of their skin or size of their wallets, have an equal opportunity to express themselves, organize politically, and connect with one another. Under the new rules, it will be harder to hear those who can't pay -- educators, nonprofits, activists, writers, independent filmmakers and musicians. If Internet service providers have the power to block, discriminate or charge access fees, we risk losing this critical space for democratic discourse, political action, and creative expression. According to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, the FCC doesn't need to ban access fees to prevent this from happening. Instead, the chairman proposes regulating the quality of Internet service to make sure that the slow lane is not too slow. If the slow lane is good enough, he argues, those who can't pay can still get to their users and have a chance to compete. But it's not the quality of the slow lane that is the problem; it's that there IS a faster lane that provides a better experience. According to research, increasing load times by as little as 100 milliseconds reduces the amount of time people spend on a site, how much they buy, and whether they come back. Thus, under the FCC's proposal, those who can't pay to be in the faster lane will have fewer users or readers, fewer sales, and less advertising revenue. This problem affects every application, website and service, not just delay-sensitive applications like online video. Improving the quality of the slower lane does not remove that problem. We are still stuck with the quality differential between paying and nonpaying applications. So what should we do? We should ask the FCC to throw out the current proposal and instead adopt strong rules that do not allow Internet service providers to block or discriminate or charge access fees. Such rules exist. In 2010, the FCC adopted Open Internet Rules that weren't perfect, but a step in the right direction. A federal court struck down those rules this year on a technicality: The FCC adopted them under the wrong authority. According to the court, a ban on access fees can only be imposed on entities that -- unlike Internet service providers -- have been classified as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act. The solution is simple. The FCC needs to reclassify Internet service providers as ""common carriers"" and enact the network neutrality rules we need under Title II of the Communications Act. Wednesday's ""Internet Slowdown"" is a glimpse into the future, but we have the power to avoid that fate. More than 1.2 million comments are already filed with the FCC. People who care about the open Internet are calling on Congress and the White House to stand with them. We should join them. As long as the Internet is an open and equal space, we have a voice. Let's not squander the moment.","Writer: Some tech firms will participate in Internet slowdown Wednesday to send message .

"The Justice Department's sweeping collection of Associated Press phone records as part of a national security leak investigation has had a chilling effect on sources, the news agency's top executive said on Wednesday. ""Some of our long-trusted sources have become nervous and anxious about talking to us -- even on stories that aren't about national security,"" AP Chief Executive and President Gary Pruitt said at the National Press Club. ""In some cases, government employees that we once checked in with regularly will no longer speak to us by phone and some are reluctant to meet in person,"" he said. The Justice Department subpoenaed and subsequently obtained two months of AP phone records as part of an investigation of its May 2012 coverage of a foiled airline bomb plot in Yemen. Toll records would show what numbers were dialed from the AP lines and what numbers dialed in, but would not provide any information on the content of conversations. No reporters were singled out as potential criminals, but the scope of the subpoena surrounding leak of classified information provoked outrage among media and concern from civil libertarians, privacy advocates and some members of Congress. A second, similar case involving a Fox News reporter's e-mails regarding a separate leak of classified information on an unrelated national security story added fuel to the media controversy. President Barack Obama has said he was ""troubled by the possibility that leak investigations may chill the investigative journalism that holds government accountable."" Pruitt said the AP could have helped the Justice Department narrow the scope of the subpoena had it ""come to us in advance."" He added that a court could have decided the matter if the DOJ and the AP didn't agree. ""There was never that opportunity. Instead, the DOJ acted as judge, jury and executioner in private -- in secret,"" he said. The Justice Department defended its scrutiny, saying previously that it followed its own regulations in acquiring subpoenas and exhausted other methods to find out who might have leaked the information before seeking phone records. It said investigators conducted more than 550 interviews and examined tens of thousands of pages of documents before issuing subpoenas involving phone lines. Justice Department rules call for negotiations with news organizations on such issues unless there is a ""substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation."" Attorney General Eric Holder has subsequently said he will never prosecute reporters for doing their job. Pruitt, who is also a First Amendment lawyer, worries about precedent. ""If reporters' phone records are now open territory for the government to secretly monitor, then news sources will be intimidated from talking to reporters. The AP is not going to be intimidated, but our sources will be,"" Pruitt said. Pruitt says other news organizations also have experienced sources worried about speaking to them. ""This chilling effect is not just at AP. ... Journalists from other news organizations have personally told me (the DOJ's seizing of AP's phone records) has intimidated sources from speaking to them,"" he said. Holder has launched a review of Justice Department guidelines on investigations involving the press, and has met with media executives about it. Obama has given Holder a July 12 deadline to come up with some suggestions for possibly changing the approach.","Justice Department subpoenaed Associated Press phone records as part of leak probe .

Delta Air Lines came out on top in baggage and reservation change/cancellation fees, collecting $1.6 billion last year. Delta's baggage fees totaled $865.9 million and it collected $778.4 million in change/cancellation fees.

"Two al Qaeda gunmen tried to kidnap two U.S. Embassy employees in Yemen last month but were shot and killed by one of the Americans, a Yemeni government official told CNN on Saturday. The attempted kidnapping was carried out by two armed men with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) on April 24, and the fatal shooting occurred near a Yemeni barbershop ""where many foreigners and diplomats go to get their hair cut,"" the Yemeni official said. The two U.S. Embassy personnel, however, were apparently wayward and shouldn't have been at the barbershop, the official said. ""These individuals violated security protocol,"" the Yemeni official said. ""U.S. Embassy personnel are not allowed to leave their secure facilities. The American who shot the kidnappers had a gun permit and was authorized to carry a gun. The two armed kidnappers were AQAP militants. They weren't unarmed civilians."" Marie Harf, deputy spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, said in a statement: ""We can confirm that, last month, two U.S. Embassy officers in Yemen fired their weapons after being confronted by armed individuals in an attempted kidnapping at a small commercial business in Sa'ana. Two of the armed individuals were killed. The Embassy officers are no longer in Yemen."" Two Yemeni national security officials told CNN the plot against the Embassy is bigger than initially believed. The revelation of the incident comes after the U.S. Embassy in Yemen was indefinitely shuttered Wednesday amid security concerns and as fighting between security forces and AQAP intensifies, including in the capital, Sanaa. Just days before the alleged abduction attempt, a joint U.S.-Yemeni operation was being carried out against AQAP in the Abyan and Shabwa regions of Yemen, but authorities did not disclose whether drones were used in the strikes. The use of the unmanned drones has stirred controversy due to the accidental killings of civilians in some cases, a high-level Yemeni official said at the time. On Saturday, a top Yemen Interior Ministry official said the U.S. government had been considering closing the embassy two weeks ago, as attacks on foreigners  intensified. The violence at the barbershop -- as well as violence against other foreigners in the past six weeks -- eventually convinced the Americans to close down the U.S. Embassy this past week, the official said. Meanwhile, the Yemen Defense Ministry announced that seven more AQAP fighters were killed Saturday in the southern province of Shabwa during clashes with security forces. Of all al Qaeda-affiliated networks worldwide, AQAP is considered the most dangerous threat to Americans. Meanwhile, the Yemeni government Thursday expelled U.S. freelance journalist Adam Baron on accusations that ""there was an issue with his documentation,"" the Committee to Protect Journalists said. On Twitter, Baron said the only official explanation for his deportation was he's ""no longer welcome in Yemen."" He's written for the Christian Science Monitor and McClatchy and has lived in the Yemen capital since January 2011, his website says. A second U.S. freelancer, Tik Root, was denied entry Thursday into Yemen after flying to Sanaa from Istanbul because, an unidentified Yemeni official told CPJ, he lacked a journalist visa. A Yemeni national security source said Saturday that two American journalists were recently barred because they are a high target for kidnapping with their continuous movements. The source also cited the growing AQAP attacks in Sanaa. At least seven journalists were abducted last year in Yemen, CPR said.

"Saudi Arabia reported significantly more deaths from the MERS virus on Tuesday, the same day the country sacked one of its top health officials. The Saudi  Ministry of Health reported that 282 people have died since 2012 from the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, or MERS-CoV, a major uptick from the previous official death toll of 190. This is out of 688 total cases in the Arab nation; 353 patients have recovered and 53 are still receiving treatment. About five weeks ago, Saudi Arabia was reporting 339 known cases of MERS-CoV, 102 of which had resulted in deaths. The new numbers came out the same day that acting Health Minister Adel bin Mohammed Fakieh announced he had relieved Deputy Health Minister Dr. Ziad Memish from his post, according to a statement on the health ministry's website. No reason was given. Last week, the World Health Organization reported it was aware of 636 ""laboratory-confirmed cases"" of MERS infections, which had led to 193 deaths. It is not immediately clear how Saudi Arabia's latest figures affect those numbers. There are documented cases of the virus around the world. As a coronavirus, MERS is in the same group of illnesses as the common cold. But it is much more lethal: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that about 30% of those infected have died. Those with MERS have severe acute respiratory illness, including symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath. Some develop more dangerous complications like pneumonia and kidney failure. There is no vaccine or special treatment. MERS is thought to have originated on the Arabian Peninsula in 2012. No one knows exactly where it came from, but evidence implicating camels is emerging. In a recently published study in mBio, researchers said they isolated live MERS virus from two single-humped camels, known as dromedaries. They found multiple substrains in the camel viruses, including one that perfectly matches a substrain isolated from a human patient. MERS: 5 things to know .

"Saudi health officials are stepping up efforts to fight the Middle East respiratory symptom coronavirus, or MERS-CoV, after a recent spike in cases. Saudi Arabia confirmed more than 50 cases of the virus in the past week, at least seven of which were fatal. The Saudi Health Ministry says 13 new cases were reported Monday alone, bringing the total to 257. It is not clear why there was a sudden increase, said Dr. Abdullah Al-Asiri, assistant undersecretary at the Saudi Ministry of Health and a member of the Scientific Committee of Infectious Diseases. ""We have faced an increase in the number of cases around the same time last year at the end of winter,"" the Saudi Press Agency quotes him as saying. Should I be concerned? Last week, reports on social media said health care workers had refused to treat MERS-CoV patients. The government has since issued a statement saying ambulance services that refused would be suspended from work and investigated. Saudi officials have also called on the World Health Organization and a group of medical experts to meet at the end of this month to discuss the status of the virus. In a prepared statement, Ministry of Health spokesman Khalid Marghalani said a drug company would be arriving in Saudi Arabia to discuss the production of a vaccine to fight the virus. MERS-CoV was discovered in September 2012. The World Health Organization reported Sunday that 250 cases have been confirmed globally with 93 deaths worldwide. A new cluster of the virus was reported in the United Arab Emirates this week, as were the first cases in Greece and Malaysia. MERS-CoV comes from the same group of viruses as the common cold and attacks the respiratory system, the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Symptoms, which include fever, cough and shortness of breath, can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure. Although many of the cases have occurred on the Arabian Peninsula, people have died of the infection elsewhere, including in European countries and Tunisia in North Africa. However, all of the people involved contracted the disease in the Middle East before being diagnosed. Limited human-to-human transmission of the disease has also occurred in other countries. Health officials do not know exactly how the virus spreads, and they stress hygiene, such as diligent hand-washing, to limit its spread. The WHO has not recommended any MERS-related travel restrictions but says member countries should monitor any unusual respiratory infection patterns in travelers to the Arabian Peninsula. After the spike in cases, Dr. Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al-Rabiah stepped down as minister of health, state media reported Monday.

They have since been forced out of power, but Christian and Muslim militias continue to battle for control. Human rights investigators said the March 29 incident began when Chadian national army soldiers entered Bangui in a convoy of several military pick-up trucks. They entered a crowded market where shoppers included women and children, and opened fire, a U.N. report said Friday. ""As panic-stricken people fled in all directions, the soldiers allegedly continued firing indiscriminately,"" said Rupert Colville, spokesman for the U.N.'s office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. ""Several sources told the investigating team that they believed the Chadian force had entered Bangui to extract remaining Chadians and other Muslim inhabitants in order to save them from further attacks by (Christian militias),""  Colville said. The U.N. said the soldiers who were responsible for the Bangui attack were Chadian soldiers but not among those who are part of the African-led International Support Mission peacekeeping mission that's trying to stabilize the Central African Republic. ""It seems they have gone straight back to Chad without being apprehended,"" Colville said of the attackers. About 850 Chadian soldiers are part of the 6,000-strong peacekeeping presence, but on Thursday, Chad's foreign ministry issued a statement saying the country planned to withdraw its troops from the force, according to CNN French affiliate BFMTV. ""Despite the sacrifices we have made, Chad and Chadians have been targeted in a gratuitous and malicious campaign that blamed them for all the suffering in (Central African Republic),"" said a statement from Chad's foreign ministry.","The U.N. accuses soldiers from Chad of killing civilians in the Central African Republic .

"As Puerto Rico struggles with a massive debt crisis, a top congressional investigator has questions about the island government's decision to nullify an agreement that would have returned about $230 million in overpaid taxes to a major bank. House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa sent a letter last month to Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla asking for a briefing on his administration's decision to unilaterally nullify the agreement between the Puerto Rico Treasury Department, known as Hacienda, and Doral Financial Corporation, the second largest mortgage provider on the island. Doral has said the Padilla administration's decision to pull out of the agreement could hurt its financial condition. Because Doral Bank's deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Issa wrote that the Puerto Rican Treasury's ""actions place federal dollars ... at risk."" ""To enable the committee to better understand the nature of this risk, and the consequences of Hacienda's actions, I respectfully request that appropriate Puerto Rico administration officials provide a briefing to committee staff,"" Issa wrote. Read Issa's letter (PDF) Issa's letter comes as Doral battles Puerto Rico for a $230 million tax refund it says it's owed. After Puerto Rico decided not to refund the money, the FDIC essentially told the bank it could no longer count the $230 million toward its capital requirements. Deadline imposed . The regulator gave the bank 120 days to find other ways to meet its capital requirements or face possible sale, merger or liquidation. An Oversight Committee aide said that one of the questions the California Republican wants answered is whether the FDIC would have to expend federal taxpayer money in the event the bank liquidates and isn't able to make all its depositors whole. The FDIC declined to comment. For its part, the Democratic governor's office argues that the agreement, signed under a previous administration, is null because Doral's supporting paperwork did not prove that the bank had overpaid its taxes. Just last week, debt rater Moody's downgraded the U.S. territory's credit rating further into junk status -- a theme Doral hit in a statement to CNN. ""The government's decision to nullify its agreement with Doral was unexpected,"" the bank said, and ""comes at the very time that the island teeters on financial insolvency. Nevertheless, the government's financial situation should have no bearing on its willingness to fulfill its obligation to honor a legally binding agreement with Doral or any other business."" In the statement, Doral spokeswoman Miriam Warren said while bank officials had not seen Issa's letter, ""We believe that an inquiry from the chairman and his committee represents a significant step in making the government of Puerto Rico accountable for its troubling behavior in this case."" Barbara Morgan, a spokeswoman for the governor's administration, said in a statement that the Treasury Department determined there had been no overpayment and Doral's allegations ""are without merit."" ""Doral's financial situation was not caused by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and its regulatory issues began many years before the Treasury's determination to nullify the 2012 closing agreement,"" she said, adding that administration officials are working with Issa's staff to provide the information he requested.","House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa asks Puerto Rico's governor to respond .

"The ancient city of Homs is now a warzone as President Bashar al-Assad's army strikes fiercely at the heart of Syria's 11-month-old anti-government uprising. Hundreds in Homs have been killed by rockets, mortar rounds and snipers' bullets since the start of the year, say opposition groups, as the Syrian regime tries to regain control of the country's third largest city. The humanitarian crisis in Homs is worsening -- dozens are reported dead nearly every day, and opposition activists say they don't have enough doctors or medical supplies to treat the wounded. Homs, known as the capital of the revolution, has seen the worst of the violence that has left at least 6,000 people dead since protests began in Syria in March 2011. Located in the agricultural heartland of central Syria, the city has long been a transport and commercial hub of vital strategic importance. The road through Homs connects the capital, Damascus, in the south to Syria's largest city, Aleppo, in the north. Homs is home to one of two oil refineries in the country; preserving that oil supply is crucial to the Assad regime's ongoing efforts to crush the anti-government movement there. The city's citizens, known as ""Homsies,"" hold a contradictory place in the Syrian national conscience, according to Chris Phillips, a Syria analyst for the Economist Intelligence Unit. ""Homsies are often the butt of jokes in Syria,"" said Phillips, ""but they've actually got quite a large cultural and educational influence on the country."" The city of 1 million is one of Syria's most ethnically diverse. Traditionally a Sunni Muslim merchant town, a considerable number of Alawite Muslims, a Shia sect, have settled in Homs in the past 30 years, and there also is a small Christian population in the city. ""We live in a complex community, with many different sects and religions,"" a Homs opposition spokesman -- who uses the name Abu Rami to hide his real identity from security forces -- told CNN. ""Before the uprising, we were all living here as brothers and we didn't think there were differences between us,"" said Rami from central Homs, where scores have been killed in non-stop fighting between opposition and regime forces this month. Homs is more warzone than city now, he says. Parts of the city are without electricity; in other parts, security forces shut off the electricity and telecommunications networks ahead of early morning raids to root out opposition members. ""If you're in a place where they cut off the power or the phones, you know you're in trouble,"" said Rami. There is a shortage of everything from children's milk formula to oil for heating, and he says security forces are preventing medical aid from reaching dying citizens. Many of the injured are being treated in field hospitals in civilian homes, including some who died from wounds that would not have been fatal with proper care. ""Every day there are murders -- snipers on the roofs are shooting anything that moves, preventing the arrival of medical supplies and shooting at ambulances. It's a very hard situation,"" said Rami. A 26-year-old born and raised in a middle class family in Homs, Rami left his medical studies at Al Baath University to help organize protests against al-Assad's government in March. But the city and its once-vibrant sidewalk cafe culture are now in lockdown mode after fighting intensified there recently. Defectors from the military have joined volunteers in forming the Free Syrian Army in Homs, and residents in some neighborhoods have organized into armed defense committees, according to a report from Human Rights Watch. With at least 60 checkpoints set up in Homs and dozens of tanks now surrounding the city, the opposition fears al-Assad is plotting an attack that could rival the 1982 crackdown in Hama, when regime tanks and troops killed thousands of people and reduced parts of that city to rubble. President al-Assad denies responsibility for the escalating violence in Syria, and distanced himself from his armed forces in a recent television interview. ""They are not my forces,"" al-Assad told ABC's Barbara Walters. ""They are forces for the government. I don't own them. I'm president. I don't own the country. So they are not my forces."" The bloodshed has left city residents on edge. Public life is limited to about six hours each day from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., says Rami -- shops close soon after that and people are rarely seen on the street. Rami himself hid in a friend's basement in the relatively calm Al Ghouta neighborhood for days, as he didn't feel safe to return to his own home. ""My neighborhood is surrounded by shabiha thugs and I'm afraid to be arrested or killed,"" he told CNN. The ""shabiha"" pro-regime militia, reportedly working alongside government forces, has been blamed by the opposition for attempting to stoke sectarian tensions in Homs. And while Homs has traditionally been a place of religious tolerance, Syria expert Phillips told CNN ""there is a real sense now that that is changing and being manipulated by people on both sides"" of the conflict. ""The older Sunni merchant class that feel the city is theirs rightfully are now turning on the Alawites, who they see as these recent migrants that don't actually belong in the city,"" said Phillips. ""Alawites live on the outskirts; they're not seen as really part of the old city. They don't fall within the old city boundaries, they're recent migrants and [some Sunnis] are not very happy with them."" While certain elements of the Sunni community would like to overthrow the Alawite al-Assad and retake what they see as their rightful place as leaders of Syria, Phillips says the Alawite community fears the prospect of persecution if the government falls. ""The regime is trying to persuade the Alawites that if they abandon the government, they will be wiped out in the dog-eat-dog aftermath,"" he said. According to Phillips, those who have spent the last 11 months protesting every day in Homs fear that ""if they stop doing this, then they will be crushed."" Rami said he would like to stay in Homs if and when the uprising ends. ""I hope Homs will be okay,"" he said. ""I hope in the future we'll stand together in Homs."" As the death count continues to rise and prospects for peace in the near future dims, Rami believes the war in Homs can only end one of two ways. ""Either we all die,"" he said, ""or we get victory at the end.""","Homs, Syria's third largest city, is known as the capital of the revolution .

"Do you have tons of Facebook friends and often update your status? If so, you may be a narcissist, a new study suggests. Research from Western Illinois University showed a link between the number of Facebook friends you have and how active you are on the site to the likelihood of being a ""socially disruptive"" narcissist. The study -- which was recently published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences -- was conducted among 300 participants, who took a Narcissistic Personality Inventory questionnaire. Those with more Facebook friends, who tagged themselves in photos and updated their status throughout the day were more likely to have narcissistic traits. ""People who have a heightened need to feel good about themselves will often turn to Facebook as a way to do so,"" study author Chris Carpenter from Western Illinois University told Mashable. ""Facebook gives those with narcissistic tendencies the opportunity to exploit the site to get the feedback they need and become the center of attention."" See also: Survey says facebook feeds narcissism (study) Carpenter said that Facebook users that self-promote themselves on the site show signs of two narcissistic behaviors. The first is called grandiose exhibition (GE), which refers to people who love to be the center of attention. The second is a category that involves entitlement/explotiveness (EE), which indicates how far people will go to get the respect and attention they think they deserve. ""There isn't a baseline of how many friends a person has or how often they update their status that would qualify as them to have these narcissistic characteristics,"" Carpenter said. ""However, it's interesting to note how often these people use first-person pronouns such as 'I' and 'me' on the site."" This isn't the first time a study has been conducted about Facebook narcissists. In 2010, a study published from York University highlighted the differences between how men and women self-promoted themselves on Facebook. Men tended to promote themselves in the ""About Me"" description, while women used pictures that ""include[d] revealing, flashy and adorned photos of their physical appearance.""

"It started with a chance conversation between a doctor and a nurse several years ago. But that brief encounter may end up exposing what could be one of the largest Medicare frauds in U.S. history. Dr. Alon Vainer, a medical director at dialysis clinics in Georgia, was discussing clinic procedures with one of the nurses, Daniel Barbir. The two men say they saw something they believed was very wrong: expensive medicine, and lots of it, was being tossed in the trash. And the clinic workers were being told to do it, the two men say. ""When we sat down and started talking about it and getting into details, we actually realized exactly what was going on,"" Vainer said. The alleged waste was being carried out on a massive scale and, the nurse and the doctor said, they knew why almost immediately. They claim it was a way for their company, DaVita Inc., to defraud the government, overbill Medicare and Medicaid and make a fortune. ""We're talking in the hundreds of millions, easily,"" Vainer said. ""The profit this company raked from those two schemes, only from those two drugs, was hundreds of millions of dollars."" The allegations of massive fraud have implications for all Americans. The alleged fraud would have involved Medicare and Medicaid patients, whose medicine is paid for by U.S. taxpayers. Vainer and Barbir said the alleged fraud schemes they discovered were going on at the company's clinics all across the country -- at the time, about 2003 through 2010, more than 1,800 -- with tens of thousands of patients. It was enormous, they claim, and Vanier said it was all a deliberate strategy coordinated by the company. ""It was just a scheme in order to fraudulently increase and maximize and boost the Medicare revenue, Medicare payment, so therefore fraudulently increase their revenue,"" he said. DaVita Inc., based in downtown Denver, is one of the nation's largest dialysis companies. The name means ""Giving Life"" in Italian. The company just moved into a brand new $101 million office tower, complete with fountains, gardens and even a suspended ski gondola inside for private meetings. DaVita has grown in the past couple of years and now runs roughly 2,000 dialysis clinics across the country, which has added up to a $7 billion business. The dialysis empire is run by CEO Kent Thiry, who dresses like one of the Three Musketeers, has adopted a company slogan of 'One for all and all for one' and in company staff meetings leads his employees, who he calls villagers, in cheers of ""DaVita!"" Thiry is reportedly paid an estimated $15 million a year, according to the Wall Street Journal, which has called him the best compensated CEO in Colorado. Most of DaVita's revenue comes from a single source: taxpayers. More than two-thirds of DaVita's revenue comes from Medicare and Medicaid payments. If Vainer and Barbir's allegations are true, the company threw away hundreds of millions of dollars of medicine, and taxpayers paid for it. And, if true, the alleged fraud schemes could represent one of the largest Medicare frauds in U.S. history. Vanier explained to CNN how DaVita instructed its nurses to administer a 100-milligram dose of the iron drug Venofor. ""For example, if a patient requires this dose once per week, you'd administer 100 milligrams, waste nothing and charge Medicare for 100 milligrams,"" he said. ""But what DaVita did, instead of charge (for) one vial, they give 50 milligrams of this vial (and) put the residual into the trash."" he said. With another vial, he said, the company would give 25 milligrams to a patient and put the rest in the trash, then repeat it with yet another vial, when one vial could have been given without waste. The more vials DaVita used, the more the company was able to bill the government, the men say. Vainer and Barbir claim they tried to call attention to the massive waste and tried to get it stopped.  But instead, they say, they were basically told to stop causing trouble and to continue following the company's protocols. ""That's what upset me the most,"" Barbir said. ""and that's when I went to Dr. Vainer. I said, 'Dr. Vainer, I can't do that.'"" Barbir says he quit his job and left the clinic rather than continue where fraud was going on. Vainer claims the company punished him for speaking up. ""Of course, once they found out, they did not renew my medical directorship or my practice,"" Vainer claimed. ""We are a three-physician practice, and it was a significant loss of revenue."" Today, both men have filed a whistleblower lawsuit under the U.S. False Claims Act on behalf of the U.S. government, charging DaVita with massive Medicare fraud. They stand to make millions if DaVita is found guilty. DaVita's CEO wouldn't talk, but the company's attorney Kim Rivera did. When asked about the plaintiffs' allegation that DaVita had come up with so-called schemes to throw away drugs and maximize profits, Rivera said: ""Well that's just wrong. If you look at the facts of the case, first of all, the doctors make the dosing decisions.... When you look at what the practices were -- decisions being made by doctors, based on what was in the best interest of their patients. And they took into account a variety of things. ""You can't just look at one issue. You have to look at things like infection control, what the patient's going to do, how the patient's going to do with particular doses. And so, during that entire time what we did, what the doctors did, was appropriate."" But other companies, including DaVita's main competitor, used smaller vials and smaller combinations at times, limiting what was thrown away. DaVita reiterated its decisions to throw away medicine were for ""sound clinical reasons"" and ""never to increase wastage."" Plaintiffs' attorneys Lin Wood and Marlan Wilbanks, who claim DaVita made as much as $800 million over-billing the government, say that DaVita's defense won't hold up in court. ""It's not just the taxpayers that are the victims here, it's the health care system,"" Wood said. ""It doesn't take a graduate degree to understand what's going on here,"" Wilbanks said. ""This is just dishonesty."" DaVita denies that and vows to fight the case in court. But earlier this year, while denying it did anything wrong, DaVita settled a similar case in Texas for $55 million. Pat Burns, with the watchdog group ""Taxpayers Against Fraud,"" says the bigger problem is that even if a company gets caught cheating the government, the company executives never seem to face any punishment. Fines are paid and business continues as usual. ""The way it's set up right now, if the fraud is not caught, then taxpayers foot the bill, Burns said. ""If the fraud is caught, stockholders foot the bill."" Burns and others have been arguing for much harsher treatment when companies are found guilty of defrauding the federal government. He points to record billion-dollar fines, particularly in the pharmaceutical business, that are paid, but executives don't get punished and the companies continue to do business with the government. In fact, one of DaVita's defenses to CNN is that the federal government itself declined to charge the company with wrongdoing, even after reviewing the fraud allegations. ""The government has come in and thoroughly investigated what the allegations are, and in both cases the government decided to drop it and move on,"" Rivera said. Federal prosecutors in Georgia declined to intervene in the case but stated in a letter that decision ""should not be construed as a statement about the merits of the case."" The short-staffed U.S. Department of Justice declines to join lawsuits all the time, instead allowing private citizens who hire private lawyers to essentially prosecute for the government, Burns said. ""The U.S. Department of Justice simply doesn't have the people,"" Burns said. ""It should have the people. I think we all would agree to that. It simply doesn't."" Which brings us back to the original meeting of one doctor and one nurse who now stand to make millions if these allegations of fraud are proven true. The biggest winners, though, in their lawsuit could be taxpayers. The U.S. government will recover the bulk of whatever they win. They and others like them are essentially the U.S. taxpayers' deputies in the fight against health care fraud. Asked if they are surprised that they have to defend the U.S. taxpayer, Barbir said simply, ""I'm not surprised. It's not easy to come forward and stand up and tell the truth, but it's the right thing to do."" The case is set for trial later next year.","A doctor and nurse have filed a whistleblower suit against DaVita Dialysis .
The two claim the company was over-billing Medicare and Medicaid .
They say the company was wasting medication and throwing it away .
The company denies the claims, saying decisions were made in patients' best interests ."
"The boy was scared, angry, insecure. His dad was away in prison, and the son didn't know how to grapple with his loss. ""Everybody says my father is so bad, but I really love him,"" the boy said. Sharon Content still recalls that conversation -- a reminder of her life's calling. She worked on Wall Street for five years before realizing that she needed something more meaningful. ""I just didn't feel satisfied,"" she said. Content is the founder of the Brooklyn, New York-based Children of Promise organization, aimed at helping children cope with having a mother or father in prison. Her organization works with about 200 children between the ages of 6 and 16, all of whom have at least one parent in prison. ""I call them the silent victims of incarceration,"" Content said. ""They're not the victim who the crime was committed against, but they are feeling the ramifications of their parents doing time."" More than 2.7 million children in America have a parent in prison, according to a 2010 study (PDF) by The Pew Charitable Trusts. For the vast majority, there are few outlets for the kids. Children are left to be reared by grandmothers, aunts, moms -- themselves often already struggling below the poverty line. Sometimes, they fall into the hands of the state. In some countries, children actually grow up behind bars with their parents because no one else can raise them and there isn't a social safety net large enough to take care of them all. Pushpa Basnet, one of this year's top 10 CNN Heroes, runs a home in Nepal where dozens of these children can live a more normal life, even in their parents' absence. At her organization in Brooklyn, Content says separation from parents often leads to depression, anxiety and anger. In some cases, the kids witnessed the crimes their parents committed, so the group works with the children to remove the stigma they may feel. ""There's so many different scenarios that these young people go through,"" Content said. ""But the one thing that's consistent is, there's a level of embarrassment of what your parent did, and they shoulder that level of shame."" Across town from Content, Christopher Watler runs the Harlem Community Justice Center, a nonprofit group that works with the state court system in helping inmates re-enter society. It helps about 250 inmates a year find jobs, get mental health treatment and strive for a life beyond crime. ""Lots of times when a guy comes home, there's a lot of excitement, and the families welcome them back home,"" Watler said. ""But very soon after the honeymoon phase of the release ends, the reality starts to sink in: When are you going to get a job? ""For some, those pressures can lead them back. We don't want that."" Many times, a parent has missed large chunks of his child's most formative years while serving time. That can create awkward and tense moments upon his or her return. Watler's organization works with a ""family re-entry"" social worker and interfaith groups to help ease that transition by providing help with rent, food and little things like diapers. ""If you're arguing because you don't have Pampers to contribute to the household,"" Watler said, ""we want to help solve that problem in the short term until you get on your feet."" They especially focus on men and women 18 to 24 years old, who are at the highest risk of committing crimes again. Watler's group provides counseling to give them the skills to be a successful parent while emphasizing that staying crime-free is an important lesson for their kids to witness. ""They want to have those relationships with their children,"" he said. At Children of Promise, more than 100 letters of thanks adorn the walls. They are notes from parents in prison thanking the organization for keeping them in contact with their children. ""They're happy that we still respect this very important relationship,"" Content said. The children in the after-school and summer programs write to their moms and dads every two weeks. They include photographs, report cards and other items going on in their lives. Often the kids will ask each other: What did you tell your dad? In Nepal, Basnet also wants to preserve the bond between parent and child. During school holidays, she sends the younger children to the prisons to visit, and she brings them food, clothing and fresh water during their stay. She also started a program to teach the parents how to make handicrafts, which she sells to raise money for the children's care. ""Often, they think that they're useless because they're in prison,"" Basnet said. ""I want to make them feel that they are contributing."" Who's your CNN Hero of the Year? Cast your vote now! Content believes that programs tailored to children are vital in breaking the generational cycle of incarceration. ""The cycle doesn't continue because (the children) saw behavior and repeated it,"" she said. ""From my experience working with the population, the cycle repeats itself because of the lack of support that this young person now has after going through these traumatic experiences."" The children are allowed to still be kids at her program. They play sports and other recreational activities. But the children also talk in groups about their feelings, and they are allowed access mental health support. ""Young people who have lost a parent to military deployment or death or even divorce, society has a level of compassion and understanding for that,"" Content said. ""But for a child who loses a parent to incarceration, that same level of empathy doesn't exist."" She recalls consoling the one boy who wondered about whether it was OK to love his father. ""Your dad is not bad,"" she told him. ""He made some bad decisions and ... is paying for those mistakes. You can feel good about loving him."" Content knows that helping 200 children is ""just a drop in the bucket"" compared with millions of kids with incarcerated parents. But she hopes her organization grows, first statewide and then nationwide, to bring attention to society ""about a population they may not even think about."" ""If I'm able to give a bit of a voice to the population,"" she said, ""I feel like I'm doing my part.""","More than 2.7 million children in America live with a parent in prison, says a recent study .

"The Atlanta Braves have decided to leave the limits of their namesake city because they got ""a terrific deal,"" Mayor Kasim Reed said -- one that was sweeter than he felt comfortable supporting for fear of hurting his municipal government long-term. ""We wanted the Braves to stay in Atlanta, but (there was a) business problem that we had to solve,"" Reed said Tuesday.  ""That choice was encumbering between $150 million and $250 million in debt and not having money to do anything else."" The mayor chose not to go that route, and partly as a result, the Major League Baseball franchise is heading about 12 miles north to Cobb County. This new multimillion-dollar stadium, which will be part of a larger retail and entertainment complex, is scheduled to open in 2017 to the northwest, where two major interstates -- Interstates 75 and 285 -- meet, the Braves announced Monday. Atlanta Mayor: Cost too high . A day later, Reed admitted that he was taken aback by the news. While the team and city had been engaged in negotiations over the past 18 months -- and he'd ""still felt that we could get a deal done"" -- the mayor said his first indication that something had changed came after being contacted by a Braves official on November 6, a day after his re-election. Reed said he learned about the baseball club's new thinking, including a reported offer of $450 million of public financing from Cobb County, the next day. The city of Atlanta wasn't asked to put up that much money, nor was it asked to build a new stadium, the mayor said. Still, the Braves did ask for extensive public investments in the publicly owned stadium and the surrounding area, money that Reed said he didn't feel the city could give now, given other needs and the desire to keep spending and debt in check. The mayor pointed specifically to a $922 million infrastructure backlog and desires to upgrade roads, expand public spaces and pursue other improvements across the city. ""If we made a different decision,"" Reed said, ""every single dollar for everything else would have gone to fund and modernize the stadium."" Critics have pointed out that, in recent months, city money has been allocated for another stadium in downtown Atlanta: $200 million for a new home for the NFL's Atlanta Falcons. Reed took pains to state that the two stadium deals ""candidly are not close."" The Falcons' one uses revenue from the city's hotel-motel tax but doesn't tap the government's general fund, as a Braves stadium deal might have done. Plus, the mayor added, ""I certainly was not going to try to finance two stadium deals at the exact same time."" The team's contract with Turner Field, which was retrofitted for baseball after the 1996 Olympics, expires in 2016. Club President John Schuerholz said in a video message that Turner Field needs ""hundreds of millions of dollars of upgrades. Unfortunately, that massive investment would not do anything to improve access or the fan experience."" He vowed that the new stadium site ""will be one of the most magnificent in all of baseball. It will thrive with action 365 days a year."" The surrounding area will be a ""mixed-use destination,"" he said. As to what will then happen with the Braves' current home, Reed says it will be demolished to make way for ""one of the largest developments for middle-class people that the city of Atlanta has ever had."" The mayor pointed out that it wasn't like the Braves were leaving the region altogether, insisting that they are and will remain his favorite team. And he credited Cobb County officials with stepping up to make a strong offer. ""$450 million in public financing is a pretty good deal,"" Reed said. ""We can't spend money that liberally in the city of Atlanta. We are fiscal conservatives here."" 8 short-lived sports venues .","Turner Field will be demolished, area will be redeveloped, mayor says .

"Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama's policy of halting deportations for the undocumented parents of children born in the U.S. is popular -- but his method for implementing it is not. Only 26% of Americans think Obama's plan for those immigrants goes too far, while 50% called it about right and 22% said it doesn't go far enough, according to a CNN/ORC poll out Wednesday of 1,045 adults, conducted Nov. 21-23 and with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. However, when asked for their stance on Obama using an executive order to make those changes, just 41% said they favor the move, while 56% said they oppose it. Despite the limited backing for Obama's action, the survey shows that Republicans might have a hard time gaining traction on the issue.

Support for a GOP lawsuit against Obama over his executive order comes from just 38% of Americans, while 60% say Republicans shouldn't challenge the move in court. Instead, 76% said the GOP should spend more time passing immigration reform legislation -- something Obama repeatedly prodded his Republican critics, especially in the House, to do -- while just 21% said the party should focus on overturning Obama's policies. The results come as Republican lawmakers and governors grapple with how they'll respond. Greg Abbott, the incoming Texas Republican governor, said he's likely to announce a legal challenge to Obama's executive order in about two weeks. And House members could push to limit funding for government agencies affected by Obama's action as they debate budget measures in December. RELATED: Abbott: Texas readying challenge to Obama's immigration action . The poll found that 49% of Americans say Obama has the legal authority to loosen deportation policies on his own, while 48% say he doesn't. Obama, meanwhile, got a boost from young people and minorities for his handling of immigration after he announced his executive order last week. Approval of his handling of immigration jumped to 65% from 50% in September among non-whites, and from 39% to 52% among those between ages 18 and 34. His overall marks on immigration also jumped, with 34% of Americans approving of how he's handling the issue in September and 44% approving after last week's announcement. That improvement, though, didn't affect Obama's overall approval rating, which the poll found was at 44% -- little changed from October's 45%. The survey also found evidence of support gradually increasing for easing U.S. policies toward undocumented immigrants and their families. It showed that 75% of Americans say they feel sympathetic toward those immigrants and their families -- up from 67% in 2011 and 52% in 2010.","A CNN/ORC poll shows just 26% of Americans think Obama's immigration action goes too far .

"At least 118 people were killed Tuesday in twin blasts at a market in the central Nigerian city of Jos, an official said, warning the toll could climb. The explosions, which targeted Terminus market, went off some 20 to 30 minutes apart, setting fire to the entire venue. ""The death toll stands at 118. This is the number of victims recovered from the scene of the explosions, but we are still searching through the smoldering debris for more bodies,"" said Mohammed Abdulsalam, coordinator for the National Emergency Management Agency in the city. ""The figure may rise when the search is over,"" Abdulsalam said. A journalist on the scene of the first explosion called it ""massive."" People were screaming and running, some covered in blood. Some had to be carried away, the journalist said. An ambulance driver who asked not to be identified said he saw at least 15 bodies and about 30 injured. Plateau State Commissioner Chris Olakpe described the blasts as ""terrorist activities,"" but refused to speculate on who might be responsible. He said the first blast was a suicide car bomb, while the second was caused by an improvised explosive device in a separate car. Olakpe said 46 people were killed in the blasts and that 45 were injured, disputing the higher death toll provided by Abdulsalam. It is not uncommon for authorities to report conflicting death tolls in the immediate aftermath of attacks. ""Terrorists usually want to cause fear and trepidation,"" said Olakpe. ""By tomorrow, we will get on top of the matter."" In a statement, President Goodluck Jonathan condemned the bombings as a ""tragic assault on human freedom"" and described those behind them as ""cruel and evil."" ""President Jonathan assures all Nigerians that government remains fully committed to winning the war against terror, and this administration will not be cowed by the atrocities of enemies of human progress and civilization,"" the statement said, adding that Nigeria was committed to implementing anti-terrorism measures and resolutions put forth at a recent summit in Paris. When CNN tried to speak with a nurse at a local hospital by phone, she was unable to hear because of victims' cries and screams. CNN had previously reported three blasts at two markets -- Terminus and Abuja. Terminus market is also known as the New Abuja market. A possible third blast may have been a gas canister ignited by the first bomb. Late Sunday, a bomb in the northern Nigerian city of Kano killed at least four people, according to local police. The blast occurred at a busy intersection in a predominantly Christian area of the city and left several cars burning, Kano police spokesman Rabilu Ringim said. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the attack, the spokesman said. Terrorism in Nigeria has been in the spotlight recently since more than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped by the militant group Boko Haram. The terror group abducted 276 girls on April 14 from a boarding school in Chibok in northeastern Nigeria. Dozens escaped, but more than 200 girls are still missing. In his statement Tuesday, Jonathan reaffirmed his government's commitment to take ""every necessary measure"" to find the girls and cooperate with other countries in the region to combat the ""Boko Haram menace."" The president also said Nigeria was determined to ensure safety and security in schools in Borno state and other parts of the country and to rebuild the school in Chibok.

"This year has been the deadliest for journalists in the field since monitoring began 17 years ago, according to an annual report released Wednesday by Reporters Without Borders. Eighty-eight journalists lost their lives while reporting in the middle of wars and bombings, or were killed on orders by corrupt governments, organized crime tied to drug trafficking and by Islamist militias, the report said. This is a 33% rise in journalist deaths since just last year. ""The reason for the unprecedented number of journalists killed in 2012 is mainly the war in Syria, the chaos in Somalia and Taliban violence in Pakistan,"" said Christophe Deloire, secretary-general of the nonprofit group. ""The impunity enjoyed by those responsible for violations of human rights, in particular, the right to freedom of information, encourages the continuation of these violations."" Read the report . In places like Syria, where fighters loyal to President Bashar al-Assad have battled opposition forces for the past 21 months, professional journalists have faced difficulty and persecution while attempting to report. Amateur reporters, using mobile phone cameras and Twitter feeds, have stepped in to tell the story of life in the conflict zones. According to the report, 47 so-called citizen journalists were killed in 2012, compared with five in 2011. In Syria alone, at least 17 journalists, 44 citizen journalists and four media assistants lost their lives, the report said. ""Because of the polarization of information sources, news manipulation, propaganda, technical constraints and the extreme violence to which journalists and citizen journalists are exposed, anyone trying to gather or disseminate news and information in Syria needs a real sense of vocation,"" the Reporters Without Borders report said. ""Without their action, the Syrian regime would be able to impose a total blockade on information in some regions and carry out its massacre with nobody watching."" After Syria, the report said, Somalia was the next most dangerous place for journalists, with 18 killed in 2012, followed by Pakistan, the world's deadliest country for the media from 2009 to 2011, with 10 deaths of media personnel. Organized crime, drug trafficking and government corruption led to the deaths of six journalists in Mexico and five in Brazil, according to Reporters Without Borders, the next two most perilous countries in the world for those trying to report the news.

"Convicted Singaporean match-fixer Wilson Raj Perumal is categorically denying a story published by German weekly Der Spiegel alleging that the Cameroon team was involved in fixing a World Cup game in Brazil. The Cameroon federation -- known as FECAFOOT -- has pledged to investigate Der Spiegel's allegations, which focused on the national side's second Group A game against Croatia -- purportedly based on an interview with Perumal. ""Contrary to the 'revelations' published by the German weekly Der Spiegel that were picked up by news outlets worldwide, I did not predict the result of the Cameroon vs. Croatia match played on June 18, 2014,"" said Perumal in a statement published online. ""The Facebook chat with the Der Spiegel journalist took place a few days after the match -- June 21 -- as confirmed by my Facebook log, and was but an informal assessment of the behavior of the Cameroon team at the Brazil 2014 World Cup after they had played two of their three group stage matches, including the one with Croatia."" CNN has been sent screen grabs of two Facebook conversations between Perumal and the journalist, Rafael Buschmann, by the fixer's representative. The first is dated the June 21 and the second is dated the June 26 -- in other words after the Croatia game -- where Perumal talks of ""five to seven black sheeps,"" and ""seven rotten apples"" within the Cameroon team, adding ""in my opinion they fixed all three matches."" Perumal's Facebook account does not show public updates, so CNN was unable to independently verify those exchanges. ""At no time did I make reference to four goals being scored or to a red card being issued,"" Perumal said. ""At no time did I suggest that I had any way of corroborating or substantiating what was meant to be an educated guess based on my extensive match-fixing experience,"" added Perumal, who was arrested in Helsinki in 2011 and sentenced to two years in prison for fixing games in Rovaniemi, northern Finland. ""Last but not least: at no time was I informed by the Der Spiegel journalist that our chat was going to end up in the German publication."" The Der Spiegel journalist, Rafael Buschmann, told CNN that the publication was confident in its reporting of the story. ""We firmly stand by our assertion that Mr. Perumal wrote in a Facebook chat with Der Spiegel some hours before the World Cup match Croatia vs. Cameroon, that the result of the match will be a 4-0 victory for Croatia and that a player of Cameroon will get a red card in the first half,"" Buschmann said. That alleged prediction largely came true. Midfielder Alex Song was red-carded during the game for lashing out at Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic, who scored twice in a 4-0 victory along with goals from Ivica Olic and Ivan Perisic. CNN contacted Song's agent but he was not immediately available for comment. Now living in Hungary, Perumal recently published a book -- ""Kelong Kings"" -- about his involvement in illegal match fixing, which was written in conjunction with investigative journalists Alessandro Righi and Emanuele Piano. ""I apologize to the Cameroon FA and to its fans if I inadvertently offended them; it was not my intention,"" said Perumal. ""I strongly believe that Der Spiegel should also do the same since they placed words in my mouth that I did not utter."" ""Kelong Kings"" examines three decades of match-fixing efforts, including World Cup qualifiers, Olympic matches and the 2010 World Cup. ""I am now back in Hungary where I have testified against my former associates in a local match-fixing trial,"" said Perumal. "" 'Kelong Kings' is an honest account of what my life has been like until today. ""I have now turned a new leaf and wish to put my expertise at the disposal of those willing to truly fight the scourge of match-fixing. ""When the time is ripe I will share what I know with FIFA and UEFA, but I will not accept that my statements be manipulated at the detriment of others."" A FIFA spokesperson told reporters Tuesday that football's governing body could not comment on whether an investigation was underway on the alleged manipulation of the Cameroon-Croatia match. FECAFOOT said in a statement Monday that ""in 55 years of existence, it has never been sanctioned for, involved in, or even linked to match fixing or any fraud of any kind.""","Match-fixer denies predicting Cameroon would lose 4-0 to Croatia at World Cup .

"First, the good news. News organizations -- including CNN, The New York Times, The Washington Post and Bloomberg -- are asking: Where are the women? They've noticed that President Obama's nominees for his national security team and Cabinet, including Secretary of State, Defense, Treasury, and Director of the CIA, have excluded the talent of potential female appointees. As co-founders of the Women's Media Center, whose purpose is to make women more visible and powerful in the media, we want to say thank you for noticing. Now, the bad news. President Obama isn't answering. He wouldn't have been re-elected without 55 percent of the women's vote, something he earned by representing women's majority views on issues, yet now he seems to be ignoring women's ability to be not only voters, but leaders. Fortunately, there are still possibilities. A second-term President Obama still has time to demonstrate his commitment to equality in a different but equally important area of the federal government, the agencies that have oversight of the media and telecom industries. Media companies have some of the most powerful resources at their disposal in shaping attitudes and culture. But media culture, from our TV shows to advertising, is often deeply sexist and normalizes roles that limit everyone. There is a powerful ""bully pulpit"" effect to having women at the head of these agencies. Four important agencies regulating media include the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division and the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration. One slot has already been filled by a man. On January 3, William J. Baer was sworn in as assistant attorney general for the Antitrust Division. Erin Burnett: White men to fill Obama's cabinet . That could leave three. We say ""could"" because it's not yet 100% clear that the heads of the FTC or FCC will be stepping down, though top appointees do shift around in a president's second term. For instance, there has already been speculation that Lawrence E. Strickling, assistant secretary for communications and information, which manages the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, is in the running for FCC chair. Why not an equally logical woman's name? Karen Kornbluh, who has just returned from serving as U.S. ambassador to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, was one of six women called qualified by the National Journal. Others named as possible FCC chairs were FCC Commissioners Mignon Clyburn and Jessica Rosenworcel, Clinton administration FCC executives Susan Ness and Cathy Sandoval and Obama adviser and communications expert Susan Crawford. Obama's Cabinet shaping up to be a boys club . We're glad to say the FCC has had black chairmen. William Kennard, for example, made a top priority of closing the digital divide for African-Americans and for Americans with disabilities. It's unfortunate that there have not been more, though we live in a diverse country in which white Americans are about to become the minority. Never in the 80 years of the FCC has a woman of any race or group been its chair, though women have been the nation's majority for a long time. Then there's the Federal Trade Commission, which has broad oversight over everything from price fixing at the gas pump to whether Google is a monopoly. It includes the Bureau of Consumer Protection, which monitors false and deceptive advertising. Women still have most of the purchasing power in households. According to GfK MRI's Spring 2011 Survey of the American Consumer, 75% of women are the primary shoppers for all household products. Women are more likely to have the expertise for such decisions in the interest of consumers and also to be affected by those decisions. As we step into 2013, America's media are still largely run by men. Women hold only 6% of all TV and radio station licenses. It's long past the time to close the gender gap in our nation's leadership and in the media and telecom industries' leadership especially, where in 2011 only 28.4% of TV news directors were women, according to the Women's Media Center's 2012 Status of Women in the U.S. Media report. We thought President Obama wanted women in his inner circle. Right now, the makeup of that  inner circle looks nothing like the country.","Jane Fonda, Glora Steinem, Robin Morgan: Obama short on women appointees .

"The shoe attack on Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Egypt, the latest on a politician in the Middle East, causes many in West to ask: Why is throwing a shoe such a big deal? One of CNN's resident experts is producer Mohammed Tawfeeq, who was in Baghdad when President George W. Bush dodged a flying shoe at news conference in the U.S. Embassy in December 2008. Journalist Muntadhar al-Zaidi tossed it because he wanted to ""humiliate the tyrant,"" his brother told CNN. ""Yes, I was there,"" Tawfeeq said. ""It was a very big deal in Iraq."" Read more: Iraqi artist inspired by George W Bush shoe thrower . In fact, some Iraqis celebrated that moment, he said. ""Other people were not happy because for them they see it -- by end of the day -- like a guest visiting their country,"" Tawfeeq said.  ""Traditionally, it was also offensive to insult a guest."" The act of throwing a shoe at someone or showing them your sole is ""incredibly offensive"" in the Middle East, he said. ""The bottom line is a shoe is dirt,"" he said. ""Throwing a shoe on someone means throwing dirt on that person."" Professor Faegheh Shirazi, with Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Texas, agreed, saying it is offensive ""regardless of the religious practices."" ""Throwing a shoe or hitting someone with a shoe or showing the bottom of your shoe when sitting with legs up on a chair and facing another person all are culturally unacceptable and are considered to be a grave insult and belittling to a person,"" Shirazi said. Another offensive aspect is the significance of the shoe being a sign of wealth. ""Most often, lower-status people and poor men could not wear shoes,"" Shirazi said. ""The feet came in contact with pollution and the dirt on the road. The dirt on the feet indicated the lack of social status, the level of economic class and the level of education and lack of sophistication and intellect."" Tawfeeq, who occasionally visits the United States, was surprised to learn shoe throwing was not considered an offense in North America. A search of literature reveals references suggesting the power of the shoe is ancient. For example, in the King James Version of the Old Testament, Psalm 60:8 says: ""Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me."" ""Perhaps it has to do with the hierarchy of the body position, that is, the relationship between the head and the feet, the head being at the top and not touching the ground and the dirt,"" Shirazi said.  ""The head carries a more prestigious status in comparison to the feet, which in older times mostly remained bare.""","Throwing a shoe is offensive ""regardless of the religious practices,"" professor says .

"Police arrested a 14-year-old Dutch girl Monday after she tweeted a terror threat to American Airlines that catapulted her into social media fame overnight. A Twitter user calling herself Sarah with the handle @QueenDemetriax_ tweeted ""@AmericanAir hello my name's Ibrahim and I'm from Afghanistan.

American Airlines responded swiftly from their official Twitter account saying ""@QueenDemetriax_ Sarah, we take these threats very seriously. Your IP address and details will be forwarded to security and the FBI."" Moments later, in a series of tweets, the girl pleaded with the airline, writing ""I'm just a girl"" and claiming the threat was a joke made by her friend. The teenager turned herself in at a police station in the Dutch port city of Rotterdam on Monday afternoon after authorities launched an investigation into her whereabouts, Wessel Stolle, a Rotterdam police department spokesman told CNN. ""The assumption made by her tweets was taken seriously, and I may add that it is a rather alarming threat,"" Stolle said. The girl has been charged with ""posting a false or alarming announcement"" under Dutch law, but the consequences of the accusation remain unclear. ""She will be questioned for the next couple of hours and after that she might be sent home during the investigation,"" Stolle said. ""We do not know yet. That will have to come out of the investigation."" Rotterdam police said they are in contact with several agencies, but did not confirm if the FBI or any other American agency may be involved in the investigation. American Airlines stood by their actions Monday despite the girl's appeals on Twitter, including one message that reportedly read ""I'm so sorry I'm scared now.""

"Hundreds of people are feared dead following deep, devastating landslides Friday in a remote, mountainous part of far northeastern Afghanistan, a provincial governor said. A landslide crashed down around noon in an area with some 300 homes in the district of Argo in Badakhshan province, the area's governor, Shah Waliullah Adeeb, said. Citing reports from tribal elders and district council members he added that a wedding ceremony was taking place in that area at the time. Close to 600 people from a nearby village then came to help dig people out when a new landslide struck, Adeeb said. The provincial governor said there are 2,700 dead, an estimate based on the premise that some houses were occupied, the number of wedding attendees and those who came to help only to get buried themselves. Yet Ari Gaitanis, a spokesman for the United Nation's Afghanistan mission, reported later Friday a smaller figure of 350 deaths. At the same time, Gaitanis acknowledged the toll could rise Saturday with search efforts underway. The affected area isn't densely populated, according to the U.N. spokesman, who estimated about 700 families live in the village. Gaitanis said that 120 houses were destroyed. The out-of-the-way location -- far from a major city, bordered by Tajikistan to the north and Pakistan to the south -- as well as the rocky terrain and abundant mountains makes it difficult to reach, said the U.N. official. That said, search-and-rescue teams were able to reach the area later Friday. But the rescue efforts are difficult with rubble 25 to 30 meters (80 to 100 feet) deep covering the ground, according to Adeeb, the governor. He noted worries that another 700 houses are in danger if there's another landslide. The United States is ""ready to help our Afghan partners as they respond to this disaster,"" U.S. President Obama said Friday outside the White House. ""I want to say on behalf of the American people that our thoughts are with the people of Afghanistan, who have experienced an awful tragedy,"" Obama said during a wide-ranging news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Bangkok turned into a war zone Wednesday as Thai military forces cracked down on anti-government protesters, ending a tense standoff that has troubled the capital for weeks. The army surged into Lumpini Park, the area where Red Shirt demonstrators had amassed. Armored personnel carriers crushed bamboo and tire barricades; the protesters hurled M79 grenades at soldiers. The May sky quickly turned black from thick smoke billowing from landmark buildings set ablaze. Finally, after hours of intense street battles, the Red Shirt leadership surrendered. The government imposed a strict curfew that barred people from going outside between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. The chaotic day left at least five people dead as Bangkok residents endured an edgy and unsettled night. Thailand's prime minister sought to calm public fears with a televised address in which he expressed confidence that peace would soon be restored. iReport: Are you there? Send your images, video . ""I would like to give moral support to officers who are doing their duties now and would like to reassure you,"" Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva told citizens. ""And I am confident that we can overcome all the problems and bring the country to a long-lasting peace."" The government considered the demonstrators to be terrorists, and army Col. Sansern Kaewkamnerd said that growing violence necessitated the use of force. He said soldiers were given the all-clear to fire if they faced a clear threat. iReport: Video sparks discussion . ""The terrorists have created further situations of violence by torching government and business buildings,"" Sansern said. ""It was therefore necessary for the police and military to put further pressure."" He said the government had regained full control and Red Shirt leaders had fled or were taken into police custody. Seven anti-government protest leaders were taken into custody while several others fled, authorities said. iReport: Army running away . Lt. Gen. Daopong Ratanasuwan, the army's deputy commander, estimated the number of protesters left on the streets late Wednesday had dwindled from 10,000 to about 3,000. Timeline of Thailand's political crisis . Many dispersed, and smaller riots erupted throughout the city. Witnesses reported a dozen buildings -- including a bank, a police station, a local television station and Thailand's biggest shopping mall -- set ablaze. Hours after the large military operation got under way, soldiers took control of the park area. The Red Shirt leadership called off the protests, telling a crowd at the park that they wanted to avoid further bloodshed and wanted to turn themselves in. But it seemed as though the large group of protesters was not heeding that call. Sniper fire and explosions were heard after the leaders spoke of calling off the protests, said George McCleod, a witness and freelance journalist in the area. ""It is a live ammunition situation, and I expect a heavy death toll by the end of the day,"" he said. What are the protests about? At least five people, including an Italian journalist, were listed as killed by the Police Hospital in Bangkok. Another 64 -- two journalists among them -- were wounded. One was Andrew Buncombe, Asia correspondent for the Independent newspaper in London, who was taken to the hospital with a leg injury that was not life-threatening. Officials asked protesters, residents and foreigners to head to a nearby stadium if they wanted to leave. Bangkok residents: 'This is a mini-civil war' ""We Thai people never experienced this kind of situation before,"" said Sirinun Siripanich, the assistant secretary to the Bangkok governor. ""This is like a mini-civil war."" The military operation was the government's last stand against protests that paralyzed parts of Bangkok for months, Thai officials said. At least 40 people have been killed since clashes intensified Thursday. Trapped in Bangkok's protest zone: Hunkering down . The prime minister's office issued a statement blaming the crackdown on failed talks between the two sides. ""Negotiations failed because core [opposition] leaders are not to be able to make decisions by themselves,"" the statement said, alluding to an outside force influencing the protesters. ""[We] ask core leaders to stop the rally and surrender."" The Red Shirt opposition members support former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a bloodless 2006 military coup. They have been protesting for weeks, demanding that Abhisit dissolve parliament and call new elections. From his self-imposed exile abroad to avoid a trial on corruption charges, Thaksin released a statement Wednesday saying he was not the leader of the United Front for Democracy, the formal name of the Red Shirt opposition, and that their movement calling for new elections is not on his behalf. ""They did not demand anything for me or on my behalf. I am not UDD,"" he said. Thaksin also accused the Thai government of defaming him by saying he was the mastermind behind the violence in the country's ongoing political crisis. ""I never approve nor agree to any use of violence,"" he said. ""I believe in peace. I love my country as much as any member of this government. I believe in peaceful and non-violent means to end conflict and reject any use of force. ""If there is any act of terrorism, it is the duty of this government to find the wrongdoer and prosecute them in the court of law."" The violence prompted the United Nations' top human rights official to implore anti-government protesters and government officials to resume talks. But on Wednesday in Bangkok, as bullets rang out, black plumes of smoke rose and soldiers crept forward toward a showdown, it seemed that the time for talking had passed. iReport: 7-11 at OnNut Looted/Bombed .

"Rebels gave Malaysian officials the data recorders from downed Flight 17 on Tuesday, days after the passenger jet crashed in eastern Ukraine. ""We believe these are the black boxes and these boxes will reveal the truth,"" said Alexander Borodai, the self-declared rebel Prime Minister in Donetsk. It was a significant step forward in an investigation that's been stalled for days, but key questions remained unanswered: Will the black boxes give investigators the clues they need? What will happen to the bodies of the plane crash's 298 victims, many of which are being kept in refrigerated train cars? And who pulled the trigger to bring the plane down? Speaking to international reporters invited to watch the handover at the headquarters of the pro-Russian rebel movement early Tuesday, Borodai said the separatists had done their best to retrieve bodies and handle wreckage at the crash site. And he denied accusations that rebels shot down the plane. ""This is an information war,"" he said. ""We don't have the technical ability to destroy this plane. Ukrainians are not interested in the truth."" Col. Mohammad Sakri of the Malaysian military thanked him. ""Having the black box is not to blame each other,"" he said, ""but to show the Malaysians that we are so serious that these things be recovered for Malaysia."" The long-awaited handover came hours after Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and U.S. President Barack Obama lashed out Monday at Russia over conditions at the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, saying Russian-backed rebels were still impeding efforts to find out exactly what happened. What will black boxes reveal? The flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, known as the black boxes, could provide key information about what happened to the plane, analysts told CNN. But is it possible the rebels tampered with them before handing them over? ""You can't go and fool around with the data. These are solid, secure devices,"" said Peter Goelz, former National Transportation Safety Board managing director. ""If there was any kind of attempt to alter them, investigators would know immediately."" The voice recorder could include audio from the cockpit, which would show whether the pilots knew the plane had been hit, said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. And the flight data recorder will give investigators information about engine settings, pressurization and electronic communications, among other details, she said. but that doesn't mean the black boxes hold all the clues to explain what happened to the Boeing 777. ""The black boxes aren't going to solve"" the issue of who downed the Malaysian airliner, a U.S. intelligence official told CNN's Evan Perez. Handling the remains . The remains of 16 people were still missing Monday, four days after Flight 17 plunged to the ground, Poroshenko told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. Earlier, the Ukrainian government issued a statement saying that 282 bodies and 87 ""body fragments"" had been recovered from the sprawling crash site. A train carrying the remains of 282 passengers was headed toward the eastern city of Kharkiv, officials said Monday. Obama and Poroshenko decried how the bodies had been treated, echoing complaints that the remains had been left exposed to the elements for days and that rebels had stripped personal belongings from some of the bodies and their effects. Poroshenko said the rebels' conduct was ""barbaric."" Obama called the handling of remains an ""insult"" that has ""no place in the community of nations."" Dutch forensics experts who inspected the train Monday were ""more or less"" satisfied with how the bodies were being stored,"" said Michael Bociurkiw, the spokesman for monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. After the train arrives in Kharkiv, the remains will be flown to Amsterdam on board a Dutch C-130 Hercules, officials have said. Most of those who died in the crash were from the Netherlands. Dutch Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans said bringing the victims' remains home is his country's top priority. ""To my dying day, I will not understand that it took so much time for the rescue workers to be allowed to do their difficult jobs,"" he told the U.N. Security Council on Monday, ""and that human remains should be used in a political game."" Who pulled the trigger? The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution Monday demanding full access to the crash site and condemning the downing of the plane. The resolution won unanimous approval from the 15-member council, which includes Russia. It did not specify who was responsible for the crash. U.S. and other officials have said it appears the plane was shot down by a sophisticated surface-to-air missile located within rebel-held territory. Evidence supporting that conclusion includes telephone intercepts purporting to be pro-Russian rebels discussing the shootdown and video of a Buk missile launcher traveling into Russia with at least one missile missing. While they have stopped short of putting the responsibility squarely on Russia, Obama, British Prime Minister David Cameron and others have said the pro-Russian rebels could not have shot such a high-flying jet down without weapons and training from Russia. But officials said Monday that U.S. intelligence analysts are examining phone intercepts, social media posts and information gathered on the ground to see if Russian officials played a direct role in the shootdown, according to two U.S. officials directly familiar with the latest assessment. The officials declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation. ""We are trying to determine if they manned it, advised, or pulled the trigger,"" one of the officials told CNN. Poroshenko, speaking to CNN's Amanpour, pleaded for international solidarity against the pro-Russian rebels. ""I don't see any differences"" between 9/11, the Lockerbie bombing and the attack on Flight 17, Poroshenko said, referring to the 2001 terror attacks on the United States and the bombing of a Pan Am flight over Scotland in 1988. Obama called on Russia to rein in the rebel fighters, who he said had treated remains poorly and removed evidence from the site. ""What exactly are they trying to hide?"" he said. Russians blame Ukraine . Pro-Russian rebels have repeatedly denied responsibility for the shootdown. In an interview with Chris Cuomo broadcast Monday on CNN's ""New Day,"" Borodai said he believed Ukrainian forces either shot the plane down with a surface-to-air missile or, as the Russian general suggested, one of its own fighter jets. ""We didn't have motives and desire to do that, and it is obvious that Ukrainians have them,"" he said. ""I can't say about desire, but motive is obvious that the crash of this plane was beneficial to them."" Moscow has strongly denied claims it pulled the trigger, and on Monday, a Russian general suggested that it may instead have been a Ukrainian jet fighter that shot the plane down. Russian monitoring showed a Ukrainian Su-25 fighter jet flying along the same route and within 3 kilometers to 5 kilometers (1.9 miles to 3.1 miles) of Flight 17, Lt. Gen. Andrei Kartapolov of the Russian Army General Staff said at a news conference, Russian state media reported. ""We would like to know why the Ukrainian plane was flying along a civilian route on the same flight path as the Malaysian Boeing,"" Kartapolov said, according to the reports. In his interview with Amanpour, Poroshenko rejected the Russian suggestion, saying all Ukrainian aircraft were on the ground at the time. Vitaly Churkin, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, also blamed Ukraine for the crash on Monday. But when asked about audio recordings purporting to show pro-Russian separatists talking about shooting down a plane, he suggested that if they did, it was an accident. ""According to them, the people from the east were saying that they shot down a military jet,"" he said. ""If they think they shot down a military jet, it was confusion. If it was confusion, it was not an act of terrorism."" Ukrainian President: The world must choose sides . So much we don't know -- eight unanswered questions . Who were the victims? Should jet have flown over Ukraine?","Rebels hand over black boxes to Malaysian officials .

"Cancer has spread in Hugo Chavez's colon, spine and bones, and the Venezuelan president could have only nine months to live, Spain's ABC newspaper reported Monday, citing medical records provided by unidentified intelligence sources. ""His health appears to be deteriorating at a more rapid pace. Clearly there has been metastasis in the bones and the spine,"" the ABC report says, citing what it said were doctors' observations after medical tests December 30. The newspaper did not divulge its sources or detail how it checked the information's accuracy, and CNN was unable to verify the report. An official in Venezuela's information ministry said the newspaper's report was invalid and the government would not comment on its contents. In June, Chavez said doctors in Cuba had removed a cancerous tumor from his body but did not specify what type of cancer it was. He announced in October that treatment had cured him of cancer, but the government has released few details about his health. ""There are no malignant cells in this body. They don't exist,"" Chavez, 57, said at the time. The ABC newspaper report details what it says are doctors' differing estimates of Chavez's life expectancy during the course of his treatment. According to ABC, in June doctors diagnosed Chavez with prostate cancer but said he could live for five years or more with treatment. In late October, ABC says, the president's medical team said the number of cancerous cells in his bone marrow had increased. In late December, according to the newspaper, doctors said they had found a tumor in Chavez's colon. The president was refusing a more intense recommended treatment and could have only nine months to live, ABC says, citing medical records. Citing a January 12 medical report, ABC says Chavez was receiving ""increasing doses of painkillers and stimulants that have helped him give the impression that he is stabilizing and have given him a high level of visibility."" Emili Blasco, author of the article and the newspaper's Washington correspondent, defended the story in an interview with CNN en Español on Monday night. He called the report ""reliable,"" and stressed that his paper has no agenda. A lawmaker from Chavez's United Socialist Party of Venezuela mocked the newspaper report's claims, which come at the start of a politically-important year for the Venezuelan president. Chavez has pledged to run for re-election in 2012, dismissing speculation that his illness would force him out of politics. ""We have laughed a lot about this because because they insist, but they are seeing a Chavez that is active, that is working, that is in front of the government, of the party, of the fight, of the problems of the people and who is demonstrating that he is healthy,"" lawmaker Aristobulo Isturiz said at a news conference broadcast on state television. Isturiz, who is vice president of Venezuela's National Assembly, noted that an energetic Chavez gave a state of the union speech that lasted more than nine hours earlier this month. The desires of political opponents of Chavez are fueling speculation, Isturiz told reporters. ""Desires are one thing, and there are many who wish Chavez had not nine months, but one month (to live),"" he said.","Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has pledged to run for re-election this year .

"A line began to form at the Apple Store here on the eve of the iPhone 4S release, as is often the case around the world during the company's product launches. At the front of this particular line Thursday, Steve Wozniak sits in a Pico armchair, sipping Diet Dr Pepper and scanning e-mails from his white iPad. The Apple co-founder, who gets a paycheck of ""a couple hundred dollars every two weeks"" and still maintains his status as employee No. 1 in company records, hasn't been able to stay put for long. Crowds of Apple fans, family friends and people who have seen him riding his Segway around the neighborhood stop to say hi, take pictures and ask for his autograph. ""I'll be taking a thousand pictures,"" Wozniak whispered with a smile. ""I'm going to sit down and see if I can get a little e-mail done, because there's no way I'm going to get it all done today."" Seconds later, an enthusiastic man in a yellow polo shirt positioned his two kids near the computer legend and pleaded for him to pose. Wozniak immediately sprang to his feet with a grin on his face. People brought iPhones, iPods and iPads for Wozniak to sign with a marker. ""Now your phone is not going to be worth as much when you sell it,"" Wozniak said to one woman before signing her iPhone 4. Fans gave Wozniak their condolences over the late Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder who died last week. Flowers, partially eaten apples and notes were laid in front of Apple Stores around the world, including this one, where the memorial was set just a few feet from Wozniak's spot in line. Wozniak explained that sending flowers or onetime celebrations are the kinds of traditions he and Jobs agreed were unnecessary. However, he talked openly about how much he misses his high-school pal, with whom he built a technology empire. Wozniak acknowledged that he could have easily made one phone call to Apple and gotten the phone he's waiting in line for, but he didn't. He has yet to play with an iPhone 4S or its Siri voice-controlled assistant. He has said previously that he does not ask colleagues about products in development because he does not want to ruin the surprise for himself. ""I want to get mine along with the millions of other fans,"" Wozniak said. ""I just want to be able to talk to my phone."" Analysts have expressed disappointment in the iPhone 4S, but Wozniak, who looks forward to every new Apple device, is especially animated when discussing it. Over the past year, he has not been shy about his anticipation for voice-assist technology, like the new 4S tool called Siri. People who say they have waited in lines behind Wozniak during past Apple releases have written spiteful messages online claiming he had used his celebrity to cut in line just before the stores opened. Wozniak said that he is usually further back in line at these events but that fans in front of him insist that he get his devices first. On Thursday, there is no dispute about Wozniak's place in line. His Segway, which he rode from his nearby home, is parked in a corner near the store's entrance. Wozniak arrived about noon, and he plans to stay overnight in order to get the new iPhone first, he said. Fifteen minutes after Wozniak arrived, Parth Dhebar, 17, showed up. He first met Wozniak last year in line at a nearby store during the launch of the original iPad. Wozniak and the high school student kept in touch by e-mail and Facebook, and they were third and fourth in line to buy the iPhone 4. At the iPad launch, Wozniak taught Dhebar how to ride a Segway. ""Mall security was like, 'You shouldn't be Segwaying in here,' but nobody is going to say no to Woz, obviously,"" said Dhebar, who develops iPhone applications. ""He does it because he wants to, not for publicity reasons."" Reporters and cameramen were among the people approaching Wozniak on Thursday. By 7 p.m. Pacific, about a dozen people had set up chairs behind Wozniak, and his wife, Janet Hill, joined. Wozniak said he had already ordered two iPhones to be delivered to his home; he's in line to buy one for his wife. Before then, a policeman asked Wozniak quietly whether he would need anything and whether the celebrity planned to stay all night. Wozniak said that he was but that he might take a jog around the block at 3 a.m. ""The line is doing nicely,"" Wozniak said after surveying the area. Some in the queue came out solely because Wozniak was here, which they learned from updates on his Twitter and Foursquare profiles. Joe Hewitt, a prominent Silicon Valley software developer, also tweeted this afternoon when he spotted Wozniak in line. Mohamad Jawad, a graduate student at Santa Clara University, took the bus after seeing Wozniak's tweet. David Gandy, a furniture designer who is looking to change jobs, said he came to soak up some inspiration from Wozniak. ""I came out here just so I can hang out with Woz for 18 hours,"" said Gandy, who lives in the nearby city of Campbell. ""I've been watching him get harassed all day."" Wozniak designed the original Apple computers, his major triumph, but he is recognized by many people nowadays for his short-lived appearance in 2009 on the ABC show ""Dancing with the Stars."" ""You were awesome on 'Dancing with the Stars!' "" said one fan, who had her picture taken with Wozniak. ""So good! I voted for you."" Wozniak quipped, ""It's the one show I like on TV."" He doesn't watch television, he adds. He spends a great deal of time responding to fan mail.","Steve Wozniak arrived first at an Apple Store in California .

"What a difference two years make. Instead of a band of rabble-rousing conservatives, a markedly different group was plotting campaign strategy with House Republican leaders at a recent party headquarters meeting. Gone is the tea party-infused talk of confrontation. This diverse group -- top-tier candidates picked to be in the GOP's ""Young Guns"" program -- includes an openly gay former Massachusetts state legislator, an African-American female mayor from Utah and an Indian-American Ivy league graduate from California. Unlike the take-no-prisoners approach of two years ago, these candidates stressed the need to work with Democrats to get things done in Washington. Richard Tisei, who was one of the few Republicans in the Democratic-dominated Massachusetts Senate, said that voters are frustrated with a polarized Congress and that he has a record of getting things done. ""I can bring my experience, having served in the Legislature on, you know, a state level, down here and hopefully bring some common sense and willingness to work across the aisle,"" Tisei told CNN. If Tisei beats eight-term Democratic Rep John Tierney in November, he would be the first House Republican to say he's gay while running for a first term in office. He supports same-sex marriage and signed onto a legal challenge to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act, a law GOP leaders are fighting to uphold in the federal courts. ""I am a live-and-let-live Republican. I think the government, again, should get off your back, out of your wallet and away from the bedroom,"" Tisei said. Further proof that he doesn't fit the traditional GOP candidate mold -- Tisei refuses to sign a pledge that he will not raise taxes. ""If there are loopholes that could be closed, help pay down the deficit, I don't want to tie myself up in knots. I want the option of being able to do what needs to be done to help the country,"" he said. The Young Guns program Tisei recently joined was started in 2007 by three Republican rising stars -- Reps. Eric Cantor of Virginia, Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Kevin McCarthy of California. The three were concerned their party wasn't doing enough to grow its base and recruit candidates in districts where the GOP lost in 2006. The program grew to support 90 candidates in 2009 and became part of the National Republican Congressional Commitee. Those selected for the program received financial and political support from the national party, and 62 of them won in 2010, helping to return the House gavel back to the GOP. Democrats have a similar program they call ""Red to Blue."" McCarthy, who led GOP recruiting two years ago, which included outreach to females and minorities, told CNN ""the caliber of the candidates has only improved higher because of the success of the last one."" The third-ranking House Republican said he thinks leaders will pick 30 to 40 Young Guns by this fall. Fitting the ""young"" part of the bill is Indian-American Ricky Gill, 25, who hopes he'll become the youngest member of Congress next year. A Princeton University graduate who has endorsements from popular Republican Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Nikki Haley of South Carolina, Gill said his campaign represents a ""GOP version 2.0."" He boasts that he's raised the most money of any Republican challenger in the country in his bid to unseat Democratic Rep. Jerry McNerney in California. Gill said the 9th Congressional District in California is the ""quintessential swing"" district.  ""The person who's going to win that race is the one who creates broad agreement about the issues of our day -- it's getting people back to work; it's focusing on our agriculture economy. Those actually are consensus issues."" More so than Tisei or Gill, Mia Love may defy most people's expectations of a GOP candidate -- a black, conservative Mormon from Utah. If elected to represent Utah's 4th Congressional District, Love, the mayor of Saratoga Springs, would be the first black Republican congresswoman. ""There are a lot of people who have tried to define me as a person,"" Love, a daughter of Haitian immigrants, told CNN's Kyra Phillips in an interview last month. This year, McCarthy and other Republicans said divided government in Washington means candidates need to stress their ability to find solutions. Brad Dayspring, a senior adviser to YG Action Fund, a super PAC that supports House Republican candidates, told CNN that in 2010 candidates talked about repealing President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, criticizing the spending in the stimulus program and opposing Democratic proposals such as cap and trade, but this year the message centers on ""solving problems."" Dayspring, a former Cantor aide, said the party's ideology and issues aren't changing as Republicans work to increase the GOP majority, but he noted ""a conservative in Massachusetts is going to look a lot different from a conservative in Arkansas."" His group is evaluating GOP candidates across the country and plans to support 15 to 25 this cycle. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, insists the party isn't getting a makeover, saying Friday of these candidates, ""We didn't choose them for their demographics or their style. They just happen to be good candidates in districts that are winnable for us."" Democrats facing these Young Gun candidates said their talk of compromise doesn't add up. Early and often Democrats are tying all of these challengers to the House GOP budget authored by Ryan, which passed without a single Democratic vote and which, they argue, will end Medicare. Gill refuses to get drawn in, saying he ""salutes the idea of us having this discussion,"" but steers clear of personally endorsing the House Republican plan and instead zeroes in on his support of one piece of the plan that Ryan co-authored with a Senate Democrat. Democrats insist Republicans will change their moderate message if they win, and they'll become just like the GOP members elected two years ago. Tierney, Tisei's Democratic opponent in Massachusetts, told CNN, ""He's going to fall right in line with them, and they're the ones that won't compromise and we've had compromise all the way up until the tea party election in 2010."" Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an llinois freshman Republican who was one of the Young Guns two years ago, said 2010 was ""a very special year because people were just ticked off so you saw all these grass-roots Americans saying I can run for Congress, and I did that as a military guy with no significant legislative experience."" But Kinzinger said that 2010 was an ""outlier"" election and that this year candidates need to show a vision for how they'll produce results. ""I think it's important that Republicans and Democrats start basically reaching across the aisle and finding the areas (where) we agree and at least moving forward on those,"" he said. Despite the anti-incumbent mood and approval ratings for Congress at a record low, McCarthy, the House majority whip, said he believes voters will stick with Republicans this fall. ""I think the public sees some change in Congress, but they want to finish the job,"" he said. Although Boehner recently warned there was a 1-in-3 chance Republicans could lose seats in the House, McCarthy was more bullish on the party's electoral position, telling CNN that ""there's an opportunity to gain in the overall number"" of GOP seats.  He cited the Young Guns program as the way to ""keep us on offense.""","Tea party-infused talk of confrontation absent from some GOP House candidates .

"The Ebola outbreak in coastal West Africa is still contained to Guinea and Liberia, the World Health Organization announced Tuesday, despite rumors of the virus spreading to other countries. Cases have been reported in Sierra Leone, Mali and Ghana, but the WHO says none has been confirmed. Rumored cases in Mali are still being investigated. The number of suspected cases in Guinea has grown to 157, with 101 deaths. Sixty-seven have been confirmed as Ebola. In Liberia, 21 cases have been reported, including 10 deaths. Five of the cases have been confirmed as Ebola. The outbreak has ""rapidly evolved"" since originating in the forests of southeastern Guinea. The city of Guekedou, near the borders with Sierra Leone and Liberia, has seen the majority of the deaths. Twenty cases are believed to have occurred in Guinea's capital, Conakry, according to WHO. ""This is one of the most challenging Ebola outbreaks that we have ever faced,"" said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, WHO's assistant director-general for health security. What is Ebola and why does it kill? It's the first emergence of Ebola in western Africa, which means doctors and health officials in the region don't have any experience with the virus. Outbreaks generate a lot of fear and anxiety, Fukuda said, which can lead to misinformation. The U.N. agency is trying to track people who had encountered the victims and make sure ""that all those who have been in contact with infected people are being checked upon,"" spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told CNN last week. There are about 50 staff currently deployed in the area and more are set to go shortly. They are working to prevent the spread of infection, primarily in health care facilities, and are sending personal protective equipment to surrounding countries. ""What is really important is to inform the population of Guinea and Conakry about this disease, as this is the first time they are facing Ebola,"" Jasarevic said. ""They need to know what it is and how they can protect themselves."" The aid organization Doctors Without Borders has called the outbreak unprecedented, because previous cases have been limited to a small area. Mali's government reported on its Facebook page last week that biological samples tied to three suspected Ebola cases within its borders were being sent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for analysis. WHO said two of the samples have come back negative; they are still waiting on the other. Nine Ebola cases total are suspected in the country. Ebola is one of the world's deadliest viruses, causing a hemorrhagic fever that kills up to 90% of those infected. It spreads in the blood and shuts down the immune system, causing high fever, headache and muscle pain, often accompanied by bleeding. Close to 9 in 10 of the patients WHO health professionals are seeing with Ebola are dying, said Dr, Stephane Hugonnet, who returned from southeast Guinea last weekend. ""Ebola is clearly a severe disease,"" Fukuda said. ""It is also an infection that can be controlled. ... We know very well how this virus is transmitted."" The virus is named after the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), where one of the first recorded outbreaks occurred in 1976.","Mali says it has three suspected Ebola cases .

"Tunisia's national assembly approved the country's landmark new constitution -- its first since the ouster of longtime president Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali three years ago. The text was passed with 200 votes, the state news agency TAP reported. Twelve members voted against the measure, and four abstained. Alongside the vote, Prime Minister Mehdi Jomaa appointed a caretaker Cabinet as part of a deal to end a crisis between Tunisia's Islamist party and its secular opposition until new elections. The approval of the new constitution is one of the last steps to establishing full democracy in the North African country,  the cradle of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings that toppled autocratic leaders in one of the most conservative corners of the world. Its drafting lasted two years and exposed a deep rift between the Islamist Ennahda party and the secular opposition. But after months of political crisis and sporadic violence, Sunday's milestones contrast sharply with messy transitions in regional neighbors Libya and Egypt -- still caught up in turmoil after ousting their own longtime leaders in 2011 revolts. Celebrating the vote, assembly members made victory signs and sang the national anthem, TAP reported. ""All eyes around the world are fixed on Tunisia's democratic experience,"" assembly chief Mustafa Ben Jaafar was quoted as saying by TAP. Political turmoil . The once-banned moderate Islamist Ennahda party won elections in October 2012 -- the first after Ben Ali's ouster in January 2011 -- and formed an Islamist-led government. But political turmoil has beset the country, which relies heavily on foreign tourists for revenues. Under a deal agreed between Ennahda and the opposition, the ruling party agreed to hand over power once parties had finished writing a new constitution and appointed an electoral commission to oversee new elections. TAP said Jomaa's new government was made up of 21 ministers and seven secretaries of state. It consists mainly of technocrats . Jomaa, an engineer and former minister, was appointed premier in December. Tunisia represents a rare bright spot in a still volatile region following the Arab Spring uprisings. Two years after Moammar Gadhafi was toppled, Libya's government is weakened by political infighting and fragile security forces, a constitution has yet to be drafted and armed militias do as they please in a country awash with weapons. Egypt's own elected Islamist president, Mohamed Morsy, was deposed by the army. The country's interim government has labeled his Muslim Brotherhood organization as a terrorist group. Egyptians this month approved their new constitution as part of a transition plan from army chief Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi after he ousted Morsy in July.

"More than 300 flights. Over 3,000 hours in the air. A staggering 4.6 million square kilometers of ocean. The numbers speak to the breadth of the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. The results speak to the fruitlessness of it. The plane, carrying 239 people, disappeared on March 8. And despite an expansive search involving 26 countries, officials have nothing to show for it. So authorities are moving on to the next phase of the search -- one that will be even more challenging. ""We know very clearly the area of the follow-up search will be even broader, with more difficulties and tougher tasks,"" Chinese Transport Minister Yang Chuantang said Monday. What's next . Australian, Malaysian and Chinese officials will meet in Canberra, Australia, on Wednesday to hash out plans for the next stage of the hunt. One group will analyze the data and information collected so far. Another will look at the resources needed. The data audit will look at information gathered since the beginning of the search. ""It will also look again at the satellite information that's been accumulated so that we can make sure that it's been accurately interpreted,"" Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said. Authorities have relied on satellite information and pings believed to be from the plane's flight data recorders in picking their search area. But with an expanded search area comes the most challenging task ahead: scouring uncharted territory. A key element of the new phase will be a detailed mapping of the ocean floor. ""We know that the water is very deep,"" Truss said. ""And for the next stage involving sonar and other autonomous vehicles, potentially at very great depths, we need to have an understanding of the ocean floor to be able to undertake that kind of search effectively and safely."" Truss said he's not sure how deep the ocean is in the expanded search area because ""it's never been mapped."" The tools . The next stage of the hunt will involved highly specialized technology, including towed side-scan sonar and more autonomous underwater vehicles, Truss said. ""You can count on one hand the number of devices that can do this work, when you talk about towed sonar devices,"" said Angus Houston, chief coordinator of the joint search effort. Truss said he's optimistic that the new devices will be in the water within a month or two. In the meantime, he said, the Bluefin-21 drone will continue underwater missions. The Bluefin-21 has already scanned 400 square kilometers of the Indian Ocean floor, but with no luck. The United States has authorized the use of the drone for another month. The cost? About $40,000 a day. While the Bluefin-21 provides greater resolution than deep-towed sonar devices, the drone can only go about 4.5 kilometers deep. The cost . Australia estimates the next phase of the search will cost about $60 million, Truss said. He said officials will consult with Malaysia, China and other parties on how that cost would be shared. Until now, all countries involved in the search have paid for their own costs. ""Whenever we've asked, people have come forward,"" Truss said. But ""I think we'll be looking at increasing involvement from the manufacturers and their host countries."" Letting others in . The new phase will allow more parties to join the search, acting Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said. ""This gives an opportunity to those not involved in the early phase of the search and rescue efforts to come on board,"" he said. Those could involve research institutions and more countries, he said. Truss said most of the new equipment will likely have to come from the private sector. Lessons learned . It took two years to find the wreckage of Air France Flight 447 in the Atlantic Ocean. Truss said authorities can learn from that effort. ""There were some quite long gaps in their search, and we don't want that to happen in this instance,"" he said. ""That's why we're starting work this week on actually putting together the next stages of the search."" But as officials from this search have already learned, hope can dash as quickly as it arises. ""We've been confident on the basis of the information provided that the search area was the right one,"" Truss said. ""But in practice, that confidence has not been converted into us discovering any trace of the aircraft.""","Officials will review data to see if satellite information has been ""accurately interpreted""

"An operation targeting al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is under way in Abyan and Shabwa, Yemen, a high-level Yemeni government official who is being briefed on the strikes told CNN on Monday. The official said that the scale of the strikes against AQAP is ""massive and unprecedented"" and that at least 30 militants have been killed. The operation involved Yemeni commandos who are now ""going after high-level AQAP targets,"" the official said. A day earlier, suspected drone strikes targeted al Qaeda fighters in Yemen for the second time in two days, killing ""at least a dozen,"" the government official said. The predawn strikes targeted a mountain ridge in the southern province of Abyan, the official said. It's the same area where scores of followers of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula had gathered recently to hear from Nasir al-Wuhayshi, the head of the terrorist network's Yemeni branch and the global organization's ""crown prince,"" the official said. ""It's too early to tell how many militants were killed, but the number is at least a dozen,"" the official said. The targets included ""foreign nationals,"" the official said, but he provided no details of what their nationalities were. Nor was it clear whether any high-value targets were among the dead and wounded, he said. Yemen's state news agency SABA said three strikes targeted an al Qaeda training camp in the village of  Wadi al Khila, about 450 kilometers (280 miles) south of the capital Sanaa. The fighters were ""preparing to launch attacks against Yemeni and foreign interests in the area,"" according to a statement from the country's Supreme Security Committee. ""These strikes destroyed the training facility completely and killed both Yemeni and foreign members,"" it said. The official said Sunday's raid was a joint U.S.-Yemeni operation. He would not confirm whether drones were used in the attack, but the United States is the only country known to have conducted drone strikes in Yemen -- and as a rule, U.S. officials don't comment on those strikes. But the official said the area is so rugged and mountainous that Yemeni troops would have faced heavy losses in any ground assault. Al Qaeda operatives had fled to the area after a 2012 push by government troops, backed by the United States, he said. The high-level official said it would take time to fully clarify the details of the weekend's strikes -- whether the raids targeted camps, vehicles on the move or both, the full death toll among the militants, and whether there were any civilian casualties. A Saturday drone strike in a neighboring province killed at least 10 suspected al Qaeda militants, but also killed three civilian day laborers. But other Yemeni officials, who asked to remain anonymous as they are not authorized to speak to the media, said there was growing frustration within the government about the lack of clarity and expressed concern that some of the information being reported by the military may be propaganda. ""I'm worried this is an attempt to convince Yemenis that the U.S. and Yemen have turned a corner and are in the process of destroying AQAP,"" one of those other officials said. ""At this hour, the numbers of militants being reported as being killed keeps changing, and we still aren't sure if any civilians have been killed or wounded in these strikes."" ""Yemenis are smart enough to doubt initial reports of this type,"" he added. ""If this does turn out to be exaggeration, it will make the people here trust their government even less than they do and fuel growing anger over the drone program."" The United States first used armed drones to pick off an al Qaeda operative in Yemen in 2002. Strikes on suspected al Qaeda figures resumed in 2009, with more than 100 reported since then, according to the New America Foundation, a U.S.-based think tank that tracks the raids. Those strikes have killed somewhere between 700 and 1,000 people, including at least 81 civilians, the foundation says.

"If it had happened anywhere else, this would be the world's biggest story. More than 230 girls disappeared, captured by members of a brutal terrorist group in the dead of night. Their parents are desperate and anguished, angry that their government is not doing enough. The rest of the world is paying little attention. The tragedy is unfolding in Nigeria, where members of the ultra-radical Islamist group Boko Haram grabbed the girls, most believed to be between 16 and 18, from their dormitories in the middle of the night in mid-April and took them deep into the jungle. A few dozen of the students managed to escape and tell their story. The others have vanished. (Roughly 200 girls remain missing.) The latest reports from people living in the forest say Boko Haram fighters are sharing the girls, conducting mass marriages, selling them each for $12. One community elder explained the practice as ""a medieval kind of slavery."" While much of the world has been consumed with other stories, notably the missing Malaysian plane, the relatives of the kidnapped girls in the small town of Chibok in northeastern Nigeria have struggled for weeks with no resources to help them. The Nigerian government allayed international concerns when it reported -- incorrectly  -- that it had rescued most of the girls. But the girls were still in captivity. Their parents raised money to arrange private expeditions into the jungle. They found villagers who had seen the hostages with heavily armed men. Relatives are holding street protests to demand more help from the government. With a social media push, including a Twitter #BringBackOurGirls campaign, they are seeking help anywhere they can find it. Nigerians demand government do more to save abducted girls . It's hard to imagine a more compelling, dramatic, heartbreaking story. And this is not a one-off event. This tragedy is driven by forces that will grow stronger and deadlier if the captors manage to succeed. I think of these girls as trapped in the rubble of a collapsed building. Their mothers and fathers try to dig them out with their bare hands, while the men who brought down the building vow to blow up others. Everyone else walks by, with barely a second glance. Perhaps this story sounds remote. But at its heart it is a version of the same conflict that drives the fighting in other parts of the world. These young girls, eager for an education, are caught in the crossfire of the war between Islamic radicalism and modernity. It's the Nigerian version of the same dispute that brought 9/11 to the United States; that brought killings to European, Asian and Middle Eastern cities; the same ideological battle that destroyed the lives of millions of people in Afghanistan; that drives many of the fighters in Syria and elsewhere. In Nigeria, the dispute includes uniquely local factors, but the objectives of Boko Haram sound eerily familiar. Boko Haram wants to impose its strict interpretation of Sharia -- Islamic law. It operates mostly in the northern part of Nigeria, a country divided between a Muslim-majority north and a Christian-majority south. Islamic rule is its larger objective, but its top priority, judging from the group's name, explains why it has gone after girls going to school. Boko Haram, in the local Hausa language, means roughly ""Western education is sin."" But women are just the beginning, and Boko Haram goes about its goals not only by kidnapping, but also by slaughtering men and women of all ages and of any religion. These militants view a modern education as an affront, no matter who receives it. In February, they burst into a student dormitory in the northern state of Yobe, where teenage boys were sleeping after a day of classes. They killed about 30 boys, shooting some, hacking others in their beds, slitting the throats of the ones trying to flee. In July, also in Yobe state, they shot  20 students and their teacher. The gruesome attacks are not restricted to remote areas. A few weeks ago, a bus bombing in the capital of Abuja killed more than 75 people. Boko Haram took responsibility. It was the deadliest terrorist act in the city's history. Boko Haram has killed thousands of people since 2009 and has caused a humanitarian crisis with a ""devastating impact,"" causing nearly 300,000 to flee their homes, according to Human Rights Watch. Nigeria is a resource-rich nation whose people live in grinding poverty. It is also plagued with endemic corruption. That triple combination -- poverty, corruption and resource-wealth -- creates fertile ground for strife and extremism. And the instability in Nigeria sends tremors through a fragile region. Boko Haram keeps hideouts and bases along the border with neighboring countries Cameroon and Chad. This is an international crisis that requires international help. Is there anything anyone can do? Most definitely. First, it is urgent that the plight of these girls and their families gain the prominence it so clearly deserves. Global attention will lead to offers for help, to press for action. Just as the intense focus on the missing Malaysian plane and the lost South Korean ferry prompted other nations to extend a hand, a focus on this ongoing tragedy would have the same effect. Nigeria's government, with a decidedly mixed record on its response to Boko Haram, will find it difficult to look away if world leaders offer assistance in finding and rescuing the kidnapped girls from Chibok, and another 25 girls also kidnapped by Boko Haram in the town of Konduga a few weeks earlier. This is an important story, a wrenching human drama, even if it happened in a part of the world where news coverage is very difficult compared with places such as Malaysia, South Korea or Australia. The plight of the Nigerian girls should remain in our thoughts, at the forefront of news coverage and on the agenda of world leaders.","Frida Ghitis: If more than 200 girls were kidnapped elsewhere, it would be world's biggest story .

"In a town not far from me, a municipal ballot measure has become a national bellwether. The citizens of SeaTac, a working-class community that includes the major airport for the Seattle-Tacoma area, will vote next month on whether to establish a $15 minimum wage for hospitality and transportation workers. This is obviously a fight about economics (a recent report (PDF) finds that those workers make an average wage of $11 today). Perhaps less obviously, it's also a fight about citizenship. The pro-Proposition 1 campaign is part of a resurgence of worker organizing across the country. Fast-food strikes have hit dozens of cities; autoworkers are unionizing in the low-wage South; fiercely independent lobstermen in Maine have already unionized. Labor organizers in SeaTac want to ride this wave. At the same time, the opposition is strong and well-funded and has the advantage of inertia. The airlines and hotel chains opposed to Proposition 1 need only to sow uncertainty and fear about unintended consequences -- the fear, specifically, of the layoffs or cuts in hours that might result if labor costs went up (and, implicitly, of course, if corporate profits remained untouched). But SeaTac is a town with fewer than 12,000 voters, with many immigrant families and with shops and restaurants where ""everybody knows your name."" Generic talking points and a vague invocation of fear or hope won't cut it here. Every voter's door in SeaTac can be knocked on more than once, and will be. Which is why SEIU 775NW, the local union that helped put Proposition 1 on the ballot, is investing heavily in feet on the street and face-to-face persuasion. What's notable in SeaTac, though, is that the people who live here are not pawns in anyone's game. For over three decades, workers in the United States found that as their economic fortunes declined, so did their civic clout. Now, everyday citizens in and around SeaTac who have endured constant economic insecurity are finding their voice and learning to ask in public whether they should accept as normal a life where working multiple jobs still can't push a family out of poverty. Last week, I heard one of these newly activated citizens. Evelyn Olano is a 51-year-old Filipina immigrant. She works two low-wage jobs at the airport, scanning bags and doing security seven days a week. Her husband, already past retirement age, cleans hotel rooms. Five or 10 years ago, Evelyn and every baggage handler and bathroom cleaner and car rental gatekeeper at SeaTac would have silently borne their lot. Today, they are not. They are becoming literate in the language of civic action and political power. As I watched Evelyn give a speech at a campaign event, it was very clear that she'd never done this before -- and that she'd be doing it again. Evelyn spoke of the dollars and cents difference Proposition 1 would make in her household. But her earnest presence testified just as powerfully to the democratic difference it would make. The economic rationale for a minimum wage hike is that it creates a virtuous cycle of increasing demand: When workers have more money, businesses have more customers, which means businesses hire more workers, which in turn generates more customers. Customer creation begets job creation, from the middle out and bottom up. The civic rationale for a minimum wage hike is similarly demand-driven. When more citizens demand economic fairness, powerful institutions become more responsive, which empowers more citizens to find their voice, which in turn leads our leaders to listen more to citizens. It's citizen creation, from the middle out and bottom up. The fight in SeaTac is evidence that the surest way to address economic inequality is to address political inequality: by organizing, speaking up and rounding up the votes to redefine what's considered normal in public policy. Indeed, even if Proposition 1 doesn't pass, it's already expanded the ""safe zone"" in regional politics: Both candidates for mayor in nearby Seattle have now pledged to raise their city's minimum wage to $15, a move that will have wide national reverberations. This era of economic upheaval nationwide and policy paralysis in Washington is leading citizens across the spectrum to rediscover the power of collective action. The tea party has showed vividly that an activated, well-organized minority, working together, can change the frame of what's possible in politics. Now, it's time for workers stuck in poverty to learn and apply that lesson. They may get a living wage. They will certainly get a healthier democracy.","Eric Liu: Proposition would raise wages by $4 for many in Seattle-area community .

"Three lawsuits alleging sex abuse by Kevin Clash, the puppeteer who gave Sesame Street's Elmo his voice, were dismissed by a judge who ruled the accusers waited too long to sue. Clash, who was suspended and later resigned from his Sesame Street after the first allegations surfaced in November, ""can go about the business of reclaiming his personal life and his professional standing,"" his lawyer told CNN Monday. The lawyer who filed the lawsuits vowed to ""appeal the decision and continue the fight to be a voice for victims."" A clerk with Manhattan District court confirmed that three lawsuits filed against Clash were dismissed on grounds that the statute of limitations had run out. Sesame Street had no immediate comment on the matter. Each accuser, all adult men, said they were courted and seduced by Clash when they were underage teenagers. Sheldon Stephens, now 24, was the first to the first to publicly claim he had a sexual relationship with Clash as a teen. Stephens called it an ""adult consensual relationship"" in November 2012, but filed a lawsuit in March 2013 alleging Clash threw a crystal meth sex party for him in 2004, when he was 16. Clash, who had provided the high-pitched voice of the iconic furry red Elmo since 1984, acknowledged a relationship between ""two consenting adults"" when Stephens' story initially emerged, but he said it otherwise was a ""false and defamatory allegation."" Stephens' suit, which was filed in Pennsylvania, is still pending. ""We have moved to dismiss,"" Berger said. ""I am a gay man,"" Clash, 52, said in a statement in November. ""I have never been ashamed of this or tried to hide it, but felt it was a personal and private matter."" Clash's attorney, Michael Berger, said Monday his client ""is pleased by the judge's decision."" ""As we have maintained all along, our goal has been to put these spurious claims behind him, so that Kevin can go about the business of reclaiming his personal life and his professional standing, which was recently recognized once again by the three Emmys he won last month,"" Berger said. ""The judge's decision to dismiss and close the three lawsuits is an important step in that direction. Kevin is looking forward to a time in the near future when he can tell his story free of innuendo and false claims."" The accusers' lawyer, Jeff Herman, called it ""the first battle."" ""The statute of limitations is an arbitrary timeline that silences victims,"" Herman said. ""We believe that the victims in this case are within the statute of limitations, but this ruling highlights the need for a window in New York to allow victims to have their day in court."" In November, Clash issued a written statement saying: ""I am resigning from Sesame Workshop with a very heavy heart. I have loved every day of my 28 years working for this exceptional organization. Personal matters have diverted attention away from the important work Sesame Street is doing and I cannot allow it to go on any longer.

"A review of a computer hard drive used by cop-killing suspect Eric Matthew Frein shows he planned the attack and his retreat into the woods for a couple of years, Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col George Bivens said Friday. Bivens said a hard drive which Frein had access to indicated extensive Internet research on topics such as ""how to avoid police manhunts, use of various law enforcement technologies and skills related to survival."" ""It did give us a lot of insight into the techniques that he might be employing -- what his escape might involve,"" Bivens said. ""But it did not provide as much information as we might have hoped had it been his own computer."" Frein, 31, is the suspect in a September 12 ambush that left Cpl. Byron Dickson dead and another trooper wounded outside the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Blooming Grove, Pennsylvania. He is still being sought. Police were able to track Frein through his cell phone when he called his parents one time earlier this month, a federal law enforcement official told CNN. Frein hung up after one ring, the source said. Authorities asked CNN not to report Frein's cell phone use at the time. The detail can be reported now because police have identified the area where they believe Frein to be. The cell phone has not been turned on since that time. ""I'm not going to comment on anything that may have been done with cell phones,"" Bivens said Friday. Direct message from police . Addressing Frein directly, the colonel said, ""You are a coward. Your actions have caused tremendous disruption for an innocent community all while you try to hide from us. We are not intimidated. We will not leave ... We will protect the community. We will find you and we will bring you to justice."" The nearly two-week search for Frein included the abandoned Buck Hill Inn, a sprawling 46-acre hotel complex. ""Frein has been known to visit the area in the past and it is a large facility that needs to be cleared,"" Pennsylvania State Trooper Tom Kelly said via email. ""There has been no sighting there or no one specific reason as to why it is being searched."" Bivens added, ""We do know he has an interest in that location and do know he has spent some time there."" A war buff obsessed with Eastern European military conflicts, Frein has ""experimented with explosives,"" Bivens said. ""We are taking that into consideration"" and checking for ""booby traps"" while searching cabins and caves where Frein might have been hiding. The suspect may have a radio with him. ""There is nothing in our investigation that indicates Frein has left the area,"" he said. Suspect described as very meticulous . Frein appeared in an upcoming documentary about Vietnam War re-enactors called ""Vietnam Appreciation Day."" ""Eric kind of kept himself to the side,"" Patrick Bresnan, the director, told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""He had mannequins that he brought that he dressed in uniforms. He was very meticulous about the layout of those mannequins, the weaponry that were with them. He had magazines from the period, letters from soldiers back to their family and a lot of photography."" Bresnan said most re-enactors see what they do as a hobby. A small percentage, however, take the practice too seriously, even hoarding both antique and modern weapons. There is a sense of empowerment they feel re-enacting battles, he said. ""There is the point in which the fantasy of being a soldier kind of gets blurred and they become a soldier,"" he said. ""And I think that's what we are seeing here with Eric."" Bresnan's wife, Ivette Lucas, who also worked on the film, said of Frein: ""He was very specific, very precise about what he did. And he actually preferred to do what they call tactical re-enactments, which are re-enactments that are private and that are performed in the woods where they actually go out and hunt the, you know, in this case, Viet Cong... He might have just snapped and took the fantasy a little bit, well, way more seriously. "" On Wednesday, with as many as 1,000 law enforcement officers involved in the manhunt at any given time, authorities revealed that the meticulous, grid-like search over some 3 square miles of rugged terrain was paying off. There have been a number of sightings of a man believed to be Frein by both residents and police, Bivens said without giving further details. The sightings were from a significant distance, however. The search has yielded an empty pack of Serbian cigarettes, Bivens said. Frein claims to have fought with Serbians in Africa and has studied Russian and Serbian languages, according to the FBI, which last week named him one of its 10 Most Wanted fugitives. Soiled adult diapers were also found, perhaps used by Frein to stay in a stationary position for long periods of time. Authorities have said that Frein hated law enforcement and that they believe that he's solely focused on hurting more officers but not civilians. Trooper Alex T. Douglass survived the shooting. ""I think this is a game to him in some ways,"" Bivens said of Frein this week. Who is suspect Eric Frein?","Eric Matthew Frein tried to call his parents earlier this month, source says .

"After being smacked in the face by wave upon wave of sex abuse scandals for the past decade, it's easy to feel nothing but angry or numb. So Joe Paterno's statue came down, a slew of dioceses went bankrupt, and thousands of once-secret documents about molesters in the Boy Scouts will soon be made public.  It's fair to ask: Have we learned anything? That makes it a good time to step back and look beyond individual villains to the big picture. When you put together the stories of Penn State, the Roman Catholic Church, the Boy Scouts and other organizations hit by abuse scandals, you see they reacted in much the same way. Their behavior was shocking, but it was more common than we knew. Thanks to lawsuits and news reports, we now see this: For decades, some of our most trusted institutions -- from schools, camps and sports leagues to correctional facilities, foster care agencies and religious groups -- have inadvertently enabled child molesters at the expense of victims. While leaders in many youth-serving organizations have confronted the abuse problem head-on, others routinely erred on the side of molesters, ignored the extent of abuse in their ranks, hid abuse from authorities and misled the public. News: Sex abuse files prompt calls for Boy Scout ousters . Why? To protect the good work of their organizations. They lost their perspective on where organizational protection ends and child protection begins. The Boy Scouts of America reflects this struggle as much as anyone. From 1971-1991, the Scouts banned more than 1,800 people for alleged sexual misconduct, according to its own ""Confidential Files,"" made public in a lawsuit in the 1990s. Those files reveal a well-intentioned effort to protect kids. But they also reveal a culture of silence that is typical of organizations that stumble over their abuse problem. Time and again, Scout leaders tried to keep abuse incidents from legal authorities or the media: In Illinois, a volunteer admitted to abusing a Scout and agreed to resign ""in return for no further legal action."" In Tennessee, Scout officials talked a victim's parents out of contacting police, promising to ""handle the situation"" internally. They let the molester resign and he was arrested months later for abusing another boy. When a Pennsylvania scoutmaster was arrested for molesting three boys, a local Scout executive worked with the chief of police to ""do everything he could to keep this account out of the newspaper to protect the name of the Boy Scouts."" New report accuses Boy Scouts of protecting child molesters . The result was often disaster: first for kids, as molesters went on to abuse again, then for the organization, as victims eventually spoke up to lawyers and reporters. In this kind of clumsiness, however, the BSA has not been alone: . Schools: The most thorough national report on sex abuse in public schools in 2004 found that ""when alleged misconduct is reported, the majority of complaints are ignored or disbelieved."" A 1990s study of 225 cases of ""educator sexual misconduct"" in New York state found that ""all of the accused had admitted to sexual abuse of a student but none of the abusers was reported to authorities and only 1 percent lost their license to teach."" Religious communities: The practice of keeping abuse allegations from secular authorities has a long tradition in several denominations besides the Catholic church. Some Orthodox Jewish communities are coming under increasing fire, through indictments and lawsuits, for pressuring families not to report allegations to authorities. When a family in Lakewood, New Jersey, ignored that pressure in 2009, some rabbis circulated a proclamation that said, ""It is prohibited (for anyone) to assist and participate with the secular authorities in their efforts to persecute a Jewish person."" In Brooklyn, the district attorney launched an initiative in 2009 to uncover abuse in Orthodox Jewish communities. Similar tales of being pressured to ""keep it in the house"" are told in lawsuits by families in the Mormon Church and Jehovah's Witnesses. Corrections: Sexual assaults are rampant in juvenile correctional facilities. A 2010 report by the U.S. Department of Justice estimated that 12% of young people in custody were sexually abused at their facilities in the past year. Of that 12%, 91% were boys and the rest were girls. Most of them were abused by staff, the very people who investigate abuse allegations. No wonder those allegations often go nowhere. Just a few years ago Texas disbanded the Texas Youth Commission, the state agency that ran juvenile corrections, after investigators found that commission had largely dismissed and covered up hundreds of allegations of sex abuse. Sports: Former young swimmers and gymnasts allege in several recent criminal and civil complaints that they were abused by coaches, and that their complaints met with superficial inquiries at best. Deena Deardurff Schmidt, a 1972 Olympic champion swimmer, said in a deposition when she reported her abuse: ""Most everyone I told in coaching gave me an answer that I felt was very vague and dismissive, that my coach was a great coach."" Today, sex abuse victims are less alone . The good news: The increased awareness brought on by lawsuits, indictments and news reports have driven a cultural shift in which kids are more likely to report abuse and to be believed. That shift has also compelled youth-serving organizations to significantly improve their procedures for preventing and reporting abuse. From national groups like the Boy Scouts to stand-alone after-school programs, most organizations run more thorough background checks on job and volunteer applicants; better train their staff and youth about how to prevent and recognize abuse; and enforce tighter procedures for reporting abuse. That's the other side of the big picture: The victims are winning.","Patrick Boyle: Boy Scout child sex abuse -- this kind of scandal is way too familiar .

"(CNN)Sarah Goodfriend and Suzanne Bryant, together for more than 30 years, made history Thursday by participating in Texas' first same-sex marriage, despite a statewide ban. Hours later, however, the Texas Supreme Court blocked other gay couples from obtaining marriage licenses after a legal challenge by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. The state high court did not explicitly say it invalidated the marriage of the two women in Austin, but Paxton said in a statement that the court voided the marriage license. ""The same-sex marriage license ... is void, just as any license issued in violation of state law would be,"" the attorney general said. Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond Law School in Virginia, said via email that the Supreme Court stay did not mention the marriage license. ""He is asserting something that the order does not say on its face,"" Tobias said of Paxton. ""He may be correct, but you sure cannot tell what he says from the order's wording."" A county clerk in Austin issued the state's first marriage license to the same-sex couple, acting on the order of a Travis County judge who said health issues prevented the couple from waiting for further court decisions. Travis County Clerk Dana DeBeauvoir's office said she issued Goodfriend and Bryant a marriage license at the order of District Judge David Wahlberg. Goodfriend said she had emergency surgery after being diagnosed with ovarian cancer in May. Paxton responded by asking the Texas Supreme Court to block any rulings that ""seek to undermine the constitutionality of Texas' marriage law."" ""The Texas Constitution clearly defines marriage as between one man and one woman, as Texas voters approved by an overwhelming majority,"" he said in a statement on Wednesday. ""The law of Texas has not changed, and will not change due to the whims of any individual judge or county clerk operating on their own capacity anywhere in Texas. Activist judges don't change Texas law, and we will continue to aggressively defend the laws of our state and will ensure that any licenses issued contrary to law are invalid."" In a statement, Gov. Greg Abbott said the ""Texas Constitution defines marriage as consisting 'only of the union of one man and one woman' and was approved by more than three-quarters of Texas voters. I am committed to ensuring that the Texas Constitution is upheld and that the rule of law is maintained in the State of Texas."" Thursday's order applied only to that one couple, and ""any additional licenses issued to same-sex couples also must be court ordered,"" DeBeauvoir's office said in a statement. ""We're here today -- two moms, two daughters -- but we're not different than the thousands and thousands of same sex couples who were recognized in the last census,"" Bryant said. ""There are thousands of gay Texans. Everybody knows one or two or three. Even if you don't know,  you do know them. They may not feel safe to be out but you know them."" At a news conference, Goodfriend and Bryant held hands with their daughters, Dawn and Ting. ""Is this really happening?"" Bryant asked a couple of times. ""It's a very important day for our family,"" she told reporters. ""It's a very important day for everyone who believes in justice and equality."" ""This really is very very meaningful to our family to have the kind of ability to make personal decisions, health decisions and financial decisions as a family,"" Goodfriend said of the historic moment. But Goodfriend said the moment was bittersweet. ""There are many other Texans, thousands of Texans who would like to be able to have their loving committed relationship recognized,"" she said. Tobias said the Supreme Court stay essentially means the issuance of other marriage licenses to gay couples is unlikely. And the county court judge's ruling does not portend the end of the Texas ban. ""I think that the state court judge seems to be treating this case as a special one (because) of the health issues involved, so this appears to be a special exception,"" he said. ""But (it's) unclear why the (attorney general) is so vigorously contesting what seems to be a narrow ruling, which may only apply to the couple before the court."" Texas' ban on same-sex marriage was struck down by a federal judge in January 2014, though that judge allowed it to remain in effect pending appeals. ""We didn't want to wait for the Supreme Court to make a decision -- which in June they probably will allow Texans to marry,"" Bryant said. ""We have reasons to need to move a little bit faster. It seems that the judge understood that."" Bryant, an attorney, said she wasn't too concerned about the state attorney general's efforts. ""If they want to come in and try to undo this they will,"" she told reporters. ""We have a valid marriage license and I don't think they can."" DeBeauvoir's statement said her office was ordered to immediately ""cease and desist relying on the unconstitutional Texas prohibitions against same-sex marriage as a basis for not issuing a marriage license."" In the case of Goodfriend and Bryant, the statement cited ""severe and immediate health concerns."" ""We are all waiting for a final decision on marriage equality,"" DeBeauvoir said in the statement. ""However, this couple may not get the chance to hear the outcome of this issue because (of) one person's health. ... It is important to note that this order applies only to the medically fragile couple who brought the court action. Any additional licenses issued to same-sex couples also must be court ordered."" Paxton said his office filed a lawsuit seeking to enjoin the Travis County clerk from issuing any other same-sex marriage licenses. Bryant told reporters, ""We're just very grateful that we've had this opportunity to crack the door open in Texas. We hope it will swing wide for everyone very soon."" CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Texas issues first marriage license to a same-sex couple in the state .

"The uproar in India over the arrest of an Indian diplomat in New York is growing. Indians are protesting outside the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, the Indian government has revoked privileges for American diplomats, and Indian politicians have called for a review of their nation's ties with the United States. E-mail and Facebook appeals are even calling on Indians to refuse to meet with any U.S. citizen. But the outcry over Devyani Khobragade's treatment is drowning out the serious allegations of exploiting her employee, also an Indian national, and the pervasive violations against millions of other domestic workers around the world and in the homes of diplomats in America. Khobragade, India's deputy consul general in New York, was arrested last week over allegations of falsifying visa application documents for a woman who worked as her housekeeper and nanny in New York. Khobragade reported she paid the woman $4,500 a month. In reality, federal prosecutors say, the domestic worker received less than $600 a month and was forced to work far more than 40 hours a week. Her effective hourly wage -- $3.13 -- was less than half of New York's minimum wage of $7.25. Many Indians are outraged over allegations that Khobragade, after leaving her daughter at school, was handcuffed on the street -- although this has been disputed -- later strip-searched and kept in a holding cell before being released on $250,000 bail. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, in a written statement, said Khobragade was arrested discreetly, was not handcuffed and was given time to arrange personal matters including child care -- but she was searched in custody as is ""standard practice for every defendant, rich or poor, American or not, in order to make sure that no prisoner keeps anything on his person that could harm anyone, including himself."" There's no doubt that strip searches, a routine part of U.S. felony arrests, are humiliating. Indians are understandably disturbed by a practice that is rare in India and seems particularly degrading. But the treatment of domestic workers, who number more than 50 million worldwide and are one of every 13 female wage earners, is often even more degrading. They are typically grossly underpaid and often mistreated. In our investigations in the United States and elsewhere, Human Rights Watch has found that women who work as nannies and housekeepers, and often both, make far below the minimum wage and are often expected to work 14 to 18 hours a day. Millions of women and girls travel across borders to earn money as domestic workers to send back to their families. They take care of elderly people in the homes where they work, cook, clean and take care of their employers' children. They generate billions of dollars in remittances for their countries of origin but are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. Many are forced to pay huge sums to unscrupulous recruiters, or work without pay for several months to cover their debt. Cut off from their family and other sources of support, many feel they have little choice but to work under slavelike conditions. In some cases, they are locked in their workplaces. They are sometimes beaten. Unpaid wages, excessive working hours and physical, sexual and psychological abuse are the most common problems. Domestic workers have even fewer options when their employers have diplomatic immunity and cannot be criminally prosecuted, regardless of how severe their crimes. The employers have control over their visas, which also leaves them with little recourse. The U.S. State Department has received dozens of allegations of abuse by foreign diplomats and by officials at the World Bank and other international financial institutions. In one case that became public, a former domestic worker accused her employer, a Kuwaiti diplomat, of raping her repeatedly. In another, a domestic worker for a former Philippine ambassador said she was forced to work 126 hours a week without pay. A 2008 Government Accountability Office report identified 42 cases of abuse by diplomats with immunity over an eight-year period, and said that the actual number was probably higher. Many cases are never reported because the victims are too frightened to complain or feel they can't afford to lose the job. As a consular official, Khobragade has limited immunity, which the State Department says does not cover visa fraud, a felony. Too many diplomats have used their immunity to exploit their employees. By taking action in this case, the State Department is sending an important message -- no employer is above the law. It is not just singling out foreign diplomats. The Khobragade case has raised good questions about the treatment of criminal suspects in the United States, including the use of routine strip searches. But that debate should not be at the expense of women exploited as domestic workers. Their treatment is just as important.","Jo Becker: Outcry over Indian diplomat's arrest overshadows issue of domestic worker abuse .

"Celebrity chef Paula Deen, who lost endorsements and a national cooking show after she admitted using a racial slur in the past, on Friday welcomed the resolution of a lawsuit by a former employee who leveled accusations of racism and sexual harassment. The federal lawsuit will be dismissed by agreement, according to a court filing. It was not immediately clear whether there was a settlement,  but a description on a federal court website labeled the filing as a ""settlement agreement."" A federal judge in Georgia had not signed off on the agreement, according to the filing. The proceedings will be dismissed ""with prejudice,"" meaning the lawsuit cannot be filed again. The parties agreed the dismissal would be ""without any award of costs or fees to any party,"" according to the posting. Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge William T. Moore Jr. in Savannah dismissed a portion of the lawsuit that contended former employee Lisa Jackson was a victim of racial discrimination. Deen released a statement Friday, said she believes ""in kindness and fairness for everyone."" ""While this has been a difficult time for both my family and myself, I am pleased that the judge dismissed the race claims and I am looking forward to getting this behind me, now that the remaining claims have been resolved."" Deen's career and public reputation went into a tailspin earlier this summer after her deposition in the lawsuit, in which she admitted using the ""N word"" in the past, was released. Jackson alleged that Deen and her brother, Bubba Hiers, committed numerous acts of violence, discrimination and racism that resulted in the end of her five years of employment at The Lady and Sons, and Uncle Bubba's Oyster House -- two Savannah, Georgia, restaurants run by Deen and her family. But Jackson could not claim to be a victim of racial discrimination targeting African-American workers because she is white, Moore ruled in early August. Other aspects of the lawsuit, including sexual harassment and abusive treatment, were still pending until Friday's agreed order of dismissal. CNN was unable to immediately reach lawyers for Jackson. Savannah is where Deen built her business and brand into what many consider the folksy face of Southern cooking. In the media firestorm that followed news of the deposition, Deen lost lucrative endorsements and her Food Network cooking show, while the publication of her eagerly anticipated cookbook was canceled. In her statement, Deen thanked Jackson for five years of service at Uncle Bubba's. ""Moving forward my team and I are working to review the workplace environment issues that were raised in this matter and to retool all of my businesses operations,"" Deen said. ""I look forward to getting back to doing what I love."" Jackson's complaint alleged that a ""racially biased attitude prevailed throughout and pervaded defendants' restaurant operations,"" and that African-American staff could use the restaurant's rear entrance only. But the judge ruled there was no evidence racially offensive comments allegedly made by Hiers were directed toward Jackson or made with the intent to harass her. The complaint said the company was a ""boy's club"" with men in management positions, ""and women are not invited to take on substantial decision-making roles."" Jackson contended that Hiers subjected her to sexual harassment on ""an almost daily basis."" In June, Deen's sons staunchly defended their mother, saying allegations of racism were false ""character assassination."" ""Neither one of our parents ever taught us to be bigoted toward any other person for any reason,"" Bobby Deen told CNN's ""New Day"" in an exclusive interview with Chris Cuomo. ""Our mother is one of the most compassionate, good-hearted, empathetic people that you'd ever meet,"" he added. ""These accusations are very hurtful to her, and it's very sad."" A deposition confession . At a May deposition in the Jackson lawsuit, Deen admitted having used the ""N word"" long ago. Jackson lawyer: ""Miss Deen, have you told racial jokes?"" Deen: ""No, not racial."" Jackson lawyer: ""Have you ever used the 'N word' yourself?"" Deen: ""Yes, of course."" Deen testified that she probably used the racial slur when talking to her husband about ""when a black man burst into the bank that I was working at and put a gun to my head."" ""I didn't feel real favorable towards him,"" she said, referring to the robber. Jackson lawyer: ""Have you used it since then?"" Deen: ""I'm sure I have, but it's been a very long time."" Deen said she couldn't remember other contexts in which she used the slur, but ""maybe in repeating something that was said to me."" ""But that's just not a word that we use as time has gone on,"" she said. ""Things have changed since the '60s in the South. And my children and my brother object to that word being used in any cruel or mean behavior."" Deen apologized for her language in two videos produced in June. ""I want to learn and grow from this,"" she said in one video. ""Inappropriate and hurtful language is totally, totally unacceptable. I've made plenty of mistakes along the way but I beg you, my children, my team, my fans, my partners -- I beg for your forgiveness.""

"President Obama may have promised Americans that they can keep their insurance if they like it, but that's not the case in at least three states where insurance companies are required to discontinue plans that don't meet Obamacare's new coverage standards. Virginia, Kentucky and Idaho have told insurance companies that they must scrap insurance plans that don't meet the minimum coverage requirements laid out in the Affordable Care Act. Some states allow insurers to amend their current plans to include the new benefits, such as maternity care and prescription drug coverage, required under Obamacare. But these three states have determined that with so many changes required under Obamacare, it's easier to start over than to try to bring existing plans into compliance. Ronda Sloan, a spokeswoman for the Kentucky Department of Insurance, explained the policy this way: ""In this case, you're talking about an entirely new product. They had to file a completely new policy. ... It was easier just to start from scratch."" That means that about half of the roughly 600,000 people in Kentucky's private insurance market will have their current insurance plans discontinued by the end of next year. Private insurance only makes up part of the state's insurance market, which also includes employer-based coverage, and Medicare and Medicaid. Virginia Bureau of Insurance spokesman Ken Schrad said insurance companies could offer customers with discontinued plans similar coverage, but it also has to include the new mandated Obamacare benefits. But, he cautioned, ""it is virtually impossible to compare what you have to what you're going to have because of all the new provisions."" Indeed, some people may find the new plans cost more. Others might qualify for subsidies and pay less for their insurance. White House spokesman Jay Carney on Tuesday defended the president's promise, arguing that anyone who has a plan that predates the Affordable Care Act can keep that plan -- as long as its terms have not changed in the interim. ""The president was clear about a basic fact: If you had insurance that you liked on the individual market, and you wanted to keep that insurance through 2010, '11, '12, '13 and in perpetuity if you wanted it and it was available, you could. You were grandfathered in,"" Carney said at the White House briefing Tuesday. In practice, insurance companies are loath to leave their plans unchanged, so grandfathered plans are disappearing. Numbers for how many grandfathered plans are hard to come by, and insurers don't seem to be looking back. ""Health plans want to keep their customers. In notifying consumers about changes to their existing coverage, health plans are educating them about their new coverage options, including the benefits and assistance that are available through the new marketplaces, and helping them enroll,"" said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans. But even having to enroll in a new plan could leave some people confused and upset, particularly after the president assured them repeatedly that that wouldn't be the case.","Virginia, Kentucky and Idaho tell insurers to end non-compliant plans .

"Xi Jinping has taken the center stage as China's undisputed paramount leader. The National People's Congress this week confirmed Xi as the new state president and chairman of the State Central Military Commission, making him the Communist party chief, head of state and commander-in-chief. This completes the handover of power from Hu Jintao, 70, who ruled China for 10 years, to the 59-year-old Xi, who was announced as the country's presumptive leader last November. Conventional wisdom had it that Xi would be a weak leader because he had not been hand-picked by late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, as had Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao. Pundits also predicted that Xi would need two or three years to consolidate power because Jiang and Hu, his predecessors, were ""looking over his shoulder."" Xi is proving conventional wisdom wrong. In the past four months, Xi has taken steps to set him apart from his predecessor, signaling that change may be afoot. He has, for example, directed officials to minimize pomp and privilege, eschew ostentatious banquets and refrain from ""empty talk."" In his speech to close the National People's Congress at the weekend, Xi vowed to ""always listen to the voice of the people and respond to the expectations of the people."" He pledged that his government would ""strive to achieve the Chinese dream of great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."" On assuming the Party leadership last year, Xi symbolically made his first out-of-town trip not to a Maoist or revolutionary shrine, but to Shenzhen, the first laboratory of market reform which in a mere 30 years has evolved from a sleepy backwater village into a vibrant urban center. Shenzhen is the product of Xi's late father Xi Zhongxun, a revolutionary leader who served as vice premier and governor of Guangdong province. While in Guangdong the elder Xi pioneered market reforms, including the creation of Special Economic Zones, of which Shenzhen was one. It's not clear what legacy the younger Xi will leave so early into his reign, but analysts say events in the early days of his premiership have already put him to the test. One of Xi's first challenges came just a month after he took over as party chief. A few days after New Year, staffers of Southern Weekly, a liberal-leaning newspaper in the southern city of Guangzhou staged a protest after a local propaganda official rewrote an editorial calling for stronger rule of law. The dispute escalated with other journalists and Chinese celebrities giving protesters public support and putting pressure on Xi's new team to respect press freedom and free speech. Days later a tentative compromise was reached, diffusing the crisis, but not all are impressed. ""The crisis ended in a kind of a draw -- no side really won,"" said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, professor at the Hong Kong Baptist University. ""The only reform in the pipeline is administrative -- the streamlining of the Chinese cabinet, positive results likely but inconclusive."" Cabestan acknowledges Xi's new style but wonders if he brings new substance. ""Beyond a new way of speaking and a better ability to communicate and create empathy, Xi has not yet spelled out new policies or reforms,"" Cabestan said. ""He has indicated a willingness to deepen the fight against corruption and waste but by relying on the same institutions and methods. He has deepened China's foreign policy assertiveness but not really modified its modus operandi -- so it's old wine in a new bottle!"" Some National People's Congress delegates I interviewed inside the Great Hall of the People are more sanguine. ""He rose up from county chief to the top, step by step,"" delegate Cai Shijie told me. ""Even before he became number one, he knew what's going on in our society, the ordinary people's disappointments and aspirations. He knows what needs to be done to meet people's expectations."" Cai is the CEO of Xin Chang'an Group, a private pharmaceutical company based in Xi'an. He hopes Xi's team can boost the private sector. ""Private enterprises generate jobs but we find it difficult to get loans,"" he explained. ""State-owned enterprises enjoy monopoly and have easier access to capital and resources so they make easy profits. We need equal treatment."" Huang Youyi, a senior editor in a state-run publishing house, likes Xi's background. ""Xi is of my age, he also spent years in the countryside as an educated youth, just like me,"" he said. ""At least he knows the real situation then and now."" And Xi's new team? ""It's a team of doers,"" Huang added. ""They are quite confident but they also face huge challenges."" Many challenges demand urgent solutions: a slowdown in economic growth, rising joblessness, growing rich-poor divide, rampant corruption, environmental and pollution problems, public discontent and sharp social tension. On top of these, Xi has to manage a rising China and a surge in nationalism that is pushing China in confrontation with Japan and other neighbors. All these are causing political, social and economic tensions. Xi cannot afford put big decisions on hold, analysts said. ""The rising tide of mass resentment, emboldened by social media and ubiquitous communications, and the political scandals of 2012, all combined with Xi's sense and vision to give him a power surge,"" said China-watcher Robert Lawrence Kuhn. ""He has surprising credibility and abundant political capital. If he is serious about tackling China's entrenched problems, he will need to spend that political capital."" How Xi handle these issues will set the tone for China's 1.3 billion people -- and for the entire world.","Xi Jinping endorsed as Chinese president in leadership handover .

"Chechen warlord Doku Umarov, one of Russia's most wanted men, has died, a Chechen jihadist website said Tuesday. The Kavkaz Center website said Umarov would be replaced as leader of the Islamist group Caucasus Emirate by Ali Abu Mohammed. Umarov has frequently been reported as killed or wounded in combat. The report of his death has not been independently confirmed. The website did not say when or how Umarov had died. It called him ""a martyr."" The U.S. State Department said Umarov organized a suicide bombing outside the Chechen Interior Ministry in May 2009. His group also claimed responsibility for the bombing of Domodedovo Airport in Moscow in 2011 that killed 36 people, the 2010 bombings of the Moscow subway that killed 40 people, and the 2009 bombing of the high-speed Nevsky Express train in which 28 people died. Umarov was a seasoned fighter who survived more than six years as the self-styled leader of the Caucasus Emirate. The Caucasus Emirate, or Imarat Kavkaz, has its roots in the 1990s Chechen insurgency. Umarov had called on his followers to do what they could to disrupt last month's Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. He claimed the Games were being held on the graves of Muslim occupants of Sochi, who he said were driven out by Russian imperial forces in the 19th century. What was behind Volgograd attacks?

"The cardinals who must pick a successor to Pope Benedict XVI after he steps down on February 28 could meet to make the decision sooner than thought, a Vatican spokesman said Saturday. The conclave, the meeting which will bring together the 117 cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church, could start before March 15 if all the cardinals are already in Rome, Father Federico Lombardi said. Lombardi had previously said the conclave was likely to start between March 15 and 19. But he gave new details Saturday, saying that because the pope had resigned rather than the conclave being triggered by his death, there was scope for the time frame to be brought forward. The decision may not come until after Benedict's departure and lies in the hands of the cardinals, he added. Opinion: Pope Benedict shows true leadership by resigning . Benedict is the first pope to step down in nearly 600 years, throwing the Vatican into some confusion. Experts are working on points of the Apostolic Constitution that need to be clarified or interpreted, Lombardi said, and are expected to give pointers on the new protocol soon. Lombardi said he had met with the pope Saturday morning and found him ""calm and relaxed even in these so emotional days."" Benedict, 85, shocked the world Monday when he announced his intention to stand down at the end of the month, citing the frailty of old age. Read more: Huge challenges await next pope . While Benedict won't be directly involved in his successor's selection, his influence will undoubtedly be felt. He appointed 67 of the 117 cardinals that are set to make the decision. More than two-thirds of the final number of cardinals must agree on the next pope. The announcement that a decision has been made will come in the form of a puff of white smoke emerging from a chimney in the Vatican. Benedict will hold a final audience in Vatican City's St. Peter's Square on February 27, but the church is not planning a formal ceremony to mark the pope's departure, Lombardi said. The pontiff, born Joseph Ratzinger, will first go by helicopter to the pope's summer residence in Castel Gandolfo, Lombardi said. He could remain at Castel Gondolfo until the end of April or early May while the works to ready a new residence for him in a monastery within the Vatican are completed, Lombardi said. Once there, he will devote himself to a life of reflection and prayer. Lombardi told reporters that the pope's decision shouldn't be seen only as negative, but rather as a lucid and responsible choice that he had taken for the good of the Church. Benedict wants the new pontiff to have the physical and moral vigor necessary to take on the necessary reforms of the Church, Lombardi said, adding that it will be up to the new pope and the cardinals to establish their priorities. Benedict's decision to remain in Vatican City has a practical as well as a spiritual motivation, he said. His presence will enable him to support his successor and the rest of the clergy, Lombardi said, although he dismissed the idea that Benedict would interfere as the new pope takes charge. The last pope to step down before his death was Gregory XII, who in 1415 quit to end a civil war within the church in which more than one man claimed to be pope. When do you know it's time to go?","Benedict could stay in the summer papal residence till April or May, Vatican aide says .

"Federal prosecutors can no longer obtain search warrants for information obtained by journalists unless a reporter is the subject of a criminal investigation for conduct unrelated to news gathering, the Justice Department announced Friday. It is one key change in guidelines stemming from controversial federal investigations over leaks of classified information that resulted in efforts by prosecutors to obtain journalist records about reporting on national security issues. In response to the uproar, Attorney General Eric Holder conducted a review of agency policy and briefed President Barack Obama on his plans for changes earlier in the day. Obama had previously ordered him to address the matter and report back. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the president accepted Holder's report that changed 30-year-old guidelines, which also had followed numerous meetings with members of the news media and members of Congress. Holder says he did not mislead Congress over reporter leak probe . The revised guidelines used by prosecutors nationwide will be implemented quickly. No congressional action is necessary. Revelations that the Justice Department subpoenaed AP phone records and obtained a search warrant for e-mail correspondence involving a Fox News reporter as part of separate national security leak investigations provoked outrage among media. There was also concern from civil libertarians, privacy advocates and some members of Congress that prosecutors had gone too far. Obama said he was troubled at the possibility the leak investigations might chill the work of journalists aiming to hold government accountable. ""Journalists should not be at legal risk for doing their jobs. Our focus must be on those who break the law,"" Obama said in May. Opinion: Obama won't let media do their job . The Justice Department defended the scrutiny and Holder subsequently said he would never prosecute reporters for doing their job. In addition to the change on search warrants, prosecutors now have to give news organizations advance notice of subpoenas unless notification would ""pose a clear and substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation, risk grave harm to national security, or present an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm."" That is a switch from current rules, which presumes prior notification would not occur unless an assistant attorney general finds there would be no harm. The attorney general now must make the decision about whether prior notification of a search warrant would harm an investigation. If the attorney general determines a delay is necessary to protect an investigation, it can last no longer than 90 days. But under the new rules the working presumption is that news organizations will be notified in advance and would have the opportunity to challenge subpoenas for material. ""While these reforms will make a meaningful difference, there are additional protections that only Congress can provide,"" said Holder.  ""For that reason, we continue to support the passage of media shield legislation."" In the case involving the AP, the Justice Department last year obtained two months of phone records for reporters and editors at the news service as part of a probe that AP said was focused on its account of a foiled plot in Yemen to bomb a U.S. airliner in May 2012. AP was not informed until a year later. Justice says it followed rules in leak probe, but key question unanswered . In the second probe, the department obtained a search warrant in 2010 for e-mail correspondence between Fox reporter James Rosen and a former State Department contractor accused of leaking Rosen classified material on North Korea. Rosen was not charged in the investigation although a government affidavit referred to him as a possible co-conspirator. Holder said it was never the intent to prosecute a reporter. The changes announced by the Justice Department include a requirement that the intelligence community certify a leak has caused harm before the attorney general would allow prosecutors to seek media-related records. The department also will provide yearly reports on the number of requests made for information from reporters. The Justice Department also will create a News Media Review Committee. That panel will include the department's chief privacy and civil liberties officer as well as the director of public affairs, two officials who might take a hard look at requests to interview reporters or obtain their records. The department will launch a separate group called the News Media Dialogue Group which will meet in six months to review whether the changes in guidelines have been effective. That panel will include representatives from news organizations.

"A 29-year-old former U.S. Marine who has been jailed in Iran since 2011 and accused of being a CIA spy says in a letter to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry that his confession was made under duress. ""For over 2 years I have been held on false charges based solely on confessions obtained by force, threats, miserable prison conditions, and prolonged periods of solitary confinement,"" Amir Hekmati says in the letter, which was obtained and published by the Guardian and whose authenticity the family vouched for to CNN. ""This is part of a propaganda and hostage taking effort by Iranian intelligence to secure the release of Iranians abroad being held on security-related charges."" Hekmati adds that Iranian intelligence told his court-appointed lawyer that he could be released in exchange for two Iranians being held abroad. ""I had nothing to do with their arrest, committed no crime, and see no reason why the U.S. Government should entertain such a ridiculous proposition,"" writes Hekmati, who has dual U.S.-Iranian citizenship. ""I do not wish to set a precedent for others that may be unlawfully (obtained) for political gain in the future. While my family and I have suffered greatly I will accept nothing but my unconditional release."" Father fears he may never see his son imprisoned in Iran . Though Hekmati has been able to send and receive letters, it was not clear how this letter -- dated September 1 -- was sent. The newspaper reported Wednesday that the letter had been smuggled out. Born in Arizona and raised in Nebraska before settling with his family in Flint, Michigan, Hekmati joined the Marines in 2001 out of high school. He finished his service four years later as a decorated combat veteran with tours in Iraq. Afterward, he translated Arabic as a contractor and helped train troops in cultural sensitivity. Hekmati's family said he had gone to Iran to visit his grandmother but was arrested in August 2011, accused by Iran's Intelligence Ministry of working as a CIA agent. In December 2011, Hekmati appeared on Iranian state television maintaining that he had been sent to Iran by the CIA. Family pleads for his release . At trial, whose proceedings were not public, prosecutors accused him of trying to infiltrate Iran's intelligence system in order to accuse Iran of involvement in terrorist activities, according to the semi-official Fars news agency. In January 2012, he was convicted and sentenced to death. Two months later, an Iranian court dismissed the lower court's death sentence and ordered a retrial. In Washington, spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said the State Department had received a copy of the letter from Hekmati's family. But, she added, ""We have not had any communication with Iran on the issue of a prisoner exchange."" In a statement issued last month, Kerry said the espionage charges were false and urged the Tehran government to release him ""safely and as soon as possible."" Hekmati's mother has visited her son in Tehran's Evin Prison; she says his father has terminal cancer.

"Libya's prime minister threatened Saturday night to bomb a North Korean-flagged ship that had entered a rebel-held oil port, calling the ship's arrival there a ""violation of international law."" Prime Minister Ali Zeidan said if the ship does not follow orders, ""it will be bombed and this could lead to an environmental disaster."" The vessel, dubbed Morning Glory, docked late Friday night in the oil port of As-Sidra. Zeidan said the ship's captain subsequently was warned by phone, though the captain responded that local militia on board did not allow them to depart. Libyan government officials spoke with diplomats at North Korea's embassy in Tripoli, Zeidan said. He added that information showed a ""Gulf nation"" owned the ship and that it is registered in North Korea. A spokesman for Libya's National Oil Corporation indicated the tanker was Saudi owned, but Saudi Arabia's embassy released a statement saying it had nothing to do with the ship. In addition, an arrest warrant has been issued for the oil tanker's captain and ""the use of armed force, as necessary,"" has been authorized, according to Zeidan. The situation speaks to the unsettled situation in the North African nation, which the government is struggling to control more than two years after the ouster of longtime  Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. In this case, the issue centers around the oil-rich eastern part of the country and one man in particular, Ibrahim Jadran. The militia leader was entrusted by the government to safeguard crucial oil ports. But last July, Jadran and his men seized them, blocking oil exports, and demanded more autonomy and shared revenues for his eastern region. Meet the man holding Libya's oil hostage . ""We used to be part of that government until the corruption became so visible, and the government started to sell oil without measuring units, and after we became certain that such a government is not credible and unable to rebuild the state,"" the 32-year-old Jadran told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in January. ""That's why we declared independence of our province and we started to seek our fair rights."" There is a lot at stake, given the Libyan government's precarious state and the wealth of natural resources in the country. Libya is thought to have Africa's largest proven oil reserves. The country produced 1.6 million barrels per day after the revolution only to have that output slow to a relative trickle of fewer than 200,000 barrels per day by the end of last year. The government has said the disrupted oil production, from seizures of ports as well as protests and strikes at other oil facilities, is costing the country $130 million a day. Saturday night's threat against the North Korean-flagged vessel isn't the first time Libya's government has threatened force against ships that enter the eastern oil ports. On several occasions, authorities have issued ultimatums to such ships, only to have those deadlines come and go with no action.","A North Korean-flagged tanker enters a rebel-held oil port in eastern Libya .

"Two Chinese ships arrived at the coast of Vietnam on Monday to begin efforts to collect thousands of Chinese citizens who are fleeing the country after deadly attacks last week. The chartered ships reached the port of Vung Ang in Ha Tinh, the coastal province where some of the worst violence targeting Chinese facilities and workers took place, Chinese state media reported. One of the two, the Wuzhishan, departed later Monday for the southern Chinese port city of Haikou with 989 evacuees on board, according to the official Chinese news agency Xinhua. Along with two other ships that are still en route, the vessels are being used to bring back almost 4,000 Chinese citizens who are leaving because of the recent unrest, Xinhua said. Chinese authorities said Sunday that more than 3,000 Chinese had already been evacuated from Vietnam after protests over China's decision to move an oil rig into disputed waters of the South China Sea spiraled into riots last week in which foreign-owned factories were burned and looted. At issue is the positioning of the rig in waters claimed by both China and Vietnam. Vietnam claims the rig's presence is ""illegal,"" while China says it has every right to drill and has castigated the Vietnamese government for failing to ensure the safety of its nationals. Two Chinese citizens were killed in the violence and more than 100 were injured, authorities said. The crisis has frayed ties between the two Communist-run Asian nations, and there is little sign of either side backing down over the increasingly bitter territorial dispute. Security tightened . A series of chartered planes carried scores of Chinese citizens, including 16 critically injured workers, back to China on Sunday, Xinhua reported. The critically hurt patients were suffering from a range of injuries inflicted by beatings with iron bars, said Liao Zhilin, a spokesman for the hospital in the western Chinese city of Chengdu where they were admitted. The badly injured workers were employees of China Metallurgical Group Corp., a contractor for an iron and steel complex being built in Ha Tinh, according to Chinese state-run media. Vietnamese authorities have clamped down on the unrest, arresting hundreds of people. They have beefed up security at key locations and urged citizens not participate in further protests. But that hasn't stopped China from pressing ahead with the measures to extract thousands of its citizens from the country. Beijing has also warned Chinese people not to travel to Vietnam and said it will suspend some planned bilateral exchanges with Hanoi, according to Xinhua. Ships clash at sea . Out in the South China Sea, ships from both countries are facing off. Vietnam's state-run news agency VNA on Saturday accused China of continuing to show ""its aggressiveness by sending more military ships"" to the area around the oil rig. The news agency cited Nguyen Van Trung, an official at the Vietnam Fisheries Surveillance Department, as saying that China had 119 ships in the area Saturday morning, including warships, coast guard vessels and fishing boats. Some of the ships were provoking the Vietnamese vessels by ramming them and firing water cannons at them, he said. Vietnam says the rig site is clearly on its continental shelf, and moreover, is in its Exclusive Economic Zone. Hanoi has demanded that China remove the offending rig from the disputed waters, escort vessels from the region and hold talks to settle the issue. 'We are not afraid of trouble' China, for its part, has continued to accuse Vietnamese ships of similar acts, saying they are trying to disrupt the oil rig's drilling operation. It has declared a 3-mile exclusion zone around the rig, which is operated by the state-owned oil and gas company CNOOC. ""We do not make trouble, but we are not afraid of trouble,"" Gen. Fang Fenghui, the chief of the general staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), said Thursday during a visit to the United States. ""In matters of territory, our attitude is firm. We won't give an inch,"" Fang said after meeting U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey. U.S. concerns . Relations between China and Vietnam soured this month when the Chinese platform began drilling for oil near the Paracel Islands, which are claimed by both countries. At the time, the U.S. State Department called the move ""provocative,"" saying it ""raises tensions."" Beijing has laid claim to most of the South China Sea, putting it at odds with several of its neighbors in the region, including the Philippines and Malaysia. China is also locked in a bitter dispute with Japan over a group of tiny islands in the East China Sea. While many commentators say Vietnam has every right to be upset over the positioning of the Chinese rig, at least one analyst says the issue not as clear cut as some suggest. ""Geographical proximity alone is not an unequivocal basis for claiming sovereignty or sovereign rights,"" writes Sam Bateman in the Eurasia Review. Bateman, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technological University, says Vietnam's claim to the Paracel Islands is ""seriously weakened"" by North Vietnam's recognition of China's sovereignty over the Paracels and the lack of protest between 1958 and 1975. In 1974, the two countries fought the Battle of the Paracel Islands, which ended in a Chinese victory and complete control over the land and surrounding waters. After the reunification of Vietnam in 1975, Vietnam's leaders publicly renewed the country's claim to the islands, but the issue remains unresolved. ""We have to acknowledge there are territorial disputes,"" including ""what exactly is the status quo and who is seeking to change it,"" Dempsey said Thursday at the news conference with Fang of the PLA. His comments were a veiled reference to Washington's view that Beijing is attempting to change the status quo by more aggressively seeking to establish control over disputed areas.

"Have you heard about China's banana slip? A few days ago in Beijing, as Gary Locke wrapped up his tenure as United States ambassador to China, he was lambasted in a Chinese state media editorial. The piece called Locke a ""guide dog."" It said he had stirred an ""evil wind."" Worst of all, it called him a ""banana."" As in yellow on the outside and white on the inside. It's a slur, akin to ""Oreo"" for African-Americans or ""coconut"" for Hispanics, used by people of a given ethnic group to judge another member of that group for being insufficiently, well, ethnic. The point of saying a person of color is ""white inside"" is to accuse him of being a race traitor, ashamed or in denial of his true heritage. In this case, the idea was that Locke, though of Chinese descent, wasn't Chinese enough. Why? He couldn't speak the language. Oh, and he apparently didn't do the bidding of China's leaders, choosing instead to go to Tibet, work with dissident human rights activists, point out smog levels in Beijing and generally represent the interests and values of the United States. That's what the editorialist meant when he called Locke a banana. Many Chinese citizens disavowed the slur, calling it an embarrassment. But what it revealed was that despite modernization and burgeoning wealth -- or perhaps because of them -- China still has a fragile identity. (And America still has some advantages.) Let's start with the fact that the editorial was published in an organ of state media. It got attention because in a country where the government controls the press, editorials are assumed to express the views of top national leaders. They may not, in fact. It's quite possible this particular opinion writer was just an individual. But in the absence of a free press, who can really tell? This is the price of propaganda: No one believes what you say, but they believe you meant to say it. A second notable aspect of the banana rant was that it completely conflated ethnicity and nationality, and in a particularly Chinese way. The Han Chinese are the overwhelmingly dominant ethnic group of China, and their ethnocentrism frames Chinese political culture. (Just ask Tibetans.) It also fuels the nationalism behind China's territorial disputes with Japan and other Asian nations. So the premise of the banana comment was that someone of Chinese ethnicity, wherever he may live, should be considered Chinese to the core and therefore in the end loyal to the Chinese nation. Of course, that's a notion white Americans have often used to justify mistreatment of ""indelibly alien"" Chinese immigrants, whether during the era of Chinese exclusion  in the late 19th century or the persecution of Wen Ho Lee at the turn of this one. But it's as wrong now as then and as wrong here as there. Even if Locke could speak perfect Mandarin, even if he could read the Chinese classics and write calligraphy, this Eagle Scout, child of public housing, prosecutor, state legislator, governor, Cabinet secretary and diplomat was made in America. Whether Locke is ""Chinese enough"" is for him and his family to judge, not for any other Chinese American, much less an apparatchik in China. But there can be no doubt that Locke is plenty American, and that's really what stuck in the craw of some commentators in China. Ultimately, the banana rant reminds us that the United States, for all its manifest failings and its continuing racial tensions, remains exceptional in its capacity to synthesize the peoples of the world into new hybrids. Which is also why the United States, for all its economic troubles and relative geopolitical decline, retains a competitive edge over rising powers like China. To put it very simply: America makes Chinese Americans, but China does not -- and does not particularly want to -- make American Chinese. It's in America's operating system to welcome an immigrant who becomes a houseboy and to make it possible for that immigrant's grandson to hold high public office. This is the Locke family arc: truly American. It's not so much in China's operating system to welcome an immigrant -- whether ethnic Chinese or not, however steeped in Chinese civilization -- and make it possible for her family to be seen as truly Chinese. When operatives in China call Locke a banana, they assume, wrongly, that to be American is to be white. America is not white anymore. It never really was. China may be four times more populous than America. But America is many times more diverse, intermingled, open and adaptive than China. I'm proud to be Chinese American: proficient in Chinese culture, fluent in American life. Call me what you will; I like my country's chances.","A Chinese state media outlet referred to U.S. ambassador as a ""banana""

"An environmental advocacy group backed by hedge fund tycoon Tom Steyer is set to unleash a seven-state, $100 million offensive against Republican ""science deniers"" this year, a no-holds-barred campaign-style push from the green billionaire that could help decide which party controls the Senate and key statehouses come November. The Steyer-backed outside group, NextGen Climate, has billed itself as a progressive, pro-environment counterbalance to the wealthy oil and gas industry -- as well as the primary foil to the pro-business Koch brothers and their well-funded conservative donor network. The outfit, launched last year by the San Francisco billionaire, has already pledged to spend heavily this midterm year in Iowa to assist the Democratic Senate nominee Bruce Braley, and in Florida, where Gov. Rick Scott is facing a difficult re-election fight against Democrat Charlie Crist. Steyer's 2014 map now includes Senate races in Michigan, New Hampshire and Colorado as well as governor's races in Maine and Pennsylvania, home to two of the most endangered Republican governors in the country, Paul LePage and Tom Corbett. ""This is the year, in our view, that we are able to demonstrate that you can use climate, you can do it well, you can do it in a smart way, to win political races,"" said Chris Lehane, the longtime Democratic consultant advising Steyer. Lehane and NextGen political strategist Sky Gallegos revealed their 2014 strategy Wednesday in a briefing with reporters in Washington. 'Pro-climate action' vs. 'anti-science' Absent from their list of 2014 targets: must-win Senate races for Democrats in conservative-leaning states such as Arkansas, Alaska, North Carolina, Louisiana and Kentucky. That's because Democrats on those ballots have expressed support for the Keystone XL pipeline, the coal industry, offshore drilling or hydraulic fracturing -- all nonstarter issues for environmentalists. Instead, Lehane said the 501(c)4 group will play in races that feature a stark choice between ""pro-climate action"" candidates -- all Democrats -- and ""anti-science"" Republicans who have questioned the veracity of climate change or supported the interests of the oil and gas industry. GOP candidates in the NextGen cross hairs -- Scott in Florida, Terri Lynn Land in Michigan, Scott Brown in New Hampshire and Cory Gardner in Colorado -- hew closely to the ""Republican troglodyte brand,"" Lehane argued. ""They are anti-immigrant, anti-women, anti-science,"" he said. ""It's a tough brand to win elections around."" The group said that climate can be successfully used as a wedge issue -- Lehane framed it as a moral clash between ""right and wrong"" -- to boost turnout among Democratic voting groups that tend not to show up in midterm election years, specifically young voters, Hispanics and African-Americans. As in the Virginia governor's race last year -- when Steyer spent nearly $8 million on a campaign to disqualify GOP nominee Ken Cuccinelli with a combination of TV, mail and field operations -- the efforts will extend beyond the TV airwaves and include what they call ""nano-targeting"" to tailor messaging to discrete voting groups. ""We are not some super PAC that's going to come in, throw up some ads and leave,"" Lehane said. ""You can come into these states and really run a total campaign."" Focusing on hyper-local issues . Lehane said the effort, which is budgeted at around $100 million but could grow, will focus attention on hyper-local issues -- such as drought in Iowa or flood insurance costs in Florida -- that could influence voter perceptions in key pockets of each state. Pollution-related health concerns such as asthma and clean drinking water hit home for lower-income voters, he said. It wasn't lost on reporters that the NextGen map featured multiple states that figure prominently in presidential races -- Iowa, New Hampshire and Florida among them. Lehane said that was by design. ""Almost all of these states align with being really important presidential states either in the primary process or the general election,"" he said, promising that Steyer will be active throughout the 2016 campaign. When the 2016 presidential primary campaigns lurch into overdrive next year, NextGen will continue to call attention to turnout-driving local issues -- and on attacking Republican candidates. Steyer has already funded an ad in Florida attacking Sen. Marco Rubio, one of many possible GOP White House aspirants, as a tool of oil lobbyists. ""We look forward to a conversation with the Rubios of the world,"" Lehane said of the group's 2016 plans, without revealing specifics. The outside air cover should come as welcome news to Democratic candidates in their target states who are drowning in a flood of TV ads from conservative groups such as the Koch-endorsed Americans for Prosperity. But the campaign may put some Democrats in a bind. In Colorado, for instance, Lehane said NextGen will attack Gardner by showcasing his support for hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and the adverse health effects of natural gas extraction on suburban communities. But the strategy could force Democratic Sen. Mark Udall to take a definitive stand on a divisive state issue that pits the business community against environmentalists, an important slice of the Democratic base. Meanwhile, the state's Democrat governor, John Hickenlooper, has been cautiously supportive of the gas industry as a revenue and jobs creator. Charges of hypocrisy . As the founder of the hedge fund Farallon Capital Management, Steyer made part of his fortune from investments in fossil fuels, including foreign coal investments, which has prompted charges of hypocrisy from the Koch-affiliated groups he's fond of condemning. ""Tom Steyer's investments at Farallon have lined his pockets with millions of dollars from the foreign coal industry,"" said James Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners, the Koch-backed political network. ""Now he wants to burden the American people with new energy regulations to protect his current green energy investments. He's already attempting to buy the votes of Senate Democrats on Keystone, which will cost America thousands of good-paying jobs. Surely the media will call him out on the hypocrisy of his claims."" Lehane said Steyer ordered his investments be diverted from coal and tar sands when he stepped down from Farallon in 2012 but was not aware if he had investments in other energy sectors. But the primary difference between Steyer and conservative mega-donors, Lehane said, is that Steyer is not personally profiting from his political efforts. ""He is giving all the money away,"" he said. ""He doesn't have stand to gain some economic benefit by spending money that translates into his own personal economics."" Lehane added, ""We are spending a drop in the big oil bucket as compared to the fossil fuel industry, especially the Koch brothers. All Tom is trying to do is try to balance and level the playing field. We are never going to have as much money as the other side.""","Billionaire's environmental group is targeting Senate, governors' races .

"Tapping away at his computer in the study of the suburban compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, that he called home for the last years of his life, Osama bin Laden wrote memos urging his followers to continue to try to attack the United States, suggesting, for instance, they mount assassination attempts against President Obama and Gen. David Petraeus. While he urged his organization on to attack America, bin Laden was also keenly aware that al Qaeda was in deep trouble because of the campaign of CIA drone strikes in Pakistan and also because the brutal tactics of his followers had alienated many Muslims. According to senior Obama administration officials who have reviewed the ""treasure trove"" of the thousands of documents that were picked up by the U.S. Navy SEALs from bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, the leaders of al Qaeda understood that the group they led was ""beleaguered."" CNN was given a briefing this week by senior administration officials who have been analyzing the documents. Bin Laden wrote a 48-page memo to a deputy in October 2010 that surveyed the state of his organization. He was particularly concerned that al Qaeda's longtime sanctuary in Waziristan in Pakistan's tribal areas was now too dangerous because of the campaign of American drone strikes there that had picked off many of his key lieutenants. According to a count by the New America Foundation, the CIA launched a record number of 118 strikes into the tribal regions during 2010, the year bin Laden wrote this memo. Bin Laden advised his followers not to move around the tribal regions except on overcast days when America's all-seeing satellites and drones would not have as good coverage of the area. He also urged his followers to depart the tribal regions for the remote Afghan provinces of Ghazni, Zabul and, in particular, Kunar, pointing out that the high mountains and dense forests of Kunar provided especially good protection from prying American eyes. Bin Laden fretted about his 20-year-old son, Hamza, who had recently been released from house arrest in Iran, instructing his deputy to tell his son to move out of Waziristan. He also provided elaborate instructions about how Hamza might evade the surveillance of the American drones in the tribal regions by meeting members of al Qaeda inside a particular tunnel on the road between the western Pakistani town of Kohat and the city of Peshawar. During his final days, bin Laden's world was filled with paranoia. He instructed that Hamza should throw out anything he had taken with him from Iran as it might contain some kind of tracking device, and that he should avoid the company of a man who might have ties to the Pakistani intelligence services. Bin Laden also reminded his deputies that all internal communications should be made by letter rather than by phone or the Internet. As a result, according to administration officials, bin Laden had to wait for responses to his queries to his deputies that could sometimes take up to two or three months to be delivered -- surely not an efficient way to run any organization. Bin Laden also advised his lieutenants that when they kidnapped someone they should take many precautions during the negotiating process and also throw away any bags that contained ransom money because they might also contain a tracking device. The spectacular set of self-inflicted mistakes made by al Qaeda's affiliate in Iraq weighed heavily on the minds of bin Laden and his top advisers. Privately, they criticized the brutal tactics of al Qaeda in Iraq, which had provoked a tribal uprising against al Qaeda that had dealt a large blow to the group's position in Iraq from 2006 onward. Until the end, bin Laden remained fixated on attacking the United States, prodding his deputy to ""nominate one of the qualified brothers to be responsible for a large operation in the U.S."" According to administration officials, bin Laden's number two, Ayman al-Zawahiri, pushed back, telling bin Laden it was much more realistic to attack American soldiers in Afghanistan than American civilians in the United States. Bin Laden did urge his followers to scope out opportunities to attack President Obama or Petraeus while they were in Afghanistan. At the time, Petraeus was the commanding general of NATO soldiers in Afghanistan. Bin Laden noted snidely that killing Obama would pave the way for Vice President Joe Biden to assume the presidency. The al Qaeda leader said Biden was ""totally unprepared"" for the job. Above all, bin Laden constantly fretted about his media image, pointing out to his deputies that ""a huge part of the battle is in the media."" For the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, bin Laden wanted his media team to emphasize particularly that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were one of the main reasons for the financial crisis in the United States. (Bin Laden bought his compound in Abbottabad with cash, so presumably he didn't quite understand the dimensions of the subprime mortgage debacle.) One of his media advisers, who U.S. officials believe to be the American al Qaeda recruit Adam Gadahn,  suggested  bin Laden take advantage of the 9/11 anniversary in 2011 to record a 'high definition' videotape message that could be given to all the major American news networks, except to Fox News, which Gadahn said ""lacks neutrality."" It doesn't appear that bin Laden made such a tape. Administration officials say it is strange that in all the documents recovered at the bin Laden compound there is no mention at all of al Qaeda's plot to use liquid explosives to bring down as many as seven American, British and Canadian passenger planes flying from Heathrow Airport in 2006. If this plot had succeeded it might have rivaled 9/11 as a spectacular attack. Bin Laden moved into his Abbottabad compound either at the end of 2005 or sometime in 2006 and an administration official says that, perhaps, information about the Heathrow plot ""got lost in the move.""","Peter Bergen: Osama bin Laden's final writings show al Qaeda felt under siege .

"Former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy, appearing before a Cairo court Tuesday to face charges related to a 2011 jailbreak, denounced the process as unfair and unjust. Speaking from inside a soundproof glass enclosure, Morsy demanded to know where he was and who was in charge. His lawyers explained to the judge that he was angry because he had not been allowed to see his lawyers or family. Nineteen Muslim Brotherhood members, including Morsy, allegedly broke out of the prison in 2011, state-run EGYNews reported. At the time, the Muslim Brotherhood was banned in the country. But the Islamist group became Egypt's most powerful political force after longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak was toppled in February 2011. Morsy and dozens of co-defendants are accused of collaborating with the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas and the Lebanese Shia group Hezbollah to escape from the Wadi-Natroun prison, the state-owned Ahram Online news agency said. The defendants are also accused of attempting to murder police officers, Ahram Online said. Egypt's military OKs Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi for presidential run . 'I am not assured' of judge's fairness . The judge, who controlled the sound, allowed Morsy to address the court in the afternoon. Morsy said he had not been allowed to see his lawyers since November. But he had been visited repeatedly by ""investigative judges"" whom he warned about taking part in what he sees as a farce. ""It's not enough for the judge to be fair, but for the subject to be assured of the judge's fairness, and I am not assured,"" he said. The other Muslim Brotherhood defendants were placed in a separate enclosure and held up a four-finger salute to show solidarity with the group. The judge adjourned the hearing until February 22. The trial is one of several that Morsy is facing. He has also been charged with raiding other prisons, killing soldiers and officers in Rafah, and incitement to murder in connection with protests against his rule in 2012. A short tenure . Morsy became Egypt's first democratically elected president in 2012 after the fall of Mubarak, who had ruled Egypt for 29 years. But just one year later, Morsy was deposed in a military coup. The U.S. State Department called for the military to release him, saying his detention was politically motivated. Opponents accused Morsy of pursuing an Islamist agenda and excluding other factions from the government. But supporters said that he wasn't given a fair chance and that the military has returned to the authoritarian practices of Mubarak. Egyptian official killed . Morsy's trial wasn't the only significant news out of Egypt on Tuesday. A senior aide to Egypt's interior minister was killed in the Giza area of Cairo, a presidential spokesman said. Gen. Mohammed Said was shot and killed near the Pyramids, spokesman Ehab Badaway said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. Last September, the interior minister himself was targeted in an assassination attempt. Egypt's Interior Ministry oversees the country's police force, which has led a fierce and sometimes deadly crackdown against protesters over the past several months.","Mohamed Morsy demands to know where he is, who's in charge at hearing in Cairo .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Thousands of Yemeni women marched toward the attorney general's office in the capital Saturday demanding legal action for what they called the president's attacks on their morality. Similar demonstrations took place in other cities as well fueled by President Ali Abdullah Saleh's comments the day before. In a short speech Friday, Saleh said women who were protesting against his regime were violating Yemeni cultural norms that prohibit mixing with men who are not direct relatives. He called it forbidden behavior in Islam and advised women to stay home. Angry female activists said Saleh was trying to degrade them in public. Prominent activist Tawakkol Karman said Saleh was shocked to see women leading Yemen's revolt. ""Saleh has finally shown the world his real face and his hatred against women,"" said Karman, a leading member of Islah, the largest opposition party in Yemen. ""Women have ruled Yemen on numerous occasions throughout Yemen's history,"" she said. ""That is why he has tried to oppress women for the 33 years he has been in power."" The government said protesters ""misused"" Saleh's comments, prompted by a belief that the opposition was using women and youth to promote their own agenda, and not the greater good of Yemen. ""Saleh is the first to support women's rights and has always shown interest in involving women in Yemeni politics,"" said Zaid Thari, a senior member of the ruling General People's Congress party. ""Saleh was advising protesters and not acting against women in specific."" Anti-government demonstrators in Yemen have been calling for reforms and the ouster of Saleh for many weeks. Recently, women have shown their faces in greater numbers. They took to the streets in 10 provinces Saturday, holding firm on their demands that Saleh step down. Karman said Saleh is scared he will be known as the leader overthrown by women. Another prominent activist, Amal Basha, said it was Saleh who was using religion to prevent women's participation. ""I consider women protesters here as if they are doing holy work, a holy job,"" Basha said. ""Why is he (Saleh) trying to demonize and undermine what they are doing? Saleh uses religion to give himself legitimacy and support his policies."" Yemen's largest opposition bloc rejected Saleh's stance against women. The Joint Meeting Parties said Islam grants women more rights. ""Saleh's comments against the purity of women protesters are a clear indication that his oppressive regime does not respect any rights of expression and wants women to be led by men at all times,"" said Mohammed Sabri, a senior bloc official. Even the conservative tribal coalition of Mareb and Jawf warned Saleh against attacking women's rights, saying that tribal culture has always given women the right to lead if they so desire. ""Women ruled Yemen numerous times in the past with success,"" said Ali Obaid, a senior member of the coalition. ""Yemeni women lead the Yemeni revolution and men follow.""","Women have been protesting in greater numbers in recent weeks .

"If you're a person who hates it when your supervisor looks over your shoulder at work, you may want to stop reading this column right now. Because what follows is only going to depress you. Hitachi, the big electronics company based in Japan, is manufacturing and selling to corporations a device intended to increase efficiency in the workplace. It has a rather bland and generic-sounding name: the Hitachi Business Microscope. But what it is capable of doing ... well, just imagine being followed around the office or the factory all day by the snoopiest boss in the world. Even into the restroom. And, the thing is, once you hear about it, you just know that, from a management point of view, it is an innovation of absolute genius. Here's how it works: . The device looks like an employee ID badge that most companies issue. Workers are instructed to wear it in the office. Embedded inside each badge, according to Hitachi, are ""infrared sensors, an accelerometer, a microphone sensor and a wireless communication device."" Hitachi says that the badges record and transmit to management ""who talks to whom, how often, where and how energetically."" It tracks everything. If you get up to walk around the office a lot, the badge sends information to management about how often you do it, and where you go. If you stop to talk with people throughout the day, the badge transmits who you're talking to (by reading your co-workers' badges), and for how long. Do you contribute at meetings, or just sit there? Either way, the badge tells your bosses. The stated intention of this is to increase productivity and get the most out of employees. But a case can be made that, however much we worry that the National Security Agency may be peeking into our lives, we should be just as concerned -- or more -- about the potential for corporations to become their own, private NSAs. And there's not much, in the future, that employees will be able to do about it. With government surveillance, the public can complain that the state has no right to be scrutinizing the lives of its citizens so intrusively. But corporations can make the argument that supervisors have always been encouraged to keep an eye on how workers are spending their time when they're on the clock -- and that electronic tools such as the Business Microscope are simply a 21st-century way to do that. The employers are paying for their workers' time, the argument will go -- and if the employees don't like being accountable for how they spend that time, they can always choose to work elsewhere. Hitachi says that by analyzing the ""enormous amount of data collected with the Business Microscope, it will be possible to propose methods to improve organizational communication and quantitatively evaluate efficacy.""  Among the activities the badges record and transmit, according to Hitachi, are ""the distance between people talking face-to face"" and ""an individual's activity level (active or nonactive), which is determined on the basis of subtle movements detected (such as talking, nodding and silence)."" And the sensor badges never sleep. They never take breaks. They don't go to lunch.  As H. James Wilson, a senior researcher at Babson Executive Education, wrote in the Wall Street Journal, the badges not only transmit who employees are talking to and how long the conversations go on, but can ""also measure how well they're talking to them."" If you're in a conference room with colleagues and they are animated participants in a discussion about, say, sales strategy, while you just remain quiet in your seat, the badge knows it. Businesses have long dreamed of maximum efficiency, and Hitachi says that, since the Business Microscope was first developed in its labs in 2007, ""over one million days of human behavior and big data"" have been collected. (You can imagine the surveillance experts at NSA, and at spy agencies for governments around the world, hearing about what Hitachi has come up with, shaking their heads in admiration, and saying: ""Boy, those guys are good!"") The long-term question will be whether companies, in the name of workplace output, will want to risk the morale problems that will inevitably arise among employees who are instructed to wear such devices, manufactured either by Hitachi or by other firms that will engineer their own digital tracking machinery. Technology always wins, but victory can come with a price. And if employees bristle and become resentful about being kept on such a short electronic leash, that could bring about productivity problems of a different sort.  Unhappy workers are not motivated to put in extra effort. Of course, the employees could get up from their desks, congregate in an out-of-the-way corner of the office, and bitterly complain about it all. But the badges would know. And tell.","A device, the Hitachi Business Microscope, is designed to track workers in the workplace .
Bob Greene: This technology allows corporations to become their own, private NSAs .
He says while maker of device says this can help increase productivity, what about morale?

"(CNN) -- On Sunday, November 2, it will again be the end of Daylight Saving Time. Many of us will be muttering to ourselves as we wander around resetting all of our various clocks -- on the thermostat, clock radio and stove, among other places. Sure, you'll get an extra hour of sleep by turning back the clock by an hour in the fall. But if you have a regular day job, you'll be commuting home in the dark instead of in daylight come the following day. Why do we do this every fall? And why do we dial forward the clock by an hour every spring? Daylight Saving Time has been around for a good part of 20th century, but there's no really good reason why we should continue with the status quo. The U.S. government started moving into and out of ""Daylight Saving Time"" during World War I to copy the Germans, who said they were doing it to save fuel. When the war ended, the U.S. government wisely repealed the law since it proved unpopular. During WWII, it came back -- again with the notion that it would somehow conserve resources. After the second war, the U.S. converted factories from making bombs to making cars and consumer products. The GIs came home. But Daylight Saving Time just stuck around. Numerous polls show that people want to stay in Daylight Saving Time year round, or at least just stick with either Standard or Daylight time and stop switching clocks around. Two states, Arizona and Hawaii, already keep their clocks the same all year long. We may have reached a tipping point to end the clock-changing madness. First, the U.S. Department of Energy issued a report in 2008 that examined the impact of extended Daylight Saving Time. A four-week extension would save approximately 0.5% of electricity per day for the country. Put in perspective, it's enough energy to power 100,000 households for a year. The second strong case for staying in Daylight Saving Time year round is that we can save lives. A recent study shows the switching of clocks in the spring causes a 25% jump in heart attacks in the few days following the switch, confirming earlier research that point out the shift in time can disrupt the quality of sleep and biological rhythms. Taking away an hour of sleep and jolting you awake in the predawn darkness is simply bad for your health, especially if you are elderly or have a heart condition, researchers noted. So here's the question: If you have a chance to save lives and save electricity, would you do it? Sure you would, right? But you haven't, and neither have I. Why? Maybe because we're all a little too sleep deprived and discombobulated to do something after all that clock-changing. Last year, a member of the Missouri legislature proposed moving the state to permanent Daylight Saving Time if 19 other states would join its effort. The state House voted to approve the measure, HB340, but it didn't go anywhere in the Senate. The idea is smart and worth revisiting. The hard part is how to get this more traction. Here's an alternative proposal: Legislatures pass a bill whereby if at least 31 other states pass similar bills, their state will then switch to permanent Daylight Saving Time. With Arizona and Hawaii already in, that adds up to two-thirds, or 33, states. Thirty-three is the number of states needed to pass a constitutional amendment, and while this is not a constitutional issue, it seems like a good standard to meet. So how can we convince all these local governments to take on this initiative? We need help from students, who can create interdisciplinary projects combining science, math, social studies and government, to show why we need to get rid of this outdated concept. If we all pitch in a little, we'll be able to save energy and lives. In short, it's about time.","On Sunday, November 2, it will again be the end of Daylight Saving Time .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A former CIA agent who participated in interrogations of terror suspects said Tuesday that the controversial interrogation technique of ""waterboarding"" has saved lives, but he considers the method torture and now opposes its use. Ex-CIA agent John Kiriakou says he underwent waterboarding in training and cracked in a few seconds. Former CIA operative John Kiriakou also told CNN's ""American Morning"" that he disagrees with a decision to destroy videotapes of certain interrogations, namely of al Qaeda's Abu Zubayda. Kiriakou made the remarks as two congressional committees prepared to grill CIA Director Michael Hayden on the destruction of the tapes and on ""alternative"" means of interrogation. Waterboarding begins by placing a suspect on a table with the suspect's feet slightly elevated, said Kiriakou, who was waterboarded several years ago as part of his CIA training. He said he elected not to learn how to perform the technique, which is designed to emulate the sensation of drowning. Once a suspect is secured on the table, interrogators wrap his or her face in a cellophane-like material, Kiriakou said.  Watch journalist undergo, discuss waterboarding » . ""There is a bladder, or a water source, above the head with water pouring down on the mouth, so no water is going into your mouth, but it induces a gag reflex and makes you feel like you're choking,"" Kiriakou said.  Watch the ex-agent describe the procedure » . Kiriakou said he lasted only a few seconds during his training because his body felt like it was seizing up almost immediately. ""It's entirely unpleasant,"" Kiriakou said. ""You are so full of tension that you tense up, your muscles tighten up. It's very uncomfortable."" Abu Zubayda lasted a little longer, said Kiriakou, but not much. The former agent, who said he participated in the Abu Zubayda interrogation but not his waterboarding, said the CIA decided to waterboard the al Qaeda operative only after he was ""wholly uncooperative"" for weeks and refused to answer questions. All that changed -- and Zubayda reportedly had a divine revelation -- after 30 to 35 seconds of waterboarding, Kiriakou said he learned from the CIA agents who performed the technique. The terror suspect, who is being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, reportedly gave up information that indirectly led to the the 2003 raid in Pakistan yielding the arrest of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, an alleged planner of the September 11, 2001, attacks, Kiriakou said. The CIA was unaware of Mohammed's stature before the Abu Zubayda interrogation, the former agent said. ""Abu Zubayda's the one who told us that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was so important in the al Qaeda structure, and we didn't realize at the time how important he was,"" Kiriakou said. Abu Zubayda also divulged information on ""al Qaeda's leadership structure and mentioned people who we really didn't have any familiarization with [and] told us who we should be thinking about, who we should be looking at, and who was important in the organization so we were able to focus our investigation this way,"" Kiriakou said. Abu Zubayda reportedly told the agent who waterboarded him that ""Allah had visited him in his cell during the night and told him to cooperate because it would make it easier on the other brothers who had been captured,"" Kiriakou said. Though the information wrenched from Abu Zubayda ""stopped terrorist attacks and saved lives,"" Kiriakou said he opposes waterboarding. ""Now after all these years, time has passed, and we're more on our feet in this fight against al Qaeda, and I think it's unnecessary,"" he said. In a separate CNN interview, Kiriakou said the Justice Department and National Security Council reportedly approved waterboarding and other ""alternative"" interrogation techniques in June 2002. ""It was a policy decision that came down from the White House,"" he said. Despite the executive blessing, Kiriakou and other agents were conflicted over whether to learn the technique, he said. ""One senior officer said to me that this is something you really have to think deeply about,"" the former agent said, adding he ""struggled with it morally."" Kiriakou conceded his position might be hypocritical and said that the technique was useful  -- even if he wanted to distance himself from it. ""Waterboarding was an important technique, and some of these other techniques were important in collecting the information,"" he said. ""But I personally didn't want to do it. I didn't think it was right in the long run, and I didn't want to be associated with it."" As for the tapes of the interrogations, Kiriakou -- who claims neither he nor the other CIA agents realized they were being recorded during the Abu Zubayda interrogation -- said he disagrees with the decision to destroy the tapes. ""I don't see the reason to destroy them,"" Kiriakou said. ""There's a possibility that they could be used in a criminal investigation, and frankly, for the historical record, I think it's important to have things like that maintained."" The Justice Department and CIA have announced a preliminary inquiry into the matter. Hayden, the CIA director, is slated to go before congressional committees Tuesday and Wednesday. Hayden has said the CIA destroyed the tapes ""only after it was determined they were no longer of intelligence value and not relevant to any internal, legislative or judicial inquiries."" Congressional leaders said they were never properly notified about the decision. E-mail to a friend .","John Kiriakou says he questioned al Qaeda suspect but didn't waterboard him .

"(CNN) -- They arrived with bulldozers and ordered him to leave. When the Syrian restaurant owner asked why, he was threatened with detention. The security forces that had arrived unannounced that morning denied him permission to remove anything from the shop his grandfather had opened. He was forced to leave on foot, his motorcycle left behind. ""As I was walking, I looked back and I saw the bulldozer demolishing my shop,"" said the man, who's from the Qaboun neighborhood in the Syrian capital of Damascus. ""The shop was opened by my grandfather many years ago. I personally managed the restaurant for eight years. Before my eyes, all of my family's hard work was destroyed in one second."" The man, Human Rights Watch says, is one of the thousands of Syrians who have seen their homes or other premises razed as part of what it says is a collective punishment by authorities against residents of opposition strongholds. In a report released Thursday, the New York-based rights group says the Syrian government ""deliberately and unlawfully"" demolished thousands of homes in rebel strongholds in the cities of Damascus and Hama in one year. It says satellite imagery taken over both cities revealed seven areas where neighborhoods have been largely demolished. None of the destruction was caused in combat, it said. Rather, the buildings were destroyed with bulldozers and explosives placed by troops who ordered residents to leave, then supervised the demolitions. ""Wiping entire neighborhoods off the map is not a legitimate tactic of war,"" Ole Solvang, an HRW emergencies researcher, said in a prepared statement. ""These unlawful demolitions are the latest additions to a long list of crimes committed by the Syrian government."" Satellite images . The 38-page report, ""Razed to the Ground: Syria's Unlawful Neighborhood Demolitions in 2012-2013"" was released as government and opposition delegates attended peace talks in Geneva, Switzerland. It said state officials and pro-government media outlets have said the demolitions were part of urban planning efforts or the removal of illegally constructed buildings. However, HRW says the demolitions were supervised by military forces and often followed fighting in the areas between government and opposition forces. Claims of widespread abuses have been routinely leveled by the Syrian government and the opposition during almost three years of conflict in the country, which has killed more than 100,000 people and displaced millions. HRW said that as far as it could determine, there had not been similar demolitions in areas that generally support the government, although it said many houses in those areas were also allegedly built without necessary permits. It published before-and-after satellite images of the destruction, along with witness testimony. HRW said Syrian authorities flattened the districts in the year from July 2012, estimating the total built-up area destroyed at 145 hectares (360 acres) -- the equivalent of 200 soccer fields -- and said many of the buildings were apartment blocks up to eight stories high. It named the districts as Masha'a al-Arbaeen and Wadi al-Jouz in the central city of Hama, and Qaboun, al-Tadamon, Barzeh, Harran al-Awamid and Mezze airport in and around Damascus. Calls for compensation . HRW said some of the demolitions took place around government military or strategic sites that opposition forces had attacked. ""While the authorities might have been justified in taking some targeted measures to protect these military or strategic locations, the destruction of hundreds of residential buildings, in some cases kilometers away, appears to have been disproportionate and to have violated international law,"" it said. HRW demanded the Syrian government immediately end the demolitions and provide compensation and alternative housing to the residents affected. It also urged the U.N. Security Council to refer the situation in Syria, where fighting first began in March 2011, to the International Criminal Court. ""No one should be fooled by the government's claim that it is undertaking urban planning in the middle of a bloody conflict,"" Solvang said.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Wednesday replaced Gen. Stanley McChrystal as commander of U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan and nominated Gen. David Petraeus to replace him while affirming support for a counterinsurgency strategy encountering problems. The dramatic shift came a day after McChrystal's disparaging comments about America's civilian leadership surfaced, and reignited the national debate on the war in Afghanistan -- now in its eighth year with a June death toll  of coalition forces that is close to becoming the highest of the war. Obama accepted McChrystal's resignation ""with considerable regret"" and named Petraeus, the head of the U.S. Central Command, to take over pending Senate confirmation. ""It is the right thing for our mission in Afghanistan, for our military and for our country,"" Obama said outside the White House, flanked by top civilian and military leaders including Vice President Joe Biden; Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Defense Secretary Robert Gates, and Petraeus. McChrystal's remarks in a Rolling Stone article undermined the civilian control of the military ""at the core of our democratic system,"" Obama said, noting the decision to replace the general did not involve any disagreement over strategy or personal issues. ""I believe that it is the right decision for our national security,"" Obama said. ""The conduct represented in the recently published article does not meet the standard that should be set by a commanding general."" Obama said that as hard as it is to lose the general, the ""war is bigger than any one man or woman."" More importantly, he said, the war requires a unified effort from civilian and military leaders, warning that he won't tolerate division within his team. ""I believe that this mission demands unity of effort across our alliance and across my national security team,"" Obama said. ""And I don't think that we can sustain that unity of effort and achieve our objectives in Afghanistan without making this change."" The president urged the Senate to swiftly confirm Petraeus, who would leave his Central Command position. Senate Armed Services Committee chairman Carl Levin, D-Michigan, later said a confirmation hearing would begin no later than Tuesday, and he expected it to take one day. ""We know Gen. Petraeus,"" Levin said. ""I don't think there will be anybody who will say we need more time."" McChrystal issued a statement Wednesday saying that he strongly supports Obama's strategy in Afghanistan and is ""deeply committed"" to the coalition forces and the Afghan people. ""It was out of respect for this commitment -- and a desire to see the mission succeed -- that I tendered my resignation,"" McChrystal's statement said. ""It has been my privilege and honor to lead our nation's finest."" A source close to McChrystal offered a description of the roughly 30-minute meeting between Obama and McChrystal that led to the general's resignation Wednesday morning. McChrystal briefly explained the magazine article at the center of the controversy, took responsibility and then offered his resignation, the source said. Obama accepted the resignation, the source said. The president ""had no intention of keeping him,"" and McChrystal knew that going in, the source said. McChrystal is not returning to Afghanistan, and his personal belongings will be shipped home, according to the source. Immediate political reaction from both parties was positive, with lawmakers saying Obama had little choice in making a change and that Petraeus was the best choice for the job. Levin noted that Petraeus authored the counterinsurgency strategy now being followed in Afghanistan. The spokesman for Afghan President Hamid Karzai expressed disappointment at the loss of McChrystal but called Petraeus the ""obvious"" replacement, while statements from allied governments and NATO also offered support and commitment to the Afghanistan mission. In the magazine article, McChrsytal and his top officers are quoted making disrespectful comments about civilian officials including Biden, U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Karl Eikenberry, special representative to Afghanistan Richard Holbrooke and National Security Adviser Jim Jones. News of the article set off a political firestorm Tuesday. Obama was ""angry"" after reading the general's remarks, said White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who added that McChrystal had a ""profound"" mistake. McChrystal apologized Tuesday, but was recalled to Washington and met with Gates and Mullen on Wednesday before going to the White House, Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said. After he met with Obama, McChrystal was not invited to participate in a separate White House national security meeting on the war in Afghanistan, two sources told CNN. The reported remarks by McChrystal and his staff were strongly criticized on Capitol Hill. Three key Senate leaders on defense and foreign policy issues -- Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and independent Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut -- said in a news conference Wednesday that Obama had no choice but to replace McChrystal. ""The statements of the general not only were outside the norm, they really did put into question military subordination of civilian control,"" Graham said, taking particular issue with unnamed officers in the article who he said showed disrespect and a cavalier attitude he termed ""unacceptable."" ""This is a low point in my view for the armed forces in a very long time, and I'm glad the president made this decision,"" Graham said. ""There are some other officers that need to be looked at, and they need to be replaced."" At the same time, the senators and others said Obama should now make clear that a troop withdrawal from Afghanistan will only occur when conditions allow it, rather than on the July 2011 date set by the administration. Petraeus ""is an outstanding military leader, but even he can't win in Afghanistan if the president continues to insist on an arbitrary withdrawal date -- a fact our enemies are counting on and our allies fear,"" said Sen. Kit Bond of Missouri, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee. Levin, D-Michigan, told reporters that Petraeus supports the July 2011 date for starting a troop withdrawal based on conditions on the ground. ""What will be conditions-based is not whether reductions begin in July 2011, but the pace of those reductions,"" Levin said Petraeus told him. Levin acknowledged that Petraeus or Obama could change their minds on the issue, saying, ""nothing is etched in stone."" Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, said in a written statement that Obama's ""decision to return Gen. (David) Petraeus to the battlefield provides not just continuity in philosophy, but tested diplomatic skill that is at the very center of a military strategy which hinges on progress in governance to sustain military gains."" House Armed Services Committee chairman Ike Skelton, D-Missouri, said that Petraeus ""is the best that we have."" ""I have great confidence in his ability to bring about a successful outcome in Afghanistan. The commander-in-chief must have confidence in his commanders in the field,"" he said.  ""It is time to move on and return our focus to waging the war in Afghanistan."" A spokesman for the Afghanistan Defense Ministry said his government would have preferred to see McChrystal stay, but was happy Petraeus had been tapped as the replacement. ""We're not happy to see Gen. McChrystal go, but of all the choices that could have been made, we are happy to hear it is Petraeus who will continue the mission,"" Gen. Mohammad Zahir Azimi said. Obama tapped McChrystal to head the U.S. military effort in Afghanistan in the spring of 2009 shortly after dismissing Gen. David McKiernan. McChrystal was strongly recommended as the best choice to carry out the counterinsurgency strategy created by Petraeus in Iraq, but administration officials later expressed displeasure with what they thought was McChrystal's leak of his request for more troops for Afghanistan before Obama completed his review of the issue. The president eventually ordered 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan, most of the number sought by McChrystal. CNN's John King, Suzanne Malveaux, Barbara Starr, Dana Bash, Alan Silverleib, Ted Barrett and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: Key senator says Petraeus backs July 2011 start of withdrawal from Afghanistan .

"Washington (CNN) -- The White House released more than 100 pages of e-mails on Wednesday in a bid to quell critics who say President Barack Obama and his aides played politics with national security following the deadly terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. The e-mails detail the complex back and forth between the CIA, State Department, and the White House in developing unclassified talking points that were used to underpin a controversial and slow-to-evolve explanation of events last September 11. The talking points have become a political flashpoint in a long-running battle between the Obama administration and Republicans, who accuse it of not bolstering security prior to the attack, of botching the response to it, and of misleading the public for political gain less than two months before the November election. The GOP suggests that the administration removed specific terror references and stuck to an explanation -- later proved untrue -- that the attack was result of a spontaneous demonstration over an anti-Muslim film that was produced in the United States. There had been such a demonstration in Cairo. The Benghazi attack killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Read the e-mails in a searchable format. The White House and its allies in Congress have made the case that any confusion and conflicting information in the early hours and days after the attacks stemmed from the ""fog of war"" -- not any deliberate effort to mislead the American people about the source of the attacks. Obama has called Republican concentration on the talking points a political ""side show."" Senior Obama administration officials contend the e-mails demonstrate the process of developing talking points for members of Congress to use in media interviews was not focused on politics but rather on events. Analysis: CIA role in Benghazi underreported . For instance, some of the e-mails expressed caution about what should be said publicly during an FBI investigation while others centered on the strength of intelligence at the time. The White House said the e-mails it provided to inquiring lawmakers months ago and released on Wednesday aim to paint a fuller picture following what it described as a series of selective and inaccurate e-mails recently appearing in media reports. ""Collectively, these e-mails make clear that the interagency process, including the White House's interactions, were focused on providing the facts as we knew them based on the best information available at the time and protecting an ongoing investigation,"" said White House spokesman Eric Schultz. The e-mails indicate the CIA was likely the lead organization in developing the talking points with the State Department recommending significant changes. Opinion: GOP using Benghazi to smear . Changes made to talking points . Following the original drafting of them, CIA analysts made a handful of significant changes, according to administration sources. In the CIA's original set, the first bullet point included a reference that the Benghazi attack was ""spontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and evolved into a direct assault against the U.S. consulate and subsequently its annex."" It noted assessments could change ""as additional information is collected and analyzed."" The second bullet point noted the attackers in Benghazi were comprised of ""a mix of individuals from across many sections of Libyan society."" It specified that intelligence officials did not know whether Islamic extremists, including those aligned with al Qaeda, had participated in the attack. Pickering wants an open Benghazi hearing . This bullet was later changed after a CIA analyst questioned whether the current intelligence supported the assertion that extremists had participated in the attack. Another CIA officer agreed, stating intelligence placed extremists at a protest but could not support the notion that extremists were responsible for the American deaths. The editing team revised it so that talking point read, ""The crowd almost certainly was a mix of individuals from across many sectors of Libyan society. The investigation is on-going as to who is responsible. That being said, we do know that Islamic extremists participated in the violent demonstrations."" The second CIA change was to the swap out the word ""attacks"" with ""demonstrations"" in the first bullet point, which an administration source said was to eliminate an awkward and illogical account of events. A third change the CIA made was to remove the name al Qaeda from the second talking point, which was done because it didn't want to get ahead of the FBI's investigation of the attack. A key point of contention revolves around statements by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, who took the most direct criticism because of her assertions in television interviews days after the attack that linked it to the demonstration. 'Shredded bodies' in 'horrific' Benghazi blast . State Department concern . A final CIA addition to the talking points was a warning about the security situation at the time of the armed assault. But that warning was eventually removed. Senior administration officials say that long before the CIA heard concerns from the State Department about warnings being put in the talking points, . CIA Deputy Director Mike Morell advocated for removing the warnings out, since he felt the talking points should focus on what happened in Benghazi on September 11, rather than the previous six months. He also felt it was unprofessional and unfair for the CIA to cite its own warnings to the State Department, officials said. Victoria Nuland, then the State Department spokeswoman, had raised concerns over the CIA's first version, saying that they went further than what she was allowed to say about the attack during her briefings. She also questioned information about CIA warnings of extremist threats linked to al Qaeda in Benghazi and eastern Libya, saying ""the penultimate point could be abused by members (of Congress) to beat the State Department for not paying attention to agency warnings so why do we want to feed that either? Concerned..."" Rep. Darrell Issa, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee which is investigating the matter, told CNN's ""Situtation Room"" that his staff wants to digest the e-mails. He stressed that they were a selected set of documents as released and the committee is still seeking a range of other information. Opinion: Obama has explaining to do on Benghazi .

"Jang Song Taek, who held numerous posts in the North Korean regime since the 1970s, was considered the country's second-most  powerful man. Then, the most powerful man, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, had him executed. Jang's death sent ripples through the isolated nation not just because of his influential position, but because he was the uncle of Kim Jong Un. In the two years preceding his death, Jang held one of the most powerful posts -- regent to the young North Korean leader. He was instrumental in the nation's transition from former leader Kim Jong Il to his son and heir, Kim Jong Un. The secretive nature of the North Korean regime makes it a challenge to deduce why Jang fell out of favor, though one expert sums it up this way: Kim Jong Un outgrew his guardian and took him out. Those who agree with this hypothesis look at Jang's trajectory throughout his decades in the regime. At least twice before, Jang was purged from the leadership presumably for his too-big ambitions. Kim Jong Il purged Jang in 2004 and he was virtually unseen for two years before making a comeback. If his ambitions got the best of him again (the North Koreans say he was guilty of treason), this time, there will be no comeback. Jang, who was married to Kim Jong Un's aunt, was vice chairman of North Korea's top military body and had often been pictured beside the young leader, who is believed to be around 30. But in a lengthy article foaming with outraged rhetoric, North Korea's official news agency on Friday accused Jang of trying to overthrow the state, describing him as ""despicable human scum."" Analysis: North Korean execution raises more question than answers . Jang's ascent . Jang, 67, was born in northeastern North Korea and was the youngest of five children, according to the respected North Korea Leadership Watch blog. He studied economics, and it was during university that he met Kim Kyong Hui, the daughter of North Korean leader Kim Il-Sung, and sister of Kim Jung Il, who would succeed his father. The couple got married, giving Jang an inside track to some of the country's most powerful posts. Among his many positions, Jang was the director of the administrative department of the ruling Worker's Party of Korea, chairman of the country's commission for sports, and vice chairman of the National Defense Commission. ""Over time he accumulated a lot of influence within the party central committee,"" said Alexandre Mansourov, a North Korea expert at Johns Hopkins University. Although not related by blood to the ruling family, his influence came from his reliance on his wife, Mansourov said. But analysts say Jang had a big ego and was arrogant, leading to his being removed from his positions at least twice. According to Mansourov, in the late 1970s, Jang was stripped of his post and sent to work at a steel mill, but succeeded in returning to the party ranks. Jang reportedly fell out of favor a second time in 2004, when he left the leadership ranks and disappeared from public view for about two years. In the last two years, Jang extended his influence from the administrative centers of North Korea to the economic side, Mansourov said. He began accumulating authority over the economy, social life, foreign investment and foreign trade. Opinion: How Kim Jong Un got rid of his uncle . North Korean transparency? One of the more surprising developments following the execution of Jang was the lengthy indictment of his alleged crimes and his character that was published by the state media. For the regime to so openly explain why it executed him, it could hint at Jang truly having overstepped his bounds. ""This man has always been a little more individualistic and embracing capitalism and lifestyle that is not acceptable to North Korea,"" said Han Park, a professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia. Whatever Jang did to betray North Korea, it was so severe that his wife could not, or would not, help spare him. ""I think she is more loyal to the party than Jang is,"" Park said. She may have even consented or participated in prosecuting her husband, he said. To the outside world, the transition of power from Kim Jong Il to Kim Jong Un appeared smooth, but the revelations made in the indictment cast a different light on the change in power. The fall of Jang is evidence that there was resistance and tension behind the scenes during these past years, Mansourov said. It may turn out that Jang was building his own power base, growing his own cult of personality, he said. In the end, Jang may have underestimated the younger Kim, thinking he was a kid who could be manipulated, Mansourov said. In the end, Kim outgrew his regent and took him out, he said.","Jang Song Taek was considered North Korea's Number 2 .
He was executed, North Korea said .
Experts say Jang was an ambitious man whose wings had been clipped before .
His influence came from his marriage into the ruling family ."
"Thailand's bitter political crisis intensified Tuesday as five people were killed in clashes between anti-government protesters and police, and the country's anti-corruption commission filed charges against the Prime Minister. The violence erupted in the heart of Bangkok after months of protests against Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra that have deepened political divisions in the Southeast Asian nation. A police officer died after he was shot in the head, and four other people -- at least two of them protesters -- were also killed, officials said. Seventy-three people, both police officers and protesters, were wounded in the clashes Tuesday, according to the Erawan Emergency Center, a medical unit monitoring the unrest in Thailand. 10 questions: What's behind the protests in Thailand? Police were trying to clear demonstrators, who have been campaigning against Yingluck for months in central Bangkok. After police fired tear gas in an attempt to disperse crowds of demonstrators in the streets, people among the protesters began firing guns at police. With the two sides about 200 meters (656 feet) apart, police responded by firing rubber bullets and live ammunition. During the firefight, which lasted about 20 minutes, a grenade exploded near a group of police officers, knocking them to the ground. At least four of them were wounded, said Lt. Gen. Paradon Patthanathabut, the national security chief. Thousands of protesters . About 6,000 demonstrators were estimated to be on the streets of the city Tuesday, Paradon said, and thousands of security personnel have been mobilized. Protesters opposed to Yingluck have been camped out since November at official buildings around the city, including Government House, the office of the prime minister and appointed cabinet ministers. Leaders of the protests say they want Yingluck's government replaced by an unelected ""people council,"" which would oversee electoral and political changes. Clashes among pro- and anti-government groups had flared up during the crisis, leaving at least 10 people dead and hundreds wounded. The government responded by imposing a state of emergency last month. Police move in . Until recently, authorities had largely refrained from confronting the demonstrators directly, even when they prevented large numbers of people from voting in recent elections. That changed last week as police began attempts to seize sites occupied by protesters for months. Government officials said the protesters' actions were blocking public access to government services, making intervention by authorities necessary. Officials claimed public sentiment was turning against the demonstrators. But the protesters have so far refused to give way. Police said they arrested 145 protesters near the Ministry of Energy on Tuesday. Rice subsidy controversy . As the violence unfolded on the streets, Yingluck faced pressure on another front when Thailand's anti-corruption commission said it was bringing charges against her over a rice-subsidy program. The National Counter-Corruption Commission said in a statement that it was calling Yingluck to appear February 27 to face charges that she failed to act on warnings of corruption in the program that her government introduced in 2011. The program, which offered farmers well above the market rate for their rice, has run into financial problems. Problems with the subsidy program have angered many farmers, who make up part of Yingluck's support base in the north and east of Thailand. The anti-corruption commission's charges could eventually lead to the suspension of Yingluck from all political positions. In a televised speech before the commission's announcement, Yingluck said the rice subsidy program had been successful over the past two years and accused her political opponents of ""obstructing the government's implementation of the project."" She said there was ""no conspiracy to corrupt."" Long-running crisis . Protesters say Yingluck is a puppet of her billionaire brother, the deposed, exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The protests were sparked in November by Yingluck's government's botched attempt to pass an amnesty bill that would have paved the way for her brother's return to the political fray in earnest. Yingluck had hoped the elections held earlier this month could help ease tensions. But the main opposition party boycotted the vote and protesters caused widespread disruption. That left the outcome of the election inconclusive, without enough results to reopen parliament. It remains unclear when election officials will be able to complete the voting in disrupted areas. The civil unrest of recent months is the worst to hit Thailand since a crackdown on pro-Thaksin demonstrators in 2010 left scores of people dead. Protesters pledge more demonstrations .

"The Obama administration is promising a much smoother ride on HealthCare.gov come Saturday, but insurers worry that behind-the-scenes glitches will keep consumers from enrolling in the health insurance plans they want. Insurance industry insiders tell CNN that when some people sign up for coverage through the website, their personal data is not being properly transmitted to the insurance companies of their choosing. Insurers are still getting inaccurate and duplicative data. And that's even if it makes it to them at all. So how do insurers know they aren't getting the information? Customers who signed up for coverage are calling the companies with questions and finding they aren't in their systems. And insurers have been testing the site, submitting John Doe records and not seeing them come out the other end, an industry official said. ""There's no part of us that thinks all of this will be fixed in three days from now,"" the industry official said, referring to the administration's self-imposed Saturday deadline to make the site work for a ""vast majority"" of users. Another insurance industry insider was more blunt, saying: ""It's still all jacked up."" Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for the insurance trade group America's Health Insurance Plans, was more circumspect. ""There is still a lot of work to be done to make sure that enrollments can be done and processed accurately,"" he said. If the problems aren't fixed, insurers fear a worst-case scenario where consumers sign up for insurance through the website and think they're enrolled, only to find out at the doctor's office that they don't have any coverage. White House: Enroll in Obamacare, but not too fast . Insures are warily watching to see how the administration talks about the site following this Saturday's deadline to improve it. ""If they come out and claim victory over the weekend, it's just not true,"" the industry insider said. ""The question is, can you guarantee that someone who's gone through this process and signed up will have coverage January 1? As of today, the honest answer would be no."" The administration said it has made good progress on a fix to the federal online portal for consumers to purchase coverage under the Affordable Care Act following its rocky -- and politically charged -- rollout in October. Supreme Court to take up Obamacare contraception case . Consumers who pick a plan by December 23 and pay their premium by December 31 will have coverage effective January 1, said Aaron Albright, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a key player working to repair the site. ""When a consumer selects a plan and enrolls in marketplace coverage, an orange message is clearly displayed letting them know that they must make payment to be covered. A consumer will receive contact from their issuer about how to make payment. If they do not receive that notice, and are uncertain if their enrollment has been processed, they should contact the issuer,"" he said. One insurance executive said the industry is raising its voice now about the problems because officials are trying to set low expectations and avoid blame should problems persist beyond Saturday. ""The insurance industry, of which I'm a part and can say this pretty confidently, the insurance industry is making it worse than it is,"" the executive said. ""But it's still a problem.""

"If the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 caused a rift in China-Malaysia relations, the two countries appear to have put it behind them. Recent comments by officials in both Kuala Lumpur and Beijing have emphasized the active cooperation between the two countries, while also downplaying accusations lodged by Chinese families against the Malaysian government. According to Hong Kong's South China Morning Post, China's Ambassador to Malaysia sought to distance these ""radical views"" from his country's official position. They ""do not represent the views of Chinese people and the Chinese government,"" he was quoted as saying. Some of the Chinese relatives of passengers aboard the missing Boeing 777 have been openly critical of the investigation. They went so far as to release a statement calling the Malaysian government and its military the ""real murderers"" of their loved ones. In a press conference Saturday, Acting Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein made it clear China will be an accredited member of the investigation team. A few days earlier, he spoke about Malaysia's duty to keep its Asian neighbor informed about all progress. James Chin, professor of political science at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, said the rift always appeared larger in the media than at an official level. ""I think among the diplomats they do understand this is just a small thing within the larger context of Malaysia-China relations and this will not alter relationships in the long term."" Trade partners . At stake between the two countries is a thriving economic relationship. According to Malaysia's Ministry of International Trade, China was Malaysia's largest trading partner for the fifth consecutive year in 2013. Trade between the two countries that year grew by 12.5% to US $63.4 billion. Tourism numbers were equally positive, with 1.79 million people visiting from China last year -- an increase of 14.9% from the previous year. Ramon Navaratnam, former Secretary General of the Malaysian Ministry of Transport, said he did not expect trade between the two countries to deteriorate, despite the initial protests by some of the Chinese families of missing passengers on MH370 in Beijing. ""I don't see it happening as the Chinese authorities, especially their envoy (Huang Huikang) to Malaysia, has given very measured statements and not blamed Malaysia for MH370,"" said Navaratnam, who is currently the chairman of the Center for Public Policy Studies at the Asian Strategy and Leadership Institute. Navaratnam, who has authored several books on economics in Malaysia, said the business environment would not change unless the governments decided otherwise. Lee Hwok Aun, an economics lecturer at the University of Malaya, agreed bilateral trade is not expected to fall off as Malaysia's primary exports to China consist of electrical components and raw materials such as crude rubber and palm oil -- critical to China's own economy. ""Tourism may suffer some minor setbacks initially but exports won't change much as China needs raw materials,"" said Lee. ""It's much harder to organize a boycott of component imports and China too wants a steady supply chain.""","Chinese officials have been careful not to blame Malaysia for the fate of MH370 .
This is contrast to many of the Chinese relatives of passengers .
Trade between China and Malaysia grew to more than US$63.4 billion last year ."
"Four decades before anyone took an arrow to the knee in ""Skyrim,"" adventurers were sitting down with paper and pencil to battle fantasy monsters and explore rich, new worlds in a different kind of role-playing game. ""Dungeons & Dragons,"" commonly known simply as D&D, burst onto the scene in 1974, long before the word ""gaming"" came with the implied word ""video"" in front of it. In D&D, the brainchild of creators Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson, players could become fighters, magic-users, and clerics, and run through adventures created by a ""Dungeon Master"" or ""DM"" -- the person responsible for controlling nearly every aspect of the game. Players sat around a table rolling multi-sided dice and visualizing the adventure using just their imaginations -- a far cry from today's vast, richly rendered video-game worlds. But four decades later, and with all its high-tech competition, ""Dungeons & Dragons"" continues to grow and evolve. And many of today's  computer games, animated television shows, feature films, novels, and even pop and rock songs owe much to D&D lore. ""In today's culture, D&D has found its place as a leader and influencer over storytellers across so many different mediums,"" said Nathan Stewart, brand director for D&D at Wizards of the Coast, the company publishing the game. ""From game designers and musicians, to scores of screenwriters and film directors, D&D has had a profound effect on those who have brought fantasy and geek culture to the foreground."" Demon worship? Indeed, many creators of fantasy games and stories today probably cut their teeth on D&D as kids, or teens. The game allowed players to tap into their own creativity while socializing with friends. Or, for some, with their family. Jerry Holkins, co-founder for the webcomic, ""Penny Arcade,"" said he started playing D&D with his young aunts and uncles, much to the chagrin of his mother. ""My mom flipped out, of course. The belief that 'Dungeons & Dragons' constituted some kind of 'satanic ritual' was a common refrain at my house,"" Holkins said. ""When I got older, I hid the fact that I played it.  Where she might have found another young person's pornography or drugs, she found my DM's guide.  Honestly, I think she would have preferred the drugs."" By the early '80s, as the game grew in popularity with wargamers, then college and high school students, it drew the attention of some religious groups that claimed -- as they would with ""Harry Potter"" decades later -- that the game encouraged witchcraft and demon worship. For others, D&D opened the door to expanding their circle of friends at a time in their formative years when shyness may have otherwise taken over. Video game creator Ken Levine didn't have friends to play D&D with when he discovered the game in 1978. But a trip to summer camp and a chance meeting with others who played introduced him to many new people. ""So I went from having no friends and no social circle to an immediate social circle through 'Dungeons & Dragons,' "" said Levine, who is best known as creator of the ""Bioshock"" series. ""We were playing a module out of the 'Dragon' magazine called 'The Mansion of Mad Professor Ludlow.' The Dungeon Master that night is still my best friend to this day."" ""Without Dungeons & Dragons, there is a very different person in this chair right now. I just don't know if I would have made the connection -- the social network with the people I met."" By 1981, the game had more than 3 million players worldwide. By 2007, that number grew to 6 million, and the numbers keep rising. Influence on video games . Universally considered the first modern role-playing game, D&D set the benchmark for many future RPG games -- either the table-top or computer variety. Beyond simple game mechanics, the game allowed players to understand how to tell a story or craft an adventure that kept people engaged and entertained. ""Often times when people think of D&D, they think of the dice, maps and groups of friends sitting around the kitchen table,"" Stewart said. ""But D&D has also been in the video game space as far back as 1982 and has served as the inspiration for a lot of today's digital games."" The influence of ""Dungeons & Dragons"" on video games has been clear from the beginning. ""D&D was about creativity -- both in terms of the player experience and the Dungeon Master experience,"" Levine said. ""Once I started getting exposed to Gygax's world -- sitting there and thumbing through the pages of the 'Monster Manual' over and over again and the other manuals of Advanced D&D, I saw his whole vision. It exposed me to creatively minded people who thought about fantasy and genre things the way I did. It really got the ball rolling for me."" In 1988, the first officially-licensed video game based on D&D was released by Strategic Simulations, Inc. ""Pool of Radiance"" was an adaptation of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rule set, and was generally well received by fans and critics. More successful video games would follow including the ""Baldur's Gate"" series and the ""Neverwinter Nights"" collection. Holkins played many of the games and felt the games leveraged the vast settings of the D&D's campaigns without tying themselves to its specific rules -- thereby leaning more on storytelling rather than combat. ""As far as it being an influence on videogames, that's not even a conversation,"" Holkins said. ""In the Western CRPG (computer role-playing games) tradition, the lineage is so direct as to be a straight line."" And many who play games like ""Diablo,"" ""Dark Souls"" and ""World of Warcraft,"" often connected to teammates and opponents through headsets and computer chat channels, also gather together for the social experience that is an old-fashioned ""D&D"" session. ""Dungeons & Dragons"" sessions are social, Levine said. ""You are surrounded by your friends and not (someone) yelling and cursing at you over their Xbox headset. ""You get to have this really nice experience playing with friends."" Holkins agrees. ""Different groups are all playing the same game, theoretically, but in practice there's a lot of culture that isn't really portable from table to table and people approach it with their own style,"" he said. ""It would have to be like that, when you think about it. At root, the game is about a group of people who are all agreeing to imagine the same thing. Is 'intimate' the right word?  I think I could make a case."" New D&D rules . The game itself has evolved over many official and unofficial rule changes in its 40 years. From the original rules in 1974 to ""Advanced Dungeons & Dragons"" in 1981 up to ""D&D 4th Edition"" released in 2008, the idea has always been to give players a framework to create adventures the way they want to experience and enjoy them. ""There are certain things about the D&D game that transcend generations -- the storytelling aspect, the desire to become something greater than yourself or just something different from yourself,"" said Chris Perkins, senior design manager for story and world building for Dungeons & Dragons. ""I think those experiences have given the D&D game its longevity because they are timeless."" Two years and 170,000 playtesters later, those timeless ideals are implanted in the fifth and latest generation of rules which were announced by Wizards of the Coast on Monday. A brand new ""Player's Handbook,"" ""Monster Manual,"" and ""Dungeon Master's Guide"" will be released this summer, setting the foundations for the game's future. In addition to new rules, the creative team at Wizards of the Coast announced an original storyline that will extend beyond the tabletop and into digital gaming. Tiamat, a powerful goddess that takes the form of a multi-colored, five-headed dragon, is at the core of the new ""Tyranny of Dragons"" tale. A new module for the D&D online game, ""Neverwinter,"" will launch on August 14 and be ""the premier digital 'Dungeons & Dragons' experience for players,"" according to a press release. Two new tabletop adventures will also be released, one on August 19 and the other on October 21. A new line of miniatures (figures that represent player characters and others they encounter) is also planned to be used in conjunction with the fifth edition of core rules. ""We're aiming to tell the story not only in the role-playing game, but in other venues so that people can experience it at a number of different levels to a number of different depths,"" Perkins said. ""We haven't really dealt with dragons much in the (Forgotten Realms) over the past 40 years. It's been a long time since we've had an iconic villain on the order of Tiamat."" He said the experience will be different depending on what platform you access the story. Players will have a shared story, but what actually happens during a tabletop game will be different than in the digital games. While rule changes have usually resulted in the gnashing of teeth and wailing of voices from some players, Perkins said there is flexibility built in to the new edition so players can play and enjoy whatever type of game they want, using as much or as little of the new system as they want. Perkins acts as the Dungeon Master for the Acquisitions, Inc., adventures at PAX conventions and plans to show everyone how the new rules can work. ""When I run the game at PAX Prime this summer, I'm going to do it even differently,"" he said. ""I'm going to have 'Theater of the Mind' elements, but I'm also going to have very strong visuals and there will be miniatures because I'm going to try to demonstrate without actually calling attention to it that you can present and play the D&D game in any one of a number of different ways and it is still Dungeons & Dragons."" Stewart and Perkins believe the future of stories in games will be best told through a transmedia experience and they hope players will usher in a familiar future for D&D. It is a sentiment shared by Levine and Holkins. ""Let's get a group of friends together and have an adventure,"" Levine said. ""In reality, that's what the future of video gaming wants to be. It wants to be a place where the player has the ability to be more expressive.""","As ""Dungeons & Dragons"" turns 40, it's still inspiring gamers .
The 5th edition of D&D rules will be announced Monday .

"(OPRAH.com) -- Chris Rock is an Emmy-winning comedian, devoted husband and loving father --but it's time to get to know a new side of this funnyman. Meet Chris Rock, hair expert. It's a detour he took after an innocent carpool ride left Rock with an idea he just couldn't shake. ""I was with my daughter one day, and we're in the car and she's with one of her friends in the back seat, a little white friend,"" he says. ""She was just kind of raving about her friend's hair a little too much for my comfort [saying]: 'You've got great hair. Oh, your hair's so good.'"" Not wanting to make her comments a big deal, Rock says he tried to play his them off. ""[I said]: ""Oh, baby, your hair's beautiful. Come on,'"" he says. ""If I would have really reacted, then she would have a complex about her hair."" Still, Rock couldn't let it go. ""It sparked something in me,"" he says. Oprah.com: Oprah's hair throughout the years! What Rock discovered is a $9 billion industry that affects the daily activities, wallets, self-esteem -- and even the sex lives -- of black women. Because women spend so much time and money on their hair, Rock says men are forced to adopt a hands-off policy. ""You cannot touch a black woman's hair. You are conditioned not to even go there,"" he says. ""When I was a dating guy, I dated women from different races. Anytime I was with an Asian or a Puerto Rican girl or a white girl, my hands would constantly be in their hair. Like my hands were thirsty."" One of the first lessons Rock learned on this journey was that women do their hair for one another. ""They say it's for the men, but it's really for the women. Because guys don't care,"" he says. ""There's no point in the history of the world where men were not sleeping with the women in front of them. We take what we can get."" Actress Nia Long, who Rock interviews in the film, agrees. ""There's always this sort of pressure within the black community like, if you have good hair, you're prettier or better than the brown-skinned girl that wears the Afro or the dreads or the natural hairstyle,"" she says. Oprah.com: Oprah's stylist reveals his hair secrets . Rock found the biggest moneymaker in the hair business to be weaves. Black women can spend six to eight hours getting their hair braided into tiny sections. Stylists then delicately attach tracks of hair -- which can be simple extensions or full wigs -- to the braids. ""If you've got a weave, your scalp's like a beat up highway,"" Rock jokes. Women who wear weaves stop by the salon for regular washes, conditioning and tightening, but the real expense lies with the hair itself. Rock says he was shocked to learn that regular women spend thousands of dollars on weaves -- and even put them on layaway. ""Janet Jackson spends $5,000 to go to the Grammys on her hair. I didn't know Kiki was spending $5,000 to go to AT&T and answer the phone,"" he says. ""That was disturbing."" Rock discovered the hottest hair on the market is found in India, where human hair is the number two export behind software. ""This is some of the worst poverty in the world,"" he says. ""I don't think [people] know they're walking around with $1,000 on their head."" While in India, Rock witnessed a tonsuring ceremony at the Venkateswara Temple. Every year, more than 10 million people cut their hair off as an offering to the Hindu gods. ""In India, hair is considered a vanity, and removing hair is considered an act of self-sacrifice,"" he says. ""These people have no idea where their hair is going or how much it's worth. The money made at this temple is second only to the Vatican. The hair collected here is auctioned off to exporters who distribute it around the planet."" Another staple of the industry is relaxers -- also called ""creamy crack"" by some. While women of other races use perms to add curl, black women use them to straighten their hair. ""You name a black woman, any black woman,"" Rock says. ""They've either had their hair relaxed, or they're having their hair relaxed right now."" The active ingredient in relaxer is a substance called sodium hydroxide. The chemical is so strong it can burn a woman's hair off -- which is why Rock is urging parents to stop the relaxing addiction now. ""This kiddie perm has to stop, okay? They shouldn't have to worry about that till they're in their teens,"" he says. ""Putting those chemicals in that child's hair is just not cool."" Rock says he tells his own daughters they're beautiful every moment he can --and has only one answer when it comes to questions of having good hair.

"China, Japan and the United States are continuing their tense standoff in Beijing's disputed new air defense zone Friday -- a treacherous situation that both sides warn could lead to violence, intended or not. To this point, a senior official in U.S. President Barack Obama's administration said Friday that commercial airlines are being told to abide by Beijing's call to notify it of plans to traverse the newly declared zone over the East China Sea, even if the U.S. government doesn't recognize it. ""We ... are advising for safety reasons that they comply with notices to airmen, which FAA always advises,"" the official said. This advice reflects fears that the back-and-forth between the two sides could have unintended consequences involving not just opposing troops, but innocent civilians as well. It's a subtle change from two days earlier, when the State Department said ""the U.S. government generally expects that U.S. carriers operating internationally"" comply with other countries' mandates, rather than directing them to. Whatever U.S. carriers do, two major Japanese airlines have refused to comply with China's declaration. Last Saturday, China unilaterally announced the creation of a ""Air Defense Identification Zone"" over several islands it and Japan have both claimed. The two countries have been sharply at odds over those isles, which are believed to be near large reserves of natural resources. Tokyo rejected the new zone, as well as Beijing's insistence that aircraft entering it identify themselves and file flight plans. They were joined by South Korea and Washington, with Secretary of State John Kerry saying the move would ""only increase tensions in the region and create risks of an incident."" Since then, there's been no backing down. On Friday morning, for instance, China scrambled fighter jets after U.S. and Japanese military aircraft entered its disputed air defense zone, according to a Chinese military official. Col. Shen Jinke, a Chinese air force spokesman, said in Beijing that the two U.S. and 10 Japanese aircraft were monitoring targets in the zone. He said the Chinese air force and navy were identifying and monitoring all foreign warplanes in the zone. A U.S. military official told CNN that at least one U.S. unarmed military aircraft and several Japanese military aircraft flew through the zone Friday without incident. The official said the U.S. flight was part of scheduled routine operations. ""This is status quo,"" the official said. ""We are not changing what we are doing. We are not trying to make a point with China. We fly U.S. aircraft daily in international airspace in the region. This is normal."" OPINION: Beijing's foreign policy balancing act in the East China Sea . The official said the aircraft were not B-52s, though the United States did fly two of those type of planes through the zone Monday as part of what the Pentagon described as a preplanned military exercise. South Korea said its military sent a plane on a routine patrol flight into the zone on Tuesday without alerting China. A South Korean Defense Ministry official said such flights are carried out twice a week and would continue despite China's declaration.

"Mississippi's attorney general said Thursday that the state may have to issue a nationwide manhunt after four pardoned murderers left jail and ""hit the road running."" ""We'll catch 'em. It's just a matter of time,"" Attorney General Jim Hood told CNN. The four were among nearly 200 convicted criminals to whom Gov. Haley Barbour granted clemency or a pardon in a final act before leaving office this week. The governor's actions have set off a legal firestorm in Mississippi. A judge issued a temporary injunction Wednesday forbidding the release of any more prisoners. And the process of releasing 21 other inmates has been halted, said Hood, who believes the former governor put people at risk and sought the court order. The pardons include the four convicted murderers and a convicted armed robber who were released Sunday. The five now must contact prison officials on a daily basis as their fate is adjudicated, but their whereabouts are unknown, Hood said. A court hearing on the matter will be held January 23. Hood said the state cannot issue an arrest warrant for the five who were released because they have not committed a crime. ""We have not found any law that will support that,"" Hood told CNN. ""They have a legal document saying they are free to go. ""There are some tough legal issues we are trying to address,"" he said. ""This is such a unique problem that no law has ever had to address yet. We're having to make new law here."" Hood said he did not know Barbour's reasons for the pardons and clemencies, but said he owed the public an explanation. He gave the governor a tongue-lashing, comparing him to the unethical, greedy commissioner in the 1980s television series ""The Dukes of Hazzard."" ""He's tried to rule the state like Boss Hogg and he didn't think the law applied to him,"" Hood told CNN Wednesday. Hood said Barbour violated the state's constitution because the pardon requests for many inmates were not published 30 days before they were granted, as required. Mississippi is one of the few states that requires advance notice. ""This isn't a partisan issue,"" according to Hood, who is a Democrat. ""Either you followed the constitution or you didn't."" Barbour is a conservative Republican. What's behind the pardon battle? Hinds County Circuit Court Judge Tomie Green issued the injunction Wednesday, saying it appeared some pardons, including those for four murderers, did not meet the 30-day requirement. Any inmates released in the future must meet the standard, Green ruled. On his way out the door, the governor approved full pardons for nearly 200 people, including 14 convicted murderers, according to documents the Mississippi secretary of state's office released Tuesday. The four murderers who received full pardons last week -- David Gatlin, Joseph Ozment, Charles Hooker and Anthony McCray -- were cited in Green's order. They were all serving life sentences and worked as inmate trusties at the governor's mansion, said Suzanne Singletary, spokeswoman for the Mississippi Department of Corrections. Trusties are inmates who can receive additional rights through good behavior. Hood told CNN that it's possible that those who didn't meet the 30-day requirement may have to return to prison and complete their sentences. Barbour said Wednesday that some people misunderstand the clemency process and believe that most of the individuals were still jailed. ""Approximately 90 percent of these individuals were no longer in custody, and a majority of them had been out for years,"" he said in a statement. ""The pardons were intended to allow them to find gainful employment or acquire professional licenses as well as hunt and vote. My decision about clemency was based upon the recommendation of the Parole Board in more than 90 percent of the cases,"" Barbour wrote. ""The 26 people released from custody due to clemency is just slightly more than one-tenth of 1 percent of those incarcerated."" Hood said he is questioning the release of many of the 175 individuals who received full pardons. The pardons are ""a slap in the face to everyone in law enforcement and Governor Barbour should be ashamed,"" Hood said. Barbour's full pardon of Gatlin has intensified fears that the man will try ""to finish what he started,"" one of his surviving victims said. ""I feel like my safety is in jeopardy,"" Randy Walker, who was shot and wounded by Gatlin, said Wednesday. ""I wonder if he's going to finish what he's started."" Gatlin walked into a trailer in 1993 where his estranged wife, Tammy Ellis, lived and shot her in the head as she held their 6-week-old baby in her arms. She died of her wounds. Walker, the woman's friend, survived a gunshot wound to the head. Gatlin was convicted of murder, aggravated assault and burglary of a residence. In an interview with CNN's Soledad O'Brien, Walker and Tiffany Ellis Brewer -- Tammy's sister -- expressed concerns about the release and fears that Gatlin may intend to target them. ""I'm married and have a family again,"" Walker said. ""I feel the safety for them is an issue. Anybody that might be with me at the time that he decides to do something would be in jeopardy."" Gatlin's pardon also raised concerns from John Kitchens, the prosecutor who saw him sent to prison. ""Haley Barbour is insane for granting a pardon to this criminal,"" said Kitchens, who is now in private practice. Brewer said Barbour -- who left office this week -- hasn't directly responded to questions about the pardon. ""He will not comment on anything. We have no answers as to why he has done this. I would like to think he did not have all of the facts of the case, if he did have all the facts,"" she said. Barbour's successor, Phil Bryant, was inaugurated Tuesday. Barbour, who served eight years in the governor's office, had previously granted full pardons to three other convicted killers in 2008. Another three were awarded conditional or indefinite releases during his time in office -- meaning the governor, in total, granted reprieves to 20 convicted murderers, the documents showed. Since the conservative governor took office in 2004, 222 people were granted clemency for a wide variety of crimes. Those who have been granted full pardons include shoplifters, rapists, burglars and embezzlers. There were also a number who were found guilty of either manslaughter or homicide, who were given unconditional pardons. Barbour is a long-time GOP operative, serving as the chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1993 to 1997, working as an aide in the Reagan administration and taking part in the 1988 presidential campaign of George H.W. Bush. He also is considered one of Washington's most-powerful lobbyists.","The attorney general vows to catch the pardoned inmates .

"Three months of political unrest, one week of horrific internecine violence, a few frenetic hours of negotiations -- it all culminated in a breakthrough deal In Ukraine to cut the president's powers, reinvent the Constitution and pave the way to free a key opposition leader. These developments Friday gave hope to the Eastern European nation. But as long as angry protesters pack Kiev's Maidan, or Independence Square, as long as the emotions remain raw, as long as the bloodshed is still fresh, this story isn't over. ""I feel very proud of Ukrainians because we showed we are able to struggle for our future, our freedom,"" said Sophia Holotna, whose friend was among the scores of demonstrators killed in the capital. ""But now I feel almost very sadness. It's my first feeling."" The agreement -- hashed out overnight and into the afternoon among Ukrainian leaders, opposition figures and European Union representatives -- drew some cheers when it was announced to the Maidan crowd. Track how the crisis in Ukraine unfolded . One of the main opposition leaders, Vitali Klitschko, took the stage a short time later. He got a notably frostier reception, contending that the government was trying to divide the protesters, before walking off to a handful of jeers. Later, a protester -- not a leader, not part of any political group, just an ordinary Ukrainian he insisted -- expressed disappointment with the deal and proposed that action should be taken if  President Viktor Yanukovych doesn't resign by 10 a.m. Saturday. Another protester, Viola Danis, said simply the deal is ""not enough."" ""This agreement does not pay for the life of my friend and the lives of the Ukrainian people,"" she said. As the crisis brewed in Kiev, a senior U.S. State Department official -- who talked to reporters on condition of not being identified and who had just been on the phone with Ukraine's foreign minister -- said that Yanukovych had gone to Kharkiv, Ukraine's second's largest city, for a meeting. The same official characterized such travel to eastern Ukraine by the President as ""not unusual."" While the government revolves around Yanukovych, there is not a single face of the opposition. Its demonstrators have strong and varying opinions about what they'd accept -- and what they'd be willing to do if these standards aren't met. Thus, while there is an apparent truce, there's not peace in the Ukraine. Uncertainty, anger and anxiety still predominating, helping to paralyze parts of this Eastern European nation. ""It's not possible to work in this environment, not to study, (not) to do nothing,"" said another protester by the name of Alexei. ""Basically everything has stopped and we're waiting for this situation to resolve. And it's really exhausting."" Deal calls for cutting powers, end to occupation . Friday was a day of action -- but unlike on Tuesday and Thursday, thankfully, the action happened in meeting rooms and Parliament, rather than in pitched battles on the streets. The first, biggest announcement on this front was the landmark agreement calling for cutting the president's power and rolling back the Constitution to what it had been in 2004. According to a draft posted on the German Foreign Office's website, further constitutional reforms must be completed by September. ""Good compromise for Ukraine. Gives peace a chance. Opens the way to reform and to Europe,"" Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said via Twitter. The deal also requires presidential elections ""as soon as the new Constitution is adopted but no later than December 2014."" And there will be an investigation -- conducted by government authorities, opposition figures and European Council representatives -- into the violence. By then, security forces should've long ago stepped back from a"" confrontational posture"" with permission to use force only to protect pubic buildings, per the agreement. And within 48 hours, protesters should have turned in their illegal weapons and withdrawn from streets and public buildings. But will they? In a conversation urging a protest leader to accept the deal that was overheard by ITN/ITV, Sikorski pleaded, ""If you don't support this, you'll have martial law, you'll have the army. You will all be dead."" The U.S. State Department official acknowledged the agreement is ""a very tough sell"" for many seething opposition activists, and called the deal ""very, very fragile."" Speaking to CNN, Klitschko said he's listening to his side's dissenters and still pushing to maintain pressure on Yanukovych -- but not through violence. ""I tell everybody it is very important ... not to be involved in the war,"" said Klitschko, who called ensuring that the country doesn't ""split"" as a top priority. ""(It's) also very important to find a peaceful way to be the winner."" Parliament acts to free opposition leader . Hours after that deal was signed, Ukraine's Parliament, the Rada, moved quickly to pass a series of measures seemingly in line with protesters' demands. The first order of business was to fulfill the first requirement of the agreement -- passing a law to roll back the country's constitution to an earlier version that limits the President's powers. Other bills called for the dismissal of the nation's interior minister and release of Yulia Tymoshenko, a former prime minister who earlier was a hero of the country's 2004 revolution, and who is a powerful symbol to the opposition. A year after Tymoshenko lost the 2010 presidential election to Yanukovych and became his fiercest opponent, Ukrainian prosecutors charged her with signing overpriced gas deals with Russian state-owned energy provider Gazprom. She was convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison at a trial she repeatedly called a farce overseen by a judge she called Yanukovych's  ""stooge."" International observers criticized her trial as being a politically motivated sham. Even with parliament's action, Tymoshenko's freedom was not expected to be immediate: A court must now act to free her, and other charges pending against her remain in place. Violence erupts . This wave of unrest began in November, amid anger about Yanukovych's decision to scrap a European Union-oriented trade deal and turn toward Russia. Russia, which has offered to lend money to cash-strapped Ukraine in a deal worth billions of dollars and to lower its gas prices, has put pressure on Yanukovych to crack down on demonstrators. Western leaders, who have offered Ukraine a more long-term aid package requiring economic modernization, urged the President to show restraint, open up the government to the opposition and let the democratic process work out. Yet, fairly soon, it became clear that the discord wasn't just about Ukraine's ties to Europe or Russia, but about larger issues such as corruption and control. The opposition called Yanukovych heavy-handed, with Klitschko and others saying protesters wouldn't leave Maidan until the president resigns. This tension boiled over Tuesday, when security forces waded into a Kiev crowd with water cannons, stun grenades, nightsticks and armored personnel carriers. At least 26 people -- protesters and police alike -- were killed. Late Wednesday, the government announced it and opposition leaders agreed to a truce and to start talks aimed at a longer-term solution. But it didn't last, collapsing in unprecedented gore in Kiev and unrest elsewhere in the Ukraine. Some protesters in the capital appeared to be armed, while men wearing what looked like government uniforms fired what appeared to be automatic weapons and, in at least one case, a sniper rifle. The government later confirmed its police fired at protesters, explaining they did so to protect unarmed officers. The death toll was far more uneven than on Tuesday: While authorities said three more police died, protesters said more than 100 of their own had been killed. The fresh blood sparked outrage among Western governments, several of which pushed sanctions against those responsible. Even after Friday's deal was announced, demonstrators went to graphic lengths to remember the dead -- bringing coffins onto their stage in Independence Square. Pavel, a demonstrator who identified himself only by his first name, said he'd helped carry away some of those shot Thursday, and he insisted he won't forget, nor will he give up. ""As long as (Yanukovych) is president,"" he said, ""the movement will continue.""

"NATO's top military commander expressed concern Sunday about the buildup of Russian forces on Ukraine's border, as Moscow's forces consolidated their control of Crimea over the weekend. Supreme Allied Commander Europe Gen. Philip Breedlove said Russia had a large force on Ukraine's eastern border and that he was worried it could pose a threat to Moldova's separatist Trans-Dniester region. ""The (Russian) force that is at the Ukrainian border now to the east is very, very sizable and very, very ready,"" Breedlove, a U.S. Air Force general, said. ""There is absolutely sufficient force postured on the eastern border of Ukraine to run to Trans-Dniester if the decision was made to do that, and that is very worrisome."" Russia said its forces complied with international agreements.  Moscow annexed Crimea following a controversial snap referendum in the autonomous region last week that produced an overwhelming majority of votes in favor of leaving Ukraine to join Russia. ""Russia is acting much more like an adversary than a partner,"" Breedlove said, speaking at an event held in Brussels, Belgium, by the German Marshall Fund think tank. Other officials expressed concern too. ""It's deeply concerning to see the Russian troop buildup along the border. It creates the potential for incidents, for instability,"" Tony Blinken, White House deputy national security adviser, told CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""It's likely that what they are trying to do is intimidate the Ukrainians. It's possible that they are preparing to move in."" Pro-Russia demonstrations planned . Pro-Russia demonstrations were planned for Sunday in Ukrainian cities outside Crimea, a Black Sea peninsula. The shows of favor for Moscow were scheduled for cities in Ukraine's south and east, where there are many ethnic Russians. On Saturday, six Russian special forces armored personnel carriers broke through the gates of Belbek air base, firing warning shots into the air, a spokesman for Ukraine's Ministry of Defense in Crimea told CNN. One journalist was injured in the attack, said Vladislav Seleznev. In a separate incident, pro-Russian self-defense forces stormed the Novofederoskoe military base, also in Crimea, taking control of it, a Ukraine Defense Ministry spokesman said. Seleznev also said that Crimean self-defense forces and Russian special forces took a Ukrainian ship, the Slavutych. The ship was captured ""after a two-hour assault,"" he said, though the Ukrainian ship's crew members came ashore and didn't suffer any injuries. Ukrainian forces on the Novofederoskoe base threw smoke bombs during the incident and retreated to the base's headquarters, Seleznev said in a Facebook posting. The base's aviation brigade then sang the Ukrainian national anthem, lowered the Ukrainian flag and left the base, he said. The White House urged Russia to open talks with the Ukrainian government. But in a statement, it also held the Russian military directly responsible for any casualties inflicted on Ukrainian military members -- whether from regular Russian troops or militias not wearing insignias. Crimea remarries -- but that divorce will be messy . International monitors . The incidents occurred as international observers were set to arrive in Ukraine to monitor the security and human rights situation, in a posting expected to last at least six months. But they will not enter the contested region of Crimea, a statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry said, because this ""became part of Russia."" The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe will eventually deploy a total of 100 observers throughout Ukraine in hopes of ""reducing tensions and fostering peace, stability and security."" They will also check that the rights of ethnic minorities are being protected. The OSCE may widen the mission to include 400 more monitors, and extend it for a second six-month period if requested by the Kiev government. Russia, which is one of the OSCE's 57 member states, approved the mission, according to state-run Russian news agency RIA Novosti. Russia's Foreign Ministry said it hoped the observers' work would stop nationalist extremists, who Moscow says have a strong influence on Kiev's government, and protect linguistic rights. Many Ukrainians speak Russian as their native language. Russia has previously said it reserves the right to enter Ukrainian territory to protect ethnic Russians from what it says is a threat from ultranationalists and fascists. Meanwhile, European leaders have demanded that independent monitors be granted access to the Crimean Peninsula. OSCE monitors made multiple attempts to enter Crimea during the height of the crisis, when pro-Russian militias took control of the region. But armed men at the borders turned them back. Russia sanctions: EU should leave trade alone . Claims on Crimea . Ukraine, the United States and other Western powers maintain Crimea is still a part of Ukraine. ""We must not allow a new division of Europe,"" German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Saturday in Kiev, where he met with with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk and acting President Oleksandr Turchynov. Russia insists its actions are legitimate. Crimea had belonged to Russia until 1954, when it was given to Ukraine. The region also has a majority ethnic Russian population and other long historic ties to Russia. Russia's Black Sea Fleet is based in the Crimean city of Sevastopol, making it strategically important to Moscow. Moscow has doggedly pursued its own course, even as Western leaders have denounced its actions as violations of Ukraine's sovereignty and a breach of international law. U.S. President Barack Obama plans to meet with leaders of the G7 group of industrialized nations this week to discuss Ukraine. Russia has been excluded from the talks on the sidelines of a nuclear summit in the Netherlands. A planned EU-Russia summit has also been canceled, as the West seeks to increase Moscow's isolation over its actions in Ukraine. EU leaders imposed a new round of sanctions against 12 individuals last week, bringing the total number of people facing EU asset freezes and travel bans to 33. The United States announced its own new round of sanctions against 20 individuals and a bank which U.S. officials say is linked to Putin and senior Russian officials. Washington had already announced sanctions on 11 individuals. ""What we've seen the President do in recent weeks, and what we'll see him do this week, is bring the world together in support of Ukraine, to isolate Russia for its actions ... and reassure our partners and allies in NATO and Europe,"" Blinken said.

"The Supreme Court unanimously ruled on Thursday that human genes cannot be patented. But in something of a compromise, all nine justices said while the naturally occurring isolated biological material itself is not patentable, a synthetic version of the gene material may be patented. Legal and medical experts believe the decision will have a lasting impact on genetic testing, likely making varieties more widely available and more affordable. The overriding legal question addressed was whether ""products of nature"" can be treated the same as ""human-made"" inventions, allowing them to be held as the exclusive intellectual property of individuals and companies. The broader issue involved 21st century conflicts over cutting-edge medical science, the power of business and individual legal rights, and how their convergence might influcence decisionmaking over how people and medicine manage the prospect and reality of certain diseases, like cancer. The issue has deeply divided the scientific and business communities. But it was a blockbuster celebrity, actress Angelina Jolie who brought it to the public in announcing last month that she underwent a double mastectomy following a genetic test. The Supreme Court case involves Myriad Genetics, a Utah-based company that was sued over its claim of patents relating to two types of biological material that it identified -- BRCA1 and BRCA2, whose mutations are linked to increased hereditary risk for breast and ovarian cancer. Since Myriad owns the patent on breast cancer genes, it was the only company that could perform tests for potential abnormalities. It says 1 million patients have benefited from its ""BRAC Analysis"" technology, and that about 250,000 such tests are performed yearly. An initial test catches most problems, but the company also offers a second called BART to detect the rest, a diagnostic that can cost several thousand dollars. Jolie had Myriad's breast cancer test. Plaintiffs and testing . Among those challenging the Myriad patents were sisters Eileen Kelly and Kathleen Maxian. Kelly was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 40. The initial BRCA test proved negative, meaning her family members were not likely at risk. But Maxian later developed ovarian cancer. The second BART testing proved positive, meaning the siblings carried the cancer-causing mutation all along. Money was not an issue for them, but Kelly and Maxian, along with a coalition of physician groups and genetic counselors say Myriad has not made the BART tests widely available for patients without a strong family history of these kinds of cancers. Breast cancer survivor Lisbeth Ceriani was another plaintiff. She faced having to pay thousands for Myriad's test to see if she had a mutation for ovarian cancer. Because of cost, she waited 18 months before she could afford it, learning she carried a mutation, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented plaintiffs. All sides agree the science of isolating the building blocks of life is no easy task. Myriad has said it has spent several years and hundreds of millions of dollars in its research. But the issue of patenting has divided the scientific and business communities. A history of patent protection . In the past 31 years, 20 percent of the human genome has been protected under U.S. patents. On one side of the Myriad case, scientists and companies argued patents encourage medical innovation and investment that saves lives. On the other, patient rights groups and civil libertarians countered the patent holders were ""holding hostage"" the diagnostic care and access of information available to high-risk patients. Outside the court during oral arguments in April, several protesters held signs, such as ""Your corporate greed is killing my friends"" and ""My genes are not property."" The patent system was created more than two centuries ago with a dual purpose. One is to offer temporary financial incentives for those at the ground floor of innovative products like the combustible engine and the X-ray machine. The second is to ensure one company does not hold a lifetime monopoly that might discourage competition and consumer affordability. All patent submissions rely on a complex reading of applicable laws, distinguishing between abstract ideas and principles, and more tangible scientific discoveries and principles. The Supreme Court ruling . The Supreme Court has long allowed patent protection for the creation of a new process or use for natural products. Whether ""isolating"" or ""extracting"" genes themselves qualifies for such protection became the central argument. The justices took the position offered by the Obama administration -- DNA itself is not patentable but so-called ""cDNA"" can be. Complementary DNA is artificially synthesized from the genetic template, and engineered to produce gene clones. Use of this protein-isolating procedure, known as ""tagging,"" is especially important in mapping and cataloguing the vast human genome. ""Genes and the information they encode are not patent-eligible under [federal law] simply because they have been isolated from the surrounding genetic material,"" said Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote the 9-0 court opinion. ""Myriad did not create anything,"" said Thomas. ""To be sure, it found an important and useful gene, but separating that gene from its surrounding genetic material is not an act of invention."" But Thomas said, ""cDNA does not present the same obstacles to patentability as naturally occurring, isolated DNA segments."" See also: Supreme Court backs DNA swab after arrest . Reaction to the decision . The American Civil Liberties Union said the decision represents a major shift in patent law and overturns established policy. ""Today, the court struck down a major barrier to patient care and medical innovation,"" said Sandra Park, senior staff attorney with the ACLU Women's Rights Project. ""Myriad did not invent the BRCA genes and should not control them. Because of this ruling, patients will have greater access to genetic testing and scientists can engage in research on these genes without fear of being sued."" Dr. Harry Ostrer, a professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and director of genetic and genomic testing at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, said the decision will not undermine the genetically engineered drug industry and expects the costs of tests to fall. ""I'm thrilled. We can offer BRCA 1 and 2 testing to low-income women without concerns about how it will be paid for,"" he said. Jolie also hoped for a meaningful impact. ""I hope that this ruling will lead to more women at risk of breast cancer being able to get access to gene testing and to take control of their lives, not just in the U.S. but around the world -- whatever their means and whatever their background,"" she said. Peter D. Meldrum, president and chief executive officer of Myriad, said in a statement  the company believed the court ""appropriately upheld our claims on cDNA"" The ruling, he added ""underscored the patent eligibility of our method claims, ensuring strong intellectual property protection for our BRACAnalysis test moving forward."" Investors in Myriad were pleased with the ruling with the stock soaring as much as 9% before settling back but still higher. The case is Association for Molecular Pathology v.

"Medical examiners have positively identified the body of the renegade former Los Angeles police officer Christopher Dorner, the man authorities say killed four people and wounded three others in a vendetta against his old comrades. That announcement from the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department came two days after a shootout, standoff and fire at a cabin in the mountains east of Los Angeles. Dorner's remains were identified through dental records during an autopsy, the department said. The charred remains of a man believed to be Dorner were found in the burned cabin late Tuesday. The cause of death was not released with the identification. Dorner was fired from the Los Angeles Police Department in 2009 for falsely accusing his training officer of kicking a subdued suspect. After unsuccessfully challenging his dismissal in court, police say, he launched a campaign of guerrilla warfare against the LAPD, targeting numerous officers involved in his case and their families. Former girlfriend: Dorner was stressed out . Dorner was cornered and died Tuesday afternoon in the San Bernardino Mountains, about 100 miles east of the city he had once sworn to protect and serve. The 33-year-old former Navy officer holed up in the cabin after a shootout with law enforcement that left a sheriff's deputy dead and another wounded, San Bernardino Sheriff John McMahon said. The cabin caught fire when police shot tear gas canisters into it, McMahon told reporters Wednesday. Although the canisters included pyrotechnic tear gas, which generates heat, ""We did not intentionally burn down that cabin to get Mr. Dorner out,"" he said. The city of Los Angeles and other communities in southern California had issued a $1 million reward for information leading to Dorner's capture and conviction. What to do with that reward was under discussion Thursday, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and LAPD Chief Charlie Beck said. ""More than 20 jurisdictions and entities are involved in this reward, so all of them will be coming together to collectively determine whether any individual or individuals qualify for it,'"" they said in a joint statement. ""Our personal hope is that the reward will be distributed, but we must follow the rules and respect the procedures of each entity."" Ex-LAPD cop gains sympathizers on social media . Dorner's mother, Nancy Dorner, expressed condolences for the victims in a statement given to Robin Sax at Fox 11 Los Angeles. ""It is with great sadness and heavy hearts that we express our deepest sympathies and condolences to anyone that suffered losses or injuries resulting from Christopher's actions.  We do not condone Christopher's actions. The family has no further comments and ask that our privacy be respected during this difficult time."" Dorner was first named a suspect in two shooting deaths on February 3: Monica Quan, the daughter of his police union representative, and her fiance, Keith Lawrence. Police say he then killed Michael Crain, a police officer in suburban Riverside, and wounded Crain's partner in an ambush on their patrol car February 7. The partner, Officer Andrew Tachias, was in stable condition at a local hospital, Riverside police said. They say Dorner also wounded an LAPD officer who chased him into nearby Corona. In addition, LAPD officers guarding one of Dorner's targets in suburban Torrance opened fire on a pickup truck that resembled Dorner's, wounding two women inside. Beck called the shooting ""tragic"" and ""horrific."" In a manifesto announcing his planned rampage, Dorner said nothing had changed in the LAPD since its scandals of the 1990s, the Rodney King beating and the Rampart police corruption case. Those allegations have struck a chord with some who say that, despite the four killings, Dorner was seeking justice. Shadowed by that history, Beck announced Saturday that the department would re-examine its proceedings against Dorner. The review is ""not to appease a murderer,"" but ""to reassure the public that their police department is transparent and fair in all things we do,"" he said.","Christoper Dorner's mother expresses condolences, asks for privacy .

Amazon Prime is Amazon's $79-a-year membership that includes free two-day shipping and access to over 13,000 streaming movies and TV shows. The company pushes the service hard to new Kindle Fire owners, automatically giving them a free month when they activate their new tablet. Amazon knows the accessibility of good, current video content is an important selling point for Kindle tablets. Earlier in the week, Amazon announced a new licensing deal with cable channel Epix that gives Amazon Prime members free access to 2,000 new movies, including mega-hits like ""The Avengers"" and ""The Hunger Games."" A recent partnership with NBCUniversal adds seasons of recent and popular TV shows to the roster, including ""Parks and Recreation,"" ""Parenthood"" and ""Battlestar Galactica."" The Amazon Instant offerings are just a small chunk of what's available for purchase in the Amazon store. Netflix . The new versions of the Kindle Fire look like a boost for Netflix fans. The Netflix app was one of the first on the Kindle Fire, but it has struggled with streaming speed and quality issues. The beefed up processor power on the new Kindle Fire should fix that and make viewing movies on Netflix a more enjoyable experience. The Netflix app is free and a Netflix streaming-only subscription is $7.99 a month, which comes out to almost $96 a year, a bit more than Amazon Prime costs. However, Netflix has a larger library of available movies and TV shows and a sizable number of people already paying for memberships. HBO Go . Already have cable and want to watch your favorite HBO shows on a tablet? HBO Go is a great app for watching addictive shows like ""Boardwalk Empire,"" ""Game of Thrones"" and ""True Blood,"" but there is no online-only subscription option. HBO Go is only for existing HBO subscribers on participating cable providers. Since HBO owns all its own content, the app is thorough, offering all episodes of popular shows -- 1,400 shows in total, according to HBO. Hulu Plus . This is another service priced at the $7.99-a-month sweet spot. Hulu Plus is one of the better options for TV addicts who want to watch episodes of popular shows soon after they air. Current offerings include ""The Office,"" ""The Colbert Report,"" ""Gossip Girl"" and ""House."" Older shows also are available in their entirety for binge-watching, including ""The X-Files,"" ""Arrested Development"" and ""Law & Order: SVU."" (CW fans can download the free CW app instead and get their ""Vampire Diaries"" fix with some ads on the side.) Hulu Plus also has a small collection of movies from Miramax and the Criterion Collection. There are a few drawbacks. Even though you're paying for the service, there are still some ads, which the company says are necessary because of the high price of fresh TV. Also, not all Hulu Plus shows can be viewed on the Kindle Fire due to some PC-only licensing agreements the company made. Before signing up, check to see that the shows you want to watch are available for your device. Freedi YouTube Downloader . All these subscription services can add up, especially when you start throwing in additional charges for shows and movies purchased or rented. Sometimes you just want to flip through free videos on YouTube. The Freedi app allows you to convert YouTube videos into MP4 files and save them to your Kindle Fire. You can rewatch the videos anytime you like, even when there's no Internet connection. It's a great option for car trips. Revision 3 . This San Francisco-based Internet TV network has a large selection of shows that you've probably never heard of but should check out. The company was purchased by the Discovery Channel in May and has a hit Kindle Fire app. Get your geek on with episodes of  shows such as ""Tekzilla,"" ""Geek Beat TV"" and ""Film Riot."" The app and show are free, and the videos high quality.","New versions of Kindle Fire beefed up for video with faster processors and better screens .
Easy to buy videos from Amazon on Kindle, but you can go through other services .
Nexflix may be an Amazon competitor, but its app is a great fit for the Kindle Fire ."
"(CNN) -- Texas Gov. Rick Perry has removed a fourth member of a state commission charged with investigating claims that an innocent man may have been executed, his office said. A family photo shows Cameron Todd Willingham with his wife, Stacy, and daughters Kameron, Amber and Karmon. The Texas governor has now replaced all of the four members that, under law, he is allowed to appoint to the commission. The remaining five members are appointed by the state's lieutenant governor and attorney general. Perry's critics say his actions are politically motivated, a charge he denies. The investigation into claims that faulty evidence led Texas to execute an innocent man in 2004 was at a ""crucial point"" when the shakeup occurred, one of the replaced members said. The commission was to hear from the author of a scathing report in the case of the executed man, Cameron Todd Willingham, when Perry announced on September 30 that he would replace three members. The session was postponed indefinitely because of the new appointments, and Perry's critics accused him of trying to quash the Willingham probe. ""I think people are making a lot of this issue,"" Perry said earlier. Commissioner Alan Levy was replaced by John Bradley, a district attorney who was also named commission chairman. Aliece Watts was replaced by Norma Farley, chief forensic pathologist for Hidalgo and Cameron counties. Perry said at the time the replacements were ""pretty normal protocol."" In a statement Thursday, Perry's office said he had appointed attorney Lance Evans of Fort Worth to replace former commission chairman Samuel Bassett of Austin, and that Randall Frost of Boerne, chief medical examiner for Bexar County, would replace commissioner Sridhar Natarajan. ""If you've got a whole new investigation going forward, it makes a lot more sense to put the new people in now and let them start the full process, rather than bring people in there for a short period of time and then replace them,"" Perry said two weeks ago. ""I think it makes a whole lot more sense to make a change now than to make a change later."" But the Forensic Science Commission began investigating the Willingham case in 2008, hiring Maryland fire investigation expert Craig Beyler to examine the evidence used to convince a jury the fire that killed Willingham's three daughters was deliberately set. Levy said at the time of his replacement he had told Perry's office ""that it would be disruptive to make the new appointments right now."" ""The commission was at a crucial point in the investigation,"" he told CNN. Asked about the future of the Willingham investigation, he said, ""I don't know if it will ever be heard."" Both Levy and Bassett said they had asked to remain on the board. Evans declined to give an opinion on the Willingham controversy when contacted by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram for a story Friday, saying all he knows on the matter is what he's read in the newspaper. ""Because I haven't had involvement with the commission, I can't really comment on what's been going on in the commission in the past,"" he said. ""I will work very hard to make sure the duties of the commission ... as given by the Texas Legislature are carried out."" Beyler's report -- the first commissioned by a state agency -- is the latest of three to conclude that arson was not the likely cause of the 1991 fire. Death-penalty opponents say an impartial review of Willingham case could lead to an unprecedented admission -- that the state executed an innocent man. The Beyler report concluded that the ruling of arson at the heart of Willingham's conviction ""could not be sustained"" by modern science or the standards of the time. Perry, who faces a Republican primary challenge in his bid for a third term next year, refused to issue a last-minute stay of execution for Willingham in 2004 and has said he remains confident that Willingham was guilty. So have authorities in Corsicana, south of Dallas, who prosecuted Willingham in his daughters' deaths. Asked earlier whether the governor wants to see the Willingham investigation go forward, Perry spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger told CNN, ""That's a decision of the commission."" However, the first replacements raised concern among Willingham's relatives, who worked to avert his execution and to clear his name after his death. ""It sounds like someone made Governor Perry mad,"" his stepmother, Eugena Willingham, said after hearing the news during an interview with CNN at her home in Ardmore, Oklahoma. ""I think it's going to delay things,"" she added. ""It makes me wonder why."" Neither Bassett nor Levy would say whether they believed political considerations were behind their replacement, though Bassett said in a written statement that the investigation should not be dropped ""because there might be political ramifications."" Bradley told CNN at the time of his appointment he did not believe it was meant to stall the Willingham probe. ""People tend to read into these things the kind of preconceived notions they come to these issues with,"" Bradley said. ""They're not going to change those positions overnight. They're going to watch how the commission does its work."" He said if he does his job right, the commission will ""probably satisfy most of those people."" CNN's Matt Smith contributed to this report.","Commission was investigating charges that innocent man was executed .

"President Barack Obama's upcoming budget plan, which according to senior administration officials will include proposed changes to Social Security and Medicare plus some new tax increases in an effort for the president to reach a deal with Republicans on deficit reduction, quickly drew criticism from liberal groups on Friday. The progressive group MoveOn.org labeled the president's proposed changes to Social Security as ""unconscionable"" and Democracy for America called the cuts ""profoundly disturbing."" ""Millions of MoveOn members did not work night and day to put President Obama into office so that he could propose policies that would hurt some of our most vulnerable people,"" read a statement from Anna Galland, executive director of the group. Boehner blasts reported Obama budget as 'wrong direction' The budget will include an offer Obama made to House Speaker John Boehner in December, officials said. That proposal included $400 billion in savings to Medicare over 10 years. Obama follows up on past call to bolster U.S. infrastructure . ""The president's budget to be presented on Wednesday will show how we can invest in the things we need to grow our economy, create jobs and strengthen the middle class while further reducing the deficit in a balanced way,"" a senior administration official said. But Boehner said he and the president were never able to reach an agreement because Obama's ""offers never lived up to his rhetoric,"" a reality he said still exists. ""When the president visited the Capitol last month, House Republicans stated a desire to find common ground and urged him not to make savings we agree upon conditional on another round of tax increases. If reports are accurate, the president has not heeded that call,"" Boehner said in a statement. For Social Security, Obama plans to propose a switch to a key Republican request called ""chained CPI,"" which is an inflation formula. Obama seeks $100m to unlock mysteries of the brain . Proponents say chained CPI is a more accurate way to measure inflation than the way it's done now, which they say overstates growth in consumer prices. Some critics have said chained CPI is not a better way to measure inflation for Social Security recipients, because they spend so much on health care, which rises faster than inflation. The geeky debt fix that might work . Other highlights: . - The new budget would lead to $1.8 trillion in savings in 10 years and replace the forced budget cuts that took effect on March 1, also known as the sequester. - The budget includes funding for initiatives that Obama outlined in his State of the Union address, including universal access to prekindergarten education. That move would be paid for by increases to cigarette taxes. So far, forced spending cuts not as bad as advertised . -The plan would also close a current loophole that allows people to collect disability and unemployment benefits at the same time, a move that could create savings for the government, officials said. Obama's budget was due in February. Previously White House officials would only say the budget was coming the week of April 8, without revealing a specific date. Republicans were sharply critical of the delay, which came after protracted negotiations over spending cuts and tax rates.

"A woman who says a female teacher from middle school sexually abused her for years decided to confront the teacher -- and post video of the exchange on YouTube. Within hours, the educator resigned from her job at another school in California. Police launched an investigation. And the former student, who once felt powerless, now says she feels vindicated knowing the ex-teacher is no longer working with children. The video . The former student, who calls herself ""Jamie,"" said the abuse started when she was 12 years old. ""I am 28 years old and have been waiting years to get up enough courage to report a teacher for sexually abusing me for years,"" Jamie's caption on her YouTube video states. ""When I finally got up enough courage to report her, I found out that the statute of limitations was up and she will never have to pay for the things that she did to me."" So she decided to expose the teacher on the Internet. ""I decided I'm going to call her to get some answers from her,"" Jamie said to a camera in her home. After the woman identified as the teacher picked up the phone, Jamie asked, ""So what happens when a student comes in and says that they're having (a) sexual relationship with a teacher?"" ""I would involve law enforcement,"" the woman said. ""So how is that any different from what you did"" years ago, Jamie said. ""It's not,"" the woman replied. ""Do you realize that you brainwashed me, and you manipulated me, and that what you did was wrong?"" Jamie asked. ""Yes. And I regret it,"" the woman responded. ""You should be so ashamed and so disgusted with yourself,"" Jamie said, raising her voice. ""I am. I am,"" the woman said. 30 day sentence for teacher who raped his 14-year-old student . Shortly after Jamie posted the video on YouTube, she sent the link to her former teacher. The educator resigned within hours, said Jamie's attorney, David Ring. The teacher has not responded to CNN's phone and e-mail requests for comment. Police have launched an investigation into the case, but the statute of limitations may be an issue, Riverside police Lt. Guy Toussaint said. It all depends on what the investigation reveals and what crimes may have occurred. At the Alhambra Unified School District, where Jamie said the teacher most recently worked, administrators received an electronic message Friday with a YouTube link incriminating the educator, said Superintendent Laura Tellez-Gagliano. Administrators called police immediately. The woman, identified by the school district as an Alhambra High School administrator, was interviewed the same day, and she ""tendered her resignation"" at the end of the interview, Tellez-Gagliano said in a statement. No students from the Alhambra district have been identified as victims so far, and the ""Alhambra Police department will be handing this matter over to the jurisdiction of the appropriate police department,"" the district said. ""This alleged action took place in another school district, without any report prior to her employment to the Alhambra Unified School District,"" the superintendent said. The Alhambra Police Department said it notified Riverside police because the reported abuse allegedly took place in Riverside. ""At this time in the investigation, there have been no identified crimes involving the suspect that have occurred in Alhambra,"" APD said in a statement. Former sixth-grade teacher admits sex with boy . Why now? Now that she's a mother, Jamie said she wanted to make sure the teacher couldn't work with children again. ""The reason why I wanted to do this was to expose her for what she really was and to protect other kids, because she shouldn't be around anyone's kids,"" Jamie told reporters Monday. ""It took a lot for me to come forward, but I kept thinking about my own kids, and how I wouldn't want anything to happen to them."" Jamie said the abuse took place 'off and on"" between the ages of 12 and 18. She said she didn't come forward as a teenager because the teacher had brainwashed her. Ex-L.A. teacher sentenced to 25 years in lewdness case . ""She told me that my family didn't love me. She told me that nobody cared about me and that she was the only one that loved me and the only one that was there for me,"" Jamie said. ""She made me believe that she was my only friend, and that I could trust her."" Jamie said she didn't want a physical relationship -- but that the teacher threatened her multiple times. ""She said that she would kill herself if I ever left. And I believed that,"" Jamie said. Now, more than a decade after middle school, Jamie said she feels greater control in her life. ""In the beginning, I thought there was nothing that I could do. But after the outcome, obviously, there is something I can do.""

"The North Korean army has declared invalid the armistice agreement that ended the Korean War in 1953, the official newspaper of the country's ruling Workers' Party said Monday. Since last week, North Korea had been threatening to scrap the armistice after the U.N. Security Council passed tougher sanctions against it in response to its February 12 nuclear test. On Monday, the Rodong Sinmun newspaper reported that the Supreme Command of North Korea's army had done so. ""The U.S. has reduced the armistice agreement to a dead paper,"" the newspaper said. North Korea also cut off direct phone links with South Korea at the inter-Korean border village of Panmunjom, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. The phone line was the emergency link for quick, two-way communication between the two sides. The armistice agreement, signed in 1953, ended the three-year war between North and South Korea in a truce. Since the two sides remain technically at war, it remains to be seen whether the invalidation means that either side can resume hostilities. What's in a threat? A look at North Korea's escalating rhetoric -- and actions . The Rodong Sinmun reported the Supreme Command saying that it can now make a ""strike of justice at any target anytime, not bound to the armistice agreement and achieve the national reunification, the cherished desire of the Korean nation."" However, the North has nullified the agreement on several occasions in the past. A look back at the history of the armistice. What is the armistice agreement? It is the agreement that ended the war between North and South Korea. It is a truce, rather than a peace treaty. Has the North ended the armistice before? Yes. In 2003, Pyonyang's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) announced that it may have ""no option"" but to stop honoring the armistice because of the United State's ""persistent war moves."" In 2009, North Korea said its military would no longer be bound by the agreement because South Korea was joining a U.S.-led anti-proliferation plan. Part of the reason for the latest move are the joint exercises between the United States and South Korea. A bigger reason is tougher sanctions passed in the U.N. Security Council against North Korea in response to its nuclear test on February 12. Pyongyang carried out its third nuclear test, despite international condemnation. What caused the division of Korea? For most of the first half of the 20th century, Japan controlled the Korean peninsula as its colony. By the end of the World War II as Japan neared defeat, the allies agreed to an independent Korea. The United States and Soviet Union divided postwar occupation of Korea along the 38th parallel and the two sides were ideologically opposite. Pyongyang scraps armistice amid heightened saber rattling . Why did war break out? On June 25, 1950, a surprise attack by North Korean soldiers who crossed the 38th parallel easily overwhelmed South Korean forces. The United States leapt to the defense of the South. As South Korean, U.S. and U.N. forces fought back and gained ground into North Korea, Chinese forces joined the war on the North's side later that year. To this day, China remains a crucial ally of North Korea and the U.S. of South Korea. What toll did the war take? The toll of the war included about 1.2 million deaths in South Korea, 1 million deaths in North Korea, 36,500 deaths for U.S. troops and 600,000 deaths for Chinese soldiers. What are the lasting effects of the war? The brutal war separated thousands of families, and created the world's most heavily fortified border. It also drew the alliances that exist today. When was the armistice signed? The armistice was signed in July 1953. What were its terms? The terms of the armistice included the creation of the Demilitarized Zone, aheavily fortified 155-mile long (250 kilometers) 2.5-mile wide line separating the two countries. Why the Korean War still matters . How have relations between the North and South been since then? In the last 60 years, diplomacy between North and South has zigzagged from conciliatory to bellicose. During more friendly times, the two countries arranged emotional family reunions for those separated by the war in 2000, their leaders shook hands in a 2007 Pyongyang summit and ran freight trains across the border. But periods of rapprochement have been counterpointed by flareups. More recently, the North shelled the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong leaving two marines and two civilians dead. Pyongyang claimed Seoul provoked the 2010 attack by holding a military drill off their shared coast in the Yellow Sea. That same year, North Korea was also accused of sinking a South Korean warship, killing more than 40 sailors. Without an armistice, what can happen? The two sides can resume hostilities if they so choose. What are the risks of a military clash? A military clash could risk drawing in the United States, which has about 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea as part of the security alliance between the two countries.

"Federal prosecutors were preparing charges Sunday against the surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings even as authorities said they believed he and his brother were allegedly preparing to carry out more attacks when their plans were disrupted. Authorities have not said publicly what charges will be filed against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, but a Justice Department official, who has been briefed on the case, told CNN he will face federal terrorism charges and possibly state murder charges. Tsarnaev, 19, remains in serious but stable condition with a gunshot wound to the side of the neck, a federal law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Sunday. It is unclear whether Tsarnaev was wounded during his capture or an earlier shootout with police that left his older brother -- the other man wanted in the bombings -- dead, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""He's not in a condition to be interrogated at this time,"" Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis told reporters at a news conference on Sunday afternoon. However, another senior federal official who has been briefed on the investigation told CNN's Fran Townsend that Tsarnaev has communicated in writing with officials several times. Even as prosecutors worked to put together a case against Tsarnaev, Davis said he believed the brothers were planning another attack before a shootout with police disrupted their plans. ""We have reason to believe, based upon the evidence that was found at the scene -- the explosions, the explosive ordnance that was unexploded and the fire power -- that they were going to attack other individuals,"" Davis said Sunday on CBS News' ""Face the Nation."" He did not say whether investigators had identified a specific target. Authorities believe the brothers bought bomb components locally, but their guns came from elsewhere, another federal law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. The official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the case, said authorities are trying to trace the guns. Tsarnaev was captured Friday night, days after he and his brother allegedly planted two bombs near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. The blasts killed three people and wounded more than 170 others. Authorities virtually shut down Boston and some of its suburbs as part of a manhunt after authorities say the brothers went on a rampage late Thursday and early Friday. The brothers allegedly hurled explosives at police after killing Massachusetts Institute of Technology police Officer Sean Collier and hijacking a car. What's next for the suspect? There are questions about whether Tsarnaev will ever be able to talk given the nature of his wound, Sen. Dan Coats, R-Indiana, said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" ""It doesn't mean he can't communicate, but right now I think he's in a condition where we can't get any information from him at all,"" said Coats, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The government has invoked the public safety exception in the case, a designation that allows investigators to question Tsarnaev without reading him his Miranda rights and without a lawyer present, said another Justice Department official, also speaking on condition of anonymity for the same reason. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel told reporters on a flight to Israel that he has not seen any intelligence that linked the brothers to any terrorist organization, but it was still early in the investigation. But Davis told CNN that he was confident that the brothers were ""the two major actors in the violence that occurred."" ""I told the people of Boston that they can rest easily, that the two people who were committing these vicious attacks are either dead or arrested, and I still believe that,"" he said Sunday. The sentiment was echoed by Watertown Police Chief Edward Deveau. ""From what I know right now, these two acted together and alone,"" he said. ""I think we have to be ever vigilant, and we're learning as we go along, but as far as this little cell -- this little group -- I think we got our guys."" Hints of a radical? While investigators piece together the actions of the brothers in the months and days before the marathon bombings, there appear to be hints that the elder Tsarnaev was becoming radical. The Tsarnaev family hails from the Russian republic of Chechnya and fled the brutal wars there in the 1990s. The two brothers were born in Kyrgyzstan, authorities said. Profiles of the two suspects . An FBI official said Saturday agents interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev in 2011 at the request of the Russian government. The FBI said Russia claimed he was a follower of radical Islam and a strong believer and that he had changed drastically since 2010. But a U.S. official and a law enforcement source said Sunday the Russian government's request was vague. The lack of specifics limited how much the FBI was able to investigate Tamerlan, the law enforcement official said. Tamerlan Tsarnaev apparently became increasingly radical in the last three or four years, according to an analysis of his social media accounts and the accounts of family members. But so far, there is no evidence of active association with international jihadist groups. In August 2012, soon after returning from his visit to Russia, the elder Tsarnaev created a YouTube channel with links to a number of videos. Two videos under a category labeled ""Terrorists"" were deleted. It's not clear when or by whom. A CNN analysis of the YouTube channel has established that one deleted video featured a militant named Abu Dujana, whose real name was Gadzhimurad Dolgatov. CNN has located a video clip of the footage in question. Russian security services killed Dolgatov in December during an assault on an apartment in Makhachkala, the capital of the Russian Caucasus republic of Dagestan. Dolgatov led a small group in Dagestan that had links to the main Islamist militant group in the region, Imarat Kavkaz. Older suspect in Boston bombings grew increasingly religious, analysis shows . Separately, a U.S. intelligence source told CNN that investigators are looking into whether Tsarnaev had any connections with the group, known in English as Caucasus Emirates. The source says Tsarnaev had several computer links to the group in his social media activities, and investigators are looking into the possibility that he received ""operational plans"" from this group. Rebels who call themselves Mujahideen of the Caucasus Emirate Province of Dagestan issued a statement Sunday that appeared to distance the group from the Boston bombings, saying they are not fighting the United States. ""We are at war with Russia,"" it said. The statement also said that children are never targets of the group. 'He was just relaxed' As an army of officers hunted for the suspects in Monday's marathon bombings, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev acted like any other college sophomore. He was on the campus of University of Massachusetts Dartmouth every day after the attack until late Thursday, a university official told CNN. Tsarnaev attended classes and went to the gym and dorm parties while much of Boston was at a tense standstill. On Tuesday, he and a fellow student were at the campus gym when the bombings came up in discussion. Zach Bettencourt said he expressed his shock about the attack, telling Tsarnaev that it was the type of thing you hear about in Iraq or Afghanistan, not Boston. He said Tsarnaev responded: ""Yeah, tragedies happen man. Like these things happen around the world. It's crazy."" A student at the school told The Boston Globe she saw Tsarnaev Wednesday night at a party that was attended by some of his friends from intramural soccer. ""He was just relaxed,"" she said, asking the paper not to print her name. At the dorm where Tsarnaev lived, students joked Thursday as they viewed the FBI photos of the bombing suspects on television, a senior who lived in that dorm told The Boston Globe. ""We made a joke like, that could be Dzhokhar,"" Pamala Rolon said. ""But then we thought it just couldn't be him. Dzhokhar? Never."" The campus, which was closed during the search for the bombing suspects, reopened Sunday morning. Moment of silence . Boston, meanwhile, is trying to return to semblance of normalcy with some streets and business reopening. Federal investigators on Sunday were lifting crime scene tape and barriers erected during the investigation into the bombings near the marathon's finish line on Boylston Street. People throughout Massachusetts are being urged to observe a moment of silence Monday at 2:50 p.m., exactly one week after the Boston Marathon bombings. Of those injured in the marathon bombings, 55 remain hospitalized,  including three in critical condition, according to a CNN count. Doctors, meanwhile, said Sunday that they are ""cautiously optimistic"" that a Massachusetts transit officer wounded in a shootout with the alleged Boston Marathon bombers will recover. Richard H. Donohue, 33, remains in critical condition at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, said Dr. Russell J. Nauta, a surgeon who operated on the officer. There was life before the bombings, and then life after. ""We are all scattered in the pain and horror of this week's violence,"" Boston's archbishop, Cardinal Sean O'Malley, told parishioners during Sunday services at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross. ""Some of those here were among those injured. But everyone has been affected."" He voiced what so many have been thinking: Why would anyone do this? What were the bombers thinking? It has been ""very difficult to understand what was going on in their heads,"" he said. Timeline of the bombings and manhunt .","55 people remain hospitalized from the marathon bombings .

"The State Department responded to a congressional subpoena on Friday for information relating to the Obama administration's response to the deadly terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, last year. The agency sent the House Oversight Committee 97 pages of documents, but said many had already been shared with the panel chaired by California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa and released publicly. ""We will supplement this response if we identify additional responsive documents,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement disclosing that the agency had replied to the subpoena. The Oversight panel has not been satisfied with explanations so far about how the Obama administration arrived at ""talking points"" initially drafted by the CIA that were developed to explain events around the attack last September 11 that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. A request from Congress prompted drafting of the ""talking points."" They have become a political flashpoint in a long-running battle between the administration and Republicans, who accuse it of not bolstering security before the attack, of botching the response to it and of misleading the public for political gain less than two months before the November election. The GOP suggests the administration removed specific terror references and stuck to an explanation advanced by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice in television appearances -- later proved untrue -- that the attack was the result of a spontaneous demonstration over an anti-Muslim film that was produced in the United States. The White House and its allies in Congress have said any confusion and conflicting information in the early hours and days after the assault stemmed from the ""fog of war,"" not any deliberate effort to mislead the public. The Oversight subpoena sought documents and communications from 10 current and former State Department officials that refer or relate to the ""talking points."" Psaki said the State Department spent ""countless additional hours re-reviewing"" information and provided the panel with documents ""that we have identified in searching for records up to the time of Ambassador Rice's television appearance."" She said the State Department since December has ""demonstrated an unprecedented degree of cooperation with Congress"" on the Benghazi issue by taking part in eight hearings and participating in 35 briefings for lawmakers and staff. ""We have accommodated previous requests for information from the House Oversight Committee by providing 25,000 pages of documents for their review,"" she said.","State Department turns over documents to House panel that demanded  information .

"(CNN) -- Estimates for the amount of thick sludge that gushed from a Tennessee coal plant last week have tripled to more than a billion gallons, as cleanup crews try to remove the goop from homes and railroads and halt its oozing into an adjacent river. TVA officials originally said the cleanup would take four to six weeks. Now they say they aren't sure. The sludge, a byproduct of the ash from coal combustion, was contained at a retention site at the Tennessee Valley Authority's power plant in Kingston, about 40 miles west of Knoxville. The retention wall breached early Monday, sending the sludge downhill and damaging 15 homes. All the residents were evacuated, and three homes were deemed uninhabitable, according to the TVA. TVA's initial estimate for the spill was 1.8 million cubic yards or more than 360 million gallons of sludge. By Friday, the estimate reached 5.4 million cubic yards or more than 1 billion gallons -- enough to fill 1,660 Olympic-size swimming pools. Environmental advocates say the ash contains concentrated levels of mercury and arsenic. The plant sits on a tributary of the Tennessee River called the Clinch River. At least 300 acres of land has been coated by the sludge, a bigger area than the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. A spokesman for TVA, a federal corporation and the nation's largest public power company, said the agency has never experienced a spill of this magnitude. ""There's a lot of ash there,"" spokesman John Moulton said Friday. ""We are taking this very seriously. It is a big cleanup project, and we're focused on it 24 hours a day."" Initial TVA estimates put the cleanup timeline at four to six weeks, but Moulton said the agency will no longer say how long it expects the effort to take. Environmentalists say it could take months or even years to clean up the mess. Video footage showed sludge as high as 6 feet, burying porches and garage doors. The slide also downed nearby power lines, though the TVA said power had been restored to the area. An estimated 78,000 cubic yards, or 15.7 million gallons, of sludge covered local railroad tracks and Swan Pond Road. Chris Copeland's backyard is covered with the sludge, though it didn't damage his house. ""We have a terrible mess in our backyard,"" he told CNN's ""Newsroom."" ""I can't begin to imagine how much of an effort it is going to take to clean this mess up. It is incredible how much ash, dirt, earth, trees and debris is behind our house and then covering this neighborhood."" Bulldozers and heavy machinery have been on the scene of the spill since Monday, scooping up the thick gray goop that downed power lines, trees and broke a water main, forcing a temporary boil order on residents. Footage from the Clinch River, a popular fishing site, reveals piles of dead fish on its banks. TVA said that has nothing to do with the toxicity of the sludge. ""What happened -- when you have a surge of ash, that created a wave to push the fish up and onto land,"" Moulton said. ""When the water receded, there were dead fish. They weren't killed by any toxic chemicals, they were stranded by the wave."" He noted that water quality tests from the nearby water treatment facility have shown that the water from the river intake meets federal and state guidelines for potable water. But critics of the coal operation remain concerned about the long-term effects of the spill. ""The early results are showing that it is not in the drinking water yet, but it is a fluid situation and the stuff is still not properly contained and concentrations can change over time,"" said Stephen Smith of CleanEnergy.org. He said people can still be exposed as the sludge dries and goes airborne in dust. He said the spill underscores the need for the federal Environmental Protection Agency to regulate the containment of coal ash and accused TVA of underplaying the Tennessee spill. ""You have acute problems we are dealing with today, but we'll have chronic problems for a long time,"" Smith said. ""This whole area has been devastated environmentally."" Appalachian environmentalists compare the mess to another spill eight years ago in eastern Kentucky, where the bottom of a coal sludge impoundment owned by Massey Energy broke into an abandoned underground mine, oozing more than 300 million gallons of coal waste into tributaries. The water supply for more than 25,000 residents was contaminated, and aquatic life in the area perished. It took months to clean up the spill. ""If the estimates are correct, this spill is 1½ times bigger,"" said Dave Cooper, an environmental advocate with the Mountaintop Removal Road Show, a traveling program that explains the impact of an extreme form of mining. CNN's Samira J. Simone contributed to this report.","Cleanup crew works to keep sludge from coal plant out of river .

"Texas authorities initiated the seizure of the 1,600-acre ranch where prosecutors say polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs and others sexually abused children, officials said Thursday. The Texas Department of Public Safety and the Schleicher County Sheriff's Office met Wednesday afternoon with two residents of the Yearning for Zion Ranch near Eldorado, Texas, and those occupants said eight adults live there, a DPS spokesman said Thursday. Authorities provided the residents with copies of court orders directing the state to take possession of the forfeited ranch, state officials said. ""Law enforcement personnel are working with the occupants of the ranch to take all reasonable actions to assist with their departure of the property, to preserve the property, and to successfully execute the court order,"" the state agency said. More from KSAN/KLST . The state obtained the final judgment of forfeiture on January 6, authorities said. The Attorney General's Office filed for the seizure of the property in 2012. In 2008, in response to phone calls to a family violence hot line alleging abuse and rape, police raided the ranch, and 416 children were initially removed. That figure rose to 468 after some of the mothers were found to be younger than 18. About 130 women voluntarily left the compound. The children were returned to the complex after the Texas Supreme Court ruled the state had no right to remove them and lacked evidence to show they were in imminent danger of abuse. Child protection officials said they found a ""pervasive pattern"" of sexual abuse on the ranch through forced marriages between underage girls and older men. In August 2011, a Texas jury found Jeffs guilty of sexual assault against two girls, ages 12 and 15. He is serving a life sentence. The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints openly practices polygamy on the YFZ Ranch, as well as in the twin border towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona. Critics of the sect say girls are forced into ""spiritual"" marriages with older men and sexually abused. Sect members have denied that any sexual abuse takes place. Jeffs' appeal denied, another sect leader convicted .","Texas authorities meet with two residents of the Yearning for Zion Ranch .

"For a society that regards conformity as an important value, there are surprising number of Japanese who opt for homes that defy the cookie-cutter design. Take for example, Tatsumi Terado and his wife Hanae who lives in a house with no interior walls, hardly any barriers and some ladders to get around. The young couple call their house the Ninja -- because they need to be as nimble as one to go from one room to another. ""We feel we're getting in better shape these days,"" says Hanae Terado, extolling the benefits of all the climbing around the house. ""But we never fall."" Radical design is featuring more and more in Japan's residential landscape and is a hit among the country's young generation. It is as if the compact spaces the Japanese have to live in are pushing the architects, and their clients, to think out of the box and let their whimsical ideas take off. Says Hanae Terado: ""I don't know if this is a cutting edge, but this is a house where our thoughts and inspirations take place."" Avant-garde design in Japan largely caters to middle class couples or families building a small house, not the typical clientele of bold architectural ideas elsewhere in the world. These average Japanese home owners can afford to take more risks because, unlike many of their counterparts in the West, they don't have to worry about long-term investment. ""Houses depreciate in value over 15 years after being built,"" says Tokyo-based architect Alastair Townsend, ""and on average they are demolished after 25 or 30 years, so the owner of a house doesn't need to consider what a future buyer might want. ""It gives them a lot of creative license to design a home that's an expression of their own eccentricities or lifestyle."" Open a Japanese architecture magazine or browse the Internet, and there are many examples of eccentric homes across the country, from strange polygonal structures to houses with no windows. While this conceptual Japanese architecture could be a bit impractical, these homes are becoming more like modern-art installations breathing new life into the country's cramped spaces. Some of the more quirky homes are built next to plain-looking buildings. Architect Sou Fujimoto's ""Skeleton House"" stands out in an average Tokyo neighborhood. The transparent building, which he built for a young couple, lacks in privacy but conjures a sense of open elegance. Calling the design ""kind of a tree house,"" Fujimoto says, ""We thought the whole house is like one big tree. You can jump onto one branch and the other branch to move around."" He also argues that the house fits Tokyo's character as one part of the cozy components that make up the city. ""I think it's a really, really nice collaboration because at the beginning, it was more simple, a bit more boring,"" he says. ""Then it's getting more exciting.""

"(CNN) -- Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said he will pursue a full United Nations membership bid during a speech Friday that was likely meant to both make the case for membership and manage domestic expectations. ""We are going to the United Nations to attain full membership"" from the U.N. Security Council, Abbas told an audience in Ramallah, tempering his rhetoric by adding that ""we are not going to bring independence. Let's not exaggerate. ""We will continue to negotiate,"" he said. Abbas says he wants the Palestinian territories ""to be represented in its natural borders,"" calling disputed territories inhabited by Israeli settlers ""illegal."" ""We want a seat at the United Nations, and we don't want anything more,"" Abbas said. He says Palestinian leadership does not seek to ""isolate the state of Israel, but rather isolate the policies of Israel,"" saying he will head to the United Nations headquarters in New York ""carrying an olive branch with us."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is also expected to speak next Friday at the United Nations, has said the move could complicate the peace process and further destabilize the region. ""We have been calling all along for the Palestinians to return to negotiations,"" said Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev. Regev called the issue of settlements ""a red herring"" that he says Palestinian leaders have used to avoid talks with Israel, deciding to grandstand on the international stage instead of re-engaging in peace negotiations. Hamas, the Palestinian organization that holds sway in Gaza, also was critical of Abbas on Friday, saying he is showing a willingness to negotiate and acknowledgement of Israel, which would ""deprive the Palestinian people from their right to come back to their homeland."" ""We are warning him not to go,"" said senior Hamas official Mahmoud al-Zahar. ""This is going to make more division inside the Palestinian people."" As regional pressure mounts over the prospective bid next week, U.S. diplomats have been scrambling to head off the burgeoning controversy, though some analysts suggest the decision to take the vote to the Security Council could reflect a political posturing by the Palestinian leader. Abbas concluded his speech Friday by acknowledging ""other options,"" presumably referring to his government's ability to weigh a host of decisions at the U.N. General Assembly next week, which may or may not include the full membership bid. ""As for the other options, we have not taken a decision,"" he said. While the United States has vowed to veto a full membership application, should it actually come before the U.N. Security Council next Friday, the Palestinian government could also go to the General Assembly, where only a majority vote would be needed to gain a lesser status, that of a permanent observer state, similar to the position that the Vatican currently holds. A vote in its favor would be all but assured. The Palestinians currently hold the status of a permanent observer entity. As an observer, the delegation can speak in the General Assembly but not vote. A successful vote in either body will not lead to an established ""state"" with defined borders, but would afford the Palestinian government an upgraded international status allowing them to pursue legal actions against Israel. Abbas is expected to personally submit the request for full membership. CNN's Kevin Flower contributed to this report.","NEW: Hamas warns Abbas not to go to the United Nations .

"The widow of suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev is ""doing everything she can to assist with the investigation,"" of the Boston Marathon bombing, attorney Amato DeLuca said in a statement Tuesday. Katherine Russell last saw her husband Thursday, just hours before he died in a gun battle with police, according to a source close to the family.  She was handing off her 2-year-old daughter to stay with him while she went to work, the source said. The FBI wants to interview Russell about her husband, but for now, agents only have been able to talk to her lawyer. ""She knew nothing about it at any time,"" DeLuca told CNN's Chris Lawrence, referring to the bomb plot. Russell, 24, learned through news reports that the father of her daughter was suspected in the attack, DeLuca said. ""That's my understanding."" Hearing that news devastated her, he added, saying Monday that she's ""very distraught"" and ""cries a lot."" ""The reports of involvement by her husband and brother-in-law came as an absolute shock to them all,"" DeLuca's Tuesday statement said. ""As a mother, a sister, a daughter, a wife, Katie deeply mourns the pain and loss to innocent victims -- students, law enforcement, families and our community.  In the aftermath of this tragedy, she, her daughter and her family are trying to come to terms with these events."" Timeline: A look at Tamerlan's past . ""The whole family is a mess, to put it bluntly,"" he said Monday. ""They're very distraught. They're upset. Their lives have been unalterably changed. They're upset because of what happened, the people that were injured, that were killed. It's an awful, terrible thing."" Tsarnaev's domestic violence arrest . Tsarnaev and Russell met when she was a student at Suffolk University in Boston, although it is unclear when they began dating.  The couple married on June 21, 2010, according to marriage records at the Cambridge City Hall. Eleven months earlier, Tsarnaev was arrested, accused of domestic assault and battery against his girlfriend at his home in Cambridge, police records said. The police report was redacted to hide the girlfriend's name, and a police spokesman would not confirm it was Russell. The woman, who was ""crying hysterically,"" called 911 to report that she was ""beat up by her boyfriend"" on the afternoon of July 28, 2009, Cambridge Police Officer Angela Pereira wrote in the arrest report. Tsarnaev told Pereira and another officer that his girlfriend ""was yelling at him because of another girl."" Suspect says brother was brains behind attack . ""I asked the suspect if he had hit the victim, and he stated 'Yes, I slapped her,' "" Pereira wrote. The girlfriend told police Tsarnaev hit the left side of her face. ""No visible marks were seen,"" Pereira said. NPR's Laura Sullivan reported Friday on an interview with unnamed women she described as Russell's close friends and college roommates. ""They described Tamerlan as very controlling and very manipulative of their friend,"" Sullivan said. ""They say he was combative and angry. He would often call (Russell) names and insult her. He would call her a slut and a prostitute, and they remember fights that they would get into where he would fly into rages and sometimes throw furniture or throw things."" Russell dropped out of school after she became pregnant in her senior year, the women told Sullivan. ""They say that she really pulled away from her friends, that she cut off contact with them, and she also cut off contact with her family members which her friends had been in contact with,"" she reported. Did one brother brainwash the other? Wife is staying with parents . Russell was born and raised in suburban Providence, Rhode Island, a Christian who converted to Islam after marrying Tsarnaev. She's an observant Muslim and wears a headscarf, her lawyer said. Katie -- that's what family and friends call her -- is staying now with her parents in North Kingstown, Rhode Island, but before last week she was living in Cambridge and working as a home health aide, he said.  ""She worked many, many hours."" Her husband took care of  their daughter each day while she was at work, her lawyer said. ""She would go off in the morning, she would work 'til late at night,"" he said. ""She called to see how her daughter was and that kind of stuff, like any person would."" A killer in the family . Widow is not talking yet . The Russell family hired DeLuca on Saturday, after federal agents contacted them asking to interview her, he said. For now, he is the one speaking to the FBI. ""She understands the need for doing it,"" he said. ""This is the way the government looks at it, and she understands this. It's a threat to national security, and she gets that. And she's a really good person, very sympathetic to that. Katie's just trying to bring up her daughter."" What we know about the suspects . In the statement released Tuesday, DeLuca said Russell is very close to her family. ""She is fortunate to have the support of her loving family now, as they, too, struggle to come to terms with these events and the deep sorrow we all feel following the events of last week,"" he said.  ""The injuries and loss of life -- to people who came to celebrate a race and a holiday -- has caused profound distress and sorrow to Katie and her family."" The family released its own statement Friday, after learning Tsarnaev had died. ""Our daughter has lost her husband today, the father of her child,"" the family said. ""We cannot begin to comprehend how this horrible tragedy occurred. In the aftermath of the Patriots' Day horror, we know that we never really knew Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Our hearts are sickened by the knowledge of the horror he has inflicted. Please respect our family's privacy in this difficult time.""

"For the past 26 years, musician Boujemaa Razgui, a Canadian citizen based in Boston, has traveled around the world and across the United States with his instruments, 11 neys and two kywalas, in tow. Razgui has a green card and grew up in Marrakesh. Razgui supports himself and his family playing these instruments. Last month, he traveled from Marrakesh, Morocco, to Boston, passing through Madrid and New York, a trip he has made numerous times without incident. When he arrived in New York on December 22, his suitcase with the instruments and materials he purchased in Morocco to make new instruments was not there. He was told the bag would be in Boston, but when he arrived, he obtained an empty suitcase without his prized instruments inside. He contacted John F. Kennedy International Airport on December 23 to inquire about the missing instruments, and he said a customs employee told him that his instruments were ""destroyed safely"" because they were considered agricultural products. A spokesperson from U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Razgui did not claim his bag at JFK. Typically, passengers clear immigration and are subject to customs inspections based on what they declare to have brought into the United States, the Customs spokesperson said. Razgui was not present for the inspection because he did not claim his bag. Customs agriculture specialists at JFK discovered ""fresh bamboo canes approximately three to four feet long inside of unclaimed baggage arriving on a flight from Madrid, Spain on Sunday December 22, 2013,"" the Customs spokesperson said in a statement. The spokesperson said agriculture specialists did not find or destroy any instruments, only fresh bamboo. Razgui said he did not understand what happened. At the very least, he told CNN, he wished Customs would have contacted him and asked about his belongings. While he is sad to lose the instruments and the materials, he said he would have forfeited the reeds he purchased in Morocco if it meant keeping his instruments. ""I have three kids, I make a living with this flute,"" he said. ""Now I don't have them."" Razgui says Customs destroyed 13 flute-like instruments: 11 neys and two kywalas, a shorter flute. The Customs spokesperson, however, said agriculture specialists neither found nor destroyed any instruments. Razgui's music career has taken him to Canada, Europe and the United States. He said he has played at Lincoln Center, alongside Cirque de Soleil, and was featured in Shakira and Beyonce's song ""Beautiful Liar."" In the past, he said, his instruments have been subject to increased scrutiny by Customs officials, but he has never had his instruments confiscated. ""I don't know what to do; I need my materials to make my living,"" he said. The reeds used to make his neys can only be found in Spain, Morocco and the Middle East, he said. Razgui, 55, has been playing the ney since has was 12. He said he made all of the instruments himself. While visiting family in Morocco, Razgui traveled to seven cities to find the right materials to bring home to make additional flutes, he said. Now Razgui says his music career is on hold, as he has limited access to additional flutes in the United States. He borrowed some from a professor at Boston College, he said, but their quality does not compare with those he lost. Razgui said he had to cancel a concert at a hotel in Holbrook, Massachusetts, on New Year's Eve. ""I need something to work with, it doesn't make sense to me that they were just cut off, I have a big heart for this,"" he said. ""Right now I don't have a job; I don't know what to do."" The Customs spokesperson said any passenger who has an issue can file a report online or contact Homeland Security.","Boujemaa Razgui says his 13 flute-like instruments were destroyed at JFK International .

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration had ""very detailed contingency plans"" for military action against Pakistani forces if they had tried to stop the U.S. attack on Osama bin Laden's compound, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the plan. Their names are not disclosed because of the sensitive intelligence information involved. ""No firepower option was off the table"" during the Navy SEALs' 38-minute mission on the ground, or during the time U.S. helicopters were in the air, one official told CNN. ""We would have done whatever we had to in order to get our men out."" The two U.S. officials also told CNN about the plan if bin Laden had been captured alive, which included taking him to Afghanistan and then out to the USS Carl Vinson in the Arabian Sea. All of the senior U.S. officials in the White House Situation Room during the assault were prepared to call their Pakistani counterparts if fighting between U.S. and Pakistani forces appeared imminent, one of the officials told CNN. The SEALs at all times retained the right of self-defense, and they could have fired at the Pakistanis to defend themselves. During the time the SEALs were on the ground, while some were inside the compound, others were covertly placed just outside the compound walls to provide perimeter security and keep people away. Some of those SEALs would have been able to speak enough of the local language to communicate with townspeople if they had come across them, one source told CNN. As the assault on bin Laden's compound commenced, the United States had a number of aircraft flying protective missions. None of the aircraft entered Pakistani airspace, but they were prepared to do so if needed. These included fixed wing fighter jets that would have provided firepower if the team came under opposition fire it could not handle. Additionally, the Air Force had a full team of combat search and rescue helicopters including MH-53 Pave Low and HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopters flying. The helicopter that came in to replace the crashed stealth helicopter was carrying a battlefield medical team that was flying overhead and ready to land if SEALs were wounded, one of the CNN sources said. That helicopter landed at the compound within about thirty minutes of being called. U.S. military and intelligence assets were conducting continuous reconnaissance of Pakistani military installations to watch for any indication of movements, but the Pakistani military never responded while the U.S. forces were there, one U.S. official indicated. On Monday, Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani praised the Pakistani military's response to the sudden arrival of U.S. forces. ""The air force was ordered to scramble,"" he said. ""Ground units arrived at the scene quickly. Our response demonstrates that our armed forces reacted, as was expected of them."" Still, he added, ""There is no denying the U.S. technological ability to evade our radars."" Even though it was anticipated that bin Laden would resist the Navy SEALs that assaulted his compound, and therefore be killed, the Obama administration had a plan in place for dealing with bin Laden if he was captured alive, according to both U.S. officials. The plan was for bin Laden to be flown back to Afghanistan aboard U.S. military helicopters and then flown out to the USS Carl Vinson in the north Arabian Sea. There was a team of lawyers, medical personnel, interrogators and translators standing by to deal with bin Laden if that was the scenario that unfolded. A major concern was to immediately ""preserve evidence"" and put bin Laden into a legal framework that would ensure he could be charged and tried some day, the official said. ""We didn't want to have some case thrown out on a technicality."" The official indicated the standby teams included the type of expertise normally within U.S. units in Afghanistan, so it's likely personnel did not even know who their potential target would have been. The official noted that bin Laden would have undergone the same type of medical checks and photographing that surrounded Saddam Hussein when he was captured. After bin Laden was killed by the Navy SEALs at the compound, his body was flown back to Afghanistan, and then to the Carl Vinson where he was buried at sea. Admiral Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, placed a phone call to his counterpart General Ashfaq Kiyani asking for U.S. aircraft to re-enter Pakistani airspace -- several hours after the raid -- so the body could be flown out to the Vinson.","""No firepower option was off the table,"" a U.S. official says .

"An al Qaeda-linked rebel group has wrested control of the historic Christian town of Maaloula from regime forces, opposition groups said Sunday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the hardline Islamist rebels of the al-Nusra Front seized control Saturday night. Videos posted on YouTube in recent days showed fighting between rebels and government forces in the tiny sleepy town, an hour's drive from the capital Damascus. ""We cleansed Maaloula from all the Assad dogs and all his thugs,"" a rebel commander shouts at the camera in a video posted online over the weekend. What the capture will mean for the Christian residents waits to be seen. As the 18-month-long Syrian conflict festers, the government and the opposition welcome and need Christian support. But some Christians fear radical Islamists have been swelling rebel ranks. They also fear the same fate as a number of Christians during the war in Iraq, where militants targeted them and spurred many to leave the country. Christians make up roughly 10% of the population. Syria is ruled by a government dominated by Alawites, whose faith is an offshoot of Shiism. The regime is opposed by an opposition with a large Sunni presence. Aid agencies say Syria's 2 million Christians are often targeted for suspected sympathies to President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Two top bishops have been kidnapped; a well-known priest is missing. Antoinette Nassrallah, the Christian owner of a cafe in Maaloula, told CNN last year she had seen government TV images depicting radical Muslim attacks on Christians. She said she has heard about such violence in Aleppo. ""For now in our area here it's fine,"" she said last year. ""But what I heard, in Aleppo, they are killing, destroying many of churches -- very, very old churches."" Many of Syria's Christians have fled to Lebanon where they shelter in monasteries. On Saturday, they joined in prayers for peace promoted by Pope Francis in Rome. Last year, the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on leaders of  al-Nusra while the State Department blacklisted it as a foreign terror organization linked to al Qaeda in Iraq. Al-Nusra Front has emerged as one of the most effective groups in the Syrian resistance, drawing on foreign fighters with combat experience in Iraq and elsewhere. But Washington accuses the group of using the Syrian conflict to advance its own ideology and ends. Elsewhere in Syria, Russia sent a plane to pick up its citizens from the war-torn Middle East nation, state media reported Sunday.","What the capture will mean for Christians waits to be seen .

"(CNN) -- A state fair's response to the uproar over a rodeo clown's mockery of President Obama is creating an uproar of its own. From now on, the Missouri State Fair won't allow any rodeo cowboys or clowns from the state's association to take part unless they all undergo ""sensitivity training."" And that's just part of the fallout from the Saturday incident in which a clown wearing an Obama mask held a broom descending from his backside while a voice said, ""Hey, I know I'm a clown. He's just running around acting like one. Doesn't know he is one."" Mark Ficken, president of the Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Association, has resigned. Rodeo clown Tuffy Gessling has apologized. He told Missouri news outlet digitalburg.com that he was the one whose voice was heard at the event, and that he never meant to offend. ""It was a colleague of mine that was dressed up. I am the rodeo clown making jokes,"" he said. Gessling did not immediately return a message Thursday from CNN requesting comment. U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman, a Texas Republican known as a provocateur, has invited the clown -- whose name he did not yet know -- to come perform in his own district. ""Liberals want to bronco bust dissent. But Texans value speech, even if its speech they don't agree with,"" Stockman said. After video of the event caught attention on YouTube, fair officials and politicians -- both Democrats and Republicans -- slammed the portrayal of the president. So did some attendees, such as Perry Bream, who said, ""It wasn't clean; it wasn't fun. It was awful; it was sickening. It was racist."" Sensitivity training: PC overload? The Missouri State Fair Commission announced it was permanently banning ""this rodeo clown from ever participating"" again. It did not name the clown. That behavior, during the Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Association's Finals Rodeo, was ""unacceptable,"" the commission said. Before it will consider contracting with the association again, ""they must provide evidence to the director of the Missouri State Fair that they have proof that all officials and subcontractors of the MRCA have successfully participated in sensitivity training,"" the commission wrote in a news release. The conservative news outlet The Blaze called the demand ""political insanity."" A Facebook page supporting Gessling had more than 50,000 likes by Thursday morning. On Twitter, some people argued that being offended by a rodeo clown is ""ridiculous."" But others disagreed. ""The sensitivity is needed by those fair planners who approved this act as representative of all Missourians,"" wrote Lisa Robinson. The Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Association issued a brief statement apologizing to those offended by any performances at the rodeo. The Missouri State Fair Commission and the Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Association did not immediately respond Thursday to CNN's requests for comment. Ex-official fears losing school job . Ficken, who stepped down Monday evening as president of the MRCA, has been threatened physically in the wake of the incident, CNN affiliate KDSK reported. He fears he may lose his job as superintendent of the Boonville R-1 School District, which is investigating whether he was involved. ""He's shaking like a small dog passing razor blades,"" Ficken's lawyer, Albert Watkins, told the station. Ficken announced special guest ""President Obama"" at the rodeo. At one point, he said, ""Watch out for that bull, Obama,"" but otherwise he was not part of the performance, according to Watkins. Gessling, meanwhile, told digitalburg.com he's been a rodeo clown throughout his career, and that it's what he loves to do. ""Making fun of political and famous people is kind of the platform,"" he said. ""... I've never tried to dishonor or disrespect anyone, so the whole thing was not meant to be racist or disrespectful. I was just trying to make people laugh.""","The Missouri State Fair Commission demands ""sensitivity training"" for rodeo clowns .

The human rights group Amnesty International says more than 500 people were killed during the clashes and thousands more were rounded up for questioning. ""Scores were arrested and huge amounts of up-to-date weapons and ammunition in several places were confiscated, which helped bring back the sense of safety to the residents of the city,"" a Syrian military source told the SANA news agency about the Daraa mission. But the international activist group Avaaz said there was little sign of a Syrian withdrawal from Daraa, and warned that remaining Syrian armored units still pose a threat to demonstrators. Syrian soldiers were gathered on the edges of Banias, a city on Syria's northwest coast, according to a witness who spoke to CNN Thursday. ""The army has deployed more than 30 tanks around Banias and 40 armored vehicles,"" said Anas Al Shaghri, a 23-year-old Syrian economics student. ""We are told that the Syrian army will enter the city just like they did in Daraa any minute."" Citizen protesters are posted at checkpoints leading into Banias in an effort to keep the Syrian military out of the city, Al Shaghri said. ""We just carry batons and telephones to film whenever the government thugs and armed security forces attack."" The Syrian military warned the protesters that ""if we don't pull out the checkpoints the security forces will break into the city,"" he said. But Al Shaghri said the protesters ""are not terrorists, nor armed. We are simple a people longing for freedom."" At least 16 people have been arrested and detained in the city over the past three days, he said. The announcement of the pullout from Daraa came a day after Syrian security forces arrested two people outside the University of Damascus as student demonstrators rallied for the release of political detainees, eyewitnesses told CNN. Army convoys and tanks rolled into the capital city, setting up what the witnesses described as a base in the central square. ""The army knows they cannot pressure the economic situation too much in Damascus. Everyone is trying to go about their work, school and their businesses,"" one eyewitness activist told CNN. Amnesty International said it has received firsthand reports of torture and other ill treatment from detainees held in Syria, as a wave of arrests of anti-government protesters intensified over the weekend. The organization said ""widespread, arbitrary arrests"" had taken place in towns across the country in recent days. At least 499 people were detained Sunday during house-to-house raids in Daraa, a key location for pro-reform protests, the group said, adding that most were being held at unknown locations without access to lawyers or their families. The rights group also said it had the names of 54 people killed last Friday, which brought to 542 the number of people killed during a month and a half of protests in Syria. Amnesty International stated in a report that the high number of deaths can be attributed to the tactics used by Syrian security forces. And in a statement released Thursday, Avaaz said more than 400 people -- including members of prominent families who took part in recent protests -- have been rounded up in the Damascus suburb of Zabadani. The group said 38 of those arrested were released Wednesday ""and sent home with instructions to spread the word in their communities of their arrest and torture, as a warning to anyone involved in anti-government activism."" Another 300-plus arrests have been made in Sakba, another Damascus suburb, Avaaz said. CNN could not independently corroborate those reports. Avaaz said more protests are expected across Syria after Friday prayers.","NEW: Syrian troops gather on edges of Banias, a witness says .

"(CNN) -- Syrian tanks and helicopters opened fire and killed at least two civilians as the military advanced through a series of villages in northwestern Syria Thursday, a push that sent residents running for the hills, a villager told CNN. ""They attacked the old church,"" said Mohamed Smail, a farmer who fled his home and spoke to CNN from the hills around Al Bara.  ""We are calling on international organizations to protect our ruins.  They are destroying our cultural heritage."" Syria has been engulfed in violence during more than three months of anti-government discontent. The crackdown on anti-government protests in the Jabal Zawiya region of Syria's Idlib province comes just days after Syrian authorities allowed a historic opposition conference to be held in the capital, Damascus. Helicopters swept in and dropped commandos into the area from ropes Thursday morning. Tanks and helicopters bombarded ancient Byzantine ruins in Al Bara, the site of a famous ""dead city,"" a destination for tourists fascinated by fifth-century Byzantine churches, monasteries, and an intact pyramid-shaped burial chamber. Smail also said Syrian military units attacked and destroyed the home of a local man named Mohamed Khalife, killing him and his infant son. ""His 1-year-old son, named Hasan Mohamed Khalife, was in the house and we couldn't save him,"" Smail said. Smail said Syrian troops and plain-clothed Shabiha militants had blocked escape routes to nearby Turkey. CNN could not independently confirm the man's account. The number of Syrian refugees fleeing to Turkey each day has dropped dramatically as Syrian troops have moved into border regions, after days of protests and unrest. The Turkish prime minister's office released a statement Thursday saying that five Syrian refugees had crossed the border during the prior 24 hours.  More than 15,000 Syrian refugees fled to Turkey to escape the government crackdown in recent weeks.  Nearly a third of those refugees have voluntarily returned to Syria in recent days, according to the Turkish government. Elsewhere, in the large city of Aleppo, 20 busloads of what an activist called ""government thugs"" attacked marchers with batons and knives. The attack caused the demonstrators to disperse, and a number of people were injured, but there was no word of deaths. Video surfaced on the internet of what activists say was unrest on Bab Nasr Avenue in Aleppo, and it showed a panicked crowd fleeing down the street. Syrian forces later intervened, pushed the ""thugs"" back, and a peaceful demonstration ensued, an activist said. Another activist, contacted by telephone by CNN, said the street was the site of a Thursday confrontation between protesters and government forces. Rami Abdelrahman, of the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said anti-regime demonstrations occurred Thursday in Aleppo's Bab Al Faraj, Al Masharqa and Bab al Hadid neighborhoods. Hundreds of demonstrators participated in them, he said. Some pro-regime demonstrations occurred in the same areas, with demonstrators clashing and a number of injuries resulting, he said. At the United Nations, Western diplomats exchanged harsh words with the Syrian ambassador in the Security Council, where China and Russia have threatened to veto a pending resolution condemning the violence in Syria on the grounds that they do not want to get involved in Syria's internal affairs. ""This council should send a clear message underlining our collective concern,"" said Philip Parham, Britain's deputy ambassador to the United Nations. ""They have met legitimate demands for reform with brute force."" ""I would hope that this esteemed council would focus on the real issues instead of meddling in internal affairs,"" said Bashar Jaafari, Syria's ambassador to the world body. ""Some member states will not cease to use the Security Council as a tool to pass its own policies."" Meanwhile, an American congressman who traveled this week to Syria, where he met with President Bashar al-Assad and opposition leaders, said the situation is ""dire."" U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, said he is working to end the violence. ""I appealed to President Assad to remove his forces from the cities. He told me he would, and today we learned that he has begun to do just that."" ""A process of national dialogue is now beginning. This process is unprecedented in Syria and should not be dismissed as mere window dressing, because until now there has been no window for people to view what democracy in Syria would look like."" He said he has talked to ""many Syrians who said the overthrow of Assad -- without knowing who would take his place -- will add to the instability and make things immeasurably worse, and they want him to deliver on the reforms."" ""President Assad has communicated directly to the opposition, and to me personally, that he is prepared to do that, not as a ruse to stay in power, but as a step towards the natural path to Syria's progress and development. We must be mindful however of the actions of extremists who are using this time of transition as an opportunity of cover for their own anti-democratic agenda."" Kucinich said he traveled to Syria at the request of his Arab-American constituents and not in response to an invitation from Damascus. He met with government and opposition figures, including people who had been imprisoned by the regime, and said the situation doesn't ""simply involve two players: the government and the opposition."" ""It is an extremely complicated and explosive condition involving, among other elements, a historically closed government with an awful human rights record, caught up in demands for democracy sweeping the region; security forces which went out of control killing innocent protesters; sectarian interests which have longed to overthrow a government which has protected religious minorities; violence against minorities; guns flowing across the borders with refugees on the move,"" he said. ""Too many people have already died in Syria. It is imperative to act to end further deaths.""

"The U.N. Security Council unanimously passed tougher sanctions against North Korea Thursday targeting the secretive nation's nuclear program hours after Pyongyang threatened a possible ""preemptive nuclear attack."" ""These sanctions will bite, and bite hard,"" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said after the vote. China, North Korea's key ally, could have used its veto power to block the sanctions.  Instead, after weeks of negotiating, it signed on to the final draft. ""China is a country of principle,"" China's U.N. Ambassador Li Baodong said. ""We are firmly committed to safeguarding peace and stability on the Korean peninsula."" Leading up to the vote, Pyongyang ratcheted up its bellicose rhetoric. A spokesman for the North Korean foreign ministry suggested the United States ""is set to light a fuse for a nuclear war."" As a result, North Korea ""will exercise the right to a preemptive nuclear attack to destroy the strongholds of the aggressors and to defend the supreme interests of the country,"" the country said in a statement carried by the state-run Korean Central News Agency. Despite the strong language, analysts say North Korea is years away from having the technology necessary to mount a nuclear warhead on a missile and aim it accurately at a target.  And, analysts say, North Korea is unlikely to seek a direct military conflict with the United States, preferring instead to try to gain traction through threats and the buildup of its military deterrent. But the threat came amid increased concern over Pyongyang's dogged efforts to advance its nuclear and missile technology after a recent long-range rocket launch and underground atomic blast. On Tuesday, North Korea said it planned to scrap the armistice that stopped the Korean War in 1953 and warned it could carry out strikes against the United States and South Korea. Analysts: 'Boxed in' North Korea's bluster 'particularly dangerous' The rhetoric came not only in advance of the U.N. vote, but also as military drills take place on either side of the heavily armed border that divides the two Koreas. This week, the United States and South Korean began two months of joint exercises, known as Foal Eagle.  North Korea has called the annual training exercises ""an open declaration of a war,"" but South Korea says it notified Pyongyang that the drills ""are defensive in nature."" North Korea's nuclear threat Thursday ""may suggest that Pyongyang feels even more boxed in than usual,"" said Michael Mazza of the American Enterprise Institute. And while a nuclear attack itself is not an immediate palpable threat, ""This surge in provocative rhetoric is particularly dangerous,"" added Michael Auslin, also with the institute.  ""South Korea's new president (Park Geun Hye) can't be seen to back down in the face of the North's threats, while (new North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un may feel that his successful missile and nuclear tests give him the ability to keep pressuring Seoul. The two may wind up talking themselves into conflict."" South Korea's U.N. Ambassador Kim Sook said Thursday the new resolution ""reflects the will of the international community,"" which ""will never tolerate North Korea's repeated violations and North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile program."" ""Each violation will be met by stronger responses and measures,"" he added. Will the new sanctions work? The goal of the new sanctions is to stymie the activities of North Korean banks and cash couriers who might be funneling money to the secretive regime's nuclear and missile programs. It will be tougher for the regime to move large sums of cash stuffed into suitcases, Rice said. The U.N. resolution also outlines measures to step up scrutiny of suspicious sea shipments and air cargo. And it expands restrictions to encompass several institutions and senior officials in the North's weapons industry, as well as a range of materials and technology known to be used in uranium enrichment. It also blocks the sale of luxury goods -- such as yachts and certain high-end jewelry -- to North Korea. ""As a result, North Korea's ruling elite, who have been living large while impoverishing their people, will pay a price"" for the ongoing nuclear activities, Rice said. Some doubt whether the new measures will make much difference. Sanctions imposed after previous nuclear tests and rocket launches have failed to deter Pyongyang. China will go a long way toward determining whether the new sanctions really do have ""bite,"" analysts say. ""As long as China allows North Korea to operate, as long as China provides food, energy assistance, and investment, the sanctions really don't matter,"" said Doug Bandow of the Cato Institute. North Korea notoriously allows many of its people to live in malnutrition and starvation.  Still, the country needs a functioning economy, partly to finance its military, Bandow explained. ""Kim Jong Un is now paying the price for going ahead with a nuclear test despite Chinese warnings not to create trouble during the political transition that has been under way in Beijing the past year,"" Mark Fitzpatrick, director of the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Programme at the UK-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, said this week. Future levels of Chinese grain sales to North Korea are a possible indicator of Beijing's commitment to putting meaningful pressure on Pyongyang, he said. Ken Gause, an analyst with CNA, said the new sanctions won't deter North Korea from building up its nuclear program. ""North Korea last year inserted language into its constitution that the country is a nuclear power. To walk back from this, especially under pressure from the outside world, would undermine Kim Jong Un's legitimacy and make him vulnerable. He will not do this,"" said Gause. North Korea casts U.N. sanctions as part of an aggressive, U.S.-led conspiracy against it. Simmering tensions . North Korea said the underground nuclear blast it conducted February 12 was more powerful than its two previous detonations and used a smaller, lighter device, suggesting advances in its weapons program. It was the first nuclear test the isolated state has carried out since Kim inherited power in December 2011 after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, who made building up North Korea's military strength the focus of his 17-year rule. The test followed the North's long-range rocket launch in December that succeeded in putting an object in orbit. Pyongyang insisted the launch had peaceful aims, but it was widely viewed as a test of its ballistic missile technology. Long history . North and South Korea have technically been at war for decades. The 1950-53 civil war ended in a truce rather than a peace treaty. China supported the North with materiel and troops in the Korean War. The United States backed the South in the conflict, with soldiers from the two countries fighting side by side. About 28,500 U.S. soldiers are currently stationed in South Korea.","U.S. Ambassador Rice: The sanctions will ""bite hard""

"Washington's governor estimated Friday it will take about $15 million to fix a bridge on Interstate 5 that collapsed into a river after being struck by an 18-wheeler, shutting down a portion of the state's main artery to Canada. The news came at the start of the busy holiday weekend as state and federal investigators worked to figure out what led to Thursday's collapse of the bridge, which sent vehicles tumbling into the Skagit River near Mount Vernon, about 60 miles north of Seattle. While at least three people were taken to hospitals, there were no fatalities. Gov. Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency in Washington's northwestern counties of Skagit, Snohomish and Whatcom, noting that the highway is a major conduit and its closure -- for a ""significant period"" -- will hurt the area's economy and its residents. It's unclear how long the interstate will be closed for the bridge repairs. National Transportation Safety Board inspectors were expected to spend 7 to 10 days investigating the crash, said NTSB chairwoman Deborah Hersman. Showing 'its age' An initial investigation shows the 1,111 foot-long bridge collapsed when a tractor-trailer hauling an oversized load hit one of the bridge's overhead tresses, known as the ""superstructure,"" Hersman said. ""Obviously, this is a bridge that has lived a very long life,"" she told reporters. While the bridge built in 1955 is showing ""its age,"" it appears to have been structurally sound. As part of the investigation, the NTSB will review the state's maintenance and inspection records as well as any damage reports and repairs made to the bridge, Hersman said. A heavy traffic backup along Interstate 5 was reported in both directions by midday Friday as cars and trucks inched along a cumbersome detour that took vehicles off the interstate and onto county roads. Roughly 70,000 vehicles travel that portion of the interstate a day, according to the state Department of Transportion. The collapse apparently was the result of a collision between the tractor-trailer's cargo and the bridge, Washington State Patrol Sgt. Kirk Rudeen told CNN on Friday. The truck was hauling equipment for a drilling rig, he said. 'Hold on' Dan Sligh was driving behind the 18-wheeler when he saw it strike one of the bridge's overhead support structures, and then saw the bridge give way. He slammed on the brakes, but the momentum of his pickup and camper trailer carried Sligh and his wife off the bridge and into the water dozens of feet below, he told CNN affiliate KOMO Thursday, hours after the incident some 60 miles north of Seattle. ""You hold on as tight as you can,"" Sligh said. Then, a ""white flash and cold water."" The impact dislocated his shoulder, but the Navy veteran just popped it back in and dragged his unresponsive wife to safety. A second vehicle with one person inside also fell from the bridge, according to state officials. Amazingly, no one died. Sligh's wife, Sally, was the only one of the three who remained hospitalized Friday. She was in stable condition, according to Skagit Valley Hospital. ""Rough day,"" Dan Sligh told KOMO. ""Glad to be here breathing."" 'Functionally obsolete' The bridge had been rated ""functionally obsolete,"" according to a federal database, but state officials said it was safe to drive on. That category is for bridges that may have narrow lanes or shoulders, or spans that don't provide enough vertical clearance to let tall trucks pass, according to Washington's DOT. The bridge was inspected as recently as November, said Dave Chesson, a spokesman for the Washington Department of Transportation. ""We wouldn't be having drivers drive on this bridge if we thought there were any concerns whatsoever,"" he said Friday. Sligh told KOMO he was traveling south on the interstate behind the tractor-trailer when he realized the load appeared to be about four feet too wide to fit through the bridge's superstructure. ""Any time he wants to go over to the left would be OK,"" Sligh said he told his wife. But another tractor-trailer appeared to hem the truck in to the right lane. ""There was a big puff of dust, and I hit the brakes."" Dale Ogden told CNN affiliate KING  that he was driving near the tractor-trailer's pilot car when he saw a device on that car designed to indicate whether a truck can clear an obstacle hit the top of the bridge. He then watched in his rear-view mirror as the truck struck the bridge, he told KING. ""It almost tipped the truck over but it came back down. It tipped it up to about a 30-degree angle to the left and it came back down on its wheels, and almost instantaneously behind that I saw girders falling in my rear-view mirror,"" he said. The tractor-trailer did not go into the water. The driver was questioned but not detained, state police said. Emergency funding . The U.S. Department of Transportation released $1 million in emergency funding for the bridge, Inslee said Friday on Twitter. Inslee said the accident starkly demonstrates the need for additional funding for roads and bridges. ""We have some work to do on our bridges whether or not this accident happened, and we have some discussions in Olympia"" -- the state capital -- ""about making sure that we make investments in bridges to prevent this kind of thing from happening,"" he told reporters. In March, President Barack Obama called on Congress to provide $21 billion for infrastructure construction, including improvements to existing roadways.READ MORE: How safe is that bridge you're driving on?","NTSB inspectors are investigating the events surrounding the collapse .

"Madrid (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of protesters converged on central Madrid Sunday as the so-called May 15 movement pushing for political and social change in Spain again took to the streets. Madrid's was the first major demonstration of the day and drew some 37,000 people, Spain's state-run news agency reported, citing a consulting firm it hired to estimate the size of the crowd. Protests were planned in 55 other Spanish cities later in the day and had gotten underway in Barcelona, Bilbao, Valencia and other cities, Spanish media reported. The protests focused again on Spain's 21% unemployment rate and on the government's economic austerity measures. But on Sunday, they also rallied against European Union efforts to stabilize the euro, with many protesters worried that could lead to more austerity measures across the EU. The movement takes its name from the opening round of large protests on May 15 of this year. On Sunday, it unveiled a new tactic in Madrid, when six columns of marchers started in the north, south, east and west of the capital. They walked noisily through neighborhoods, carrying banners and shouting slogans and quickly adding more protesters in a steady march to the Neptune plaza near the parliament building. GPS: The perils of public debt . A throng of riot police stood by to protect the national parliament, days after violent scuffles occurred between demonstrators and police outside the Catalonia regional parliament in Barcelona last week. ""This capitalistic system doesn't work. It's an unfair system and a lot of people are in a very bad situation, without money,"" said Eva Fernandez, a social worker who was marching with the ""northern"" column down Madrid's main boulevard, la Castellana, on Sunday. Protesters on June 12 dismantled a sprawling tent camp in Madrid's central Puerta del Sol plaza, nearly a month after it sparked large nationwide demonstrations and similar encampments in other cities to demand changes in Spain's political and economic system. ""The main thing we've achieved so far is to gain legitimacy to be able to protest and demonstrate in the streets,"" said Josua Serrano, a communications worker also marching in the ""northern"" column. ""This civil disobedience is being practiced in a lot of countries now through nonviolent direct action. So people are going to the street without fear."" Before May 15, a series of citizens groups across Spain used social media networks like Facebook to call for protests on May 15. The large response seemed to surprise even the organizers, as tens of thousands of people turned out in Madrid, Barcelona and other cities. The crowds have been dominated by young people, but also included retirees and families with young children. Demonstrators had a long and varied list of demands, but an underlying current was a call for change in Spain's political and economic system, to make it -- according to the protesters -- more democratic. The movement gained force, with daily demonstrations involving thousands of people nationwide, in the run-up to May 22 municipal and regional elections. The conservative Popular Party was the big winner in that vote and now is poised, many analysts say, to win national parliamentary elections over the ruling Socialists. Those elections are expected no later than next March. But the protesters have said repeatedly that neither of the two main parties represents their interests. Several protesters told CNN they voted for smaller parties which are farther left than the Socialists. The protests of the May 15 movement have been largely peaceful, with police standing by. But there were scuffles, arrests and minor injuries at various flash points, including in Barcelona last week.","Madrid draws 37,000 protesters .

"President Barack Obama tried to shame the nation and Congress into action against gun violence Thursday, saying it is time to pass new laws after the tears and grief of tragedies like the Newtown massacre in December that killed 20 first-graders. ""We need everybody to remember how we felt 100 days ago and make sure that what we said at that time wasn't just a bunch of platitudes, that we meant it,"" Obama said at a White House event on a national day of action by supporters of tougher gun laws. His voice both somber and angry, Obama told the audience, which included family members of Newtown victims, that ""we've cried enough"" and it is time now for Americans to pressure their elected leaders to pass a package of laws proposed by Senate Democrats. The proposals, all recommended by the president in the aftermath of the killings at an elementary school in Connecticut, include expanded background checks, tougher laws against gun trafficking and straw purchases, and improving safety at schools. Fierce opposition led by the influential National Rifle Association and conservative politicians has made passage of the measures uncertain. In addition, polls conducted over the past few weeks suggest that more than three months after the Newtown killings, public backing for major new gun laws has dropped. Obama noted the political challenge as well as the poll numbers. ""There are some powerful voices on the other side who are interested in running out the clock, or changing the subject,"" the president said, adding that ""their assumption is that people will just forget about it."" If that happens, Obama said, then ""shame on us if we've forgotten."" In trying to rally further public outcry, he declared that ""nothing is more powerful than millions of voices calling for change."" Along with the White House event, the national day of action included rallies and other gatherings in cities across the country by supporters of new gun legislation. ""There are 80 million moms in this country,"" said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, after the White House event. ""This is a non-partisan issue. It doesn't matter if you're a Republican or if you're a Democrat.  We need to come together under one umbrella and say 'enough.'"" In addition, a group called Mayors Against Illegal Guns launched a $12 million ad campaign targeting members of Congress in 10 states to act on the legislation backed by Obama and approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on mostly partisan lines. Another proposal passed by the committee -- a ban on semiautomatic firearms that are modeled after military assault rifles -- already appears doomed. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid dropped the ban -- proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California -- from the package going to the Senate floor because it lacked enough support to overcome a GOP filibuster. Reid said it can still be offered as an amendment to force a vote, as sought by Obama and Feinstein. Newtown families featured in first political ad . Even if gun legislation passes the Democratic-led Senate, it has less chance of winning approval in the Republican-controlled House. Obama rejected arguments by opponents of the legislation that the measures would strip Americans of their constitutional right to bear arms. ""What we're proposing is not radical. It's not taking away anyone's guns rights,"" the president said in warning legislators against getting ""squishy because time has passed and maybe it's not on the news every day."" Instead, he said, it's time to demonstrate that the American character includes being ""willing to follow through on what we say is important."" Obama and others pushing for tougher gun laws say the December attack by a lone gunman that killed 20 first-graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, showed the need for national action against gun violence. They note the killer, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, used a semiautomatic rifle with 30-round capacity magazines, both of which  would be banned under Feinstein's proposal. Opponents of tougher gun laws, led by the NRA, argue most gun violence involves pistols in urban areas, rather than the semiautomatic firearms targeted by Feinstein. Better enforcement of existing laws and posting armed security guards in schools would be more effective remedies, according to the NRA. Watts, however told reporters her group of American moms rejects the NRA prescription for the country. ""We are not going to put our kids in schools with shields and send them to school in bulletproof backpacks and let the good guys shoot it out with the bad guys over our kids' heads,"" Watts said. Police released new documents Thursday related to the Newtown shootings that say police found more than 1,600 rounds of ammunition in the home where Lanza killed his mother with one of her own guns, shooting her in the forehead as she lay in bed. Lanza then went to the elementary school, shooting his way inside and opening fire on classrooms with a semiautomatic rifle before killing himself to end the rampage, which lasted less than five minutes, the documents showed. Documents reveal new details about Sandy Hook shootings, but no motive . ""This is exactly why we need to ban high-capacity magazines and why we need to tighten our assault weapons ban,"" Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy said Thursday. ""I don't know what more we can need to know before we take decisive action to prevent gun violence."" After the Newtown shootings, some states -- including New York -- passed tougher gun laws. While the fervor for stronger legislation was high in the immediate aftermath of the shootings, a CBS News survey released this week indicates a 10-point decrease in support of stricter gun laws, from 57% immediately after the Newtown shootings to 47% now. That poll was in line with a CNN/ORC International survey released last week that indicated a 9-point drop in the percentage of Americans who favor major restrictions on guns or an outright ban on gun ownership, from 52% following the shootings to 43%. Other polls have shown changes in the same downward direction. ""Opinion on gun control was fairly steady over the past few years, but seemed to spike after the Connecticut shootings,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. ""The big question is whether support for major new gun laws has simply dropped back down to that previous level or whether the slide will continue even further."" Opinion: Did we learn nothing from Newtown? He noted that the biggest drop came among two specific demographics -- older Americans and people who live in rural areas. ""In the immediate aftermath of the shootings in Connecticut, the number of rural Americans who supported major gun restrictions rose to 49% but now that support has dropped 22 points,"" Holland said. ""Support for stricter gun laws dropped 16 points among Americans over 50 years old in that same time."" However, Obama noted that polls also show strong support across the spectrum, including among gun owners, for expanding background checks to prevent firearms from ending up in the hands of the mentally ill and criminals. The CBS poll showed that 90% of respondents agreed, and the president noted that support, asking Thursday ""how often do 90% of Americans agree on anything?"" He urged people to find out where their congressional representatives stand on the gun legislation, adding that if a legislator isn't ""part of the 90%, ask why not."" Polls suggest Congress might have waited too long on gun control .","Shannon Watts, head of an American mothers' group, says the issue is non-partisan .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The relatives of two Pakistani men killed by an American CIA contractor received a total of about $2.3 million in ""blood money,"" which helped secure the suspect's release, a local official said. Raymond Davis killed the two men in Lahore in January, sparking a diplomatic tussle that strained relations between the United States and Pakistan. One of the victims was Faizan Haider, whose wife and mother both acknowledged the compensation in court records. ""I have pardoned the American Raymond Davis who killed my husband on January 27th after receiving a blood money of $292, 375,"" the victim's wife, Zahra Shahzad, stated in her affidavit submitted to court. ""I received this money without any pressure or greed."" The victim's mother also submitted an affidavit stating the same thing, except for her compensation, which she said was $389,443, court records show. Haider's legal heirs got a  total of $ 1,161,349  in ""blood money,"" records said.  His heirs are a mother, a wife, three brothers and five sisters. His mother received the highest amount. Rana Sanaullah, the provincial law minister of Punjab province, told CNN legal heirs of Fahim Shamshad, the other victim, received the same total. Relatives of both victims got a total of $2.34 million from the U.S. government, Sanaullah said. Davis has said the shooting occurred when the two men tried to rob him at gunpoint as he drove through a busy Lahore neighborhood. The United States sought his release from a Lahore jail, where he has been held since January on grounds of diplomatic immunity. He was released Wednesday and is now in Kabul, Afghanistan, for medical examination and rest, according to a U.S. official not authorized to speak for attribution. ""Everybody laughs about my intuition but I just knew in my gut that he would be home,"" his wife, Rebecca, told reporters outside their home in Highland Park, Colorado. ""It wasn't a pleasant thing, but it could have been so much worse."" The decision to release Davis was made by the Pakistanis, and there was ""no quid pro quo"" between Washington and Islamabad, the U.S. official said. The official declined to comment on whether there was an exchange of the so-called ""blood money."" U.S. officials originally said Davis was a diplomat and later revealed that he is a CIA contractor, intensifying the already highly charged situation. The killings sparked an outcry in the Asian nation, a key U.S. ally in the war against al Qaeda and Taliban militants in neighboring Afghanistan. They also led to tensions between the two nations, with Congress warning Pakistani leaders that billions of dollars in U.S. aid were in jeopardy unless he was released. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton applauded the release, but stressed that the U.S. government did not compensate the families. She would not say whether the Pakistanis or a third party did. ""We also have a Department of Justice investigation that has begun into what happened in Lahore. And we've communicated our strong support for the relationship between Pakistan and the United States, which we consider to be of strategic importance,"" Clinton said during a news conference Wednesday. Davis had been charged with murder and illegal possession of a firearm, the lawyer said. He appeared in a Lahore court after the payment was made and was acquitted of the charges in accordance with an Islamic practice known as diyat, or compensation, the lawyer said. ""Diyat,"" a part of Islamic law that is enshrined in Pakistan's penal code, allows victims to pardon a murderer with or without being paid ""blood money,"" said Saeed U Zaman Saddiqi, the former chief justice of Pakistan's Supreme Court.

"Hours after her younger sister stood behind President Barack Obama during his gun violence speech last week, an Illinois teen died when a bullet found her in a North Chicago alley. Two people were being questioned Monday as police worked to piece together the final moments of 18-year-old Janay McFarlane, who left behind a 3-month-old son. McFarlane's younger sister, 14-year-old Destini Warren, was among a group of high school students standing behind Obama when he spoke in Chicago on Friday. Obama cited gun violence that killed 443 people in the city last year as one reason why children need community wide support to help them believe they can improve their lives through education and hard work. Before the night had passed, McFarlane was dead and her family was plunged into mourning. ""I felt like someone took a knife and stabbed me in my heart and took a piece of my heart that I will never, ever in my life get back,"" Angela Blakely, McFarlane's mother, said Monday in an interview with CNN affiliate WLS. ""This just echoes what the president had said Friday... we have to get handguns off the street,"" North Chicago Mayor Leon Rockingham Jr. told CNN on Monday. ""We have more shootings than other communities, and it's too much,"" he said. ""Any time you have gunfire, it's too much."" The North Chicago Police Department and investigators with the Lake County State's Attorney's office said community members led them to the two people being questioned Monday. The two might have knowledge about the homicide, authorities said. Janay McFarlane's father said that despite gun violence in the community, his daughter's death by gunfire came as a shock. ""You never think that it will be your child,"" Herbert McFarlane told WLS Monday.  ""This is the hardest day for me in my life.""

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Some 100,000 ultra-Orthodox Jews protested Thursday an Israeli Supreme Court decision banning segregation based on ethnic background in a girls' religious elementary school. Girls of Sephardic origin were being denied permission to share classrooms with the largely Ashkenazi school and were forced into segregated classes. Sephardic Jews are of North African and Middle East origin, Ashkenazim are Jews of European background. The ultra-Orthodox community in Israel is made up of many sectors reflecting many different traditions. The demonstrators resent what they feel is the intervention of the Israeli state into religious affairs. The school is Beit Yaakov in the West Bank settlement of Immanuel. Large demonstrations were held in Jerusalem and Bnei Brak near Tel Aviv. Police said 100,000 protesters demonstrated in Jerusalem, including 20,000 who joined the gathering from Bnei Brak. In response to a petition the court ruled that this was a case of discrimination. It ordered the school to integrate all the pupils. But 43 sets of parents who refuse the court order were to be incarcerated for two weeks on charges of contempt of court on Thursday. The parents of the school girls in question deny that their opposition to integrating Sephardic girls is based on ethnicity, but insist that it is about their religious observance which they believe is stricter than the families of those being refused. One protester Yehoshua Friedberg, told CNN, ""We see this as the right that parents have to allow their children to receive the education they believe in."" The mood among the thousands of demonstrators in their traditional black-clad garb was one of defiance. A young student proclaimed ""we go to jail because the judge told us to do things against the Torah (Bible). Our rabbis and we will go to jail until the end.""","NEW: Around 100,000 demonstrate .

"American democracy faces a very real threat. The power of money is overwhelming the power of average voters to influence government decisions. While this is an old lament in politics, social scientists are now finding very concrete proof about the damage being done. The problem revolves around the way in which we fund our political campaigns. Opponents of campaign finance reform are having a field day. Over the past few years, they have watched with delight as the political parties and Supreme Court have slowly eviscerated the Watergate-era campaign finance reforms. When the Supreme Court issued decisions citing constitutional barriers to the regulation of campaign finance and independent organizations have figured out new ways to influence politicians, opponents of reform proclaim that the system is better off. At a minimum, they argue that money and lobbying has always been part of this nation's politics: There is nothing much to do about it and the republic has survived. Their arguments ignore the horrendous consequences that the influence of private money has on our democratic system. The opponents of reform turn a blind eye toward the substantial evidence of how the nation is creating an unequal playing field that leaves many citizens virtually disenfranchised even when they retain the precious right to vote. Policies such as the tax system are skewed toward wealthier Americans, thereby worsening the cycle of inequality from which the nation can't seem to escape. As Elizabeth Warren recounts in her new book, the big banks had overwhelming influence as policymakers handled the crash of 2008. At the most obvious level, the constant stories about the influence of money and lobbyists fuel  public skepticism about the democratic process.  The disillusionment caused by the role of money in politics  discourages political participation. But the effects are even worse than we might think. In an academic article that will make heads turn, the political scientists Martin Gilens (Princeton) and Benjamin Page (Northwestern) have found that as a result of our political processes, wealthier Americans have disproportionate influence on the kinds of public policies the government enacts. Average citizens matter, but only when they are in agreement with wealthier Americans. If not, they tend to lose. Based on a sizable database of public opinion and a study of 1,779 policy initiatives over 20 years, Gilens and Page report that a majority of Americans have little or no influence on the kinds of policies that the government produces. ""When a majority of citizens disagrees with economic elites and/or with organized interests, they generally lose."" Because of the way  our system works, wealthy interests have the ability to block changes that they oppose. Wealthy interests were almost 15 times as likely to obtain their preferences from policymakers on issues like tax policy as were ordinary citizens. This is the culmination of changes that have been taking place for several decades. The mobilization of business interests and wealthier Americans accelerated in the 1970s after the role of the federal government had expanded. As Paul Pierson and Jacob Hacker showed in their outstanding book, ""Winner Take All Politics,"" the strengthening and thickening of the organization of the corporate and financial communities in Washington resulted in highly sophisticated lobbying operations and campaign donation techniques that enhanced their ability to influence policymakers. Over the next few decades, the result was congressional decisions such as regressive   tax cuts that favored wealthier Americans (starting with Ronald Reagan's 1981 tax cut) and economic deregulations that have favored their interests, such as freeing up the financial sector in the 1990s. At the same time that wealthier interests were mobilizing to fight against campaign finance regulations put into place after Watergate, presidential candidates in both parties, including George W. Bush (in 2000, for the primary elections) and Barack Obama (in 2008, for the general election), ultimately decided to reject the publicly financed campaign system that had required them to accept spending limits. The political parties introduced new mechanisms, such as soft money, to get around regulations while the Supreme Court dismantled the 1974 reforms through a series of historic decisions. One of the most damaging results of these changes has been that the political benefits flowing to those with greater financial means worsens the economic inequality that has become such a defining part of modern times. These kinds of findings should be shocking to Americans and offer more than enough evidence about the   dangers we are unleashing through the continued dismantling of the campaign finance laws and the failure to impose serious regulations on lobbying. For all the arguments about free speech and the need to compete, we should take a close look at   a political system in which most Americans don't have a voice in the process and where, even worse, the outcomes are biased toward certain segments of the nation who can pay to play. This is one issue where the left and right, as well as the slim center, can find agreement. Given Supreme Court decisions such as FEC v. Citizens United and FEC v. McCutcheon, a constitutional amendment might be necessary if there is to be any possibility of limiting contributions and spending. In the meantime, states might become the central arena for experimenting with new reforms. Unless reform takes place, Gilens and Page have shown us that the nation is allowing money to slowly undercut the democracy that built America.","A new study shows that the wealthy have far more influence than the average American .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel and the United States on Monday blamed Syria for violent protests on the country's border with the occupied Golan Heights. The demonstrations were a provocation designed to draw international attention away from harsh reprisals against protesters in Hama and other Syrian cities, the countries said. Israeli officials said 10 people died Sunday when fire bombs thrown by protesters detonated landmines,  said Lt. Col. Avital Leibovich, an Israeli military spokeswoman. Syrian state media reported 23 protesters were killed when Israeli soldiers opened fire on demonstrators. ""There is an attempt here to incite the international community and to draw attention away from the harsh events"" in Hama, Syria, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the Knesset, Israel's parliament. More than 1,000 people have died since the Syrian government began a crackdown on demonstrators seeking government reforms, according to the United Nations. Human rights groups say 80 people died when security forces sprayed a crowd of protesters in Hama on Friday. In Sunday's demonstrations, Israeli troops used tear gas and live ammunition on members of the demonstrators only ""after using up all other means,"" Netanyahu said. The soldiers followed international law, he said. ""We stand by our rights to defend our borders, our cities and our citizens,"" he said. ""We will do it with restraint and great responsibility."" The United States defended Israel's response, said State Department spokesman Mark Toner. ""As we did previously, we condemn what appears to be an effort by the Syrian government to incite events and draw attention away from its own internal issues,"" Toner said. ""And it's clear that such behavior will not distract international attention on Syria's, Syrian government's condemnable behavior on its own citizens."" The protests came on the anniversary of the 1967 Middle East War, when Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria. The Israel Defense Forces said that Israeli troops used tear gas and live ammunition on members of an ""angered mob."" As many as 500 people took part in the demonstration, holding mid-day prayers on the Syrian side of the border, then crouching down behind ramparts that Israel constructed in response to similar demonstrations three weeks ago. The number later dropped to about 50, with protesters waving Palestinian and Syrian flags.

"A transgender rights group announced Wednesday that it has filed a discrimination complaint in Colorado on behalf of a first-grader who was born a boy but identifies as a girl. The filing stems from a decision announced last December by officials at Fountain-Fort Carson School District that Coy Mathis could no longer use the girls' bathroom at Eagleside Elementary. Mother Kathryn Mathis said she and her husband were shocked. ""We were very confused because everything was going so well, and they had been so accepting, and all of a sudden it changed and it was very confusing and very upsetting because we knew that, by doing that, she was going to go back to being unhappy,"" she told CNN. ""It was going to set her up for a lot of bad things."" Coy was born with male sex organs but has identified as female since she could express herself, her mother said. The child had attended classes during her kindergarten year with no problems and no complaints from anyone at the school, Mathis told reporters at the Colorado Capitol in Denver, where she was flanked by her husband, Jeremy, and four other children. Wearing a girl's winter coat, Coy stood behind her mother. Afraid bullies would make fun of her daughter, Kathryn Mathis said she pulled Coy out of school during winter break. ""In the end, we just want what is the best for Coy,"" Mathis said about the complaint. ""We want her to be able to go back to school and be treated equally without discrimination and harassment."" Attorney Michael Silverman of the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund, which is representing Coy, said the complaint -- which was filed with the Colorado Civil Rights Division -- is intended to have an impact beyond a single family or school. ""For many transgender people, discrimination is a daily part of life. Unfortunately for Coy, it has started very early,"" he said, adding that the complaint is a ""test of Colorado's Anti-Discrimination Act."" ""The world is going to be looking at the school,"" he said, which can ""send a message to the world and teach tolerance, fair play and equal rights."" A girl's life . For most of the past year, Coy has dressed as a girl. Coy's passport and state-issued identification recognize her as female. Transgender kids: Painful quest to be who they are . Kathryn Mathis said she got a call ""out of the blue"" from the school in December saying that Coy could use the boys' bathroom, gender-neutral faculty bathrooms or the nurse's bathroom, but not the girls' facilities. The district ""took into account not only Coy, but other students in the building, their parents and the future impact a boy with male genitals using a girls' bathroom would have as Coy grew older,"" a letter the family's attorney received in December said. ""However, I'm certain you can appreciate that, as Coy grows older and his male genitals develop along with the rest of his body, at least some parents and students are likely to become uncomfortable with his continued use of the girls' restroom."" In a statement Tuesday, the district's attorney, W. Kelly Dude, said: ""The district firmly believes it has acted reasonably and fairly with respect to this issue.  However, the district believes the appropriate and proper forum for discussing the issues identified in the charge is through the Division of Civil Rights process.  The district is preparing a response to the charge which it will submit to the division.  Therefore, the district will not comment further on this matter out of respect for the process which the parents have initiated."" ""It's sad that the Mathis family had to file a civil rights complaint in order for their daughter to be treated equally,"" said Herndon Graddick, president of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, in a statement. ""The students clearly aren't the only people at this school who need more education."" A little-studied group . Transgender children experience a disconnect between their sex, which is based on their anatomy, and their gender, which includes behaviors, roles and activities, experts say. For the general public, transgender identity may be a new concept, though many might recall Chaz Bono, the child of entertainers Sonny and Cher. Born female, Bono underwent a transition in his 40s to become a man. He wrote in his book ""Transition"" that, even as a child, he had been ""aware of a part of me that did not fit."" He appeared last year as a man on ""Dancing with the Stars,"" in part, he said, to destigmatize being transgender. Being transgender no longer a mental 'disorder' in diagnostic manual . Comprehensive data and studies about transgender children are rare. International studies have estimated that anywhere from 1 in 30,000 to 1 in 1,000 people are transgender. Some children as young as age 3 show early signs of gender dysphoria or gender identity disorder, mental health experts who work with transgender children say. These children are not intersex -- they do not have a physical disorder or malformation of their sexual organs. The gender issue exists in the brain, though experts do not agree on whether it's psychologically or physiologically based. Many transgender people report feeling discomfort with their gender as early as they can remember. Transgender job seekers face uphill battle . Gender identity is often confused with sexual orientation. The difference is that ""gender identity is who you are, and sexual orientation is who you want to have sex with,"" said Dr. Johanna Olson, a professor of clinical pediatrics at the University of Southern California, who treats transgender children. Children around age 3 are probably not interested in sexual orientation, she said. But experts say some children who look like they will be transgender in early childhood turn out to be gay, lesbian or bisexual. Differences in schools . School policies toward transgender students vary across the United States. In New York, for example, the law says students can't be discriminated against on the basis of their gender identity. But in Maine, a court ruled in November that a school district did not violate a transgender student's rights when she was told she couldn't use the girls' bathroom. Gender nonconformity is not a disorder, group says . Dude, the Colorado school district's attorney, has said there is nothing in that state requiring public schools to permit transgender students to use restrooms intended for the gender with which they identify. He added that the Fountain-Fort Carson School District adheres to the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act in all respects: ""Coy attends class as all other students, is permitted to wear girls' clothes and is referred to as the parents have requested."" She also has easy access to bathrooms other than the girls', Dude said. Coy's case will be the first to challenge a restroom restriction under the state's anti-discrimination act, the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund said. For now, the first-grader is being home-schooled. Girl Scouts accept transgender kid, provoking cookie boycott . Reaction to Coy's story . CNN's online audience has responded to this story with a range of questions and comments, with many saying the child is too young to comprehend gender differences. Mostly, posters said they felt sorrow for Coy as a child who is struggling. ""Just let the kid use the gender-neutral bathrooms. When he/she is a teen, if he is still convinced he is a girl, maybe then you can get into it with the school,"" said commenter EDM. ""This kid is going to have a hard enough life if he really is transsexual, why start fighting battles now, when he should just be blissfully ignorant""? Transgender teacher sues school for alleged discrimination . Commenter AlawJ said the story left a ""negative impression of the parents."" ""My rash view may be unfair, but I remember being that age and have helped raise 9 nieces and nephews. One wanted to be a firetruck and ran around making truck noises. Another one of the boys liked to play dress up with the girls,"" AlawJ wrote. ""My fiance's little brother always wore dresses as well. But, at the end of the day, the parents are there to be the adults and make decisions for them. ""I also am a little weary when you read a story where the parents are filing lawsuits for their 6 year old child's rights."" Editor's note: A previous version of this story quoted certain reader comments that were harshly critical of Coy's parents.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A senior Pakistani intelligence official told CNN Friday that U.S. military personnel have left a southern base said to be a key hub for American drone operations in the country's northwestern tribal areas. It is the Shamsi Air Base in Pakistan's Balochistan Province, from which drones are said to take off and where they are refueled for operations against Islamic militants. The development comes amid a public furor over American drone attacks, which have killed civilians. A suspected U.S. drone strike Friday in the Pakistani tribal region killed 25 people, including eight civilians and 17 militants, a Pakistani intelligence source said. This came after another strike on March 17 killed 44 people, most of them civilians. Yet a U.S. official disputed the Pakistani contention that civilians died in Friday's drone strike. ""There is no evidence to support that claim whatsoever,"" the U.S. official said. Another senior Pakistani intelligence official, who did not want to be identified discussing a sensitive issue, confirmed that the Americans had been using the base as a center of operations for launching drone strikes. He was not able to confirm the Americans had left. While the first official was able to confirm that American personnel were no longer operating out of the base, he could not say whether they had left voluntarily or at the request of the Pakistani government. The operation of the base -- not publicly acknowledged by the American government -- has always been presumed to have occurred with tacit Pakistani military consent. It was not clear from the Pakistani officials when the presence there began or when it ended. A U.S. military official who did not want to be identified told CNN: ""There are no U.S. forces at Shamsi Air Base in Balochistan."" He did not respond at the time or in writing to queries as to whether U.S. personnel had been based there in the past. The departure of American personnel -- if confirmed -- would be significant because of increasing strain between Islamabad and Washington sparked by the continuing drone attacks and by the Raymond Davis affair, in which a CIA contractor fatally shot two Pakistani men in a Lahore neighborhood. It has always been unclear how many drone bases the United States operates in or near Pakistan. But the Friday attack in North Waziristan that killed 25 people would indicate the United States maintains the capability to strike tribal areas with drones. Carl Forsberg, research analyst at the Institute for the Study of War think tank, said he doesn't think the alleged move will affect the effort using drones to target the Haqqani Network and other militant groups holed up in the tribal region. That's because many strikes have been conducted from closer bases, such as those across the Pakistani border in eastern Afghan provinces. He said the Pakistanis could be making the alleged move to appease a populace angry at the United States. The southern air base, he said, doesn't appear to be integral to the tribal area fight and is probably a supporting base. ""It's not like the Pakistanis shut down the program,"" he said. ""It's possible they want to do this as a means of pre-empting drone strikes in Balochistan,"" where there is a Taliban presence. ""The United States has an interest in going after the Taliban in Balochistan"" he said, and in an ideal world the United States would like to target Taliban sanctuaries in that region with drones. Also, he said, it's possible the Pakistanis are using pressure on the United States to offset any U.S. pressure on them. He said it's no coincidence that the development emerged after Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, visited Islamabad. In an interview that aired Wednesday on Pakistan's Geo TV, Mullen spoke forcefully about the Haqqani Network, which he said ""very specifically facilitates and supports the Taliban who move in Afghanistan, and they're killing Americans."" ""I can't accept that and I will do everything I possibly can to prevent that specifically,"" he said. Then Mullen said Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence ""has a longstanding relationship with the Haqqani Network. That doesn't mean everybody in the ISI, but it's there."" ""I also have an understanding that the ISI and the (Pakistani military) exist to protect their own citizens, and there's a way they have done that for a long period of time,"" Mullen said. ""I believe that over time, that's got to change."" A senior Pakistani intelligence official responded by saying, ""We do have a relationship: that of an adversary."" ""We have made our resolve very clear that (the Haqqani Network) is an enemy we need to fight together,"" said the official, who did not want to be identified discussing intelligence matters. The Pakistani intelligence official told CNN that ""we have our hands full"" fighting other Islamist militant groups along the border with Afghanistan, notably those under the umbrella of the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, ""and once we are through with them we can turn on the other (the Haqqanis). We do not have the capacity to undertake simultaneous operations."" The official said the ""onus of providing proof of this"" relationship was on the Americans and it was not up to the ISI ""to start providing clarification."" Asked if offense was taken from Mullen's remarks, the intelligence official said: ""Not personally, no."" In Friday's attack, a drone fired five missiles on a hideout in Mir Ali of North Waziristan, one of the seven districts of Pakistan's volatile tribal region bordering Afghanistan, two intelligence officials said. The officials said the militants, who were staying in the hideout, were planning to move into Afghanistan for an attack against coalition forces. The militants were local Taliban members from Orakzai agency, another district of Pakistan's tribal region, who were trained for war, the officials said. The intelligence officials asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media. But the attack also killed at least three women when one of the missiles hit a house next to the targeted compound, officials said. The Pakistani intelligence source identified the civilians killed as five women and three children. Friday's drone strike was the 20th this year compared with 111 in all of 2010, based on a CNN tally. The strike comes two days after Pakistan issued a strongly worded statement condemning deadly suspected U.S. drone strikes in the country's tribal region. ""Drone attacks have become a core irritant in the counterterror campaign,"" a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Wednesday. ""We have repeatedly said that such attacks are counterproductive and only contribute to strengthen the hands of the terrorists.""

"North Korea threatened Tuesday to nullify the armistice agreement that ended the Korean War in 1953, citing U.S.-led international moves to impose new sanctions against it over its recent nuclear test, the North's official news agency KCNA reported. Pyongyang's military said it will also cut off direct phone links with South Korea at the inter-Korean border village of Panmunjom, KCNA added. Q&A: How worried should we be about North Korea's nuclear test? North and South Korea have technically been at war for decades. The 1950-53 civil war ended in a truce rather than a peace treaty. This is not the first time Pyongyang's rhetoric has written off the armistice. In the aftermath of a previous nuclear test in 2009, it said its military would no longer be bound by the agreement because South Korea was joining a U.S.-led anti-proliferation plan. The North's latest threat comes amid new international efforts to clamp down on its weapons program. A draft U.S. resolution to authorize more sanctions against Pyongyang in response to its controversial nuclear test was formally introduced Tuesday at the U.N. Security Council by U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice. A senior Obama administration official earlier told CNN that the United States and China, a key North Korean ally, had reached a tentative deal on the wording of the proposed resolution. The two nations had been negotiating for weeks on the question. According to a Security Council diplomat familiar with the negotiations, the draft resolution contains sanctions targeting specific technology known to be used for uranium enrichment. These new sanctions go beyond those contained in existing resolutions. The draft sanctions resolution also includes restrictions on a list of luxury goods such as jewelry, yachts, luxury automobiles and racing cars, according to the diplomat. These are specifically singling out the interests of the regime's ruling elite. Some luxury goods had already been banned by a Security Council resolution prompted by North Korea's first nuclear test in 2006. For the first time, the Security Council would be pressuring North Korean diplomatic personnel, calling for vigilance on diplomats engaged in illicit activities such as moving large amounts of cash across borders. The draft sanctions resolution would aim to stop North Korean officials using diplomatic pouches to bring money back to North Korea, according to the person familiar with the negotiations. A vote on the resolution is expected later this week. The diplomat said the United States and China are satisfied with the text and see it as balanced and appropriate. The members of the Security Council may make minor technical changes, but no major changes to the resolution are expected. 'Reckless moves' There has been major concern in recent years among world powers about North Korea's nuclear aspirations. Timeline: North Korea's rocket-fueled obsession . Pyongyang continues to make ""belligerent and reckless moves that threaten the region, their neighbors and now, directly, the United States of America,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a CNN interview Tuesday. ""It's very easy for Kim Jong Un to prove his good intent here also. Just don't fire the next missile. Don't have the next test. Just say you're ready to talk,"" said Kerry, speaking on the last full day of his first international trip as the nation's top diplomat. Kim is North Korea's leader. Addressing reporters later in Qatar, Kerry again put the onus on Kim to act, saying, ""The American people and the world"" would like to see him ""take responsible actions"" for peace. ""Rather than threaten to abrogate and threaten to move in some new direction, the world would be better served"" if Kim tried to engage in legitimate dialogue, Kerry said. ""Our preference is not to brandish threats to each other. It's to get to the table"" to negotiate, he said. As a permanent member of the Security Council with veto power, China can strongly influence the body's decisions and has previously resisted strong sanctions on the Kim regime, which it props up economically. The two communist countries have been close allies since China supported the North with materiel and troops in the Korean War. The United States backed the South in the conflict, fighting side by side with its troops. In pictures: Rare glimpse inside North Korea . Analysts say Beijing wants to maintain the North as a buffer between its border and South Korea, a U.S. ally. Beijing's government on Tuesday said it strives for a ""nuclear free peninsula."" It repeated its support for the U.N. Security Council's condemnation of North Korea's nuclear tests but also called for a muted response to it. 'Paying the price' Mark Fitzpatrick, director of the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Programme at the UK-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, told CNN that while the resolution will probably not be too onerous, the fact that China went along with another U.N. sanctions measure against North Korea reflects the growing anger and disillusionment that Beijing feels toward its supposed ally. ""Kim Jong Un is now paying the price for going ahead with a nuclear test despite Chinese warnings not to create trouble during the political transition that has been under way in Beijing the past year,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""The real question, though, is the degree to which China will be willing to implement the U.N. sanctions and to impose punishment of its own. ""A sharp drop in Chinese grain sales to North Korea in January may be a sign that China's support for U.N. sanctions is more than just a symbolic punishment."" Fitzpatrick characterized North Korea's reported threat to nullify the 1953 armistice as ""largely bluster,"" pointing out that the country has ""broken the armistice many times, most recently in 2010 by sinking a South Korean corvette and shelling a South Korean-populated island."" But, he added, ""the threat does point to more trouble to come from the recalcitrant hermit kingdom. Things are going to get worse before they get better."" Military exercises . Pyongyang said the underground nuclear blast it conducted on February 12 was more powerful than its two previous detonations and used a smaller, lighter device, suggesting advances in its weapons program. It was the first nuclear test the isolated state has carried out since its young leader inherited power in December 2011 after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, who made building up North Korea's military strength the focus of his 17-year rule. Like the regime's previous tests in 2006 and 2009, the move prompted widespread international condemnation, as well as a promise of tough action at the United Nations. A Cold War response to North Korea's latest challenge . North Korea's government regularly rails against sanctions imposed on it. The staging this week of joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises, known as Foal Eagle, has added to the simmering tensions, KCNA reported Monday. It described the training exercises as ""an open declaration of a war"" in the face of repeated warnings from the North that they should not be held. The exercises have ""touched off the pent-up resentment of the service personnel and people of (North Korea) and compelled them to harden their pledge to take thousand-fold retaliation against the enemies,"" the news agency said. But the South Korean military warned Wednesday that it would respond strongly to any attack from its northern neighbor. ""If North Korea goes ahead with provocations and threatens the lives and safety of South Koreans, our military will strongly and sternly retaliate against the command and its supporting forces,"" Maj. Gen. Kim Yong-hyun, a senior official at the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a news conference, according to the semiofficial news agency Yonhap.

"Brussels, Belgium (CNN) -- NATO's North Atlantic Council on Sunday approved an operations plan that will shift the entire Libyan military mission to alliance command, officials said, easing the burden on the United States and its allies to protect civilians in the war-torn country. NATO ambassadors unanimously approved a so-called ""no-fly plus"" plan that will put the alliance in charge of protecting civilians as well as enforcing a no-fly zone and an arms embargo. ""Our goal is to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas under threat of attack from the Gadhafi regime,"" NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said. ""NATO will implement all aspects of the U.N. resolution. Nothing more, nothing less."" The new NATO mandate will begin in two to three days, NATO officials said, allowing the current coalition, led by the United States, the United Kingdom and France, to stand down. At the same time, NATO was putting the final touches on its takeover of the no-fly zone over Libya. The handover from the United States and allies should be complete by Monday. NATO officials described the transition as a phased and seamless operation. All alliance members will have to abide by the rules of engagement approved Sunday, albeit with caveats that may allow some nations not to participate in operations in Libya. However, it is assumed that none of these nations will prevent other alliance members from executing the military plan and rules of engagement that were approved. A senior U.S. administration official spoke to reporters soon after the announcement. He stressed the NATO mission is to protect civilians and did not rule out the possibility of an attack on the rebels if they were to go on the offensive and strike cities with civilian populations, now held by pro-Gadhafi forces. The official also said he expected more countries to participate in the Libyan mission now that NATO has assumed command of it. He praised the speed with which the group of 28 allies reached a consensus. The office of British Prime Minister David Cameron similarly cheered the news of a NATO agreement. ""NATO is already enforcing the arms embargo and the no-fly zone. Today's agreement to transfer complete command and control of all military operations to NATO both ensures that partners from the region are able to participate and represents a significant step forward as we plan for the next phase of this vital mission,"" it read.","NATO agrees to take on all Libya operations .

"Saudi Arabia's government made what may be its first official reaction to a campaign calling on Saudi women to defy the country's de facto driving ban on Saturday, saying the kingdom's ""laws will be fully enforced"" that day. However, an influential supporter of the campaign said she believes the statement is not aimed at women who plan to drive, but at others who might consider that a good day to stage demonstrations of their own in a nation where protests are outlawed and gatherings are tightly controlled. The Interior Ministry issued the statement Wednesday on SPA, Saudi Arabia's official news agency. Addressing what it called ""rumors exchanged over social networks and some media outlets calling for congregations and marches,"" the Interior Ministry said that ""the laws of the Kingdom prohibit activities disturbing the public peace and opening venues to sedition."" Saudi blogger and opinion writer Tamador Alyami, a supporter of the campaign who recently posted a video showing her driving in the city of Jedda, noted that a Twitter account supporting Saudi political prisoners recently ""tweeted a message saying you have to take advantage of this day, that it's an opportunity to go out there and demonstrate and ask for the rights of the political prisoners."" ""As soon as I read the Interior Ministry statement, I was sure the message was meant for them, not for those who will go out to drive,"" she said, adding that women drivers will not be demonstrating that day. No traffic law specifically prohibits women from driving in Saudi Arabia, but religious edicts there are often interpreted to mean women are not allowed to operate a vehicle. Saudi cleric warns driving could damage women's ovaries . In late September, an online movement was launched urging Saudi women to get behind the wheel. The October 26th Women's Driving Campaign quickly gained momentum, with its online petition having so far garnered over 16,000 signatures. In addition, numerous Saudi women have already taken to the streets -- filming themselves driving through the streets of various cities, and then uploading those videos to YouTube. The language of the Interior Ministry's statement ""shows that it wasn't really about the 26th of October movement,"" Alyami said. ""They've known about this campaign for a few months and there's been no attempt to stop (it). If they've let it go this far, that should reassure us."" Indeed, many women who have been out driving report having been spotted by traffic police who haven't stopped them. Alyami said she drove her car again on Wednesday to her parents' house and passed two traffic policemen. ""One of the traffic policemen saw me and didn't stop me. I was scared, but when he just drove by and went away, I felt so happy, so reassured and more determined than ever to go out on the 26th.""

"Paris (CNN) -- In a rare public spat, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev criticized his political mentor, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, for Putin's comments over the use of force against Libya. It all started Monday, when Putin visited the town of Votkinsk, where a large defense plant that produces missiles (including nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles) is located. Criticizing the United Nations Security Council resolution authorizing a no-fly zone over Libya and military action to back it up, Putin called it ""obviously incomplete and flawed."" Putin said it's clear that ""it allows anyone to do anything they want -- to take any actions against a sovereign state."" ""It resembles a medieval appeal for a crusade in which somebody calls upon somebody to go to a certain place and liberate it,"" he said. On Thursday, acting on instructions from Medvedev, Russia abstained from the U.N. Security Council resolution imposing a no-fly zone over Libya but did not veto it, something that Putin obviously thought should have happened. A few hours later Medvedev weighed in, scolding Putin's comments, without using the prime minister's name. ""It is absolutely inexcusable to use expressions that, in effect, lead to a clash of civilizations -- such as 'crusades,' and so on. That is unacceptable,"" he said. Otherwise ""everything could end up in far worse shape than it is now. It is important to remember this."" Medvedev went on: ""All that is now happening in Libya is the result of the appalling behavior of the Libyan leadership and the crimes it committed against its own people."" He did not instruct his diplomats to veto the resolution, he said, ""for one reason: I do not consider this resolution to be wrong. Moreover, I believe that this resolution generally reflects our understanding of what is going on in Libya."" The public smackdown was political catnip in Moscow. The two men, whom Russians refer to as ""the tandem,"" both could be candidates for president in 2012 but neither is announcing yet he will run. Speculation is rife over who might go first -- and when. Medvedev has developed a close working relationship with President Barack Obama but Putin has a prickly relationship with Washington. At the factory Monday, Putin took aim not only at Medvedev's refusal to use his veto, but at the U.S. leadership: . ""In Bill Clinton's times,"" Putin said, ""Yugoslavia and Belgrade were bombed. Bush sent armed forces into Afghanistan. A far-fetched and totally false pretext was used to invade Iraq, and the entire Iraqi leadership was eliminated, even children in Saddam Hussein's family died. ""And now, it's Libya's turn -- under the pretext of protecting civilians. But it's the civilian population who dies during those airstrikes against (Libyan) territory. Where is the logic and the conscience? There is neither.""","Prime minister raps U.N. resolution, refers to ""crusade""
Presidents calls comments ""unacceptable""
Both could run for president next year ."
"The Internal Revenue Service targeted liberal groups as well as conservatives seeking tax-exempt status, a Democratic congressman charged on Monday after the agency acknowledged the inappropriate practice continued until last month. Rep. Sander Levin said the term ""progressives"" was included on IRS screening lists of applicants for tax-exempt status made available to Congress on Monday. It was the first confirmation that the ""Be on the Lookout"" or BOLO lists used criteria targeting liberal groups after an inspector general's report made public last month said the IRS had used words such as ""tea party"" to determine possible extra scrutiny. Earlier, the first substantive review of the controversy by the IRS showed the agency used multiple lists of inappropriate criteria in assessing tax-exempt applications up until this month, more than a year later than previously revealed. Daniel Werfel, the IRS acting commissioner, provided no details of what inappropriate criteria were on the lists, but said ""there was a wide-ranging set of categories and cases that spanned a broad spectrum."" The practice of using BOLO lists in considering tax-exempt applications has been suspended, Werfel told reporters. Shifting polls contradict key deposition . Levin's disclosure that progressive groups also were targeted follows a liberal claim that their side also  came under extra scrutiny based on political titles or other language in their applications. In a statement, the Michigan Democrat  questioned why the Treasury inspector general who initially disclosed the IRS targeting, J. Russell George, focused only on BOLO lists that contained conservative labels. The inspector general's report ""served as the basis and impetus for a wide range of congressional investigations, and this new information shows that the foundation of those investigations is flawed in a fundamental way,"" Levin's statement said. A spokesperson for George later responded that the report focused only on BOLO criteria used to refer cases for extra scrutiny of potential political activity that would make groups ineligible for tax-exempt status. Conservative groups complained about their applications being delayed for months and even years, receiving demands for inappropriate questioning from the IRS. Republicans have claimed the controversy amounted to political retribution against enemies of the administration, an accusation denied by the White House and the IRS. In response to Levin's statement, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Dave Camp said the inclusion of ""progressives"" on a BOLO list did not prove that liberal groups underwent the same extra scrutiny of conservative groups cited in the inspector general's report. CNN Poll: Did White House order IRS targeting? Political firestorm . The controversy that became public last month with the release of George's report ignited a political firestorm in Washington while fueling conservative mistrust of President Barack Obama's administration. Use of some lists of conservative labels for further screening stopped in May 2012 when IRS officials were first notified of the practice. However, Werfel's review showed that other inappropriate lists continued to be used until as recently as this month by the unit that handles tax-exempt applications. Werfel was informed on June 12, 2013, that other BOLO lists were still in use. He immediately suspended use of any BOLO lists by the unit that handles tax-exempt applications, his review said. He noted that his investigation, while still incomplete, found no evidence so far of intentional wrongdoing by IRS personnel, involvement by anyone outside the IRS or that targeting extended into other areas of the agency. ""Several key leaders, including some in the commissioner's office, failed in multiple capacities to meet their managerial responsibilities at various points during the course of these events,"" Werfel's report said. ""Most notably, there was insufficient action by these leaders to identify, prevent, address, and disclose the problematic situation that materialized with the review of applications for tax exempt status."" Remember that IRS scandal . . . ? Five IRS managers have been replaced, from the previous acting commissioner whom Werfel succeeded to the head of the unit based in Cincinnati that handles tax-exempt applications. In addition, Werfel created an Accountability Review Board to recommend within 60 days ""any additional personnel actions necessary to hold accountable those responsible"" for the targeting disclosed by the inspector general's report. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday that Obama believes Werfel's report ""is an important step in ensuring accountability for any staff that acted inappropriately, identifies the failures in their systems that allowed the misconduct to happen, and takes a forward-looking systemic view at the agency's management."" The White House ordered the review by Werfel when he started the job on May 22 in the aftermath of George's audit that found targeting of some conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. Werfel was given 30 days to complete the review, and the House Ways and Means Committee has scheduled a hearing for Thursday on the report, with Werfel as the lone witness. Read IRS watchdog's report . Series of investigations . The targeting scandal and a separate inspector general's report that documented wasteful spending on IRS conferences in past years have led to a series of investigations of the tax collection agency by Congress, the Department of Justice, the tax administration inspector general's office and Werfel. The IRS admitted there was unfair targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status starting in 2010, but officials said the action was a bureaucratic shortcut in its Cincinnati office rather than an exercise of political bias. IRS targeting: Scandal or snafu? In his report that disclosed the misconduct, George said there was no evidence of a political motive. However, George is continuing to investigate the matter, along with the FBI and the congressional committees. Republicans argue the controversy is proof that the administration and progressive groups have been trying to clamp down on those who disagree with Obama's agenda. Camp, a Michigan Republican, said Monday that the IRS ""still needs to provide clear answers to the most significant questions -- who started this practice, why was it allowed to continue for so long, and how widespread was it?"" ""This culture of political discrimination and intimidation goes far beyond basic management failure and personnel changes alone won't fix a broken IRS,"" Camp said in a statement that promised continued investigation. As part of his review, Werfel said 80 groups awaiting IRS action on their applications for tax exempt status for more than 120 days could self-register with the agency as long as they certified under penalty of perjury that they would comply with applicable laws and regulations. McConnell: Obama administration marked by 'culture of intimidation' At the heart of the matter is what kind of organization can qualify for tax-exempt status. Regulations limit such status to groups primarily involved in social welfare activities, while political groups are considered ineligible. Confusion over defining what constitutes political activity versus social welfare activity contributed to the targeting by the IRS, Werfel said. An IRS statement on Monday said the ""safe-harbor"" option for self-certification would apply to groups that ""certify they devote 60% or more of both their spending and time on activities that promote social welfare."" ""At the same time, they must certify that political campaign intervention involves 40% or less of both their spending and time,"" the statement said. Applicants meeting those thresholds would get approval within two weeks of seeking self-certification, it said. Werfel said the IRS would continue checking on tax-exempt groups to ensure they were following the law. Earlier: What's a 501(c)(4)?","The IRS targeting was more widespread than previously revealed .
