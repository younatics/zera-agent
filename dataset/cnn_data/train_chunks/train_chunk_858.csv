"By . Darren Boyle . An extreme sports fan decided to propose to his girlfriend mid-way through a parachute jump but ended up fumbling the ring while she watched in horror as it tumbled uncontrollably to earth. Brandon Strohbehn and his girlfriend Nicole Nepomuceno used a special type of tandem jump where they face each other as they leaped from the aircraft while12,500ft above California. Nicole wrapped her legs around the firefighter's waist and strapped herself to his harness before exiting the plane. Scroll down for video . Nicole Nepomuceno smiles as her boyfriend Bandon Stohbehn produces an engagement ring as he proposes mid-way through a 12,500ft parachute drop . Brandon turns the ring towards his girlfriend Nicole so she could get a better look while floating down to earth . Nicole's joy is short-lived when the ring gets caught in the slip stream and is ripped from Brandon's grasp . On the way down, Brandon, from Oceanside, California, pulled a ring from his jump suit's pocket, opening the box so his girlfriend could inspect it. As he was about to hand over the ring, it 'slipped' from his grasp and plunged to earth. Brandon filmed the jump from a special helmet mounted camera and caught his girlfriend's reaction as she saw the ring float for a second in mid air before tumbling out of control. Before the jump, Mr Strohbehn arranged with members of the two families to hide around the landing zone with the genuine ring. He said: . 'The original plan was to do it out of a hot air balloon. I had a bunch . of friends helping with the coordination and helping to keep Nicole from . knowing what was going on. 'We . actually had planned it as a going away jump for a friend that was . heading to North Dakota - it was the perfect cover, Nicole had no idea. 'The . balloon jump got canceled multiple times due to weather so I was fed . up. I wasn't gonna let another weather hold keep me from asking her to . marry me.' He said: 'So, two months after the . original planned balloon jump, we had a ""birthday boogie"" for Nicole's . birthday at Skydive San Diego. 'Our plan was to jump the whole weekend and camp down there. So I decided this would be the perfect time to make this happen. 'Maybe even a good birthday present. So we came up with the Mr. Bill plan. 'I got a . fake ring, knowing that I was going to drop it on our Mr. Bill high pull . at 12,500ft. Then I called all her family and coordinated - with the . help of her brother-in-law and my brother - them to come down on the day . I was going to propose. 'We . even had a special staging area in one of the classrooms that my . brother would escort them to so Nicole wouldn't see any of her family . there and get suspicious. 'Then, . once we got on the plane that was taking us up for our proposal jump, . my brother had all of her family and my family come out and wait for us . to land. 'She . was super surprised and couldn't believe all her family was there. In . the end, it ended up being a great thing that the balloon jumps were . canceled because it gave us a chance to have all of our family there to . celebrate with us for this epic day.' Once safely on the ground, Brandon produces the real engagement ring as he bends down on one knee . Luckily this time there was no mistake as Nicole agrees to marry Brandon despite the high altitude prank . Brandon Strohbehn holds his wife after the second proposal in the same position they completed their 12,500ft parachute jump . The couple now have 224 skydives each under their belts, although they almost failed to get together in the first place. Friends insisted that the pair were a perfect match, but they resisted all attempts to be set up on a blind date. Brandon . added: 'Neither of us wanted to be set up on a blind date, so when we . first met at a country bar just by chance, I think we both wanted to . make sure that it was clear we were not interested in what our friends . were trying to force us into. 'But, . as it turns out, we were both attracted to each other but didn't want . to admit it yet. It didn't take too long after for us to start ""running . into each other"" more often. 'Our first unofficial first date was snowboarding up at Big Bear - a local mountain in San Bernardino. 'We . were just going ""as friends"", so it was by no means a ""real"" date, but . we both knew what it was. Not too long after, we started officially . dating.' After dropping the ring, Brandon unfurled a banner asking Nicole to marry him as they continued their descent . Once on the ground, Brandon and Nicole showed off the banner containing the proposal . The fun-loving couple have both completed 224 parachute jumps in the 18 months they have been going out .","Brandon Strohbehn waited two months for the right weather to propose .

"By . Darren Boyle . A drunk teenager who broke a policeman's leg leg in a brutal late-night attack outside a city centre nightclub after going 'berserk' has been jailed for 28 months. Mohammed Labead, 19, seriously injured PC Lee Wilson, 42, as he went to the aid of colleague Sgt Rachael Shearing after an assault on a girl. Labead, of Norwich, yesterday admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm on PC Wilson without intent on January 19 this year. Scroll down for video . PC Lee Wilson attempts to grapple with Mohammed Labead outside Mojo's nightclub in Norwich in January . Labead managed to break free from PC Wilson's grip and started pushing him towards the corner . During the struggle Labead forces PC Wilson to the ground where he suffers a vertical fracture to his tibea . PC Wilson said he was frightened by the level of aggression shown by Labead during the late night attack . Labead also admitted a count of assault by beating over Sgt Shearing and another assault by beating on the same night. Guy Ayers, prosecuting, said trouble erupted as a crowd of young women gathered late at night outside Mojo's club in Norwich. Mr Ayers said Labead and his friends were 'boisterous' and 'aggressive' towards them. The 19-year-old grabbed one of the girls with both hands to the face and pushed her backwards. Mr Ayers said she was 'rightened' and 'distraught' and had one of her earrings yanked out. Sgt Shearing dashed to the scene but was verbally abused by Labead. They scuffled and PC Wilson went to help her, Norwich Crown Court heard. PC Lee Wilson, right, said Mohammed Labead 'went berserk' when he tried to arrest the teenager . Mr Ayers said the PC Wilson, who has 23 years experience, found Labead 'extremely aggressive' and was 'frightened' by his 'level of aggression'. PC Wilson was wrestled to the ground as he fought to restrain Labead and suffered a badly broken leg. It was a vertical fracture to the right tibia which required major surgery including the fitting of a metal pin to stabilise the break. The assault was captured on CCTV. Mr Ayers said Labead had no previous convictions but had a caution for assaulting a constable in 2013. PC Wilson read out an emotional victim impact statement in court. PC Wilson, pictured, told Norwich Crown Court that his five-year-old son has nightmares of daddy being 'hurt by that bad man' He said his recovery had been 'slow' and 'painful' and he suffered pain every day as a result of being attacked. Norwich-based PC Wilson said: 'Due to my age, both my physiotherapist and doctor have intimated it is likely I will suffer from arthritis in the knee within 10 years which will undoubtedly affect my career.' He said the attack had an impact on his two-year-old daughter and five-year-old son. 'My son knows his daddy is a police officer, he sees me as indestructible - it was hard to see him so upset when he saw that I'd been hurt. 'In the first few weeks after leaving hospital I was unable to climb the stairs to tuck them into bed, read a bedtime story and worst of all, unable to comfort my son after his nightmares of daddy being ""hurt by that bad man"".' Judge Stephen Holt jailed Labead for 28 months in a young offenders institution. Judge Holt told the court: 'He is a police officer out there in the community doing his duty, keeping us, the public, safe and police officers must expect and will get support from the courts in these sorts of cases.' Matthew McNiff, defending, said Labead felt 'sick', 'saddened' and 'ashamed'. Mr McNiff said he pleaded guilty at the first opportunity to what was a 'drunken, stupid reaction not a drunken, deliberate action'. He said Labead was young and 'deeply immature' and insisted there was a 'lack of premeditation'. Speaking after the hearing, PC Wilson welcomed the sentence. 'I've served as a police officer for 23 years, suffered bruises and broken ribs but nothing like this. 'It was completely uncalled for - he just went berserk,' he said. PC Wilson suffered a vertical fracture of the right tibia, left, which required a major operation. Orthopaedic surgeons were forced to install a metal pin into PC Wilson's leg, right, to stabalise the unusual break . 'There is no justification for that level of violence, especially against people who are there to protect genuine members of the public who want to have a safe and enjoyable night out. 'The majority of people want to have a safe night out but with some people there's been a noticeable decline in the attitude towards police. 'Nothing appears to be off-limits from verbal abuse to spitting to being assaulted. 'This type of behaviour is dealt with robustly but we shouldn't need to when all we're there to do is ensure people have a safe night out.' The late night attack happened outside Mojo's nightclub in Norwich, pictured and was captured on CCTV which helped with Labead's prosecution . Supt Dave Marshall, of Norfolk Police, said last night: 'It's distressing to see one of your officers injured and with such severity in this case. 'We accept, with the job we do, there will be occasions where you suffer injuries but not to this extent. 'PC Wilson was simply trying to do his job and help a colleague when Labead lashed out, injuring both officers. 'Labead has quite rightly received a custodial sentence for such an aggressive response to our presence while trying to resolve a separate dispute. 'Hopefully this case demonstrates that violence in the night time economy, whether towards a member of the public or a police officer, is not acceptable.' Temporary Norfolk Assistant Chief Constable, Nick Dean, said: 'Officers on the frontline routinely face danger - it's the nature of the job. 'However, to attack anyone in this way, including a police officer, is a serious matter and the sentence shows the courts will not tolerate such despicable behaviour.'","Mohammed Labead broke PC Lee Wilson's leg during a late night attack .

"By . Belinda Robinson . Suspect: Tiniko Thompson, 46, is alleged to have killed her boyfriend Carl Patrick, 53, a Miami police officer in his Pembroke Pines, Florida home on May 9 . The girlfriend of a Miami police officer who was found shot to death in his home has been arrested. Tiniko Thompson, 46, is alleged to have killed her boyfriend Carl Patrick, 53, in his Pembroke Pines, Florida home on May 9. Police officers found a chilling note along with the body, reading, 'It was an accident, we had a fight.' According to officers, Mr Patricks' body was found earlier this month in his bedroom under burned bedding. They described the scene as being 'consistent with something being lit on fire' and reveal he was still dressed in his police uniform. Mr Patrick's former girlfriend, Ms Thompson has been arrested in connection with the murder, according to police. She made her first appearance in court on Thursday on second-degree murder charges. Ms Thompson is alleged to have killed Mr Patrick and left him . to die at home while he fled the scene stealing his mobile phone and . fleeing. Two days later, her mother reported her to . the police after she threatened to commit suicide. It was then that Patrick's body was . discovered in his Pembroke Pines home. When officers examined the house, they found a note in the kitchen that read, 'It was an accident, we had a fight.' Death: Mr Patrick's body was found earlier this month in his bedroom under burned bedding in his home in Florida . Yet, when Ms Thompson . was brought in for questioning after his death she told officers that he had shot . himself. She described how they were fighting when his gun went off. 'It went POW! And that was it,' she . recalled of the single gunshot that eventually ended his life. 'He . called me a b****. He said, 'You b****.' She went on to say that the 25-year Miami police veteran was 'abusive' towards her. She tearfully told NBC news: 'He scared me. I don't know what else to say.' In court: The 46-year-old made her first court appearance Thursday while facing charges of second-degree murder . However, it is not clear how Mr Patrick would have been able to shoot himself. The medical . examiner determined that the bullet-wound didn't match up . with how he would have shot a gun at himself, as he would have used his right-hand to fire the gun. Ms Thompson said she had left the scene and went to live . in her car for the next several days. But police said that they found another note in her vehicle like the one found in the kitchen, which told how she was too scared to call police after what happened. According to a medial examiner, Mr Patrick's life could have been saved if he had received immediate medical attention. His death has been ruled a murder (homicide.) Arrested: Ms Thompson said that Mr Patrick had shot himself - she described him as abusive and said that she was scared of him .","Tiniko Thompson, 46, is alleged to have killed her boyfriend Carl Patrick, 53, .

"By . Belinda Robinson . A pensioner kept 18 cats, five rabbits and three dogs living in squalid conditions and refused to allow the RSPCA to inspect his home. But when inspectors did manage to enter the house they found a total of 26 animals, some deprived of water living in appalling conditions in Hunts Cross, Liverpool. The house belonged to Raymond Coll, 66, who claimed he did not live at the property but was a builder carrying out maintenance work while the owners were away. Neglect: This chaotic scene greeted RSPCA inspectors when they went to  Raymond Coll's property in Liverpool . Squalor: A total of 18 cats were removed from the squalid house where they were treated cruelly by owner Raymond Coll of Liverpool . Backyard: RSPCA inspectors uncovered three dogs including this . traumatized, wide-eyed dog, right, living in terrible conditions at the . house in Hunts Cross, Liverpool . However, it later emerged that he had lived at the property with his wife for 16 years and had even shoved a female inspector out of the door and locked her out at one point. Liverpool Magistrates’ Court heard that RSPCA officers were alerted by a concerned member of public to the presence of animals being kept in dreadful conditions. They discovered three dogs without any water in the back garden, which was littered with building materials. Officials also found a large number of cats hidden in cages in a small utility room and in dark cupboards without natural light, litter trays, ventilation, food or water. Chaos: The kitchen inside the house is littered with pots and pans and a cat can be seen walking on the counter - Coll was found guilty of six counts of animal cruelty . House: A total of 18 cats, five rabbits, right, and three dogs were removed from the squalid conditions . Speaking in court, RSPCA inspector Louise Showering revealed the property was 'very untidy and unkempt'. There were large amounts of household waste and building materials scattered around but she also said there was no sign of any building work taking place at the property. Inspector Showering added: 'It was a hazardous environment not suitable for animals.' She told Mail Online: 'There were animals all over the place.' 'They seemed to have gone to great lengths to make cubby holes to hide them away in, even in the gap in the back of a freezer where the motor would have been. 'It was very chaotic and not a suitable environment for any animal to be living in. 'This case was the largest number of animals I have ever seen in one place.' The RSPCA said they were called to the home in August last year and since then, all the . animals have been signed over to them. District Judge Ian Lomax found Mr Coll guilty of six offences under the Animal Welfare Act, including failing to meet the animals’ need for a suitable environment. Mr Coll, who failed to appear in court, was also found guilty of failing to meet their need for a constant supply of fresh drinking water. Judge Lomax said he was satisfied the offender had a connection with the property and that he had been 'evasive' throughout the proceedings. He is due to be sentenced on June 12 and a warrant will be issued for his arrest if he fails to appear in court. All the animals have since been re-homed. Mr Coll was found . guilty in his absence of six counts of failing to meet the needs of 26 . animals all contrary to section 9 of the Animal Welfare Act. 1 - Failed to meet the needs of five cats by providing a suitable environment.2 - Failed to meet the needs of three dogs by providing a suitable environment3 - Failed to meet the needs of 18 cats by providing a suitable environment4 - Failed to meet the needs of seven cats by housing them away from other animals5 - Failed to protect 11 cats from suffering by controlling and treating fleas6 - Failing to provide a constant supply of fresh drinking water to seven cats .","Inspectors found animals in appalling conditions at the house in Liverpool .

"By . Fiona Macrae . The key to good taste lies in your genes rather than your tongue. It has long been known that some people are more sensitive to the bitter taste of broccoli and Brussels sprouts. And many believed this was because these ‘super-tasters’ have so many taste buds that their tongue is extra bumpy. A study has disproved the long-held belief that people with 'bumpy' tongues are hyper-sensitive to taste . The theory has also been used to explain why some people don’t like spicy food or why some children are picky eaters. Now, a study has shown that having a bumpy tongue doesn’t affect the ability to taste – at least where bitterness is concerned. However, a person’s genes are important, the journal Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience reports. Researcher Nicole Garneau, of the Denver Museum of Nature & Science in US, made the connection after asking hundreds of museum visitors to stick out their tongues. The bitter taste of broccoli can be detected by anyone regardless of how bumpy their tongue is . After rating their bumpiness, she checked . the volunteers’ sensitivity to bitter chemicals and analysed their DNA . for genes involved in detecting sharp tastes. She said: ‘There is a long-held belief that if you stick out your tongue and look at the bumps on it, then you can predict how sensitive you are to strong tastes like bitterness in vegetables and strong sensations like spiciness. ‘The commonly accepted theory has been that the more bumps you have, the more taste buds you have and therefore the more sensitive you are. ‘No matter how we looked at the data, we couldn’t replicate this long-held assumption.’","Study claims to disprove theory that bumpy tongues are hyper-sensitive .
Many believed this was a physical sign a person had more taste buds .
US researchers found it does not make foods taste more bitter or spicy ."
"By . Belinda Robinson . A group of MPs and parliamentary candidates are calling on the Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg to step down in the wake of a bruising at the ballot box. The group, which includes would-be Liberal Democrat MP for Winchester - Jackie Porter - have joined dozens of party members adding their names to an online letter urging the Deputy Prime Minister to step aside. But Mr Clegg insisted on Friday that he would not quit despite a round of disappointing results which led to more than 250 of the party's councillors losing their seats in local elections in England. Staying power: Mr Clegg insists that he will not quit despite a round of disappointing results which led to more than 250 Lib Dem councillors losing their seats in local elections in England . Yet even the party leader acknowledged that the party is at risk of losing every one of its 11 MEPs when European election results are declared tonight, putting him under even more pressure to go. Jackie Porter, who is set to fight the Tory-held target seat of Winchester in next May's general election, said the party was 'not going forward with a clear strategy'. The county councillor said the party's achievements were overshadowed because Mr Clegg 'allowed himself to be portrayed as just another pea out of the same pod' as David Cameron and Ed Miliband. In order to win back support, the party needed to demonstrate it was different, she suggested. Reservations: MPs John Pugh, left, described the Lib Dem's local election defeats as 'abysmal' while John Hemming, right, said he was 'not an enthusiastic fan of Nick's leadership' She declined to say who she would like to see take Mr Clegg's place. Ms Porter is one of more than 250 to have signed up to the online LibDems4Change campaign which has published an open letter to Mr Clegg. It says voters have delivered a 'stark message about the party's performance and direction'. 'We consider it vital that at the 2015 General Election the Party should be led by someone who will receive a fair hearing about our achievements and ambitions for the future,' it says. 'It is clear to us that this person is not you, as the loss of so many of our hard-working councillors highlights . 'You have fulfilled a range of objectives in Government, but we now believe that progress will be best achieved under a new leader. 'We therefore ask that you stand down, allowing the membership to select your successor this summer.' Under existing rules, if Mr Clegg refuses to quit, a leadership contest would be triggered if 75 local party associations formally demand one or a majority of the parliamentary party approves a no confidence motion. Nigel Farage: In Thursday's elections, the Lib Dems lost control in Portsmouth following gains by Ukip . MP John . Pugh - while falling short of calling on Mr Clegg to go - described the . local election defeats as 'abysmal' and said they were 'mostly due to . national unpopularity'. 'The . high command is in danger of seeming like generals at the Somme - . repeatedly sending others over the top while being safely ensconced in . Westminster and claiming the carnage is all somehow sadly inevitable,' he told the BBC. Ros Kayes, the candidate in West Dorset, is another to have put her name to the letter. In Thursday's elections, the Tories took charge of Kingston Council - the back yard of Energy Secretary Ed Davey - and the Lib Dems lost control in Portsmouth following gains by Ukip. As the scale of the losses became clear, Mr Clegg said he would 'absolutely not' resign, and insisted the Lib Dems were still succeeding where they focused on their achievements in coalition. He blamed a wider 'anti-politics mood' but his party has seen its opinion poll ratings at consistently low levels since joining the Conservative-led coalition. Mr Clegg has said it is 'flamingly obvious' that being part of the Government had damaged the party's chances. Mr Pugh told The Independent on Sunday that the party was to hold a 'root-and-branch look at our current strategy, including how and by whom it is presented'. 'I canvassed a number of backbench colleagues in the run-up to the elections and two very strong themes emerged. New leader? Former MP Sandra Gidley has backed Business Secretary Vince Cable to take over as an interim leader as he has been shown to be independent-minded within the coalition . 'There was a widespread view that no matter how much Nick spoke there was a section of the electorate that would not give him a fair hearing. 'But equally, there was a need to avoid any civil war in the party.' He said the party appeared to have moved from an aggressive footing to a 'less sustainable and more negative approach of digging in in our constituency trenches'. 'We need to try to improve the national profile and try not to make Nick such an obvious target. It's the elephant in the room and the party can't ignore it.' A Liberal Democrat spokesman played down the significance of a review being carried out in the coming days - insisting it was standard practice to take stock after elections. Another MP, John Hemming, said he would consider 'whether any action is needed' when Parliament returned on June 4 and said he was 'not an enthusiastic fan of Nick's leadership'. However, former MP Sandra Gidley has backed Business Secretary Vince Cable to take over as an interim leader as he 'has been shown to be independent-minded within the coalition'. She told Sky News: 'What we need over the next year is somebody to lead the party who is credible, who has questioned the coalition in the past, not seen to be in a love-in with David Cameron and has the confidence of the party.' 'We should be making more of a case for what we have done in the coalition and we are not able to do that at the moment while we have Nick, as a leader, associated with some of the negative aspects of the coalition - the broken promises. 'It's not easy to say this because Nick did a stonking job for us at the last election but I do not think he is the right face for the Liberal Democrats at the next election and many others sadly agree.' Mr Cable 'would be a very good choice', she said. 'Then we see what we've got left after the General Election - the young turks can fight it out after a sensible period of time,' she said. Liberal Democrat Party President Tim Farron told the programme: 'Nick Clegg should undoubtedly stay and the Lib Dems should stay the course in Government. 'But that does not mean that we dismiss the concerns of the folks who made their views known.' Unlike the 'spineless' other leaders, Mr Clegg had been 'the only one with the bottle and the backbone to stand up to Nigel Farage', he said.","Dozens of Liberal Democrat MPs have signed an online letter urging Mr Clegg to step down .

The healthy monkeys include a five-week-old baby, who is being monitored closely. Mr Najarian said that the deaths could be attributed to necropsy, however, results were inconclusive and the zoo awaits a pathology report on tissue samples. Metro spokesman Jim Middaugh told The Oregonian that the monkeys came from the East Coast, but he did not know exactly where from. The Oregon zoo has faced a series of problems in recent months. Kim Smith, the director of the zoo and veterinarian Mitch Finnegan were fired in early May following an investigation that found sloppy mistakes in the treatment of an orangutan that died in January.

"By . Belinda Robinson . Dead: Police were searching for . Julian Paris, 54, who allegedly shot dead his wife at a crowded park in Florida . The dead body of a man wanted by police in Florida for allegedly murdering his wife in front of their kids has been found. Julian Paris, 54, was wanted by police after he callously shot his wife Liza Nicole Adderly, 34, dead at Dr. Phillips Community Park in Orlando in front of their three children. However, Orange County officers confirmed that Mr Paris had been found dead by family members from a self-inflected gunshot wound, next to his late son's grave at Woodlawn Cemetery. Mr Paris had been on the run since May 7 after investigators said he fatally shot his wife at 4.20pm in broad daylight. Ms Adderly had taken her three children to a play date with another family when Paris showed up, officers said. He then shot and killed his wife in front of their shocked children who were standing next to their mother and are aged four, 13 and 15. Eyewitnesses said the suspect fled from the park in a white Kia Spectra compact hatchback, with the Florida number plate K259IV. The couple’s three children watched as their dad sped away from the parking lot wearing a red fedora and red T-shirt, according to a witness. Shocked onlookers along with the couple's children were among the first to dial 911 for emergency services to get help after the horror at the park unfolded. Murder scene: Police were searching for a Florida man who brazenly shot his wife to death at a crowded park in Orlando  but he was later found dead . Sheriff’s spokesman Jeff Williamson said: 'It shows how . brazen he was to come here in broad daylight and shoot this woman in . broad daylight in front of multiple witnesses, including juveniles.' 'I think it says a lot about . the person and the crime itself. It’s heinous,' he added. Mr Paris had several aliases, but his given name was Rick Adderly, according to his family. The couple had a history of domestic abuse and officers were called out to an incident between the pair two hours before Mrs Adderly was killed. On Wednesday, the 34-year-old mother of three was shoved by Mr Paris during a meeting at his job as an irrigation worker, according to the Orange County Sheriff’s Office. Ms Adderly was so distraught that she went back to her car, screaming for help, say police officers. She was shot to death just a few hours later. Orange County police officers launched a widespread manhunt for the 54-year-old but his daughter found him dead at 7.20p.m. on May 8. Investigators are still trying to determine why he killed himself. In happier times: Rick Adderly (also known as Julian Paris), his wife Liza Nicole Adderly and their children pose together in a group shot at the beach . Police line:  Julian Paris, 54, had fled the park in a white Kia Spectra watched by his three kids . After more than 16 years of marriage, the couple separated a month before the killing. Relatives said that the graveside where Mr Paris was found dead belonged to their 17-year-old son - who was their eldest - but had been hit by a car and killed in January . 2012. Jane Watrel of the Orange County Sheriff's Office said: 'You all know that he was going through a separation, but we do not know why he took this extreme drastic measure. 'We got the call around 7:25 p.m [from] family who called saying they found the body of Mr Paris at his son's grave.' The tragic couple married in 1998, when she was 18 and her husband 38. Deputies are still looking for the deceased man's car. Adrianna Adderlini, . 23, a relative through marriage told The Orlando Sentinel: 'This is very surprising because they've been so good after the death of . their son — just holding their family strong.' The couple leave behind their three surviving children.","Mr Paris, 54, died from a single self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head .

"By . Rebecca Evans . Probe: Glaxo's China boss Mark Reilly was caught on camera having sex with his Chinese girlfriend . A covert sex tape involving a senior executive and his Chinese lover was the trigger for a major investigation into corruption at British drugs giant GlaxoSmith-Kline, it was revealed yesterday. The video of married Mark Reilly and his girlfriend was filmed by secret camera and emailed anonymously to board members of the pharmaceutical firm. It led to an investigation that has rocked the £76billion company – which stands accused of bribing doctors and other health officials in China with £320million of gifts, including sexual favours from prostitutes, to persuade them to prescribe its drugs. Mr Reilly, who ran the company’s Chinese business, was charged six weeks ago with running a ‘massive bribery network’ involving £90million of illegal sales and banned from leaving the country. It was the culmination of a year-long corruption investigation into the FTSE 100 firm. But yesterday, it was revealed the scandal first erupted after the sex tape was emailed by ‘GSK whistleblower’ to board members, including chief executive Andrew Witty, in March 2013, in what was believed to be a threat or blackmail attempt. The footage showed father-of-two Mr Reilly, who is separated from his wife, having sex with his Chinese girlfriend. He was given permission to hire investigator Peter Humphrey, 58, to find out who had hidden the camera in his Shanghai flat and who had sent two separate emails making serious fraud allegations. The £20,000 probe, codenamed Project Scorpion, focused on disgruntled former employee Vivien Shi, 49, a prominent businesswoman whose family is part of Shanghai’s communist elite. But a few months after starting to investigate Miss Shi, Mr Humphrey was arrested along with his wife Yu Yingzeng, a US citizen and daughter of one of China’s most eminent atomic weapons scientists. According to the Sunday Times, Mr Humphrey’s arrest and detention in July was at around the same time that China began a police probe into GSK’s alleged bribery. Mr Reilly, 52, of Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, stepped down from his post as China manager soon after Mr Humphrey’s arrest but remains a GSK employee. He returned to Britain around the same time but voluntarily went back to China within days to assist police with their inquiries. He was charged in May this year and accused by police of presiding over a web of corruption and pressing his sales teams to bribe health officials to meet targets. If found guilty, Mr Reilly, who has a PhD in pharmacology and neurosciences from University College London, could face life in prison. Mr Reilly joined GSK in 1989 and has worked in Singapore, Hong Kong and China. He is separated from Jill, 49, with whom he has two teenage daughters, and has moved out of their £1.2million home. Email: The footage was apparently sent to executives including chief executive Andrew Witty . It is understood he met Mrs Reilly at university, where she was studying psychology. Like her husband, she took up a post at GSK, working as a director of capital planning. Yesterday, a neighbour said he did not know Mr and Mrs Riley had split and said he had not seen either for months. The first email from ‘GSK whistleblower’ was sent in January last year. In March, the sex tape was sent from the same account, followed by a third email in May. The emails laid out a series of sales and marketing practices described as ‘pervasive corruption’.GSK launched an internal investigation but found ‘no specific evidence’ to substantiate the claims. However, the accusations are  virtually identical to the charges laid by police against Mr Reilly and 45 other suspects. Last month, Britain’s Serious Fraud Office announced it is to investigate the company’s ‘commercial practices’. Yesterday, GSK confirmed the sex tape’s existence and added in a statement: ‘The issues relating to our China business are very difficult and complicated. The investigation by the Chinese authorities remains ongoing and we are co-operating fully with this investigation.’","Executives at GlaxoSmithKline were sent a sex tape featuring China boss Mark Reilly and his girlfriend .

"By . Rebecca Evans . Saudi bomb maker Ibrahim Al-Asiri, who is described by a US official as 'an evil genius' He is Al Qaeda’s most valued bombmaker and the creator of explosives so dangerous only an ‘evil genius’ could have come up with them. Such is the skill of chemistry student Ibrahim Al-Asiri, who was born into a respectable middle class Saudi family, that his devices can be sewn inside a human body. And terrifyingly, because they contain no metal elements, they are virtually undetectable and can evade airport security. The master explosives-maker first tried out his chilling tactics on his willing younger brother, Abdullah. He implanted a suicide bomb inside the 23-year-old for an assassination attempt on a Saudi Arabian prince. Although the device went off as planned, Abdullah succeeded in killing only himself and not his target. Al-Asiri’s sinister creations have also been used on two high-profile terror attempts in the US, including the underwear bomb carried by Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab in his attempt to blow up a plane carrying 300 passengers over America on Christmas Day 2009. In 2010, his devices were found in printer cartridges on a cargo plane bound for the US. They were intercepted in the UK. In May 2012, US officials said they believed Al-Asiri had built an improved version of the underwear bomb, which was given to a Saudi-recruited double agent to blow up on a US-bound flight. After the discovery of the printer cartridge bomb, then US deputy national security adviser John Brennan said analysis of the devices showed they were made by the same person who was behind the underwear bomb. He said: ‘He’s a very dangerous individual – clearly somebody who has a fair amount of training and experience. We need to find him and bring him to justice as soon as we can.’ US congressman and former homeland security committee chairman Peter King said Al-Asiri was an ‘evil genius’, adding: ‘He is constantly expanding, he is constantly adjusting.’ Intelligence sources believe Al-Asiri, who is known as Abu Saleh, has been passing on his lethal bomb-making expertise from his base in Yemen to Syria, with plans to attack transatlantic flights. Al-Asiri's sinister creations have also been used on two high-profile terror attempts in the US, including the underwear bomb carried by Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab in his attempt to blow up a plane carrying 300 passengers over America on Christmas Day 2009 . He is also feared to be training British fanatics in Yemen, where MI6 and MI5 believe extremists pose a real threat to the UK. All his bombs use a chemical fuse and a high-level industrial explosive known as PETN, or pentaerythritol tetranitrate. The same material was used in 2001 by British shoe bomber Richard Reid when he tried to destroy a transatlantic flight. Ben Friedman, a US expert in defence and homeland security, said the authorities were worried about bombs implanted inside people or explosives made from non-metallic elements. But he said it was important to remember that previous attempts to blow up planes had failed. ‘These guys are serial failures,’ he added. ‘It’s not like they have a track record of unmitigated success. It’s closer to the opposite.’ In May 2012, US officials said they believed Al-Asiri had built an improved version of the underwear bomb (pictured), which was given to a Saudi-recruited double agent to blow up on a US-bound flight . There have been several attempts on Al-Asiri’s life, including US drone attacks, but he has so far managed to stay hidden in Yemen, perfecting and sharing knowledge of how to make his bombs. The son of a soldier, Al-Asiri was born into a well-off family in 1982. In 2007 they were  living in the Islamic holy city of Mecca when he and his younger brother disappeared. They surfaced in Yemen in 2009, where it emerged they had joined the newly-formed Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In August of that year, Abdullah pretended to be an Islamist militant who wanted to reform, and was given an audience with Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, Saudi Arabia’s top counter-terrorism official. Once stood next to the royal, he detonated the bomb, hidden inside part of his intestine. But the blast went straight downwards meaning Abdullah was torn in two and the prince escaped with minor injuries. Al-Asiri was named as one of Saudi Arabia’s most wanted terrorists in 2009 and in 2011 joined the US wanted list.","Ibrahim Al-Asiri was born into respectable middle class Saudi family .

Coleen, a 28-year-old model, yesterday wrote on Twitter: ‘We love our daddy!! Happy Father’s Day…We’re so proud of you xxx’ alongside a montage of photographs of her absent husband with his two boys. Scroll down for video . Coleen Rooney, the wife of £300,000-a-week Manchester United striker Wayne, received a torrent of abuse on Twitter after posting a Father's Day message saying how proud she and her two sons are of the striker . However, social media users reacted angrily in light of the fact that they did not believe star player Rooney had lived up to his reputation as a footballing great. Fans made retorts such as ‘Shame he can’t play football’ and ‘What’s there to be proud of? Rooney, 28, was also trolled on Twitter with many users slamming his corner kick during the match and saying he was played in the wrong position. Meanwhile, the Italian press yesterday gloated in their victory – even claiming that their WAGs are more attractive than those of the England players. Gazzetta Dello Sport said that the WAGs of their team, including Mario Balotelli’s fiancée Fanny Neguesha and Michela Quattrociocche, the wife of former Liverpool player Alberto Aquilan, were more attractive the likes of Alex Gerrard, Coleen Rooney. Peter Crouch’s wife Abbey Clancy or Frank Lampard’s girlfriend Christine Bleakley. Coleen wrote on Twitter: 'We love our daddy!! Happy Father's Day @WayneRooney. We're so proud of you xxx' alongside a montage of photographs of her husband and two boys . Other famous Italian WAGs include .

However, the WAGs are not expected to meet each other in Brazil has Roy Hodgson has banned them from coming. Despite this, Coleen is preparing to fly out to Brazil later this week with sons Kai, four, and Klay one. Social media users reacted angrily to Coleen's tweet and said they did not believe Rooney had lived up to his reputation as a footballing great . She said: ‘I don’t want the boys to grow up and say, “How come you never took us to watch my dad play in the World Cup?”.’ She added: ‘I actually prefer watching the World Cup at home, especially when the weather’s fantastic.’ The England team schedule means she and the boys might not even get to see Wayne, but she said: ‘At least he knows we’re there and we’re going to support him.’ Mrs Rooney is preparing to fly out to Brazil later this week with sons Kai, four, and Klay one . It is not known how many other WAGS will heed Hodgson’s ban but Alex Gerrard, 31, the model wife of England captain Steven, 34, was seen partying with friends on the beach of Spanish isle of Ibiza on Saturday seemingly without a care in the world. The mother-of-three has previously revealed that despite Hodgson’s WAG-veto, she would travel to Brazil if England get through to the later stages. At its peak, more than 15.6million watched the match in Britain, with many pubs staying open late after the Home Office allowed licencing laws to be relaxed during England matches.

"By . Rebecca Evans . A woman who was neglected and tortured for 20 years told of her fear last night that the foster mother who abused her may be allowed to live nearby when she is released from jail. Eunice Spry is due to be released by the end of the month after serving seven years for torturing, beating and starving children in her care, crimes that a judge said were the most horrific he had seen. Her adopted daughter Victoria, one of three children who suffered unimaginable cruelty at her hands, is now fighting to stop her settling within 150 miles of her home. Beauitful: Despite the cruelty and appalling injuries inflicted on her by her mother Victoria, 28, has made a total success of her life . Victoria, who does not want to give her surname or address, has started a petition to keep Spry, 70, away from her, and has so far amassed more than 11,000 signatures. She says police and prison officials will not tell her exactly when Spry will be released – having served just half of her 14-year sentence – or where she will live, although they say it will not be Gloucestershire, where Victoria has settled. But Victoria fears that Spry could return to Worcestershire, where she used to live, just 25 miles away. Last night, Victoria said: ‘Why do criminals have more rights than their victims? She has served her punishment but mine will never leave me. Horrific: Some of the terrible injuries inflicted on Victoria by the woman who was supposed to love her . ‘I will fight with everything I have to stop this happening. When she was sent to prison I felt safe for the first time in my life. I was so happy that she couldn’t hurt me any more. ‘I never want to see her again and I do not want her living anywhere near me. I do not think I am asking for a lot.’ Spry, a twice-divorced Jehovah’s Witness, fostered children for Gloucestershire Social Services for more than 20 years. In 2007 she was found guilty of 26 charges of child abuse against three of them, including Victoria, whom she adopted as a baby. Victoria was left chained for days as a child and was beaten daily. She was kept out of school and never learned to read or write, having effectively been imprisoned at a decrepit farm in Eckington, Worcestershire. At the age of 14, Victoria’s misery plumbed new depths after she was seriously injured in a car crash that left her in a coma for six months and killed two of her sisters. After leaving hospital, Spry confined her to a wheelchair needlessly for four years to get benefits, which led to the wasting of her leg muscles. But at 19 she escaped after strangulation marks on her neck were spotted during a rare visit to a local church. Worshippers helped her and she went to police, who arrested Spry. Since then, she has flourished, teaching herself to read and write and becoming a talented animal photographer. But Victoria, who is engaged to her boyfriend of five years, said: ‘I am scared of her still and I am angry about many things. ‘I am angry about my lack of education, that I get laughed out of job interviews because I have no GSCEs. I am angry that as a 28-year-old woman, I have to wear false teeth because she knocked mine out. ‘I am angry that I have scars all over my body and that I have to fight every day from hearing her voice, telling me that I am worthless, that my biological parents didn’t want me, that no one wants me. ‘Sometimes you have to talk about the past to stop it becoming somebody else’s future. ‘As children we were shut off from the world. ‘We had no friends and were not allowed to go to school.’ Heartless: Eunice Spry was found guilty of subjecting three young children in her care to a 'horrifying catalogue of cruel and sadistic treatment' by a jury at Bristol Crown Court . She believes that Spry’s sadism stemmed from her twisted view of her devout faith as a Jehovah’s Witness, believing that some children were possessed and needed purifying. She remembers waking from her coma, having broken virtually every bone in her body, including her neck and hips, and having sustained serious injuries to her internal organs. Victoria, who now campaigns to get more support for the  victims of child abuse, said:  ‘She was there. ‘She told me that I was scum, that I should have died but the devil saves his own. ‘I remember lying in the  hospital bed and feeling the  tears fall silently down my face, wishing I had died.’","Eunice Spry was jailed for 14 years  in 2007 for abusing three children including her adoptive daughter, Victoria, 28 .

"By . Rebecca Evans . It is one of the capital’s most beautiful parks, enjoyed by thousands who visit each day to stroll through 200 acres of landscaped gardens. But Gunnersbury Park in West London has been ‘desecrated and despoiled’ by travellers who left 50 tons of rubbish and filth after illegally camping there for just three days. The once perfectly manicured lawns have been churned up by cars, the turf of a cricket pitch destroyed and a picturesque bluebell wood transformed into a hazardous swamp of refuse – all at a cost to the taxpayer of tens of thousands of pounds. Scroll down for video . Wrecked by travellers: Some of the 50 tons of waste left strewn  across Gunnersbury Park . Discord: Among the detritus left littering the inner London beauty spot was this smashed piano . Piles of waste, including a piano, sofas, mattresses, prams, lawn mowers, dirty nappies, toys and vast amounts of building rubble, have been left without any care or consideration. A local school sports day was cancelled, along with a weekend charity run, because of health and safety fears. Police said the travellers had come to London after attending Appleby Horse Fair in the Lake District, Europe’s largest gathering of the travelling community, where piles of rubbish were also left strewn in their wake. They are expecting more to arrive and migrate from park to park around southern England. Intimidating: One of the travellers yesterday . Itinerant: The community has now moved on to nearby Blondin Park, pictured, and set up camp there . Around 70 men, women and children in 17 caravans turned up at Grade II-listed Gunnersbury Park, the former Georgian stately home of 19th century financier Nathan Rothschild, on Sunday evening. Then, with wilful abandon, they proceeded to destroy the much-loved grounds and terrorise park-users. Hounslow Council, which estimates the clean-up bill will exceed £18,000, applied to the courts for an eviction notice. Meanwhile, police received reports of travellers – armed with guns – trying to run over walkers in their cars and threatening to kill their dogs. So worrying did the situation become that, as a last resort, the park was closed on Wednesday evening. But within a few hours the group moved to a nearby park, where they have set up camp again. Gunnersbury has now been tentatively re-opened. Dumped: Police said the travellers had come to London after attending Appleby Horse Fair in the Lake District.

The beautiful green spaces around here are why people live in this glorious part of West London. It greatly angers me and it comes at such an enormous cost to the taxpayer. ‘This is not about there being any prejudice to the traveller way of life – in Ealing we have a designated park where they can stay. It is about the mess left behind, the fly-tipping, the anti-social behaviour and intimidation of park users. ‘Parks are there for everyone to enjoy, they are not campsites to be trashed. I wish we had more powers to deal with this quickly, but our hands are tied by the courts.’ Abandoned: A school sports day was cancelled, along with a charity run, because of health and safety fears .

Hounslow Police confirmed they had received several complaints of anti-social behaviour, including one of a man in a car with a gun. One regular dog walker said that in addition to the piles of rubbish, there was also human excrement. ‘One of my dogs came back from sniffing around the rubbish covered in it,’ she said. ‘I walked past their “camp” yesterday with a few fellow dog walkers and a car with two young guys in it came speeding across the field at 30-plus miles per hour. ‘I told them to slow down and just got abuse back. They nearly hit one of the little dogs.’ Tranquil: Gunnersbury Park as it usually looks . A man who runs a dog walking business said: ‘They left such a mess – piles of wood with nails in and tins of toxic paint. This is dangerous for dogs and other animals that live in the park, such as rabbits and squirrels. ‘What upsets me is not that they camped here illegally, but that they trashed the park so much. No one has a right to do that. It’s heartbreaking to see.’ A police spokesman said that following the report of a man in a car with a gun, specialist armed officers had been sent to the park. The spokesman added: ‘There continues to be an increased police presence in the park to provide reassurance to local people.’","Travellers came south to Gunnersbury Park from the Appleby Horse Fair .

"By . Rebecca Evans . All the best people use Google Glass: The Prince of Wales uses the latest technology . Technology giant Microsoft is secretly trialling a new computerised headband that could help blind people ‘see’. The device, which resembles an Alice band, is similar to Google Glass in the way it relays information about its wearer’s surroundings. But instead of being in the form of glasses, the ‘smart’ band uses an ear piece for instructions and updates. In addition to helping blind people, it is claimed the band will have a dramatic impact for all by ‘revolutionising the urban experience.’ The scheme, which is being tested on a group of eight blind people in Reading, Berkshire, will be visited by the Queen on Thursday. It has been used to help them find their way around Reading train station, a busy warren of staircases, escalators and ticket barriers. Tim Gebbels, an actor who is blind and has tested early versions of the technology for Guide Dogs, a charity for the blind, hopes it will enable him to navigate towns and cities ‘as easily as anybody else’. Guide Dogs chief executive Richard Leaman said: ‘This project hits right at the heart of the daily challenges blind people face in our urban landscape.’ Although small-scale at present, if successful then cities and transport networks around the country could be connected to its network, providing information on public places such as restaurants and museums. The device works by bouncing information from sensors mounted on any item such as buildings or train carriages to a receiver in the wearer's headband. The user is able to receive personalised instructions, such as how to get to the airport on time if a train is delayed. Google Glass has been criticised for privacy concerns because of an integrated camera that records images of the surroundings . Google Glass has been criticised for privacy concerns because of an integrated camera that records images of the surroundings. Cinemas in America are on alert for the illegal recording of films and motorists have received tickets for driving while distracted. The Microsoft device is expected to provoke less controversy as it does not cover the eyes or have a camera. The project, called Cities Unlocked, involves Tesco, Barclays, Costa Coffee, First Great Western and First-Group. Microsoft is working in a consortium with Future Cities Catapult, a technology body funded by the Department of Business Innovation and Skills, and Guide Dogs. The consortium said: ‘The short-term goal is to make the city more accessible and enjoyable for people with sight loss, by using new technologies. The longer term aim is to ... revolutionise the urban experience for everyone, through more effective collaboration and innovation.’","Scheme being tested on a group of eight blind people in Reading, Berkshire .

"By . Rebecca Evans . Former Asian Football Confederation President Mohammed Bin Hammam is alleged to have paid out £3 million in bribes to football officials to secure support for the 2022 Qatar world cup bid . Pressure was mounting last night for Qatar to be stripped of its status as 2022 World Cup host in the wake of fresh corruption claims. Emails and account details allegedly reveal how a senior official ‘bought’ support for the Gulf state’s successful campaign to stage the tournament. Up to £3million from secret slush funds was reportedly used to bribe officials by Mohamed bin Hammam – a disgraced former vice president of football’s governing body Fifa. According to the Sunday Times, payments of up to £120,000 were made to African football bosses who held sway over the continent’s voting process. Contrary to Fifa’s strict bribery rules, Mr Bin Hammam staged hospitality junkets across Africa and Asia, meeting delegates privately and handing out Nike holdalls full of luxury gifts and £250,000 in cash to get backing for Qatar’s bid. Yesterday there were calls for the 2022 World Cup bid to be re-run and for Fifa president Sepp Blatter to resign. Fifa’s decision to award the world’s biggest sporting tournament to the tiny oil-rich desert state has been controversial from the word go. As well as health fears for footballers over the 50C summertime heat, reports say 1,200 migrant workers have died during an £120billion frenzy to build eight stadiums and other infrastructure. Business magnate Mr Bin Hammam was banned from world football in 2011 after being caught bribing voters in a bid to become Fifa president. The official Qatari bid committee have always insisted that the 65-year-old had nothing to with the campaign to take the World Cup to Doha. Among the alleged payments made by Mohammed bin Hammam were: . £30,000 for ‘school fees’ for Liberian-born former Man City striker George Weah – Fifa’s world player of the year in 1995. £48,000 to Zambian FA president Kalusha Bwalya for ‘FA and personal expenditure’. £31,500 to Fadoul Houssein, of the Djibouti FA, for an ‘expensive course of medical treatment for his general secretary’ and an all-expenses luxury trip to Saudi Arabia. £36,000 for a ‘car to travel to football projects’ for ex-Gambian FA boss Seedy Kinteh. £480,000 to the Ivory Coast FA as part of a  Fifa development scheme. £120,000 in cash to 25 delegates flown to Kuala Lumpur to discuss the bid in 2008. £30,000 to Sao Tome FA president Manuel Dende, who asked for £138,000 for ‘football pitches’ to be paid into his personal account. As bids were being prepared six years ago, he was head of Qatari football, president of the Asian Football Confederation and a Fifa vice-president – with a vote in picking the top bid. However, the newly unearthed files allegedly show that he flew around the world in the Qatari royal jet in a covert campaign to create a ‘groundswell’ of support. There is also said to be evidence that he paid just under £1million into bank accounts controlled by Jack Warner, who stepped down as Fifa vice-president in 2011. Of this money, £370,000 was paid before Mr Warner voted in 2010 to award Qatar the 2022 tournament. Emails from African football bosses show their thanks for money they received. One in Namibia said he would ‘always be behind you’, but asked for a ‘once-off financial assistance to the tune of $50,000 (£29,000)’. FIFA president Sepp Blatter, right, awarded the competition to Gulf state following a vote in December 2010 . Fifa is now under pressure to re-examine the Qatari bid as a result of the latest corruption allegations . There are also claims Mr Bin Hammam exploited his position as chairman of a Fifa development scheme in poor countries to channel more than £700,000 into the football federations of three key African Fifa voters. By contrast, England was humiliated when its campaign to host the World Cup in either 2018 or 2022 received just two votes. Shadow international development secretary Jim Murphy yesterday said the bidding process should be held again if the allegations are proved true. He added: ‘The failure to do so would amount to the biggest crisis in Fifa since its formation in 1904.’ Alexandra Wrage, a former member of Fifa’s independent governance committee, said the documents were a ‘smoking gun’ after officials had insisted there was no evidence of corruption. Tory MP John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said Fifa boss Mr Blatter’s position was ‘almost untenable’. Fifa vice-president Jim Boyce said he would favour a re-vote if the body’s chief investigator found wrongdoing. Last night a member of Mr Bin Hammam’s family said they would not be commenting.","Emails and account details allegedly reveal how a senior official ‘bought’ support for the Gulf state’s successful campaign to stage the tournament .

"By . Rebecca Evans . It is called Mount Pleasant estate – but the name could not be further from the reality of those who  have to live here. For this sprawling, dilapidated industrial park in a deprived corner of London was not built for human habitation. But the rat-infested warren of crumbling Victorian buildings is home to desperate people living in makeshift lodgings that even they describe as 'like living in a ghetto'. Migrants are living illegally in crumbling rat-infested Victorian buildings in Brent, north-west London . The illegal 'hidden homes' are unfit for purpose, with whole families, mainly immigrants, cramped into tiny rooms without heating or proper sanitation . It is part of a worrying new phenomenon in London and the Home Counties, whereby commercial buildings, such as warehouses, factories, offices and garages, are shoddily converted and rented out as residential lets. These illegal ‘hidden homes’ are unfit for purpose, with whole families, mainly immigrants, cramped into tiny rooms without heating or proper sanitation. They are unregulated, unsafe and, as a result of being poorly wired for electricity, have caused more than 30 fires in the past nine months, which claimed two lives. London Fire Brigade has warned of the dangers while councils struggle to cope with their emergence. The situation in Mount Pleasant, in the North-West London borough of  Brent, only came to light when the emergency services responded to a small fire and found up to 100 people living in appalling conditions. Most have now been evicted but around 30 – mostly immigrants from Eastern Europe or Asia – remain, with just one bathroom and mould-covered kitchen, between all of them. The situation in Mount Pleasant, in the London borough of Brent, only came to light when the emergency services responded to a small fire and found up to 100 people living in appalling conditions . Other authorities with the problem include Slough, in Berkshire, Newham in East London and Ealing in West London . One 28-year-old Indian man, who did not want to reveal his real name for fear of reprisals, has lived there for 18 months and pays £600 a month in rent. His only heat is from a gas hob ring and light from a torch or candle. He said: ‘It is like a ghetto.’ Unemployed Romanian handyman Peter and girlfriend Anya, both 25, share a tiny room for £400 a month and also have no power or heating. Samir Fertal, 38, who owns a garage on the estate, said he was fighting a constant battle against rats and rubbish. - 'It is like a ghetto' Other authorities with the problem include Slough, in Berkshire, Newham in East London and Ealing in West London. Many of the buildings have been sub-let many times with rent being paid in cash, making it difficult to trace who is accountable. Landlords who are found often exploit a loophole by claiming they are renting to relatives. Last month Harrow Council, in North-West London, chartered a plane with thermal imaging, uncovering four times more ‘suspicious’ outbuildings than expected. Housing minister Kris Hopkins said £6million had been made available to local authorities to ‘root out the cowboys’ and 950 illegal and overcrowded commercial properties had been uncovered as a result.

"By . Rebecca Evans . Daniel Spargo-Mabbs died from a heart attack after taking ecstasy at a rave . A boy of 16 died after making a ‘fatal’ decision to buy ecstasy to take with friends at an illegal rave, a court heard yesterday. Daniel Spargo-Mabbs collapsed after downing a bottle of water laced with half a gram of the Class A drug. Ryan Kirk, 21, is accused of delivering the drugs, known as MDMA, to Daniel’s friends before the party in a disused cotton factory in Hayes, West London, in January. Prosecutor Tyrone Silcott told Isleworth Crown Court that the five friends, aged 15 to 17, made a ‘bad’ decision to get some ecstasy. He said that Kirk, of Beckenham, South East London, took £80 in cash from the boys and in return handed over three bags, covered in blue stars, containing 2.5 grams of white powder. It is alleged that Kirk was a ‘deliveryman’ for drug dealer Nicqueel Pitrora, 18, from Croydon, who has pleaded guilty to two counts of supplying drugs. One of Daniel’s friends said that unlike the rest of them who sipped their ecstasy-laced water, he downed his 500ml bottle instantly. Daniel, from Croydon, South East London, who attended Archbishop Tenison’s Church of England School, died from a suspected drugs overdose two days later following multiple heart attacks. The defence say Kirk’s case is one of mistaken identity as he was picked out at an identity parade by one of Daniel’s friends who has admitted to not being ‘certain’. Yesterday, the friend said he was ‘80 per cent sure’ Kirk was the one who delivered the drugs. When Kirk was arrested, police allegedly found, in a bedroom he shared with his younger brother, 127.8g of cannabis, a large quantity of snap bags and electronic scales, two mobile phones and £185 in cash. Kirk denies two charges of being concerned with the  supply of Class A drugs and  one of Class B. Tyrone Silcott, prosecuting, told the court: 'Back on the 17th of January of this year a group of young men aged between 15 and 17 were going out for an evening to a party sometimes known as a rave at a venue in Hayes. 'The group of young men made a bad decision that evening. He told the jury that the group - some . of whom cannot be named for legal reasons -  had arranged to get drugs, . adding: 'One of those young men died as a result of taking ecstasy.' The . court heard 'three bags of white powder' were delivered before the . rave. The jury was told Daniel paid £20 towards a quantity of MDMA and . put what was thought to be half a gram of the drug into 500mls of water . in a bottle - with one witness claiming he possibly drank it all in one . go. The court heard Daniel took off his shirt after taking the drugs and was 'talking a lot more than he usually does', including talking about his girlfriend . Mr Silcott told the jury . that 'despite the tragic backdrop' of the case, their focus should be . on whether or not Kirk was the person who delivered the drugs on January . 17. The jury was told that . another man, Nicqueel Pitrora, 18, from Croydon, pleaded guilty at the . same court of being concerned in supplying a controlled drug of class A . on January 17. Mr Silcott said it was Pitrora who was telephoned and asked if he could supply two and a half grams of MDMA. The group was quoted a price of £80, the court heard. Mr . Silcott said witnesses described the person who delivered the drugs as . being a white man with pale skin and of skinny build. 'The prosecution . say it was Ryan Kirk,' Mr Silcott said. The jury was shown footage of the identity parade seen by Daniel's friend and when the identity officer asked if the witness has made a positive identification, he says: 'Yes. Do I have to be certain? If I have to be certain, then no.' The court heard that Kirk claims to . have been at his friend’s house playing X Box on the night he is accused . of delivering the drugs. 'He said he does not attend raves and has . never been to Hayes,' Mr Silcott said. Later the schoolboy who arranged the deadly deal told jurors he was only '80 percent' sure the dealer was Kirk. Speaking . from behind screens to protect his identity, he explained the man on . the bike had stopped for only 10 or 20 seconds when passing the boys the . illegal drugs. He had rung a contact called 'Shampz' three times on the 17 January to arrange the £80 deal. Mr . Silcott asked: 'You have told us that the boy that you think you . identified had sold you drugs before? ' Yes,' came the reply. Ryan Kirk, 21, from Beckenham, South London, is on trial charged with being concerned in supplying a controlled drug of class A - MDMA to Daniel (pictured). He denies the charges . 'And that you think he is someone who had given you MDMA before and cannabis I think you said? 'Yeah,' he said. 'Do you remember now if they got off the bike? 'No I think they just rode up on the bike and took it. 'You told us when you were being asked questions about it that you were 80 percent sure, is that still right? 'Yes'. But defence counsel Roderick Jones dismissed the meeting as 'minimum contact, minimum observation'. The jury was shown a video of Kirk's police interview which took place on January 21 at Croydon Police Station. He repeatedly denied any involvement in the supply of drugs, saying he has 'never' been involved in MDMA. Kirk told police he had taken MDMA once, adding: 'I didn't like it.' In the video, Kirk was questioned about cannabis and electric scales found in his bedroom. He said he shares his bedroom, which he said has two televisions, with his 18-year-old brother. Kirk said in the interview the cannabis was 'nothing to do with me'. Asked if he had any addictions, Kirk said: 'Caffeine. That's about it.' He said that on the day he is accused of delivering the drugs he went to the shop to get cigarettes and dog food for his mother. In the video, Kirk said he receives job seeker's allowance of £100 a week and said he had been applying for lots of jobs. He denied being involved in gangs, and said. 'I finished college and have been working with my dad until May this year. 'I don't want to work on a building site so have been interviewing for an apprenticeship in business admin.' The . court heard Daniel took off his shirt after taking the drugs and was . 'talking a lot more than he usually does', including talking about his . girlfriend. Mr Silcott said a toxicology report found that after the incident Daniel had MDMA in his blood. The trial will resume at 10.15am on Wednesday.

"By . Rebecca Evans . A British couple whose baby girl was seized by police during a holiday in Portugal have furiously denied being too drunk to look after her. James Moreland and Lee-Ann O’Donoghue said they had been handcuffed by police with guns, who told them their heavy-handed response was because of the ‘Madeleine McCann effect’. The couple’s 14-month-old daughter, who we have been asked not to name, was taken into emergency care on Sunday after reports they had drunkenly thrown her into a pool and staggered around with her on an eighth-floor hotel balcony. Ordeal: James Moreland and Lee-Ann O'Donoghue with their 14-month-old daughter before she was removed . Miss O’Donoghue and Mr Moreland, on their first family holiday together since the baby’s birth, said they were at a loss as to why their daughter was placed in a hospital, and branded reports of their antics as ‘ludicrous, downright lies’. They also claim Mr Moreland, 29, was beaten by police and £500 – all of their holiday spending money – was stolen during the assault. Miss O’Donoghue, 34, who is on maternity leave from her job as a hospital personal assistant, said: ‘We are so scared and shaken up. ‘The police told us they had acted like they did, that they had been heavy-handed, because of the Madeleine McCann effect. They said the case had been very bad for them and that they had to be very careful when it came to the welfare of British children on holiday.’ Vanished: Portuguese police said their heavy-handed response was due to the 'Madeleine McCann effect' The family were staying at the Hotel Paraiso in Albufeira – 40 miles from Praia da Luz where Madeleine vanished in 2007 – as part of a week-long Thomas Cook package trip. Their story first emerged in the Portuguese press, which quoted unnamed hotel guests as saying that while sat by the pool, they had seen Miss O’Donoghue on the balcony behaving dangerously. The reports also said the daughter had bruised legs after her mother dropped her and that a drunken Mr Moreland hurled her into the pool in front of horrified holidaymakers. But both parents vehemently deny any of this took place – especially as their room, which they showed to the Mail, does not overlook the hotel pool but a car park, from where Miss O’Donoghue could not possibly have been seen. Looking drained, she said: ‘You can see from my daughter’s legs there are no bruises. I did not drop her, I have never dropped her and I was not drunk. ‘She is my first and only baby and I adore her. I am such a protective mother. I just can’t believe the lies I am hearing.’ Mr Moreland, who is covered in bruises he says were inflicted by the police, said: ‘To say I threw my daughter in the pool is just ridiculous.’ Their ordeal began on Sunday afternoon when they joined friends at a bar in Albufeira. Miss O’Donoghue said: ‘I had three cocktails and was merry, not drunk by any stretch.’ At 8pm, after they returned to the hotel, police knocked on the door. ‘They said they wanted to check on the baby,’ said Miss O’Donoghue. ‘My daughter was crying because she is teething so I gave her some Calpol (a brand of paracetamol for children). ‘The police saw the bottle and said that it was an “illegal drug in Portugal” and  they were taking her to hospital for tests to see if we had sedated her. They were very brusque and had guns.’ The family were staying at the Hotel Paraiso in Albufeira - 40 miles from Praia da Luz where Madeleine vanished . Miss O’Donoghue was allowed to go to the hospital too. But when medics ‘started sticking needles’ in her baby for drug tests, she protested and was handcuffed. Soon afterwards, Mr Moreland arrived at the hospital but was refused entry. He claimed: ‘I did get angry and started to shout and swear as I wanted to see my baby. A group of about seven policemen started hitting me, they put me in handcuffs and threw me on the floor in the back of a police car. ‘They yanked my arms up behind me until I screamed. They checked my wallet for ID and when I got home I saw that all of our spending money had gone.’ The couple, from Belfast, were not arrested but the case was referred to the local equivalent of social services. They were finally given their baby back on Tuesday. A Portuguese police spokesman said: ‘We were called to the hotel because of reports of a drunk and disorderly disturbance.’","James Moreland and Lee-Ann O'Donoghue 'handcuffed by armed police'

A university student who was caught with 20,000 Euros (£16,000) in her underwear on a flight to Turkey denied funding terrorism today. Nawal Masaad, 26, of Holloway, north London, is accused of trying to smuggle the cash through Heathrow Airport en route to Syria. She was recruited by mother-of-two Amal El-Wahabi, 27, to take the money to El-Wahabi's terrorist husband, it is claimed. The cash, which was wrapped in clingfilm, was discovered when Masaad was searched at Heathrow airport on January 16 this year. Both women pleaded not guilty to one count of becoming concerned in a funding arrangement when they appeared in court. Miss Msaad has posted a statement on her Facebook page proclaiming her innocence and denying that she has any ‘jihadist affiliations’. She said: ‘On 16th January 2014 I was arrested at Heathrow airport and accused of transporting money to Syria for the purposes of terrorism. ‘I was not travelling to Syria, I was travelling to Turkey, Istanbul which is very far from the Syrian border.’ She describes herself as a British Muslim who ‘hates terrorism’ and feels that she has been targeted because of her race, adding: ‘I can’t help but wonder if I had been called Natalie from Surrey whether the authorities would have pressed terrorism charges against me.’ The pair, who are both of Moroccan descent, are the first British women to be charged with terrorism offences related to the conflict. Yesterday, carrying what appeared to be a £3,500 quilted black Chanel bag and wearing stilettos, a blouse, and white mini-skirt and jacket, Miss Msaad arrived at the Old Bailey with her electronic ankle tag clearly on display.

"By . Rebecca Evans . The daughter of exiled Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky said her father was an assassination target for saying that President Vladimir Putin was ‘a danger to the whole world’. Elizaveta Berezovskaya told an inquest into her father’s death yesterday that she feared he was poisoned. The 67-year-old businessman – who had survived at least two assassination attempts – was found in the bathroom of a £20million Berkshire mansion in March last year with injuries police described as being ‘consistent with hanging’. Claim: Boris Berezovsky, left, was killed by someone else and did not hang himself, according to Professor Bernd Brinkman, right . But yesterday a coroner said there was not enough evidence to prove ‘beyond all reasonable doubt’ whether Mr Berezovsky had taken his own life or been unlawfully killed, so he recorded an open verdict. The two-day inquest at Windsor Guildhall heard how the once powerful and wealthy tycoon suffered a ‘fall from grace’ after losing a £3billion High Court case against former business partner Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea Football Club. The father of six was reduced to living as a guest in the Ascot home of his ex-wife and had become severely depressed as he struggled with £200million debts. Miss Berezovskaya, 43, said there were a lot of people who wanted her father dead. Furthermore, eminent forensic pathologist Professor Bernd Brinkmann said he believed Mr Berezovsky had been murdered. Miss Berezovskaya said: ‘I can think of many people who would be interested in my father’s death.’ Evidence: The oligarch's daughter Elizaveta, pictured right with her sister Ekatrina, told an inquest she thought her father might have been poisoned . When asked by Berkshire coroner Peter Bedford if she knew who these people were, she replied: ‘Yes. I think we all know.’ She said her father was an outspoken critic of the Russian president and had predicted the current crisis in the Ukraine. ‘My father was saying Putin was a danger to the whole world and we can see that now,’ she added. ‘My father was saying [Barack] Obama does not understand how Ukraine is important. He was the first person saying it. For 14 years he’s been saying that.’ However, Mr Bedford said the last known assassination attempt was in 2007 and asked why he would have been a target at the time of his death as he had ceased to be politically active because of his depression. But Miss Berezovskaya, an artist, said that just because her father had lost all interest in politics in the six months before his death, it did not mean he stopped being a target. She said: ‘He was a target, always. Because he could recover. I think my father was a very serious political figure.’ Such was the change in her father’s personality in the months before his death, Miss Berezovskaya initially feared he had been poisoned. Scene: Mr Berezovsky was found dead at his home in Ascot, Berkshire in March last year . She said: ‘Something strange was happening to him. ‘It was like there was a chemical reaction inside of him. I thought then straight away that he could have been poisoned. ’ She said she had many doubts over whether her father would have committed suicide. ‘Looking at all the evidence, I found I had more and more questions and of course I want to find the truth,’ she said. She added that her father believed suicide to be ‘immoral’ and contrary to his faith as a Russian Orthodox Christian. Professor Brinkmann, 74, gave evidence to say that he believed Mr Berezovsky to have been strangled by a ‘third party’. He said the strangulation marks around the neck were inconsistent with suspension, as they were too horizontal, and the purple face of Mr Berezovsky was something he had ‘never seen before’ in a suicide by hanging. Defeat: Mr Berezovsky lost at £3billion court battle against Chelsea's owner Roman Abramovich . The German academic, who has been hired by the Berezovsky family to produce a report, is famous for proving that ‘God’s banker’ Roberto Calvi was murdered underneath London’s Blackfriars Bridge in 1982 and did not commit suicide as previously thought. But Home Office pathologist Dr Simon Poole, who examined the body, said that in his opinion, Mr Berezovsky had hanged himself. The inquest also heard about an unknown fingerprint found on the shower rail in the room where his body was discovered. Mr Berezovsky fled Russia after falling out with Mr Putin, gaining asylum in the UK in 2003. He was an associate of KGB spy-turned-dissident Alexander Litvinenko, who died from radioactive polonium-210 poisoning in November 2006.

"By . Rebecca Evans . A former policeman who claimed a £5,000 insurance payout for whiplash injuries was filmed cage fighting days after the alleged car crash, a court heard yesterday. Valerijs Trifonovs, 31, said he had neck injuries so severe he was unable to take care of himself or his son. However, after making his claim, an insurance company worker spotted a newspaper article showing Trifonovs taking part in a professional heavyweight cage fight in Liverpool. Scroll down for video . Fight: Valerijs Trifonovs, 31, took part in a professional televised cage fight 13 days after telling insurers he had suffered whiplash in a car accident. He insists the accident was genuine and he was pressured into the fight . Fight: Mr Trifonovs' lawyers argued that the 'annals of sporting history' were full of stories of people who fought on despite serious injuries. At an earlier hearing his claim for £5,000 compensation was thrown out . The fight, which was just 13 days . after the alleged crash, was broadcast on television. The footage shows . the Lithuanian bouncer, who was also a special forces soldier and . policeman in Eastern Europe, lifting his opponent off the ground, . holding him in a head lock and hitting him around the head. Quinn . Insurance Ltd is pursuing contempt of court proceedings over the . ‘contrived’ accident in Kings Road, West London, in May 2010. Court: The former member of Latvian police and special forces outside the High Court . If . convicted, Trifonovs, of Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, could face prison. The insurers’ barrister, Marcus Grant, told the High Court in London . yesterday there was ‘no bona fide accident’. ‘What . made this particular fraud memorable was film of Mr Trifonovs engaging . in a cage fight 13 days after the alleged accident,’ he said. He also said that a Honda insured by Quinn, which Trifonovs said  damaged his Toyota, could not have done so. He . added: ‘Mr Trifonovs maintained as part of his claim that he suffered a . neck injury in the alleged accident that restricted his ability to look . after his child, engage in DIY, lift heavy items, or manage his . personal care for a month afterwards.’ He . also insisted his injuries ‘prevented him from being able to go to his . gym, and swim or play football for three months after the alleged . accident’. Trifonovs’ barrister Ian Bridge insisted he had suffered a genuine whiplash injury . but took part in the fight as he needed the money and had contractual . obligations to do so. ‘Looking at this superficially, it might bring a . smile to your face due to the irony that a man should suffer a neck . injury, bring a personal injury claim, and then find himself involved in . a professional fight within a few days,’ he said. Postponed: The Latvian national was allowed to have today's hearing adjourned to secure an interpreter . Televised: A county court judge last May was shown the footage of the cage fight in Liverpool, pictured . ‘There was a purse available, tickets had been sold and a promoter had promoted him.’ After . yesterday’s hearing, Trifonovs, who was beaten in the cage fight within . a minute and a half, said: ‘I swear on my children’s lives that I had . that accident.’ In May last . year, a judge at Bow County Court, in east London, dismissed his . compensation claim – ruling that the road shunt probably ‘never . happened’. This paved the . way for Quinn to seek Trifonovs’ committal on grounds of contempt of . court, and the case reached the High Court yesterday as the insurers’ lawyers tried to get their case underway. But it was adjourned to allow Trifonovs to get full legal representation, organise his case and find an interpreter.

"By . Sam Greenhill . and Rebecca Evans . and Tim Shipman . Energy firms reaped huge profits from their wind farms during the recent storms while families suffered Christmas blackouts. Some power companies boosted their takings by nearly a third. The figure for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day alone – at the height of the crisis – was £1.2million. This is because wind farms are paid to shut down their turbines during gusty weather – and they are paid even more to close them down than they are to run them normally. A ferry crosses the Solent near Southsea sea front in Hampshire. Energy firms reaped huge profits from their wind farms during the recent storms while families suffered Christmas blackouts . The revelation came as Britain braced itself for another battering of gales and torrential rain today and tomorrow. New Year’s Eve revellers could find their celebrations disrupted and there are fears that more homes and businesses could be flooded as rain falls on already saturated ground and swollen rivers. Energy Secretary Ed Davey has demanded a crisis meeting next week with power company bosses amid growing public fury at the slow response of firms in reconnecting the tens of thousands left in the dark after the storms. In the past two weeks, as householders suffered power cuts, wind farms were paid £4.8million to switch off their turbines. The ‘constraint payments’ – which come from householders’ energy bills – are given to operators not to produce electricity when supply outstrips demand. The controversial arrangement is supposed to compensate wind farms if the National Grid cannot cope with the extra energy produced during high winds. This is because wind farms are paid to shut down their turbines during gusty weather - and they are paid even more to close them down than they are to run them normally . Last night experts from the Renewable Energy Foundation calculated that, if the wind farms had been operating normally, the companies would have been paid approximately £6million. But because they were ordered to shut down, they received about £7.8million. This includes their £4.8million ‘compensation’, plus about £3million as an agreed electricity wholesale price. Under the complicated rules, they receive both payments even though no electricity has been supplied. And they are paid a higher rate when they are switched off, meaning that in the past two weeks they have been paid an additional £1.8million, or 29 per cent more. Among the energy firms to benefit was SSE, one of the Big Six, which owns a number of wind farms.Dr John Constable, director of the Renewable Energy Foundation, said it was ‘scandalous’ that wind farm companies boosted their profits during the storms. ‘The system is being abused by power companies at the expense of householders,’ he added. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson criticised energy companies for their response to last week’s blackouts and urged them to cancel holiday leave for staff over the New Year period. He said: ‘It seems obvious that they let too many of their staff go away for the Christmas holiday, they didn’t have enough people manning the call centres and that wasn’t acceptable. 'We have made it very clear that we expect them to take proper measures.’ But Mr Paterson came under fire himself after sources revealed that he had also been away over the Christmas period. He finally resurfaced again yesterday.","Figure for Christmas Eve and Day alone – at height of crisis – was £1.2million .

"By . Rebecca Evans . and Alexandra Williams . Lewis Hamilton came under fire yesterday for posting photographs of his ski holiday online while Michael Schumacher lay fighting for his life in a coma. The British Formula One driver uploaded pictures of his Christmas break on the slopes within days of Schumacher’s horrific ski accident in the French Alps. Displayed via his Instagram account, the images show Hamilton, 28, smiling as he skis cross-country with one of his beloved pet dogs in his rucksack. Scroll down for video . 'Horrendously bad taste': Lewis Hamilton has been criticised by Formula One fans for posting this and other pictures online of him skiing as Michael Schumacher fights for life after his horror crash . Several of the images uploaded to the Mercedes driver's Instagram page show him skiing without a helmet . He was criticised on Twitter for not wearing a helmet and for his ‘insensitive’ timing. In . another photograph he is  seen wearing a helmet as he stands on the . piste with his younger brother Nick, 21, who suffers from cerebral . palsy. Hamilton wrote: ‘This . was Christmas Day. I took my brother out on his ski chair, he did his . first black run. He did amazing! Such a blessing to be with him & my . family. God is good!!’ On social media sites such as Twitter and Instagram, some  users said the photographs were in ‘bad taste’. Comments included ‘Shame on you’ and ‘very insensitive given a certain ex race driver’s current condition in hospital’. Another wrote: ‘He really should think a little and take these down before it harms his good name.’ Some fans came out in support of Hamilton, saying the pictures of him without a helmet were taken while he was hiking or cross-country skiing and that his critics should 'grow up' Holiday snaps: Hamilton also posted this picture on his Instagram page, saying he had taken his disabled brother, Nic, on his first black run in his ski chair . However, the majority of comments were supportive of the Stevenage-born racing driver. One . user wrote: ‘He has only posted one photo of him skiing and in that he . had a helmet on. The other photos are of him hiking or cross-country . skiing or walking. Is everyone to stop posting photos of snowy vistas or . skis full stop? Grow up please.’ Another . said: ‘He’s walking on snow. Not skiing. The others are cross-country . which is like walking on snow too. Michael’s injury is awful but that . shouldn’t stop anyone else enjoying the snow.’ Others explained that helmets are not usually worn for the activity. ‘Cross-country skiing is like “going for a walk” and you do not wear a helmet. Even not in competition,’ one wrote. Hamilton tweeted a message of support to the seven-time champion and his family the day after his accident . Earlier . in the week, Hamilton posted a get well message for Schumacher on . Twitter, whom doctors yesterday described as being in a stable . condition. Hamilton said: . ‘Mine & my family’s prayers & thoughts are with Michael & . his family. I wish him a quick recovery. God Bless him. The Hamiltons.’ Seven-time champion Schumacher, who turns 45 tomorrow, is fighting for . his life in a Grenoble hospital after falling and hitting his head on a . rock in the resort of Meribel on Sunday. He was airlifted from the ski run by a rescue helicopter, suffering from devastating brain injuries. Schumacher has since undergone two operations to relieve a blood clot and pressure on his brain. Sabine . Kehm, the German sportsman’s manager, said yesterday: ‘Michael is . monitored all the time, his condition was stable all night and this . morning. It has not changed. It is too early to provide any further . details.’ Doctors have said the retired Formula One driver has showed signs of ‘slight improvement’, but remains in a critical condition. His . family, including wife Corinna, 44, and their two children Gina-Marie, . 16, and Mick, 14, have kept a vigil by his bedside since the accident. It . is not known where Hamilton was on holiday, but he flew there in a . private jet with his two pet bulldogs shortly before Christmas.","Some of the images on his Instagram page show him without a helmet .

"By . Mia De Graaf . and Lizzie Edmonds . and Rebecca Evans . Customers who have been without power for 48 hours or more over the Christmas period will receive £75 as a 'goodwill gesture', it has been confirmed today. UK Power Networks, which owns electricity lines and cables in London, the south east and east of England, said it will treble the standard compensation payment of £27 for those who are still in the dark. The company said today 481 customers in Kent were without power, along with 96 in Surrey and 251 in Sussex. Compensation: Some customers will receive £75 compensation, UK Powers Networks said today. Poor weather is expected to continue in Cheshire, pictured, and across the country . Flooding: A car on the road in Weston, Hampshire where continual rainfall has led to severe floods . A spokesman from UK Power Networks said last night: 'As a gesture of goodwill UK Power Networks has decided to boost . the industry standard payment from £27 to £75 for customers who are . without power for 48-60 hours including Christmas Day, and additional . payments will be made to any customers off supply for longer up to a . maximum of £432.' Director of customer services Matt Rudling said: 'This is such a difficult time of year for people to be without power and so many families have also been flooded out of their homes. 'Our hearts go out to our customers and we have been trying different ways to help them, from arranging Christmas dinners to providing more help and tools on our website.' When the high winds struck on Thursday night, more than 300,000 customers were initially without power. Around 4,000 are thought to still be in the dark - many in the south east. Yesterday, a resident of Yalding, Kent, where homes had been severely damaged and many remain without power, vented their frustration at Prime Minister David Cameron. Damage: The route of the railway was blocked after yet another night of severe storms across Britain . Battering: Windy weather brings heavy waves to coastline of Pembrokeshire, pictured . In . a heated on-camera exchange with the PM, the woman said: 'We still have . no electric. We need electric. As I say the council, from Monday we . have been trying to contact them, but they have all decided to go on . their holidays. Nothing.' It is thought thousands of Christmas presents - such as tablet devices and computers - will still be in their boxes, as continued electricity black-outs deem them unusable. Power companies have been widely . condemned for failing to restore supplies to thousands of people - some . who had been without electricity since Christmas eve. Debris: Fallen trees are cleared by workers in north Antrim, Northern Ireland . Chaos: A motorist navigates past a fallen tree in north Antrim. 5,000 customers in Northern Ireland are believed to be without power . Electricity North West (ENW) said 1,000 customers were without power in Cumbria this afternoon after engineers had restored more than 20,000 properties across the region. Meanwhile in Wales, 1,100 properties - mainly in Anglesey and Gwynedd - have no electricity following the storms, a spokesman for Scottish Power said. UK Power Networks said 481 customers in Kent were without power, along with 96 in Surrey and 251 in Sussex. A spokesman for the company said: ""Due to the severity of the storm damage it may take until the end of the week to restore power supplies to the final single premises affected in these areas, though work is continuing to reconnect most of the remaining supplies as quickly as possible."" Around 35,000 homes were last night without power across the Republic of Ireland after being battered by Thursday night's storm. ScottishPower said it had now reconnected 14,500 customers who lost power during Thursday night's storm. Spokesman . Simon McMillan said: 'The biggest issue affecting the electricity . network has been uprooted trees and other debris blown on to overhead . power lines, which has caused damage and brought down the power lines in . some areas. Encounter: David Cameron clashed with a resident of Yalding in Kent who complained that her home had no power . Observing: The Prime Minster has promised to investigate the situation in Yalding, which was badly affected by floods . 'The company will do all that it can to restore supplies as quickly as possible. 'However, a number of roads and bridges have been blocked and closed by fallen trees which could restrict access in certain locations, and where wind speeds remain high engineers will not be able to climb poles and work at height.' Robin Gisby, managing director of network operations at Network Rail, said this week 'has been one of the most challenging periods we have faced in recent times'. The total number of flood warnings in . place across England and Wales is currently 24, with the number of flood . alerts at 86, The Environment Agency said this morning. Thursday night's storms meant that several trains were delayed yesterday morning so lines could be examined in daylight before trains set off. The line from London to Portsmouth . via Haslemere is blocked by four landslips near Liphook, and will stay . closed over the weekend. The track at Ockley between Horsham and Dorking is also closed following a serious landslip. A . spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, which speaks for the rail . industry, said: 'We'd like to apologise to passengers whose journeys . over the festive period have been affected by the bad weather of the . last few days. Stuck: Scores of train services were delayed or cancelled due to the bad weather . Stand still: Road users stuck in traffic caused by sheep on the A1M Peterborough, Cambridgeshire yesterday . 'Hundreds of rail staff have been working round the clock to clear tracks but some services have started later than planned to ensure passengers can complete their journeys safely.' North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) took to Twitter to warn people about going outside in the gales. A spokeswoman said the service had taken half a dozen calls in Lancashire alone about people being blown over by the wind, though only minor injuries were reported. NWAS said that, as a precaution, people should stay indoors, out of the windy weather. Conservative MP for Hastings and Rye, Amber Rudd, criticised Southeastern trains for failing to provide a replacement bus service for her constituents in the commuter belt towns. While Southern Rail was offering workers the option of commuting to London via bus and even using Twitter to post regular updates, Southeastern services, including their communications, had been 'lamentable', she said. Wet weather: Two people dodge a wave at Saltcoats Harbour, Scotland, yesterday . Soaked:Young children play in a blizzard of sea foam whipped up by the wind near Trearddur Bay, Anglesey . 'So Southern have really done very well,' said Ms Rudd. 'I think it's partly because they've got Gatwick Airport on their tail wanting a better service. 'But Southeastern has not been anywhere near as good, and I have received a lot of complaints about them. They have been just too complacent'. The RAC has reported a 20 per cent increase in breakdowns across the country, rising to a 40 per cent increase in the south and south east between Christmas Eve and yesterday. A combination of storms and floods, congestion caused by shoppers hitting the Boxing Day sales and those heading home after the Christmas break, have all contributed to the spike in breakdowns over the last few days. Sarah Rice, an RAC spokeswoman, said: 'We are maintaining increased levels of both patrol and support team hours as we prepare for the onslaught of shoppers over the busy sale weekend. 'The anticipated early return to work on Monday inevitably sees high volumes of breakdowns.' The RAC advises motorists to give cars a five mile drive to test the battery, check tyre pressures and tread, coolant and screen wash levels, and make sure the windscreen wipers are working properly. Desperate: Rose Gusterson, 84 , who has been without electicity since Christmas Eve . BY REBECCA EVANS . For four days and four nights, 84-year-old Rosina Gusterson has been without power. The frail pensioner, a retired carer who suffers from severe arthritis, has had no heating in her council-owned flat other than the pitiable amount emitted by her gas cooker hob since Christmas Eve. Islington Council, who own her block of flats in North London, offered to put Mrs Gusterson and her live-in daughter Ann Becouarn, 57, up in a hotel. However, they were told they could not bring their beloved 14-year-old Cocker Spaniel, Jarvis, so felt they had no choice but to stay put. Mrs Becouarn said: 'We haven’t been able to have a wash for days, we are so desperately cold. ‘We sit huddled around the hob and managed to have some mash potato on Christmas Day. ‘I do not understand why it has taken so long to fix our power, it has made my mother very ill. ‘She loves her dog, as do I, and there was no way we were leaving him. ‘The council said they would try to find us a hotel where they take dogs, but no-one ever got back to us. ‘We are not on benefits, we pay our rent so I do not understand why we have been left like this. I don’t know how much longer we can last.’ Mrs Gusterson, a widow, said: ‘We didn’t have a choice because the hotel doesn’t take pets. So I’ve been forced to live in dark, dreary and dangerous conditions because the council can’t find somewhere for Jarvis. ‘They told us “You go to the hotel and we’ll get the dog warden t pick up Jarvis and leave him at a dog’s home”. ‘I said there must be some way to keep us all together- we just can’t leave him. I explained he’s 14, he’s very deaf and not well, but they weren’t interested. In the dark: Mrs Gusterson says she doesn't understand why it has taken so long to restore power in her Islington home . The flat lost its power during the storms on Christmas Eve. A spokesman for Islington Council last night said they did not know when their electricity would be installed. But added: ‘Above all, we want our residents to be safe and warm - and their pets looked after. We have offered transport to a comfortable local hotel on full board, and free kennelling through our animal welfare service. It simply hasn't been possible to find a hotel at short notice prepared to take a dog.’","Customers without power for 48-60 hours offered £75 'goodwill gesture'

"By . Rebecca Evans . A mother of four described  as a ‘beautiful woman in chains’ has been found dead at the home where she cared for her disabled husband. Alison Taylor’s wheelchair-bound spouse Ashley was arrested on suspicion of murder but was later released on bail. A post-mortem examination failed to reveal how Mrs Taylor, 41, died and police are treating her death as unexplained. 'A beautiful woman in chains': Alison Taylor, 41, is pictured with her wheelchair-bound husband, Ashley, 42 . After her body was found on Friday, a . bunch of pink carnations was left outside the couple’s home with a note . reading: ‘Alison RIP. A beautiful woman in chains XXX.’ Mr . Taylor, 42, was released on Saturday evening, but did not return to the . house as forensic officers continued their investigation yesterday. Neighbours . in the quiet cul-de-sac in Maidenhead, Berkshire, where the pair had . lived for seven years said they were a reclusive couple who were both . unemployed and had been together since they were teenagers. Yesterday, . an elderly neighbour who did not want to be named said they had fierce . arguments that the whole street could hear and that they were widely . claimed to be drug users. She . said: ‘They had lived here for a long time and Ashley seemed all right . at first, but I think it was about a year ago that he started to use a . wheelchair. ‘Alison cared for him full-time. She was a tiny woman, very thin and fragile looking. ‘They didn’t go out much and were very reclusive.’ The couple’s children – Courtney, 23, Oliver, 21, and 19-year-old  twins Paige and Paris – had all moved out. Family: Mrs Taylor, pictured with her four children and husband, was found dead in her home in Maidenhead, Berkshire, at 8pm on Friday. Police arrested a man on suspicion of murder, but he has now been bailed . 'Reclusive couple': Neighbours said Mr and Mrs Taylor lived only in the downstairs rooms of their £225,000 home (left), situated in a quiet cul-de-sac. Mr Taylor (right) has been unable to walk for the past three years . Another . neighbour, Katie Allen, 36, said: ‘She was as sweet as  pie. She did . everything for Ashley and she doted on her kids  and grandchildren. ‘When . I spoke to her on Friday last week, she was looking forward to the . birth of another grandchild. She seemed really happy and in good . spirits. ‘I just can’t get my head around what has happened.’ A woman who lives nearby said: ‘There are always all sorts of people calling around there asking for money that they owe. Police tape cordons off the scene: Police were called shortly after 8pm on Friday and found Mrs Taylor's body in the house. Neighbours described teams of forensic officers coming and going from the property until 3am . ‘She . would barely speak. When they came out of the house and I said “Hi . Alison”, she would sort of mutter hello back and he would just stare at . her. Something wasn’t right.’ She added: ‘I’m close with their kids, but . haven’t had much to do with them. Their kids are lovely – I feel so sad . for them. It’s tragic. ‘She did absolutely everything  for him. He couldn’t do anything for himself. ‘I . know they were childhood sweethearts who had been together since they . were 17, but they did have problems.’ It is understood that the couple, . who married in September 1995, lived in the downstairs rooms of their . £225,000, three-bedroom semi-detached house.

"By . Rebecca Evans . Heap of junk mail: Rebecca George, 44, got so fed up with the deluge of menus, flyers and leaflets that she spent a year collecting them all . It is the bane of modern life - accounting for half of all post delivered. But, as these startling pictures show, the deluge of junk mail arriving through our letterbox each year is truly astonishing. Tired of the unwanted mail dropping on her door mat and going straight into the recycling box each day, one mother decided to conduct an experiment by saving it all. Rebecca George collected every takeaway menu, leaflet and sales letter she received during a 12 month period, only to find to her horror that it covered the entirety of her 15ft-long hallway. The 44-year-old graphic designer, from Hackney, east London, received an astounding 1,027 items, which is more than three every day. Mother-of-three Mrs George said: ‘I was so sick of the mail we were getting I decided to experiment, and see how it stacked up. She said: ‘I had no real concept of exactly how much it was, but just knew that I seemed to spend every day clearing up the growing mess. Now I can see that it actually covers the entire hallway. It’s ridiculous.’ Last year, Royal Mail delivered 3.3billion ‘unaddressed letters’ - the vast majority of which go instantly in the bin - but Mrs George found the worst offenders to be bank and credit card companies. Mrs George, who is married to Andrew, a journalist, added: ‘It was a combination of Royal Mail delivered junk mail and flyers put through by hand. ‘The worst offenders were banks and credit card companies offering loans and cards. Estate agents desperately trying to get me to sell my house were another regular feature. ‘I still get mail for someone that lived in the house more than 15 years ago - despite returning it on a number of occasions. But flyers from local businesses are another thing entirely. ‘Cab firms seem to be unable to drop off just one card and insist on putting three or four at a time through the door and the men delivering pizza takeaway adverts seem to operate round the clock.’ The estimated cost of junk mail disposal to the taxpayer is estimated at being well in excess of £50million, but since Royal Mail last year scrapped a ban on delivering no more than three unaddressed letters per household, per week, the number could be far higher. Unimpressed: Mrs George, of Hackney, east London, said the worst culprits were credit card firms and banks, along with local businesses posting flyers by hand . Mike Jones, of the Local Government Association’s environment board, stated recently that Royal Mail should work to reduce junk post. He said: ‘Most people don’t appreciate being bombarded with junk mail on a daily basis. ‘Not only is it a nuisance to have to pick up and throw away, but it adds thousands of tons to the amount of waste councils have to collect. ‘Huge progress in recycling in recent years has meant that most of this will avoid being sent to landfill. Project: Tired of the unwanted mail dropping on her door mat and going straight into the recycling box each day, Mrs George decided to conduct an experiment by saving it all . ‘But Royal Mail and its direct marketing clients need to do more to reduce the deluge of junk mail landing on people’s doorsteps and make sure people are aware of their right to opt out of having unsolicited mail delivered to their homes.’ 'Cab firms seem to be unable to drop off just one card and insist on putting three or four at a time through the door' Rebecca George . Out of the 54million items of post delivered by Royal Mail each day, 27million are now junk mail - an increase of 200million in the past year. Earlier this year, the head of Royal Mail, Moya Greene, defended the huge amount of ‘marketing mail’, saying it had contributed to the company’s profits, together with an increase in the price of stamps. Miss Greene said that postmen should still treat junk mail with ‘utter respect’, as it had generated £1.1billion for the company.","Rebecca George collected every takeaway menu, leaflet and sales letter .

"By . Rebecca Evans . High street fashion stores have cancelled orders for angora wool products after appalling footage emerged of the barbaric treatment of rabbits in Chinese farms. The horrific scenes, some of which were published in the Daily Mail last month, show angora rabbits screaming as their fur is torn from their bodies while still alive. In other parts of the footage, obtained by animal rights group Peta, the rabbits are seen tied up by the front and back legs, as their bodies are cut and bloodied as their fur is roughly sheared. Scroll down for video . Factory horror: An angora rabbit is tied up by its feet and its skin stretched as it is being cut with an electric shear . Angora jumpers were on sale in Topshop for £36 but the store has suspended orders for the product . Investigators also found that the . rabbits are kept alive for several years in pitiable conditions – forced . to endure their torturous ordeal month after month until their throats . are finally cut. In response . to the footage and widespread customer outcry, more than 35 companies – . including Topshop, H&M, Primark, Whistles and Next – have said they . will no longer stock angora products. Marks & Spencer has also said . it will halt all future angora orders until it has ‘concluded our . visits to farms’. Stella McCartney’s fashion company said it will no . longer use angora in any of its products. A . spokesman told the Sunday Times: ‘In light of information released . about the widespread despicable treatment of angora rabbits, we have . decided to stop all future use of angora in Stella McCartney products. The images, taken at an undisclosed location in China, shows angora rabbits in cages . The rabbit is bent across the woman's knee before being trimmed of its fur using scissors . ‘Although . we have always guaranteed that our angora wool mix fibres come from a . cruelty-free source in Italy, we are no longer willing to encourage the . use of angora in luxury fashion.’ The . angora rabbit is bred for its long, soft wool that is made up of fine, . hollow fibres, making  it softer than cashmere and a popular material . for jumpers  and scarves. China . is responsible for 90 per cent of the world’s supply of angora. Investigators went to ten angora farms and witnessed the widespread . abuse of animals at each one. At half of the farms visited, a . particularly barbaric form of live plucking is used to remove the fur. They . also found that the sensitive pads on the rabbits’ feet were being . sliced open by the wire base of their filthy cages – leading to illness . and infection –and they are never given the chance to dig, jump or run. And after their fur has been removed, they are thrown back into their cage to re-grow their coat in complete solitude. Cruel: The dead rabbits are processed for meat after their fur is taken for wool . The woman holds the rabbit by the ears while trimming its fur at the Chinese angora farm . Shocking truth: The animals are constantly injured from throughout the plucking as they struggle to break free . Torture: The Chinese fur traders use the plucking technique as it results in better quality fur and more money . Peta, . which is campaigning for shoppers to boycott angora wool completely, . did not name the farms to protect its sources. Peta’s campaigns manager, . Yvonne Taylor, said: ‘Many retailers have taken on board customer . complaints, but, while we welcome their decision to stop sourcing angora . products, we would urge them to also pull existing angora stock.’ Angora . has a trade value of £22 to £28 per kilogram, but the longer hair which . comes from plucking, as opposed to shearing, sells for more than double . that. The rabbits can live for as long as ten years if treated properly. Professor . Anna Meredith, of the Royal School of Veterinary Studies, said: ‘For a . rabbit to vocalise as it does in the video indicates it is in severe . distress.’ Animal cruelty: The angora rabbits are alive throughout the plucking and are kept for several years, plucked every few months, before their throats are slit . Locked up: The cages injure the rabbit's feet and the insanitary conditions see many of them, such as this one, suffer infections and illness . Pain and suffering: The terror in the animal's eyes is unmistakeable as a worker with a Chinese angora trader stretches it out and yanks out its fur . There are thought to be more than 50 million rabbits on angora farms in China, producing more than 4,000 tonnes of fur a year. In China, there are no penalties for the abuse of animals on farms and minimal, if any, standards to regulate their treatment. It . is by far the world’s biggest producer, followed by Argentina, Chile, . the Czech Republic and Hungary, which produce the bulk of the remaining . 10 per cent of the supply chain. Left to recover: After the rabbit had had all its fur yanked out it is thrown into a cage to regrow its fur in complete solitude . No hope: This young bunny is in the process of regrowing its fur while recovering from an eye infection in a naked steel cage . A new law was drafted in 2009, but has not been implemented. In . 2009, campaigners exposed how down used in jackets and other items was . being ripped from the bodies of live geese by Chinese suppliers. Two years later it emerged that raccoon dogs were being skinned while still alive to produce imitation sheepskin boots.","Topshop, H&M, Boden, Primark suspend orders for angora products .

"By . Caroline Graham . Goodbye Britain: Actress Gwyneth Paltrow is to move her family to Los Angeles for at least two years to be closer to her mother and brother . She has lived in London for a decade and calls it her ‘adopted home’, but Oscar-winner Gwyneth Paltrow is moving her family back to Los Angeles. The 40-year-old actress and her rock-star husband Chris Martin of Coldplay plan to make LA their home for at least the next two years. The family will move in time for their children Apple, nine, and Moses, seven, to start the school term in September. A source said: ‘Gwyneth has loved living in London but America will always be home and she wants to be closer to her family. 'Her mother and brother live in California and she plans to spend the next couple of years in Los Angeles while her children are young enough for their education not to be affected. ‘She misses her family terribly and now is the time to move. 'Her children have English accents and once they start senior school Gwyneth says the family will likely return to the UK because she believes that the English education system is second to none.’ Rumours have been rife for months that the family was planning to move back to California after they forked out £6.6 million on an opulent new home in a private Hollywood Hills estate. The 8,000 square-foot house in the exclusive Brentwood area is the most expensive in the couple’s property empire which includes their £4.6 million home in North London, a £3.2 million penthouse flat in New York and a £3.4 million house in the Hamptons near New York. Designed by renowned US architect Windsor Smith the home has six bedrooms, eight bathrooms and a separate stable block. Paltrow, famed for her eco-friendly ways, even had an entrance hall made with stones recovered from a Peruvian schoolhouse. Friends say Gwyneth longs to spend more time with her 70-year-old widowed mother Blythe Danner and her director brother Jake as well as friends like godfather Steven Spielberg: ‘Gwyneth misses her family terribly and while she has grown to love London and her children have English accents, now is the time to move. 'The kids have said goodbye to their school friends and they are having a final European holiday before the big move.’ Moving?

"By . Martin Robinson . and Rebecca Evans . TV presenter Kirstie Allsopp has bemoaned a lack of 'Blitz spirit' and claimed the victims of the Christmas storms were 'spoilt' for getting compensation . Not only is she said to be worth millions but she also has a choice of three homes to retreat to. So Kirstie Allsopp probably should have kept quiet when it came to the subject of the misery of the Christmas storms. The TV presenter believes victims of treacherous weather are ‘spoilt’ if they receive compensation for losing their power supply for days over the festive period. The star of Channel 4’s Location, Location, Location bemoaned the lack of ‘Blitz spirit’ and said that billions of people around the world get by with ‘limited electricity’. Miss Allsopp, 42, told her 331,000 followers on Twitter that she was in ‘rant mode’ as many families face a seventh night without power. The mother-of-two wrote: ‘What on Earth has happened to Blitz spirit? #SpoiltUK... Storm winds blow, trees come down, electricity goes off, it’s not much fun, need to make contingency plans, why does this mean compensation?’ Unsurprisingly, other Twitter users were quick to hit back at her lack of sympathy. One wrote: ‘Something tells me you were not affected?’ while another said: ‘Quite right people are just  spoilt. They’ll feel entitled to  shelter, food and water next!’  Energy companies have been criticised for their slow reaction to storm damage. Her comments ignited controversy on Twitter, with one person writing: 'Something tells me you were not affected?' while another added: 'Quite right @KirstieMAllsopp, people are just spoilt. They’ll feel entitled to shelter, food and water next!' Another joked about the Handmade Britain presenter: 'On the bright side, these floods will help give that fabulous distressed look to furniture. #kirstyantoinette'. One Twitter user added: 'I’m no expert, but I haven’t noticed us being at war with Germany, or you know, an actual Blitz happening.' Another replied to Allsopp, whose father Lord Hindlip, was a chairman of Christie’s: 'So say you via Twitter...doing that without electricity are you?!' to which Allsopp replied: 'Point is if I couldn’t tweet because of a storm I wouldn’t be seeking compensation, things happen, less whinging more doing.' Allsopp said billions of people around the world get by with 'limited electricity' and questioned why the storms should lead to compensation . Her comments came as many faced yet another day without power today, a week after they were cut off, despite claims by engineers the last homes had been reconnected . Network bosses meanwhile have admitted they failed to ensure enough engineers were working over the festive period to repair the damage and were today urged to cancel New Year holidays as more storms approach. It came as another storm of heavy rain and strong winds arrives in the UK, bringing with it a risk of flooding and disruption. The executive of one of the UK's biggest . power distributors has admitted its efforts to restore power to . thousands of people should have been better. Basil Scarsella, chief executive of the UK Power Networks, has said it was not prepared for the storm and too many staff were on holiday .

The company, which owns electricity lines and cables in London, the south east and east of England, said it will increase payments for 48 to 60-hour outages from £27 to £75 for those affected on Christmas Day as 'a gesture of goodwill'. Additional payments will be made to customers who have been without electricity for longer than that time - up to a maximum of £432. Mr Scarsella said: 'We could not have avoided the damage caused by the storm but we could have responded to it better. 'A lot of our employees had gone away for holidays so it meant we had a level of depletion in our resources - and that caused problems with getting people's power restored. 'It's difficult to justify saying the company has performed well when customers have been without power for five days, but once we had an idea of how bad it was we were able to mobilise as many engineers and office staff as possible.' Forecasters have said the latest storm pushing in from the Atlantic will cross the UK from west to east today. The Met Office has issued a severe weather warning over fears of strong gales of up to 80mph affecting Wales, southern, western and northern England and Scotland. It has also warned of the danger of ice patches in the south west tonight as temperatures drop to below freezing. The Met Office has issued a severe weather warning over fears of strong gales of up to 80mph affecting Wales, southern, western and northern England and Scotland today with more storms through the week . George Goodfellow, a forecaster for MeteoGroup, said: 'Normally, we would say this is a typical winter storm but because we're still recovering from a string of other storms it is likely to cause more disruption and flooding.' He said the south west will continue to bear the brunt of the storm. The Environment Agency (EA) have around 100 flood alerts in place in southern, western and northern England. Britain is braced for an entire month of bad weather that could see the number of homes flooded more than double. As the big clean-up gets under way in the aftermath of the Christmas storms, persistent rain will sweep across the country today and return to drench New Year’s Eve revellers. Then from New Year’s Day, storms and rain can be expected for the foreseeable future, forecasters warn. ‘There is no end in sight,’ said a Met Office spokesman. The fresh wave of bad weather could see the figure for flooded homes double to more than 2,000 in the worst hit areas of Kent, Surrey and Sussex. The agency said persistent rainfall means there is a ‘continued  heightened flood risk’ across southern England, particularly south west England. Some 70 flood alerts and five more serious flood warnings remain in place across the country. One warning is in place for Tewkesbury where the ground is still saturated after the Christmas rain. Much of the Gloucestershire town was submerged after the Avon and Severn rivers burst their banks last week. A spokesman for the Met Office said: ‘For as far as we can see, the wet and windy weather is here to stay. There is no end in sight. 'We are in the middle of winter, so this weather is not unusual, but there is no sign of it settling down as we go into January.’ Six people have died during the bad weather, while the bill for insurance companies is likely to top £100million. And the unsettled weather looks set to continue into the new year after the Met Office issued a severe weather warning for rain on New Year's Day, affecting southern England and western Scotland. Some 1,300 properties have been flooded during the recent storms in England, the EA said. Meanwhile energy companies have been criticised for their slow reaction to storm damage. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said he has pressed energy companies to stop staff taking new year holidays as a second week of storms looks set to derail the festive period. Speaking on ITV's Daybreak programme, he said: 'I think some of them (energy companies) definitely let their customers down, and I'm pleased to hear they are going to pay some compensation to those who are out of power. 'We were told yesterday that the final 130 houses (without power) would all be back on by last night and I'll have my daily meeting at nine when I hope to hear that has been achieved. 'Some of the companies have performed, some have not, and I think they have been penalised by the reaction of their customers. It's up to them to compensate their customers. 'We've had two Cobra (the Government's emergency committee) meetings over the last couple of days and we've made it very clear that we expect them to take proper measures - not to let staff go away on holiday over the new year period and to be properly prepared for this week.' Mr Paterson added that emergency financial assistance - known as the Bellwin fund - could be made available to local authorities to ensure flood defences and power supplies remain intact. 'It's dreadful for all those involved but we do give credit to those in the Environment Agency who worked throughout that period and who are working as we speak now,' he said. 'We've had Cobra meetings co-ordinating the other Government departments, and local government has been told at every level that they must make sure they have adequate staff on over the new year period. 'We've also said the 'Bellwin' can be triggered, which is an emergency fund where central government can come in and help.'","Kirstie Allsopp says people around world get by with 'limited electricity'

"By . Rebecca Evans . Lifestyle: The site will advise people what changes to make in their life to age better . The life-limiting risks of poor diet, excessive alcohol and smoking are widely known. But a new service is to be launched to more accurately predict their impact as we reach old age. The new website will use a mathematical formula to calculate how the lives of users will turn out and what steps they can take to alter their future. Lord Geoffrey Filkin, chairman of the Centre of Ageing Better is overseeing the new site, which he believes will provide a ‘gold standard’ of evidence to help maintain health and happiness. He said: ‘We will not be telling people what they should do, but we will be providing them with a gold standard of scientific and research evidence if they want to improve their wellbeing in later life.’ The website, which will use data from Public Health England, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the office of National Statistics, will be able to answer questions concerning life expectancy and the benefits of improved diet. Users will also be able to ask questions concerning their expected income, how to increase pension size and whether they have enough friends to stave off loneliness in old age. The Centre of Ageing Better is a new trust launched with a £50million grant from the Big Lottery Fund. The website, set to be in service by 2015, will be one of the centre’s first projects and will receive full support from the Government, of which it will remain independent of. It will offer life predictions for those aged 30 and above by creating a personalised plan. Advice: The website, set live in 2015, is the first project launched by the Centre of Ageing Better . In an interview with the Sunday Times, Lord Filkin said the website’s aim was to inspire people to improve their lives. He said: ‘Everybody is going to live much longer than we have experienced in the past, so it is really important to work out how we can ensure that we make this as enjoyable and meaningful as we can. ‘If you are 30, the thought of being 65 is so horrible that you don’t even want to think about it. You would use the website to see the difficulty of building up a pension later.’ Important: Lord Filkin, overseeing the new site, says it will create a 'golden standard' ‘We don’t want to spread misery around . the western world. This is not just a dose of gloom. In fact many things . are under your control. ‘If you are poor before you retire, you will also be poor later in life, but one thing you can do is adopt a healthier lifestyle. It has enormous benefits and almost zero cost.’ He said that even though not everyone may decide to seek a healthier lifestyle, it was important to equip them with the information to do so. He said: ‘People who have a rich social life and a sense of meaning apart from themselves will be happier and live longer. ‘Whether we’ll be able to say that you’re going to be at risk if you have fewer than 10 friends I doubt, because I doubt the data is so black and white - two good friends might be worth 10 drinking companions. ‘We will, however, be able to say that people who do have friendly relations do have a meaning to their life, live longer and say they are happier. ‘We will also bust the myth that you have to be perfectly healthy. People who have friends and give something to the community can be happy.’ Earlier this year, Lord Filkin chaired an inquiry which found that there will be twice as many people aged 85 and above in 2030 as in 2010 and that 10.7m people in Britain are set to retire on an inadequate income.","New site set to provide 'gold standard' to help people maintain happiness .

"By . Rebecca Evans . Rupert Murdoch’s ex-wife Wendi Deng wrote how she had ‘warm feelings’ like a ‘crush’ for Tony Blair, it was reported yesterday. The note was found after the 82-year-old media tycoon discovered the former Labour prime minister had spent weekends at his homes. Mr Murdoch later filed for divorce from Miss Deng, 44. Wendi Deng wrote the note to herself, expressing her 'warm feelings' comparable to a 'crush' on Tony Blair . The note was apparently written by Miss Deng to herself, expressing her ‘warm feelings’ comparable to a ‘crush’ on Mr Blair, who is married to barrister and part-time judge Cherie. Mr Murdoch and Miss Deng divorced two weeks ago following reports that she had met with Middle East envoy Mr Blair, 60, without his knowledge. Their meetings are understood to include ‘multiple’ overnight stays at Mr Murdoch’s homes, including his ranch in Carmel, California. The pair are also understood to have met on a super-yacht owned by music industry billionaire David Geffen. Such is the extent of the ‘terminal’ rift between the former allies and friends that Mr Blair was forced to avoid the prestigious US Sun Valley conference in July, where he had top billing, because Mr Murdoch objected to his presence, The Mail on Sunday reported. Rupert Murdoch later filed for divorce from Miss Deng, 44, after the note was discovered . The media finance event was attended by influential figures such as Mr Murdoch, Bill Gates and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Mr Blair, who is godfather to one of Mr Murdoch and Miss Deng’s children, has been a regular guest at Sun Valley, attending the 2007 gathering just two weeks after leaving Downing Street. Friends of Mr Murdoch insist that he ‘did not act lightly’ before ending his 14-year marriage to Miss Deng and his 20-year political and personal friendship with Mr Blair. A media executive who has known Mr Murdoch for 40 years said: ‘Rupert has supported Tony politically and personally through thick and thin. ‘He thought he could trust him, but he was wrong.’ Mr Murdoch and Miss Deng divorced two weeks ago following reports that she had met with Middle East envoy Mr Blair, 60, without his knowledge . Another friend said: ‘What really hurt was finding out that Tony had been in his homes without telling him.’ It is understood that Mr Murdoch learned of his ex-wife and Mr Blair’s encounters after  she inadvertently sent an email to the wrong person, including details of his trip to the ranch. Mr Murdoch then went to Carmel and asked the household staff if it was true. They told him Mr Blair had stayed there with Miss Deng on two weekends in October 2012 and April this year. Mr Blair visited with his British police bodyguards. There is no evidence of an affair between Mr Blair and Miss Deng.

"By . Tom Leonard . Clark Gable III, grandson of Clarke Gable, now presents the reality TV show about infidelity - Cheaters . Let's say you suspect your spouse of having an affair. Would you enlist the help of a TV show to find out what they were getting up to and with whom, then let it catch them in the act on live television - and drag you along too in the hope of an angry confrontation with the cheating couple? Probably not, but that's the premise of US show Cheaters, and although reality television doesn't come much more intrusive it's become a compulsive and unlikely hit. And its presenter is rather unlikely too, a descendant of one of the biggest stars in Hollywood history - and one of its most notorious womanisers to boot. Clark Gable III is the 25-year-old grandson of the Gone With The Wind star who Joan Crawford said produced in her 'a sexual urge beyond belief'. What would Grandpa think of the heir to the family name hunting cheating husbands with a camera crew? 'I think he'd have a good laugh. It's about the sort of things - women, sex, infidelity - he used to surround himself with,' says Clark. That would be putting it mildly. Gable went to epic lengths to hide his own myriad affairs. Five times married, he sired only two children - Clark's father John, and Judy Lewis. The latter was the product of an affair with actress Loretta Young that began on the set of Call Of The Wild in 1935, and the pair were so keen to avoid any scandal that she fled to Europe to hide her pregnancy, later secretly giving birth and only 'adopting' the baby 19 months afterwards. Gable came to see Judy just once, when she was 15, but she didn't know he was her father until she was 31 and he'd been dead five years. 'It was great back then; the studios would hide anything you wanted,' says his grandson. Is it more honest now? 'That's a strange word to use for the entertainment industry,' he laughs. Clark Gable III is the 25-year-old grandson of the Gone With The Wind star Clarke Gable (pictured) who Joan Crawford (also pictured) said produced in her 'a sexual urge beyond belief' Meeting Clark Gable III begs the . question - whatever happened to the Second? His father John, he reveals, . has spent his whole life trying to distance himself from his own famous . father's shadow. The . Hollywood star had always wanted a son but tragically died in 1960, just . three months before John was born. John was brought up by his mother, . the star's fifth wife Kay Williams, out of the limelight on Gable's huge . California ranch. 'At school graduation when they called my name out, every parent stood up to see who I was' There were several threats to kidnap him and a troublesome childhood ended up with him being sent to school in Switzerland. 'He told me he used to throw lemons at all the tourists who came to look at the family home,' says Clark. Although John - who's now 53 and also has a daughter, Kayley - did a little acting, he soon moved into stunt work before following his passion for motor racing. The more dangerous the better, says his son. In 2012 John, who is divorced from Clark's mother Tracy, made headlines when his girlfriend at the time, celebrity make-up artist Christiane Lange, was found dead at their Malibu home after a suspected drug overdose. Clark is intent on restoring some of the family's acting glory and following his famous grandfather into film. He's been modelling since he was three but Cheaters is his first turn in front of the camera, although he had a role in a low-budget Italian thriller that's yet to be released. He's now presented two seasons of Cheaters and says he can no longer be shocked by what people get up to in their private lives. Nothing is scripted or faked, though they edit out the frequent occasions when he introduces himself to stunned cheaters and they do a double take at his name Clark Gable. Like the offspring of other stars, he believes that having a famous name opens doors to begin with but can be a hindrance when you're expected to live up to your illustrious forebear. Clarke Gable III never met his grandfather who tragically died before the birth of his son . Clark feels John avoided acting because he was intimidated by the thought of trying to emulate his father's success and, as a result, he also showed a complete lack of curiosity about the colourful life of a man who, of course, he never knew. Clark finds this completely maddening. 'All my father knows about him is what he's seen on film. I feel he dropped the ball for a generation and I really want to pick it up again.' So what was it like growing up Clark Gable? 'It was both cool and a nightmare. At school graduation when they called my name out, every parent stood up to see who I was,' he says. And people still think he's having them on when he mentions his name. 'I always carry three different pieces of ID just to prove it,' he says. Clark has done some digging into his grandfather's story. He enjoys telling how he was Hitler's favourite film star, with the Führer even putting a bounty on his capture. 'He wanted my grandfather to make a propaganda film to crush the American fighting spirit,' says Clark. The star didn't return his admiration, flying as a gunner on US bombing missions against the Nazis. So what does he know about his grandfather? He loved riding and hunting, he says. More surprisingly, he even dabbled in cock-fighting, handing down to John an ornate pair of 1940s cock-fighting blades (the spurs that are attached to fighting cocks' feet) in a box with Gable's name engraved on it. Not something today's stars would ever dream of indulging in. 'It's pretty crazy to think about it,' agrees his grandson. Another fine souvenir his father inherited was a framed letter Walt Disney wrote to Gable apologising for making his ears too big when he included an animated version of the star in a couple of 1940s cartoons. 'I heard my grandfather was very upset about that,' says Clark. Neither Clark nor John inherited Gable's famously oversized ears but there's one thing all three generations of Gables share: an obsession with women. Clark, who's single, says it's 'almost an addiction' for him. And his twice-married father is no different. 'It's hard when we go out together,' says Clark. 'He tries to pick up women my age. He gets jealous, I suppose.' Grandpa would be nodding with approval. Cheaters, weeknights at 11pm from 14 April, CBS Reality.","Notorious Lothario, Clarke Gable's grandson now hosts Cheaters .

"By . Mail Foreign Service . Jailed for ten years: Rapist Li Tianyi is the son of a Chinese general . The teenage son of a Chinese general and celebrity singer was today convicted of rape and sentenced to 10 years in prison . Li Tianyi, 17, and four other defendants took an 18-year-old woman they met in a Beijing bar in February to a hotel room, where they beat her and sexually assaulted her, the Haidan Court in northwest Beijing had heard. Li had denied the charges at his trial last month, saying he was drunk at the time, but the court identified him as the ringleader. Only one of the defendants was an adult. He pleaded not guilty but was sentenced to 12 years. Li, who also pleaded not guilty and was tried as a minor, was sentenced to 10 years, in what the court said was a punishment that took into account his minor status. The other three - all of whom pleaded guilty - were sentenced to three to four years. Sentences for rape normally range from three to 10 years, but in cases deemed severe - including gang rapes and those causing serious injury or death - the sentences for adults can range up to life in prison and even death. Li's lawyers said the family will appeal. The case focused attention on what the Chinese public often deems to be the wayward behavior of children of the privileged and on the sometimes-lenient treatment given to establishment figures by the courts, considered to be under the control of Communist Party leaders. Li is the baby-faced son of General Li Shuangjiang, 73, and Meng Ge, both known for singing rousing odes for the People's Liberation Army and starring in television galas. Celebrity: Li's mother Meng Ge (centre in sunglasses) leaves court after hearing the verdict. She is a well-known singer . Li performs a duet with his father General Li Shuangjiang: Many Chinese had feared he would be given a lenient sentence because of his high profile family . Liu Shanying, politics researcher from . the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the public scrutiny of the . case likely played a role in ensuring Li was not acquitted or given a . light sentence. 'There has . been too much public sentiment involved in this case, namely the hatred . of the rich and powerful. That hatred has shaped and dominated the . public sentiment,' Liu said. 'And the ruling has been directly or . indirectly influenced by that.' Meng Ge arriving at court: The ten years sentence is the maximum term her son could have received . By mid-afternoon, Li's case was the hottest topic in China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo, with his name the most-searched term. In . a news conference, the court took the highly unusual move of commenting . on the public attention to trial, saying court officials understood the . 'grave responsibility' that came with the case and rigorously adhered . to China's penal law in handling the case. 'We believed the focus of the public attention was whether the case would be tried strictly by law, and whether the verdict would be just,' Fan Jun, a court official overseeing cases involving minors, said at the news conference, according to official transcripts posted online. The case also had generated discussion of how Chinese courts would deal with violence in cases where the victim's reputation questioned. On Thursday, the court said allegations that the victim might be a prostitute were irrelevant to the rape case. 'The key is whether the female has consented to sex,' Fan said. Li Tianyi said he was drunk and passed out during the incident, that he never beat or had sex with the woman and that he could remember little of the night in question, according to state media. But the Haidian court said Li was a main culprit, noting Li grabbed the victim's arm and dragged her into the hotel and that Li was seen hitting her head and face in an elevator as recorded on surveillance. It said Li demanded the woman to disrobe and when she refused, slapped her, kicked her and stripped her with another defendant. It said Li was the first to force sex on the victim. Li had run into legal trouble before the rape conviction. After beating a couple following a collision in 2011, Li was sent to a labour camp in the widely publicised case .","Li Tianyi, 17, is given maximum jail term by Beijing court .

"By . Rebecca Evans . Naomi Wilkinson, 50, a star of British theatre design, was found dead in her Islington home in November last year, eight months after her artist husband Paul Mason took his own life . A grief-stricken theatre designer killed herself because she felt unable to live without her husband who had committed suicide months earlier. Days before her death, Naomi Wilkinson had sent a text message to her dead husband Charles Mason’s old phone, which read: ‘I don’t think I can do this any more.’ Miss Wilkinson, 50, who created sets for the English National Opera, was found dead beside photographs of her artist husband after inhaling toxic fumes. St Pancras Coroner’s Court in London heard that the couple had been inseparable for 25 years but Mr Mason had committed suicide last March after a ‘depressive episode’. Miss Wilkinson was heartbroken by his death, and wrote letters and messages to him most days. The court heard she was found in the basement of her Islington home on November 19 next to the photographs and a rose in a vase. A note left for her family said: ‘Don’t feel sad, you have all done so, so much to help me, but I don’t want to live without Charles. I am so lucky to have had such a beautiful love xx.’ Her brother Anthony Wilkinson had gone round to check on his sister after she had stopped responding to his calls and messages. He said his sister had been ‘devastated’ after her 50-year-old husband killed himself but had seemed to be improving. He last saw her in Dublin a few days before she died, where she had enjoyed herself with her brothers and had seemed fine. However, as she was leaving, she remembered one of their favourite songs and wrote the text message saying: ‘I don’t think I can do this any more.’ Ms Wilkinson's husband Charles Mason took his own life eight months . before she was found by family at her home in Islington, . north London . Ms Wilkinson was discovered dead at her home in Liverpool Road, Islington, north London after her worried family called in the police . Mr Wilkinson added: ‘She was seeing a . bereavement counsellor and was trying to deal with it but the note . showed she did not want to live without Charles.’ Coroner Mary Hassell recorded a verdict of suicide as a result of ‘acute carbon monoxide poisoning’. Miss Wilksinson grew up in West Sussex and married Mr Mason, a successful sculptor, in 1991. They did not have any children. In . 2009, she designed costumes and sets for the critically acclaimed 2009 . production of Peer Gynt at the Barbican.

Back in 2009, the world economy was in a state of deep stagnation, but in the U.S. state of Illinois a small army of 2,000 construction men armed with spades and drills couldn’t have been busier. Working in secrecy, they were installing a 827-mile-long underground fibre-optic cable between Chicago and New York. There were already cables linking the two cities, but this one was different. The 1½in-wide plastic tube containing 400 hair-thin strands of glass had to travel in a straight line, even if that meant passing it through mountains and under car parks and rivers. Traders use super-fast broadband connections to gain a competitive advantage on their rivals (stock image) The slightest kink in the route would incur the wrath of the project’s boss, who would exasperatedly tell engineers that even deviating by the width of a road would cost him 100 nanoseconds — or a millionth of a second — in the time it took for data to travel from one city to the other. Installing the cable was to cost £180 million, but the investors behind it were convinced it was going to make them very, very rich. For they had calculated that using this cable rather than the existing, less direct, ones would cut the time it took to send a message between the two cities from 17 milliseconds to 13. That’s a fraction of the time it takes to blink very quickly, yet the minuscule time difference is enough to allow sophisticated computer programmes to exploit profitably tiny price differences between the Chicago and New York stock exchanges. These split seconds saved in the transmission of information, an industry expert  calculated, were worth an astonishing £12 billion a year to those who knew how to exploit them. The new superfast cable would be used by around 200 trading companies, and its owners were asking each potential client to pay more than £8 million for the privilege. Welcome to the extremely lucrative world of ‘high-frequency trading’ (HFT). This involves the electronic buying and selling of shares at speeds thousands of times faster than any human can manage. Incredibly, these high-frequency deals now make up half of the trades on America’s public stock markets. The high-speed computers and internet connections shave milliseconds off the time it take to trade which can lead to major profits . Yet according to an incendiary new book, Flash Boys: Cracking The Money Code, by leading financial journalist Michael Lewis, high-frequency traders are using the superspeed technology not to improve efficiency but to skim off ‘incalculable billions’ from pension and investment funds, damaging national economies in the process. In effect, he says, the technology enables these traders to manipulate the markets in their own favour. The way they do this is fiendishly simple. Cables such as the New York-Chicago one are coupled to superfast computers which allow the high-frequency traders to see the orders placed by everyone else on the stock exchange — from ordinary investors like you and me to the biggest pension funds — milliseconds before the deals close. Those milliseconds are all the high-frequency traders need to jump in ahead of the original purchasers, snap up whatever those ordinary investors were trying to buy, thereby pushing up the price a little, and then selling it to the buyer for a profit. While this may not be technically illegal, according to Lewis, it is certainly unethical. The world of High Frequency Trading while not illegal is viewed by some as unethical . His depiction of these traders as a new breed of financial parasite has inflamed passions on Wall Street and in the City of London. Some bankers and traders have accused Lewis of over-stating the evils of HFT. But others agree with him, arguing that high-frequency traders are able to buy too many unfair advantages over ordinary investors, not just with those super-fast cables but also by paying stock exchanges for market information on planned share purchases a fraction of a second before they happen. Last week, one of Wall Street’s most senior brokers, Charles Schwab, called HFT a ‘growing cancer’ that should be made illegal. Traders have created a ‘technological arms race designed to pick the pockets of legitimate market participants’, he said. Now, the FBI has just announced it will investigate whether high-frequency traders are guilty of insider trading. American author Michael Lewis  is a former London broker whose previous books, Liar’s Poker and The Big Short, have also exposed the banking world’s misdeeds. Flash Boys reveals that today’s high-frequency trading rooms are deathly quiet. Nobody screams ‘Sell! Sell! Sell!’ or frantically waves slips of paper, because it is computers that do the actual trading as opposed to people. Since the advent of high-speed computers, the sound of traders on the floor shouting 'sell' is a thing of the past in places like the New York Stock Exchange (pictured) And these super-powered mainframe computers use sophisticated software allowing them to sift through acres of financial data looking for price discrepancies and split-second trading opportunities which they can then automatically exploit. The price movements might be tiny but, with millions of trades each day, it adds up into a multi-billion pound business. The traders — many of them maths and physics graduates — spend their days sitting in front of a bank of computer screens, staring at endless figures scrolling in front of them to make sure the machines don’t slip up. Whatever the morality, HFT is now a major force in markets across the world: high-frequency traders are even battling for an edge on the trading communication links between London and New York. A new super-speed fibre-optic cable is being laid across the Atlantic, taking a more direct route than existing cables. Again, the time saving — just 5.2 milliseconds — is minuscule but, for those who trade in both the U.S. and UK, potentially worth millions. So how, exactly, does HFT work? Say you want to buy 50,000 shares in Marks & Spencer. You place your order — either electronically or over the phone — to a broker or bank, which then tries to find the best price by getting its computer to search the various stock exchanges. But the computer request from the broker or bank takes a small amount of time to reach those exchanges electronically. In that small time delay, the HFTs pounce, buying the 50,000 M&S shares, which pushes up the market price very slightly, and then selling them to you for a profit at the higher price. In 2006, one man set out to find out exactly what the high-frequency traders were up to. Brad Katsuyama, the hero of Michael Lewis’s book, was a mild-mannered banker who worked for the Royal Bank of Canada in New York, who simply couldn’t understand what was happening on his computer screen. He would find thousands of shares available for sale at a certain price. But when he pushed the ‘buy’ button, he might be able to buy a small percentage of them at the right price — only for the rest to have become suddenly more expensive. When other traders told him the same thing was happening to them, Katsuyama began to suspect they were being manipulated. But how exactly? The solution, he eventually discovered, was laughably simple. The closer a broker was to a stock market’s computer base, the quicker it would receive his message. The FBI (pictured) has launched an investigation as to whether High Frequency Traders have been guilty of insider trading . And so, when he put in an order for shares that had to be met by several exchanges — there are 13 different exchanges in the U.S. — only the closest one to him in geographical terms would sell the shares at the original price. At the same time, the computers of high-frequency traders would be able to see his intention to buy shares in that particular commodity, and — exploiting their split-second advantage — would buy up those shares at the exchanges that were further away, then offer them back to the original buyer at a higher price. Thus the buyer — whether a private investor or a giant pension fund — would end up paying more. High-frequency trading can happen anywhere, but it works best when there is a fragmented market — in other words, not one but lots of exchanges, preferably some distance away from each other.In Britain, for example, the London Stock Exchange is in the City, but there are six others. BATS Global Markets, a U.S. company, built one some miles away in the Docklands area of the East End. Another, Chi-X, has been built west of London in Slough. The New York Stock Exchange also has a British branch in Basildon, Essex. Each new exchange has been linked to the others by — guess what? — new high-speed cable links.If you were of a suspicious turn of mind, says Michael Lewis, you might notice that these new exchanges are always located a ‘surprising’ distance from the original one. His implication is clear: exchanges are being set up at least partly with an eye on how they can be exploited by high-frequency traders, who will pay for the privilege of having access to the fastest electronic links. Last July, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority fined a corrupt America-based HFT operator, Michael Coscia, $903,000 (nearly £600,000) for deliberately manipulating prices on trades spanning the U.S. and the UK — its first action against a high-frequency trader. This week the European Union vowed to launch the toughest-yet clampdown on these so-called ‘flash boys’, bring in new rules to force traders to have their precious algorithms — the programmes running automated trading — tested and regulated. Critics say there are many more corrupt traders out there, but high-frequency trading is so murky it’s difficult to know who’s doing what. Now, Michael Lewis’s explosive new book is putting pressure on authorities to investigate HFT further. ‘He’s managed to make everyone in this business incredibly defensive and look incredibly bad,’ a former high-frequency trader told me yesterday. If this row has exposed one glaring weakness about HFT, it’s that it is so complicated that virtually nobody can explain exactly how it works. That’s precisely what was said about the sub-prime mortgage fiasco which led to the last global financial crisis. To avoid another melt-down, would traders do well to spare a nanosecond or two to reflect on that?","Traders use super-fast internet to shave milliseconds off the time it takes to do business .

"By . Tom Leonard . You are a businessman in London with a crucial dinner this evening in Tokyo. Even allowing for the nine-hour time difference, you won’t need to reset your morning alarm as you’ll be on the ground and knocking back the sake just two hours after take-off. Or maybe you’re a busy working woman keen to get the Christmas shopping done. You can’t waste too much time on it - so how about New York? You’ll be there in less than an hour. Boarding all rows for Flight Hypersonic! Lockheed Martin are developing the SR-72 spy plane with an engine which could propel it up to 4,567mph, or six times the speed of sound. The same technology could be used in passenger jets . Long restricted to the realms of sci-fi, the dream of flying at least five times the speed of sound - and getting anywhere in the world in less time than it takes to go from King’s Cross to Newcastle on the fast train - came a step nearer this month. Engineers at Lockheed Martin in the U.S. revealed that they are developing the SR-72, a successor to the SR-71, the iconic Blackbird long-distance spy plane. The Blackbird holds the air speed record of Mach 3 - three times the speed of sound - but the SR-72 will go twice that speed, at up to 4,567 mph. At Mach 6, it would be three times as fast as Concorde. Able to circumnavigate the globe in six hours at an altitude of about 80,000ft, Son of Blackbird, as it’s been dubbed, will be an extraordinary weapon of war: effectively, it will be too fast to shoot down and too fast for moving military targets to avoid it. Indeed, it will be so fast it will have to be clad in a skin made from titanium crystals wrapped in carbon fibre to resist the extreme friction heat such speeds will create. All very useful militarily, but the question many scientists and aviation experts have been asking is: can the same technology be used to transform civil aviation to send passengers around the world in lightning speed? Enthusiasts have been talking up hypersonic travel for years and, apart from a few short-lived experiments, nothing much has happened. This is largely because the field is fiendishly expensive to develop and the technical difficulties enormous. But what has excited aviation experts about Lockheed Martin’s announcement is that it claims to have overcome the biggest technical hurdle -  the so-called ‘thrust gap’ in the  plane’s propulsion. Essentially, while a conventional jet turbine can get a plane up to Mach 2.5, the so-called ‘scramjet’ - a powerful jet engine that can work at extraordinarily high speeds by sucking in supersonic air - cannot start working until the plane is flying at more than Mach 3.5. The problem is bridging the gap from the lower speed to the higher one. But Lockheed says it has designed an engine that can do just that, powering the aircraft from a standstill to Mach 6. ‘It’s a significant step forward. They seem to have simplified things,’ says Dr Phillip Atcliffe, senior lecturer in aeronautical engineering at Salford University. A specialist in hypersonic flight, he believes such travel would be a ‘great development for mankind’, but adds: ‘It would shrink the world even more than we already have, but it’s not going to happen overnight. ‘There’s a lot of technology to be developed and we have to have governments and companies who are prepared to research and design it - and then airlines to buy it.’ But he believes that if the money were available - and we are talking serious money - a hypersonic passenger jet would not be unfeasible. It could even be developed by 2030. Nobody denies the challenges of building a Mach 6 passenger jet would be far greater than for a spy plane the size of a fighter jet. Any passenger jet to use the engines would be able to reach Tokyo in two hours and have to fly at around 25,000ft to avoid damaging building with its sonic boom - just like the Fireflash jet in the original Thunderbirds . It would have to be a lot bigger and - most important - it would have to protect its passengers from the intense heat created by the plane’s extraordinary speed as it passes through the atmosphere. Concorde flew no faster than Mach 2, primarily because the materials weren’t available in the Sixties that could withstand greater heat. Technology has advanced since then, and the SR-72 will be a so-called ‘warm structure’ - it will heat up rather than reflect the heat with the sort of ceramic tiles that covered the Space Shuttle. There’s also the noise to consider. Concorde wasn’t allowed to fly supersonic over land because of the ‘sonic boom’ - the sound associated with the shockwaves created by a craft moving faster than the speed of sound. According to experts, if a passenger jet flew at Mach 6 at current jet altitudes of around 30,000ft, the sonic boom could damage buildings. So how high might a hypersonic passenger jet have to fly, and  how long might it take to get around the skies? Believe it or not, Dr Atcliffe refers me to the very first episode of the children’s TV series Thunderbirds, in which the brave puppets of International Rescue have to deal with a bomb on board a hypersonic airliner, the Fireflash. ‘The episode was made in 1964, but they got it right in so many ways,’ he says. ‘It flew from London to Tokyo in two hours at Mach 6, which is surprisingly accurate if you allow for acceleration at the start and deceleration at the end.’ The Fireflash flew at about 250,000ft - still within the Earth’s atmosphere - and Dr Atcliffe reckons this, too, could be about the perfect altitude. It would be sufficiently high to cut down the heat generated because the atmosphere is colder and thinner. As for the flying experience, cocooned inside their pressurised cabin, hypersonic passengers would probably experience little that was different from flying today. Acceleration might be a little faster on take-off with the plane taking about 23 minutes to reach Mach 6. Clearly, there wouldn’t be much time for films, and the crew would have to be quick with the drinks trolley and duty frees. One major difference: for heat protection, there might not be any windows - even in the cockpit, where pilots would have to fly by computer. And what about the question that would surely be uppermost in passengers’ minds: would it be safe to travel at almost 5,000mph? Virgin Galactic has said its SS2 craft designed for space tourism could also be adapted into a passenger jet, allowing travel from London to Sydney in two hours but would rely on gravity in orbit, rather than engines, to reach its destination . Concorde suffered only one major accident, but it was catastrophic - the 2000 Air France disaster in which all 109 people on board died after the plane hit a piece of debris on the runway as it took off from Paris. ‘If anything goes wrong, it’s going to go wrong very quickly, and the potential for disaster is that much greater,’ warns Dr Atcliffe. ‘If something breaks the plane’s skin, at that sort of speed the airflow is so powerful it can start tearing chunks off the plane and it would disintegrate very quickly.’ And there’d be no room for a malfunctioning air con system or passengers would start to cook. Aeronautical experts admit this is all uncharted territory - even the Space Shuttle reached such high temperatures only for a few minutes as it re-entered Earth’s atmosphere. It’s also hard to say how much it might cost to fly hypersonic. Ticket prices will inevitably depend on how many passengers a plane can carry - so the more it can hold, the more commercially viable the flight. Concorde had room for only 100 passengers, but it was limited by Sixties technology. Experts say there is no reason why a hypersonic jet couldn’t take up to 300 passengers. Not that it will look as pretty as a conventional jetliner, and certainly not as sleek as Concorde. It’s more likely, says Dr Atcliffe, that the wings would blend into the fuselage more closely and that it would have a stubby shape to cope with the huge air pressures. But despite the excitement in the voices of aeronautical professionals, Jock Lowe, BA’s former chief Concorde pilot, has been saying for years that a hypersonic passenger jet just won’t fly as an idea, and he’s not changing his tune now. ‘I know how difficult it was to design and build Concorde and that was far more do-able,’ he tells me. ‘It’s simply not practical for anything bigger than a small spy plane,’ he insists. Maintenance could also be an issue, says Jock. ‘Imagine the Space Shuttle being turned around in an hour and being sent off again . . . that’s the size of the problem.’ The industry doesn’t appear to share his views: aircraft giant Boeing is also researching hypersonic flight and calls it, in a nod to Star Trek, the ‘warp speed of today’. The Victorians believed travelling at more than 30mph would make the human body collapse. What they would have made of technology that could propel people at 150 times that velocity is anyone’s guess.","Lockheed Martin is developing engines for SR-72 spy plane .

"By . Tom Leonard . Rise of the machines: Internet giant Google appears to be assembling an army of robots, such as the Terminator-style Atlas . Just imagine a future in which the word ‘Google’ and the internet giant’s ‘Don’t Be Evil’ motto are emblazoned on factory workers, delivery drivers, soldiers, housekeepers and care home staff. Apart from working for the world’s most powerful internet company, these workers would all have something else in common: they would all be robots. The online search behemoth already dominates our lives to an extent that makes many of us uneasy, with its intrusive global mapping, shameless hoarding of our private data and Google Glass, the spectacle-style computers that will relay everything wearers see back to the company and its advertiser clients. It’s even patenting an electronic throat tattoo that would allow wearers to issue voice commands to their smartphones, tablets and other devices. Many of us don’t need any encouragement to think of the £57 billion California-based multinational as a deeply creepy enterprise. Yet the news that it has been quietly buying up the world’s leading makers of robots and robotic parts has caused some surprise in the technology world. When it emerged that Google has even bought a pioneering military robot-maker, Boston Dynamics, curiosity turned to alarm. There has been talk of android apocalypse and comparisons to Skynet — the evil artificial intelligence system in the Terminator science-fiction films, which tries to blot out humanity with its killer robots. Boston Dynamics certainly makes some scary stuff: animal-like and human-like machines with eerily realistic running, lifting and jumping abilities that could transform a future battlefield. Its creations include BigDog, whose four human-like legs are so nimble that they can stumble and then recover, even on ice or after being kicked hard by a human. When fitted with an arm, BigDog can hurl huge cinderblocks nearly 20ft. Then there’s Cheetah, which can run at 28 mph. That’s faster than Usain Bolt. And Atlas, a 6ft 2in, 24st bipedal robot, looking alarmingly like the terrifying cyborg terminators of the films. It can drive a car, walk on rough ground and is virtually indestructible — still able to balance on one leg even when a wrecking ball is sent crashing into it. As for the humanoid Petman (whose primary purpose is supposedly to test chemical protection clothing), it can charge up stairs and do press-ups. Scroll Down for Video . Obedient: Boston Dynamics Big Dog has been designed to support troops on the battlefield . BigDog's four human-like legs are so nimble that they can stumble and then recover, even on ice or after being kicked hard by a human . Wildcat gallops along like a headless metal horse, carries heavy loads and can obey verbal commands. The little four-wheeled Sand Flea weighs just 11lb but can jump 30ft in the air — high enough to land on the roof of a house. Boston Dynamics’ main customer is the Pentagon’s shadowy technical research arm, the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. The Pentagon says robots could play a crucial role in toxic disaster zones where humans cannot go. What it doesn’t say is that they could also come in pretty handy when it comes to killing people. What, one might ask, could an internet company possibly want with such a nightmarish menagerie? Sceptics have long painted Google as a sinister James Bond-style corporate villain, working secretly towards eventual world domination. Might the conspiracy theorists be onto something? The Boston Dynamics deal — the eighth robot firm Google has bought in the past few months — shows the company is deadly serious about a robot-filled future. Google co-founder Larry Page has long said that it was technology’s job to free humans from drudgery and repetitive tasks. Andy Rubin, Google’s robot chief and . the tech wizard who developed the Android software for mobile phones, . has said that within the decade robots will have replaced Google’s . factory workers and its delivery drivers. Nimble: The Atlas robot negotiates its way along an obstacle course. Google has bought the machine's designers - pioneering military robot-maker, Boston Dynamics . Earlier this year, it hired Ray Kurzweil, an expert on artificial intelligence, as head of engineering. If you didn’t believe that Google only has our best interests at heart, one might feel a little disconcerted by Mr Kurzweil’s delight in comparing the human body to computer software — and finding us woefully inadequate. We are all ‘out of date’ and in need of updating, he has said. He has outlined a future that includes so-called nanobots that augment our immune systems to help fight diseases, improve health and allow people to live longer. Google is also developing a driverless car and says it is investing in a drone delivery programme — as is online mega-retailer Amazon. The latter’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, recently announced that flying delivery drones will deliver some of its packages within five years. Google co-founder Larry Page has long said that it was technology's job to free humans from drudgery and repetitive tasks . You can see the appeal of beating traffic jams by delivering urgent packages by air — even if the idea does remind you of those Fifties newsreels that predicted a future in which everyone would commute by gyrocopter. But what Google has planned for its army of creeping, crawling and jumping mechanical creatures is harder to gauge. The company, which has untold spare billions it can sink into any ‘blue sky’ project it likes, remains tight-lipped about its plans. (As soon as it buys each robot-maker, the secretive Google closes down the firm’s website.) It has simply said its robotic division is a ‘moonshot’ — a speculative punt. Still, the company’s bosses have dropped a few hints about what they have in mind, and it’s clear that those who initially thought Google simply wanted to replace humans with robots in its factories were wide of the mark. That’s obvious simply from the number and nature of the robot companies it has bought. One designs robotic torsos that can interact with people at home; another makes what it calls ‘human-centred hyper-agility robots’ (meaning they move in a human fashion); another produces a robotic camera system that was used in the making of the space thriller Gravity. Google sees robots as transforming society. It presumably envisions a future in which there are as many robots as there are people. Some scientists are enthusiastic, seeing a revolution that will free humanity from the tedious tasks of modern life — or, with battlefield robots, remove human soldiers from the danger of getting hurt or killed. Others are concerned about the long-term consequences of allowing machines to replace humans wholesale — especially if they are controlled by a company with such a dismal track record on respecting  our right to privacy  as Google. Professor Illah Nourbasksh, of Carnegie Mellon University, one of the world’s foremost robotics academics, acknowledges that conspiracy theorists see a sci-fi future in which, as one put it, Google’s plans mark the ‘long and dangerous road ... to human extinction’. He says he recently heard the head of a domestic drone company say she fantasises about a future in which a flying drone delivers her a bottle of water at the end of her morning run. Retailer Amazon recently announced that flying delivery drones will deliver some of its packages within five years . But imagine if every jogger has a drone noisily hovering in the air, jostling for position not just with each other but with other robots, such as so-called ‘adbots’, waiting to attract our attention and beam a specially tailored advert at us. Such ‘robot smog’, he writes in The New Yorker, could ‘transform the worst effects of digital devices into real-world annoyances that cannot be silenced or hidden in a pocket’. And don’t expect robots to understand the gestures and tone of voice we use with each other to communicate effectively — because they won’t, he warns. As for who is master of whom, just remember that you may know little about the robot —but it, beaming back images and information to Google’s databases, will know everything about you. One part of the population who, experts predict, will be seeing more and more of robots — whether they like it or not — is the elderly. With too few human carers to look after our expanding older population, robots are seen as one answer. Researchers have already discovered that some types of robots — cuddly ones that look like stuffed toys — make better companions than pets for older people. People wanted to talk to them even more than they did real dogs. Tests in the U.S. have showed pensioners were comfortable with being looked after by robots, delegating tasks such as cleaning and the laundry. They were even willing to let them hand them their medicine. Yet they preferred the human touch when it came to more personal tasks such as bathing and dressing them. Scientists differ over when we can expect this dawn of the robots. But one thing remains certain: it will be sooner than you think.","Internet giant has been buying up the world's leading makers of robots .

"By . Tom Leonard . Here we go: Veteran British actor Patrick Stewart and other Twitter users rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange . Dozens of Twitter’s British staff were in line for a huge payout yesterday as shares in the company soared to almost double their original price on the first day of trading in New York. Britain is the social media website’s biggest market after the US and a clutch of senior employees in London could make sums well into six figures thanks to owning shares in the company. They include Bruce Daisley, the UK general manager. With investors asking for 30 times the number of shares that were on offer, demand was always expected to be strong when veteran British actor Patrick Stewart and other Twitter users rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange. In a trading frenzy that recalled the days of the dotcom bubble, the site added billions of pounds to its value in hours. Anxious to avoid a repetition of the Facebook stock market launch, in which lukewarm investors proved it had been over-valued at £65billion, Twitter bosses valued the site at a relatively modest £11billion. With management, including co-founder Jack Dorsey, on the trading floor to watch their fortunes surge, shares opened at around £28 – 75 per cent above Twitter’s initial offer of £16. All smiles: Twitter CEO Dick Costolo (right) celebrates the Twitter IPO with Twitter founders Jack Dorsey (left), Biz Stone (second left) and Evan Williams on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange . Within two hours, they were even higher, before settling back to close at £28. Mr Dorsey – who critics have accused of cynically downplaying the role of others in setting up Twitter – saw the value of his shares rise to at least £686million during the day. The flurry of buying and selling pushed a company that has never made a profit in its seven-year existence to be valued around the same as long-established giants such as KFC and the Pizza Hut owner Yum!

Most are divided up between big investors such as mutual funds and the banks who set up the flotation.

"By . Tom Leonard . My Beatle brother: Louise Harrison poses with George in the Sixties . As a Beatle, George Harrison always hankered for the quiet life - it was his eldest sister, Louise, told since she was a little girl that she could be the next Shirley Temple, who longed to be famous. Neither of them got their wish. The former Beatle died in November 2001, leaving more than £100million in his will, as well as Friar Park, his huge Gothic pile in Henley-on-Thames, just one of a number of lavish homes around the world. As for his big sister, she couldn’t be further away from the 120-room mansion splendour of his life - living alone at the age of 82 in a mobile home in Branson, Missouri, and getting by on the uncertain income from a Beatles tribute band she set up. The Harrisons were brought up to be  self-reliant and Louise says she is not the type to whinge about her lot. She tells me she is financially ‘struggling’ but quickly adds: ‘But wouldn’t you say everyone is?’ Her one-bedroom mobile home - she has another next door - may not be worth very much, but at least she owns them and the land they are on, unlike the thousands with heavily mortgaged homes they can’t afford, she says. ‘George never enjoyed being rich - he said that The Beatles were just targets when they became rich and there was always some predator coming after them. Every golddigger in the world was after The Beatles,’ she says. ‘I didn’t want to become a millionaire after what happened to him. I won’t even buy a lottery ticket for fear of winning.’ She doesn’t mind not living in a castle, she adds. She would rather be broke than wealthy and heartless. This is perhaps just as well since, as she revealed yesterday, not only was she completely left out of her brother’s will, but the monthly $2,000 (£1,250) pension he had set up for her in 1980 - and meant her to have for life - was cut off by his family estate without explanation. At the time she didn’t have a job and was living on social security - which in the U.S. is not much - so it would have been quite a blow. She never discovered who took this somewhat heartless decision. She insists she has never asked George’s widow, Olivia, or his son, Dhani, who received most of Harrison’s wealth. But she knows George would have been upset. A long way from Beatlemania: The Branson, Missouri, property that Louise Harrison calls home. She has lived in America for more than 50 years and says she wants nothing from the family of her famous brother . Beatle: George Harrison a year before his death . at the Australian Grand Prix in 2000 (left), and during a rare public . appearance in Los Angeles in 1992 . ‘One of the things my brother said to me back in the Eighties was that, given his circumstances, there was no reason on this earth why a sister of his should ever experience any financial hardship.’ She insists she doesn’t care about the money or the implied slight from the family of a brother to whom she was once very close. ‘I was quite surprised, but I never argued about it, I just accepted it had been cancelled and got on with my life,’ she says. Louise and George’s parents taught them to pick themselves up if they fell. ‘I grew up in World War II during the air raids on Liverpool. If someone drops a bomb on your house, you just move out and get on with things. Just because you’re living in a mobile home, it doesn’t mean you’ll be living there for the rest of your life,’ she insists. And what about being left out of his will? ‘I was 11 years older than George and I don’t think either of us expected he would die before me,’ says Louise. Sprawling estate: Friar Park, the 120-room home in Henley-on-Thames where George Harrison lived with his wife Olivia and son, Dhani, before he passed away in 2001 . She may claim she’s not curious, but others will surely be puzzled to find out why the sister of one of the most famous men in popular music should be living in a trailer in Missouri, a state famous as the capital of the crystal meth drug industry. Could her modest financial situation have had anything to do with the falling out she had with her brother, which led to them not speaking for six years? She plays down the notion that there was a rift, although she concedes ‘he might have been told some weird things about me’. As children growing up in Liverpool’s Wavertree district, the siblings had been extremely close and they remained on good terms during his early Beatles days. By then - to borrow a line from the Fab Four - the itchy-footed Louise had started down a long and winding road. When we were Fab: Ed Sullivan with The Beatles Ringo Starr George Harrison (died November 2001) John Lennon (died December 1980) And Paul Mccartney On The Set Of The Ed Sullivan Show. 1964 . Forbidden by her father from pursuing her dream of becoming a film star by going to stage school, she married Donald Caldwell, a Scottish mining engineer, when she was 25. They moved to Canada and then to Peru before settling in Benton, Illinois. When The Beatles formed, she was very excited for her brother. ‘I was running around radio stations trying to get their records played,’ she recalls. ‘I was writing to their manager Brian Epstein every week with my research on the American music scene. 'He’d write back thanking me and asking if I could do the same for some of his other bands. I was really quite helpful in getting the band into the U.S.’ Did she get any reward for that? ‘I didn’t need any reward. My kid brother had a band and I wanted to see them to succeed,’ she says. She and Caldwell had two sons but divorced in 1970. She then moved to New York where she spent a lot of time with George, staying at the ritzy Plaza hotel and partying with him and Cynthia Lennon. In New York, where she briefly ran a travel business, she met her second husband, glass salesman Walter Kane. Walter got on famously with George and the couple would spend a month in Britain each year, staying at Harrison’s Friar Park home. All those years ago: George Harrison with his parents Harold and Louise Harrison at home in Liverpool . But the marriage didn’t last and they split up in 1983. Louise says both her husbands were alcoholics. ‘When I got my second divorce, George said: “Don’t go getting married, I’ll take care of you”.’ But instead of growing closer, they moved apart. Insiders say the privacy-obsessed Harrison distanced himself from his sister in the mid-Nineties because he disapproved of the way she was exploiting her connection with him. She would be paid to speak at Beatles conventions and in 1993, when she asked him to join the board of a peace project she had set up, he refused. The final straw came two years later when her old home in Benton was converted into a Beatles-themed B&B called A Hard Day’s Nite. Louise didn’t own the venture but did supply it with Beatles memorabilia and helped publicise it. For the next six years until his death, they didn’t meet - despite several trips by the Beatle to  the U.S. - and had minimal communication. But almost 20 years on, she questions whether her brother was ever really angry with her. ‘If George had really been upset about something, he could always have called me.’ But she concedes that many of her letters to him went unreplied. ‘I think he was just too busy,’ she says. The pair did, however, have a final reconciliation. Louise drove hundreds of miles to see Harrison at his hospital bedside in Staten Island, New York. There were reports that the desperately frail Harrison initially refused to see her, but his wife made him change his mind. Staggering: British rock group the Beatles performing their last live public concert on the rooftop of the Apple Organization building for director Michael Lindsey-Hogg's film documentary, 'Let It Be,' on Savile Row, London, England . Holding hands, the siblings chatted about old times for 90 minutes, laughing at how he used to be teased for his sticking-out ears. Louise, who still has another sibling, Harry, in Britain, says her Beatle brother apologised to her. ‘You know, I could have been a lot more help to you; I’m sorry,’ she later recalled him saying. He could, of course, have changed his will at that point but he didn’t. Given his supposed views on the Fab Four B&B, one wonders what Harrison would have thought of her Beatles tribute band, Liverpool Legends. Louise says she set it up only because she needed an income after losing the pension. ‘I wanted to get guys who looked and sounded as much like The Beatles as possible but I also wanted the kind of guys that if George was still here, they would be his friends. I’ve always been very proud of how they’ve turned out. I’m more like their mum than their manager.’ Louise, who is a grandmother, moved from Illinois to Branson about seven years ago, effectively to follow the band. The town has a profusion of live entertainment venues and they saw a gap in the market for a rock ’n’ roll band. However, business has been slow, she admits. ‘I am struggling for money, like everyone, but I am not on the breadline. I am not “skint”, as they would say in Britain. I feel very fortunate to own outright the land that my two homes sit on - which is better than most,’ she says. ‘I’m 82 now and still in good health and good spirits. I’m fine.’ In some ways, her famous brother - who once told her of his dream to play guitar for just a handful of people in an obscure little bar - would be jealous of her modest but anonymous life, she says.","Louise Harrison, 82, now lives alone in a mobile home in Branson, Missouri .

"By . Mail Foreign Service . More than 300,000 people joined Asia’s dollar millionaire ranks last year swelling the combined wealth of the region’s mega-rich to £7.5 trillion. The number was 9.4% up on 2012 to 3.68 million people, according to a survey by CapGemini and Royal Bank of Canada. Economic growth, strong stock markets, rising property prices and the region’s high savings rates helped boost fortunes. Super-rich: The number of people worth more than $1million in places like China, pictured, and Japan has risen by 9.4% . The report defines wealthy as those with at least $1 million (£630,000) in liquid assets. It covered ten Asian countries and territories including China, Japan, Australia and South Korea. Asia was surpassed only by North America, where the millionaire population grew 11.5 percent to 3.73 million. A Chinese investor watches stock prices which have risen in the last few years, causing an increase in the number of millionaires in Asia . Asia’s millionaire population outnumbered Europe’s for the first time in 2009, and in 2011 it edged out North America for top spot, according to previous editions of the report. The report’s authors forecast that Asia would reclaim its crown as soon as 2014. The superrich, defined as those worth at least £19million, grew even faster than the millionaire population at large. Their ranks in Asia grew 15.4 percent last year to 25,000 while combined wealth rose 18 percent, about double the global average. Earlier this month, the Hurun Report, which tracks China’s wealthy, said surging stock prices helped mint 64 new billionaires this year, raising the total number to 315, compared with none a decade ago. At about the same time, Wealth-X, which follows the world’s wealthy, said Asia’s superrich population grew four per cent to 44,505. Eric Lascelles, RBC asset management’s chief economist, chalked up some of the rebound in the fortunes of the superrich to more aggressive investments, which tend to get hit harder in downturns and rise more rapidly on the rebound. He said: 'Equally we need to acknowledge that globalisation over the past few decades has increased inequality to some extent. 'We have seen rates of poverty decline quite nicely over that period as well but that’s not to say that wealth or incomes have risen as quickly in the lower end as it has in the higher end.'

"By . Tom Leonard . With a powerful performance as a slave owner in the Oscar-nominated 12 Years a Slave, Benedict Cumberbatch has been wowing cinema-goers. But for a newly elected New York city official, the film resonates on a more personal level. Stacey Cumberbatch, chief of administrative services to the city’s mayor, revealed an unlikely family link when she spoke to reporters. Scroll down for video . Stacey Cumberbatch (left), one of New York's new commissioners, says she got her surname from the slave-owner ancestor of 12 Years A Slave actor Benedict Cumberbatch (right) She claims that her ancestors were . owned by the Sherlock star’s family way back in the 18th century on a . sugar plantation on Barbados. The . 37-year-old actor has previously told how his . great-great-great-great-great grandfather, Abraham Cumberbatch, built . the family fortune with a plantation on the Caribbean island. Born in Bristol in 1726, the slave owner came from a family of merchants and adventurers and died in 1785. Cumberbatch . has said that his surname became common among families in the Caribbean . as slaves often used to take the name of their masters. Miss . Cumberbatch was born in the gritty New York borough of Queens, . graduated as a lawyer and has spent a long career in city and US state . government. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said that her heritage ‘has driven her to excellence’. Cumberbatch has played several roles which reference his great-grandfather's role as a slave owner, including in Academy Award-nominated 12 Years A Slave . The Sherlock actor's mother apparently asked him not to use his real name during his career for fear of repatriation lawsuits by former slaves . In . contrast, Cumberbatch was raised in Kensington in London and educated . at Harrow. He has complained of being a victim of ‘posh-bashing’ and . threatened to move to America to escape being ‘castigated as a moaning, . rich, public-school b******, complaining about only getting posh roles’. He has insisted that he is middle class and ‘wasn’t born into land or titles, or new money or an oil rig’. His role in 12 Years a Slave isn’t the first time he has chosen a film that harks back to his family history. He . played William Pitt the Younger in the 2006 film Amazing Grace, which . told the story of William Wilberforce’s fight to eliminate slavery in . the British empire. Cumberbatch . said the role was a ‘sort of apology’ for his ancestor. Abraham Cumberbatch, an ancestor of Benedict, who lived from 1726 until 1785, owned a sugar plantation in Barbados where he owned slaves. It was common for slaves to take the surnames of their owners . The actor has previously . revealed that his mother, actress Wanda Veltham, had warned him against . using the family name professionally because it might prompt descendants . of the family’s slaves to seek compensation. Last night Cumberbatch had not responded to the latest revelations. Fourteen Caribbean countries are suing Britain, France and the Netherlands for billions of pounds in reparations for slavery.","Stacey Cumberbatch is one of New York's new commissioners .

"By . Tom Leonard . The Iranian nuclear power chief, Ali Akbar Salehi . Iran has accused four workers of trying to sabotage its nuclear power programme, tacitly blaming Israel for the plot. The Iranian nuclear power chief, Ali Akbar Salehi, said yesterday that the authorities had monitored the suspects as they worked in one of the country’s nuclear facilities and made the arrests at 'exactly the right time'. Although he did not spell out who he believed was responsible, he blamed 'hostile' nations – usually a reference to either Israel or the U.S. – which were opposed to current diplomatic efforts to resolve the row over Iran’s alleged nuclear weapons ambitions. As Iran is currently engaged in an all-out charm offensive with America while Israel has warned the world not to trust the Iranians, experts believe it is obvious where Mr Salehi is pointing the finger of blame. He later claimed Iranian authorities had foiled 'several cases' of similar sabotage attempts in the past 'two or three weeks' but did not elaborate. 'Hostile countries are not interested in finding way out of current situation and they are trying to block agreement on the nuclear case though acts of sabotage.' Tensions between Israel and Iran have sharpened in recent days with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week denouncing Iran’s attempts to reassure the West over its alleged nuclear weapons ambitions. Mr Netanyahu also revealed that Israel had arrested a Belgian-Iranian man on charges of spying for Iran. Israel believes it would be the most likely target of a nuclear-armed Iran. Tehran has accused the Israelis of carrying out a string of assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists in recent years. Iran has also claimed the US might be linked to past attacks on its nuclear programme but Mr Salehi suggested the latest alleged plot was tied to those who opposed his country’s diplomatic overtures to Washington. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week denounced Iran's attempts to reassure the West over alleged nuclear weapons . On Saturday, Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Mr Netanyahu wanted to 'blackmail the world' and stop any progress in nuclear talks with the US and European powers such as Britain and France. Talks over Iran’s nuclear programme are scheduled to resume next week in Geneva amid hopes of movement on all sides after their historic meetings at the recent United Nations General Assembly. The US and its allies have stressed that Iran and its supposedly moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, have to show concrete evidence that they are not trying to build nuclear weapons before they will ease crippling sanctions. Iran insists it only wants reactors for energy and medical use. Mr Salehi also noted that Iran has upgraded its protective measures against cyberattacks that have 'continued' over the past years. Iran periodically announces the arrest of suspects charged with espionage or attempts to sabotage its nuclear facilities, only to go quiet on their identity or fate. Israel claims the Belgian-Iranian it has arrested – Ali Mansouri - took notes on the security screenings at Israel’s international airport and photographed the US Embassy in Tel Aviv and a separate classified security installation.","Iranian nuclear power chief Ali Akbar Salehi said authorities had monitored suspects as they worked in one of the country's nuclear facilities .

"By . Tom Leonard . To foreigners, it is endearing if not a little baffling – the ultra-polite British habit of apologising for things that are not necessarily our fault. Now a study has found that saying a superfluous ‘I’m sorry’ makes us appear more trustworthy. The stereotype of the continually apologetic Brit, as depicted by actor Hugh Grant, has become a romantic comedy staple, amusing our American friends who clearly see the trait as a weakness. Unnecessary apologies feature heavily in the film FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, starring Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell (pictured), and now researchers have discovered that apologising for situations an individual is powerless to change, makes them appear more trustworthy to others . Their own experts now suggest this could be far from the case. Researchers . at Harvard Business School have discovered there are in fact . ‘significant’ advantages to apologising for problems beyond our control – . such as travel delays, a noisy restaurant or simply when someone else . carelessly knocks into you. Alison . Wood Brooks, assistant professor of business administration and lead . author of the study, said: ‘Superfluous apologies represent a powerful . and easy-to-use tool for social influence. Even in the absence of . culpability, individuals can increase trust and liking by saying “I’m . sorry” – even if they are merely sorry about the rain.’ The . study, co-authored with the University of Pennsylvania, used a number . of experiments to gauge the usefulness of the gratuitous ‘sorry’. In one . test, a male actor approached 65 strangers – 30 of them women – at a . rain-swept train station and asked to borrow their mobile phone. In one of the experiments a male actor approached 65 strangers on a rainy day and asked to borrow their mobile phone. Demonstrating the power of an apology, half of the strangers offered to lend him their phone if he apologised for the weather, compared with only nine per cent when he asked straight out . Half the time he simply made the request and the other half he prefaced it by saying: ‘I’m sorry about the rain!’ Almost half the strangers lent him their phone when he apologised – but just 9 per cent agreed to do so when he did not. The . same trend emerged during a laboratory experiment, in which 177 adults . watched a video of a stranger approaching a delayed passenger at an . airport and asked to borrow his or her phone. Many more said they would lend the phone if the stranger apologised over the flight delay. In . another experiment, 178 students were told they were playing a . financial computer game with a partner sitting in another room. They were warned the computer would sometimes override their decisions. Whenever . this happened and their partner apologised for the computer, the . student tended to rate him or her as more trustworthy, and became more . generous towards them. Another experiment found that people were more willing to lend their mobile phones to someone who apologised for a flight delay before asking to make a call than someone who simply asked for a favour .","American researchers said .

"By . Tom Leonard . Barack Obama is to be given only 90 days by the US Senate to deal with Bashar al-Assad. The upper house’s foreign relations committee last night approved a resolution that permits the president to order a ‘limited and tailored’ military operation. But that mission should not exceed 90 days and nor could it involve any US troops on the ground for combat operations, they said. 'My credibility is not on the line': Barack Obama answers questions in Sweden yesterday . Deadline: Obama has been given only 90 days by the U.S Senate to deal with Bashar al-Assad, pictured . The resolution also calls on the administration to submit to Congress a strategy for achieving a political settlement in Syria. Before deciding on the move, the committee grilled secretary of state John Kerry and military chiefs for three hours about their plans. ‘We have an obligation to act, not witness and watch while a humanitarian tragedy is unfolding in plain view,’ said the committee’s chairman, Bob Menendez. After announcing that he would ask Congress to rubber stamp his plan to take military action over Syria’s use of chemical weapons, Mr Obama has been buoyed by the support of Republican leaders. Questions: Secretary of State John Kerry was grilled by the foreign affairs committee before a decision was made . The US president was in Sweden’s capital Stockholm yesterday on an official visit before the G20 summit in Russia. He said he expected Congress to approve his plans for strikes, declaring: ‘My credibility’s not on the line, the international community’s credibility’s on the line.’ He also pointed to the consensus against the use of chemical weapons dating back a century. ‘I didn’t set a red line, the world set a red line,’ he said. ‘The world set a red line when governments representing 98 per cent of the world’s populations said the curse of chemical weapons is abhorrent.’ Delay: John McCain delayed the Senate decision after declaring that he would oppose it . The Senate panel voted on its resolution yesterday after a delay caused by John McCain saying he would oppose it. The former Republican presidential contender and Vietnam veteran, who said he was unhappy with its wording, has considerable sway over party colleagues on foreign policy. Call to arms: Yesterday, French prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault echoed Mr Obama as he defended his government¿s call for military action . Members of the House of Representatives have come up with a similar draft resolution for their colleagues to consider. It would limit a military campaign to 60 days and prohibit the use of ground forces. With the decision on the resolutions in both the House and Senate likely to be a conscience vote, the president cannot take the backing of either for granted. Congressmen on both sides are opposed to any military intervention while others want to see more convincing evidence that al-Assad is using chemical weapons. Yesterday, French prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault echoed Mr Obama as he defended his government’s call for military action. He told the French parliament any response should be ‘strong, quick and targeting specific objectives’. ‘To not act would be to put in danger peace and security in the entire region,’ he said. Meanwhile, German intelligence agents are said to have eavesdropped on a vital telephone call proving that Assad ordered the suspected chemical attack in Damascus. The BND agents heard a high-level Hezbollah official – the Lebanese terror group that supports the Assad regime – talking to the Iranian embassy in Lebanon. In the call, the commander admitted poison gas was used only because Assad ‘lost his nerve’ and thought parts of his capital were about to fall to rebels. The Hezbollah functionary also commented that he thought the release of the sarin gas missiles was ‘a big mistake’. Troubled: Boys walk on the rubble of a building hit by what activists said was shelling by forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus as fighting continues . Sacked: Jesse Norman . David Cameron has sacked one of his leading advisers after he failed to vote for the Government’s position on military action in Syria. Jesse Norman, tipped as a future leader of the Conservative Party, has been removed from his role on the Downing Street policy ideas board. The MP, pictured, is the first casualty following last week’s shock defeat on the motion condemning use of chemical weapons by President Bashar  al-Assad’s regime and backing the ‘principle’ of intervention. More are expected to follow Mr Cameron’s fellow Old Etonian to the exit because 39 Coalition MPs voted with Labour and 31 Tories, including Mr Norman abstained. His dismissal does not bode well for others including International Development Secretary Justine Greening and Foreign Office minister Mark Simmonds, who claimed they missed the vote because they did not hear the bell while chatting in a soundproofed room. A colleague, who did not want to be named, said it was ‘outrageous’ that Mr Norman was sacked over a ‘moral issue’, adding: ‘If he had rebelled on a legislative issue I could understand but instead he acted on principle and reflected the vast majority of the public.’ But Downing Street, while ‘sad’ about his departure, said ‘it was made clear all members of the policy board must vote with the Government’. Mr Norman’s appointment to the policy board was a return to the fold, after he sabotaged Lords reform plans last year.","A Senate committee approved 'limited and tailored' military action .

"By . Damien Gayle . Updated: . 11:06 EST, 1 March 2012 . The grandmother of a five-year-old boy who is now living as a girl has admitted she would rather he were back to his old self than going around in pink dresses. For more than a year Zach Avery from Purfleet, Essex, has worn his long fair hair done up in bunches and insisted on living his life as a member of the opposite sex. But Jill Recknell, from Alderney in the Channel Islands, who is in her mid 50s, confessed she cannot accept that her grandson has suddenly become a granddaughter. Mrs Recknell added she was upset by Zach's parents' decision to go public, telling the People: 'I'd rather see him kicking a football than parading in a pink dress.' Girly: Zach with his toys in his bedroom at home in Purfleet, Essex . Her daughter, Theresa Avery, 32, earlier this week said she fully supports Zach after he became one of the youngest people ever diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder (GID). The extraordinary conclusion that he is a girl trapped inside a boy’s body is being backed by medical experts and supported by his school, which has made a lavatory block ‘gender neutral’ to accommodate his needs. But Mrs Recknell says, although she loves her grandchildren no matter what, Zach will always be a boy to her - the sex he was born with and is on his birth certificate. Until shortly before his fourth birthday in December 2010, Zachy, as his mother calls him, was ‘a normal little boy’. He loved to play with his Thomas the Tank Engine train set alongside his brother Alex. Suddenly, . however, he became obsessed with the children’s TV cartoon character . Dora the Explorer, and started to dress in girls’ clothes. Mrs Avery, who has two other children, said: ‘He just turned round to me one day and said, “Mummy, I’m a girl”. 'I . assumed he was just going through a phase and left it at that. But then . it got serious and he would become upset if anyone referred to him as a . boy. 'He used to cry and try to cut off his willy out of frustration.’ Mrs . Avery and husband Darren, 41, became increasingly worried by their . son’s behaviour and took him to a doctor, then to a child psychologist. At the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust in London, which specialises in the disorder, he was diagnosed as having GID. Mrs Avery said: ‘They told us that although he had a male body, his brain was telling him he was a girl.’ Normal kid: Zach aged four, before he 'came out' as a girl . Meanwhile at Zach’s school, Purfleet Primary, they have applied themselves to what Mrs Avery calls ‘the bathroom issue’ and are hoping Zach can use the staff toilets when he gets older. Mrs Avery added that there have not been any problems with other pupils bullying Zach about his decision to change his gender. ‘We explained to the other kids that Zach’s body was that of a boy but in his brain he was a girl,' she said. 'We said Zach was just happier being a girl than a boy. 'They haven’t batted an eyelid. They’ve accepted Zach as Zach and there’s been no problems at the school with bullying. The school has been brilliant and really, really supportive.’ Figures from the Tavistock and Patman clinic – the national body for GID – revealed that 165 children have been diagnosed with the condition this year. A spokesman said they were unable to comment on individual cases, but only seven children under five were diagnosed last year – making Zach one of the youngest.",Jill Recknell says she cannot accept her grandson's transformation .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Parents who continue to cook for children who have grown up or left home have been blamed for fuelling Britain’s food waste crisis. Dubbed ‘hotel parents’, mothers and fathers whose children treat their home ‘like a hotel’ routinely cook dinner for them only for it to end up in the bin, a parliamentary inquiry has been told. It comes as ministers accuse the public of ‘ignorance’ about best before dates and what to do with leftovers. Binned: Many meals end up being thrown away because parents have cooked for children who do not come home for dinner, a council has claimed . Every year families in the UK throw away 7.2million of food, including spending £12billion on food which could have been eaten but ends up in the bin. Households are responsible for half of all the food waste every year, according to official figures. In the past officials have blamed supermarkets for buy-one-get-one-free offers to encourage people to buy too much food, or confusing use by dates which mean perfectly edible food is thrown away. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson told MPs: ‘The fact is it is shocking really in this day and age that good food is thrown away, partly out of ignorance and party out of aesthetics. Appalling: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson blamed public 'ignorance' for the scale of food waste in Britain . 'We throw away an appalling amount of food away, it's 15million tonnes-a-year. 'One of my enthusiasm is to see that it doesn’t go to land fill but is processed in some way.’ Mr Paterson is backing anaerobic digestion, which used food or farm waste to generate heat or electric power. But a House of Lords inquiry into food waste has been told that parents struggling to adjust to their children leaving home, or seeking independence, are also adding to the problem. New figures yesterday showed a sharp rise in the number of homes with more than one . family living as the ‘boomerang . generation’ of young people comes back to live with their parents. Shropshire Council told peers that many too much food is wasted because parents still cook meals for children who have grown up. ‘There are so called “hotel parents”, those with older children who treat their homes like a hotel,' it said. ‘These parents often have to deal with fluctuating household numbers that make planning meals difficult,’ the Lords EU subcommittee on Agriculture, Fisheries, Environment and Energy was told. ‘Empty nesters also have difficulty adjusting to fewer people being at home for meals and still cook the same size portions, as do those who sadly have to adjust to bereavement.’ With house prices rising and the . under-30s unable to afford a home in large parts of the country, many . even with partners and children are forced to move in with the in-laws. There are now 286,000 multi-family households in the UK, up from 193,000 in 2006. Analysts say they are the fastest-growing household type, rising by 40 per cent in a decade. Boom: The number of multi-family households has soared since the recession, with couples forced to move in with the in-laws to afford to buy a home . Shropshire council added that people who do not write a shopping list before leaving the house also buy too much, or the wrong food, while most people routinely cook too much rice or pasta. It said its claims were based on 'thousands of conversations' with local people at public events, radio phone-ins and cookery demonstrations. The warning is echoed by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs which claimed too few people know how to turn leftovers into an edible meal. In evidence to the committee, Defra said:  ‘At household level, the main reasons for food waste are buying, cooking, preparing or serving too much: including not knowing what to do with leftovers and also food not used in time or that has gone past its use by date.’ The government’s Love Food Hate Waste is offering people recipes on how to turn excess food into a meal on the next day. Tesco found that 68 per cent of its bagged salads, 48 per cent of its bakery goods and 24 per cent of its grapes go to waste . The National Farmers’ Union has also pointed to other countries working to teach people about cooking with leftovers. Both the Austrian farmers’ women association and the German farmers’ association have backed campaigns making clear that some food is called ‘too good for the garbage bin’. Last week Tesco admitted up to two thirds of supermarket food ends up in the bin. The retail giant found that 68 per cent of its bagged salads, 48 per cent of its bakery goods and 24 per cent of its grapes go to waste. Much of the food is thrown away by customers – but large amounts are lost because they have been on display too long. Yet more produce has to be ditched before it even reaches shelves.","Mums and dads still buy and cook food thinking they have a house full .

"By . Sam Creighton . Cllr Terry Wilkins, left, has been falsely claiming to have an MBE for 19 years . A former policeman who has been falsely claiming to have an MBE for nearly two decades says he has been the victim of a long-running hoax. Terry Wilkins, 67, now a Conservative councillor for Illogan, Cornwall, even had the prestigious honour listed on the council's website. The former Metropolitan Police special constable has also admitted to lying on his LinkedIn profile, wrongly claiming to be studying for a degree with the Open University. He told the BBC that this was part of a 'game' aimed at embarrassing an unnamed person. However, according to fellow Illogan councilor Stephen Richardson - who is now calling for his resignation - Cllr Wilkins has mentioned his degree is official statements during council meetings. Cllr Richardson described it as a 'very funny sort of game'. Mr Wilkins, who lived in Redruth with his wife Sue, had claimed he was awarded the MBE 19 years ago while working for the police but had not attended the ceremony. He said the medal was subsequently sent in the post and that he hid it in a draw because it 'embarrassed' him. Once the truth was uncovered, Mr Wilkins declared he had been the victim of a hoax by a resentful ex-colleague who had 'set out to deceive' him. He said: 'I was shocked to discover that I have been the victim of an elaborate and malicious hoax over the awarding of the MBE. 'I was informed that I had been awarded an MBE in 1995 while working in the Metropolitan Police Service. The former special constable claims to have been the victim of a prank by ex-colleagues . 'At the time I had no reason to question the validity of the correspondence and, as my late wife and I decided not to attend the investiture at Buckingham Palace, was subsequently sent a medal in the post. 'At the time I was embarrassed at receiving the honour and put the medal in a drawer along with my long service medal. 'It was not until recently that my present wife suggested that I should acknowledge the honour. 'I spent most of yesterday contacting former colleagues only to discover that my worst fears were true and that an aggrieved ex-colleague had set out to deceive me. 'I don’t know why I did not question the official correspondence that I received at the time: probably because I was overcome with feelings of pride and kudos. 'I asked my ex-colleagues why I wasn’t told the truth either at the time or afterwards and it seems that people and time moving on meant that it was lost in the ether.' The Metropolitan Police declined to comment on the specific case, but a spokeswoman said: 'We expect all of our officers to behave with a certain level of professionalism at all times.' Even his profile on the council's webpage listed the prestigious honour after his name . Other local organisatins, including the Rotary Club, believed Cllr Wilkins, left, when he said he had the award . Mr Wilkins was elected to Cornwall Council in 2009 but is now facing calls to step down. However, he has said he has no intention of doing so. The local Conservative Association will be conducting an investigation into the incident. Councillor Richardson, who is a member of the Mebyon Kernow party, said: 'Mr Wilkins should seriously consider his position. I am . considering reporting both himself and the Conservative Party to the . appropriate authority, as I believe this to be electoral fraud.' He added: 'All that I can say is that I've never wanted to call anyone a liar . until it is proven they are but if his story is proven true then he is . either extremely unfortunate or extremely stupid. I've just got the . impression that there is more to uncover and there could be a whole . house of cards about to fall down.' Cllr Wilkins said: 'The fact that this hoax has gone on for 19 years has come as a huge shock to both me and my wife. 'I have not used the honour for personal gain. I would like to apologise unreservedly to anyone whom I may have unwittingly misled in the past. 'I shall be removing all mention of the award on stationery and e-mail addresses immediately.'","Terry Wilkins, 67, is a Conservative councillor for Illogan, Cornwall .

"By . Mail Online Reporter . Career change: David Mech gave up his porn career in 2010 and now tutors math and is running for the school board . A former porn star from Florida is looking for a new role as a school board member, it merged today. David Mech, 38, of Boca Raton has qualified for the Palm Beach County School Board's District 3 seat. Mech was known as Dave Pounder while a performer in adult films but made quite the career change when he began a math tutoring business for middle school students a few years ago. He retired from pornography in 2010 after a 10 year career in which he appeared in over 100 films, but now is more focused on his Happy/Fun Math Tutor company. Mech had been living in Irving, California, as a banker in his early 20s but left the finance world to go full time in the adult film business and started a production company. The former actor has been open about his colorful past and retaliated against the school district when they stopped sending students to his math tutoring classes in 2013 when they learned of his former career. He filed a lawsuit against school officials last year because he had quit the business and no longer produced pornography through Dave Pounder Productions. The production company does however still produce documentaries about the pornography industry. Goals for school: Mech wants better sex education in schools and condom dispensers in the nurse's office . Mech's production company made this movie about the adult film business . Now he is determined to get a seat on the school board and wants new technology in classrooms and better sex education. 'A lot of people have issues with my background, but I don't. If people think we should fire teachers who are bikini models on the weekend, then don't vote for me', he told the Palm Beach Post. Mech also wants condom dispensers in the school nurse's office to see a decline in Palm Beach County's pregnancy rate. His qualifications include two doctorate degrees in media economics and human sexuality from Indiana Univerity and studied computer science at Florida Atlantic University. Along with another candidate, John Michael Hartman, Mech is challenging incumbent board member Karen Brill. The Palm Beach Post reports that Brill made headlines earlier this year with a short-lived proposal to enforce a dress code for parents on school property. The general election for the school board is in November.

"By . Sam Creighton . Pascale Sherwin started caring for Olivia when she was only six months old . A wealthy couple who noticed clothes and jewellery going missing discovered the culprit was their nanny - after they spotted her wearing them on Facebook, a court heard. Parents Becki and Bradley Cannings, from Exeter, Devon, were left baffled after designer fashions and other possessions like bracelets and earrings began gradually going missing. But Mrs Cannings, 29, was left devastated after her mother spotted the family nanny Pascale Sherwin, 23, on Facebook - wearing her stolen clothes and jewels on nights out. Mrs Cannings looked at the Facebook page and was stunned to see the images - some of which she was even tagged in. It is believed Sherwin stole around fifty items of clothing, four items of jewellery, a pair of designer sunglasses, designer luggage and various other belongings. The couple had been employing the nanny - known as Sasha - to look after their two-year-old daughter Olivia, but never suspected her as she was considered as ‘one of the family’. Mrs Cannings printed out the pictures and took them to the police - but was told more evidence was needed. The couple then decided to set up four cameras in the house and one outside and collected three days of footage that caught Sherwin in the act. Sherwin was found with the clothes and a stash of stolen jewellery when police searched her home in Exeter, Devon. Bradley and Becki Cannings with their daughter Olivia, they are said to be devastated by what has happened . Sherwin, now of Honiton, Devon, admitted theft from employers at Exeter Crown Court and was ordered to do 200 hours unpaid community work. Speaking after the hearing, Mrs Cannings said: 'Every week random things were going missing. It really started getting to me and I thought I was going mad. 'It did not add up. I started to make a list and realised just how much was going missing. 'I hate myself for it now but I started thinking if anyone I knew would do this. I feel stupid but I never once considered it would be her. She had become part of the family. One of the pictures supplied to the police by the Cannings, showing Pascale, left, wearing stolen clothes . 'Mum then looked on Sasha’s Facebook account and I felt physically sick. In her profile picture she was wearing all of my clothes and was doing so in several others. Pascale Sherwin, 23, admitted to the thefts at Exeter Crown Court . 'I was even tagged in them. I don’t know if she was just stupid or rubbing my nose in it. I have never felt so violated and my whole world came tumbling down.' Mrs Cannings said despite the Facebook evidence, she till hoped Sherwin wasn’t the one stealing the belongings. She said: 'I was still hoping it had been a big misunderstanding. I didn’t want to do any of it, but it was the only way we could prove anything. 'But viewing the footage was like sitting down to watch a horror movie. 'We thought we would be fast-forwarding a lot but within five minutes we caught her stealing a cardigan and putting it in her bag. 'On each of the three days she stole from us. We allowed her to build a relationship with our daughter and be part of her everyday life. This was the ultimate betrayal.' Mr and Mrs Cannings first met Sherwin, a qualified nanny, when she was working at a creche in November 2011. She took a shine to Olivia and offered to do babysitting and after a few casual shifts, started looking after her a couple of times a week in January 2012.Mrs Cannings said: 'We had her checked and she was highly regarded and professional trained as a nanny. Two of the pictures of Sherwin wearing stolen clothes, they were handed to the police as evidence of the thefts . 'She just seemed like a lovely girl and would update us hourly by text of photos of her with Olivia. 'She helped me get ready on the morning of my wedding and was at my daughter’s naming ceremony. 'She became part of the family and it seemed the ideal arrangement. By summer she was working longer, we had upped her pay and she had all the freedom in the world.' In March 2012, belongings started to go missing around the house, but it was after the couple’s wedding day when jewellery given to Becki disappeared she started to panic. The Cannings saw Sherwin as 'one of the family' and are devastated she would break their trust in her . Judge Erik Salomonsen said it was a serious offence because it involved a breach of the trust which the couple had vested in her. Mr Cannings, 40, who owns an electrical engineering firm, said Sherwin has shown no remorse or said sorry for her actions. He said: 'It makes my blood boil that she has not even apologised and has been laughing in our face. But she will have to live with a criminal record.' His wife said they had been badly affected by the whole episode but said Sherwin’s sentencing was a way of putting a 'full stop' on the ordeal. She said: 'We moved on a long time ago. But we can completely relax now knowing that justice has been served. 'I have so much faith in the police system - they were amazing. But this really affected us bad. Thankfully Olivia was so young she will not remember any of this. 'But I will not leave her with anyone now except for close family. She will be three in August and going off to pre-school this year so that should make things easier. 'I just wish I had not let my guard down - I was just so convinced it was not her.'","Pascale Sherwin, 23, admitted to the thefts after being caught on camera .

"By . Ian Lloyd . Queen Mary with the  future George VI . Heartfelt love letters to Queen Victoria, baby books created  by a doting Queen Mary, even Elizabeth I's household accounts - the Royal Archives held at Windsor Castle since 1914 contain rarely seen regal documents going back 700 years. And now, along with a new book, 25 of its most impressive treasures are on display at the Castle, many for the first time, to mark its centenary year. The oldest document in the archive is a list of jewels from the wardrobe of Edward I, written in Norman French in 1297 and acquired by George V in 1911. Among the Tudor treasures are the household accounts of Princess Elizabeth, later Elizabeth I. Compiled in the early 1550s when she was in her teens,  it details the expenses for the scullery and 'saucery' - where sauces were prepared - at Hatfield House, with each page elaborately signed by the princess. Another account book, from the reign of Charles II, reveals even kings had to deal with decorators. It details work done at Windsor Castle in the late 17th century, stating that Italian artist Antonio Verrio was paid £10,000 (£850,000 today) for doing 20 ceilings, the King's Private Chapel and St George's Hall. In 1912, just before the archive moved to Windsor, it acquired 30 large boxes of papers belonging to George III and his son George IV that were discovered in the basement of Apsley House in London. Labelled 'To Be Destroyed Unread', they'd lain there since the Duke of Wellington, executor of the younger George's will, had received them in 1830. They included the 1763 title deed for George III's purchase of Buckingham Palace for £28,000 (£3.5m today). Originally called Buckingham House, it was intended as a private residence for his new wife Charlotte. It became known as the Queen's House and 14 of the couple's 15 children were born there. A more sensational document, which can be seen in the accompanying book, dates from 22 years later. It's a sham marriage 'certificate' handwritten by George, Prince of Wales, when he attempted to wed Maria Fitzherbert, a twice-widowed Roman Catholic. The ceremony was held in her drawing room at Park Street in London, conducted by an Anglican priest who had been let out of the Fleet Prison for the occasion and witnessed by Maria's brother and uncle. The baby book created  by a doting Queen Mary for her son George VI . The ceremony was illegal as it violated the Royal Marriages Act, which stipulated the monarch's permission was needed for descendants of George II to marry, and also the 1701 Act of Settlement which prohibited a British sovereign, reigning or future, from marrying a Catholic. Queen Victoria, a prodigious letter-writer, also kept a diary for 68 years from 1832 until her death. It's estimated she wrote 2,500 words a day, some 60 million words during her lifetime. The display features the first of 141 volumes. Written on 2 August 1832, it describes the 13-year-old princess's progress through the industrial West Midlands on her way to Wales where the people were 'black', the country 'desolate', and the buildings 'flaming with fire'. Eight years later she married her cousin Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. He was clearly besotted with his bride-to-be, as a never-before-displayed letter tells us. Written in German, it begins, 'Dearest deeply loved Victoria,' and continues, 'your image fills my whole soul. Even in my dreams I never imagined I should find so much love on earth.' Victoria's heir, Edward VII, and his consort Queen Alexandra requested that their private papers be destroyed after their deaths. A few letters did survive, however, and appear in the book including one from Alexandra to her son George - later George V - in which she describes motoring 'at 50. miles!! an hour!' George IV and his signature on a sham wedding certificate . The Queen appears to have been a bit of a back seat driver: 'I poke him violently in the back at every corner to go gently and whenever a dog, child or anything else comes in our way,' but by the summer of 1901 she had moved into the driver's seat, having instructed her lady-in-waiting to contact the Automobile Club in April. Miss Knollys duly wrote to one of its senior members that 'the Queen as  well as myself will be most grateful for some instruction in driving'. The book also features some eye-opening documents from the 20th century. One reveals King George V's voracious appetite for reading - he got through more than 1,000 works between 1890 and 1936, including the sensational Lady Chatterley's Lover, which was first published privately in Italy in 1928. A fully unexpurgated version was not published in Britain until 1960 after a dramatic obscenity trial, but the 68-year-old King obtained a copy in 1933 from John Colville, whose mother Lady Cynthia was a lady-in-waiting to George V's consort Queen Mary. We're also given a different perspective on the character of Queen Mary, who comes across as an emotionally rather chilly character in biographies. For example when, after her death in 1953, her eldest son the Duke of Windsor wrote to his wife, 'I'm afraid the fluids in her veins have always been as icy cold as they are now in death.' The archives, however, show a soft side to her. For each of her six children she faithfully kept a baby book in which she recorded their first steps, first words, even their first outing in the royal pram as well as their signatures from the age of eight to 21, locks of their hair and dozens of photographs. Elizabeth II keeps a diary too, memorably telling two of her ministers, Neil Kinnock and Kenneth Baker, in the 1992 documentary Elizabeth R that it wasn't like Queen Victoria's. When Kinnock asked her if she writes it in her own hand she joked, 'Well, I can't write any other way!' The monarchy now has a website, a Royal Channel on YouTube and is on Twitter, and the challenge for the next century of royal archival life is going to be how to preserve all those emails, text messages and tweets. Treasures From The Royal Archives, Windsor Castle, until 25 January 2015. The book is £19.95 from Royal Collection Trust shops; £29.95 from bookshops.","A new book reveals that not all was what it seemed with the royals .

Elaine Morris, 40, from Aberdeenshire in Scotland, first started collecting the toys when she was a young girl, but as she grew older she became less interested in the plastic ponies. But in 2005, Elaine stumbled across the My Little Pony toys on the online bidding site eBay and decided to re-start her collection. Elaine Morris, from Aberdeenshire in Scotland, first started collecting the toys when she was a young girl . In the last nine years she has spent over £20,000 on the colourful model horses and they even take up half of her bedroom. Elaine, who suffers from Asperger syndrome, said: 'I love my ponies. I have a budget of around £200 every month that I spend on them. 'Brushing their hair is the same as stroking a cat, it's therapeutic for me. 'My ponies don't care what I look like or what clothes I wear, they don't judge me. 'A lot of people find it weird that I still collect them, they think I should leave them for the kids, but if they give me pleasure why shouldn't I have them?' As Elaine grew older she became less interested in the plastic ponies but in 2005 that all changed . Elaine's first ponies were called Butterscotch and Blossom and she got them for Christmas when she was just six years old. While she was used to playing with Cindy dolls, Elaine loved the variety of different My Little Ponies and she quickly changed her allegiance. Her collection grew to 100 ponies, but she lost them all in the late 1990s. She said: 'I went through a bad time around then and lost a lot of things, including the pony collection. 'Years later when I saw one I knew I wanted to start collecting again. 'I went a bit crazy on eBay with my credit card and actually got myself into £1,500 worth of debt. 'I've paid it all off now, but now I limit myself to £200 a month.' Elaine, who lives on her own and is currently out of work, gets most of her ponies from the internet, either from eBay or special collector's pages. She now has thousands of items, all stored in her bedroom, and even customises some of the plastic toys. She stumbled across some My Little Pony toys on eBay and decided to re-start her collection . She said: 'I don't customise them to sell or make a profit from the ponies. 'It's just something I enjoy doing.

"By . Robert Verkaik . and Kieran Corcoran . Britain is facing a new diplomatic row with Iran after claims that an agent working for MI6 has been arrested in the Islamic state and has been put on trial for spying. The man, who has not been named, is alleged to have confessed to working with the UK’s secret intelligence service in the south-eastern city of Kerman. A senior Iranian court official said the alleged spy had admitted being in contact with four British intelligence officers 11 times, both inside and outside the country. Spy row: MI6 headquarters in Vauxhall. Iran claims to have arrested an MI6 agent who is alleged to have confessed to working with the UK's secret intelligence service . Yesterday the state-backed news agency IRNA (Islamic Republic News Agency) quoted Dadkhah Salari, head of the Kerman revolutionary court, who said that the man admitted making contact with British agents 11 times, and that he was now on trial. Last night the Foreign Office refused to comment on the claims and the Iranian embassy in London did not respond to media enquiries. Slarai told the agency: ‘Through the efforts of Iranian security forces, an MI6 spy has been arrested.' The man, who has not been named, is alleged to have confessed to spying for the British . ‘He has met British intelligence officers in person 11 times, both inside the country and abroad, and provided them with intelligence,’ Salari said. But a Whitehall source said that the nationality of the man arrested had not been made clear and added: ‘The Iranians make these allegations from time to time so they can implicate their own citizens who are then executed as traitors.’ Iranian officials have said the man, in his fifties, was posing as a businessman while in the country, the Sunday Telegraph reported. Salari, who gave comments to the IRNA agency in Iran, said the man was instructed to work against the Iranian state. He said: 'He has received certain instructions that . would have enabled him to act against the interests of the Islamic . Republic of Iran. ‘He had been in touch with four intelligence . officers and after receiving their instructions and training he has . transferred their specific requested information to the country of their . origin. ‘This spy has been captured after many months of complicated intelligence operations and with the help of the almighty God.’ The development comes just a day after Iran’s new envoy to Britain, Hassan Habibollah-Zadeh, held talks in London on his first visit since his appointment last month, which ended a two-year freeze in diplomatic relations between the two countries. The British Embassy in Tehran was closed in late 2011 after hardliners overran the building. But the London talks followed a trip to Iran earlier this month by the UK’s new envoy to the country – the first by a British diplomat for two years. Non-resident charge d’affaires Ajay Sharma said he had ‘detailed and constructive discussions’ about the UK’s relationship with Iran. He also visited the site of the British Embassy in Tehran to assess the damage following the mob attack two years ago. Foreign Secretary William Hague has spoken of relations between  the two countries improving on a ‘reciprocal basis’. Thawing relations between Tehran and the international community have also seen a temporary deal reached over its nuclear programme. Iran last month agreed to curb some of its nuclear activities, in return for £4.3 billion in sanctions relief, after days of talks in Geneva. Captured: The agent, who took months to track down, was arrested in the south-eastern city of Kerman . The country agreed to give better access to inspectors and halt some of its work on uranium enrichment for a six-month period.

"By . Robert Verkaik . The last Briton held in Guantanamo Bay has dropped his torture case against MI6 in a move which could pave the way for his return to the UK. Shaker Aamer has been imprisoned at the US naval base in Cuba for 12 years after he was arrested by Afghan militias working for the Americans shortly after the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. For the past three years, Scotland Yard detectives have been investigating claims that he was tortured in Afghanistan and that British interrogators working for MI6 were present. Shaker Aamer, pictured with two of his children, has dropped claims he was tortured in front of a British official in the hope he will now be released . He alleges one British officer watched while US soldiers banged his head against a wall. But in a dramatic development, Mr Aamer has written to the Metropolitan Police telling them to drop the investigation. In his letter, Mr Aamer, whose family live in South London, says he does not want any MI6 officer to be punished for the torture he suffered because he believes the agents were only following orders from Whitehall. British Guantanamo detainees have been paid up to £20 million in compensation by the Government. It is not known whether Mr Aamer or his family have also received compensation but his decision not to testify will not affect any settlement. Mr Aamer told The Mail on Sunday he hoped that by dropping his claims against the UK Government, MI6 would in turn drop their objections to his release. He said: ‘I have many reasons for dropping the criminal complaint against the MI6 agents who were present when I was being tortured. Mr Aamer spent 12 years in the notorious high-security facility at the Guantanamo Bay US Naval base. File photo . ‘How can you punish a lowly agent when the real fault lies with someone far above him, possibly even the Foreign Secretary of the time or the Prime Minister, Tony Blair? ‘But I also hope that by taking away the threat of my being a witness, with them in the dock, MI6 will stop being fearful and paranoid, and trying to have me remain in Guantanamo Bay after all these years.’ 'I hope MI6 will now stop stabbing him in the back' Mr Aamer's lawyer Clive Stafford Smith . The case is the last remaining criminal investigation against the security and intelligence services involving British detainees at Guantanamo Bay. A team of Scotland Yard detectives officers flew out to Cuba last year to interview Mr Aamer about his allegations. Last night the Foreign Office said it would continue to negotiate Mr Aamer’s release but that the ultimate decision was with the Americans. Mr Aamer faces no charges of terrorism and was cleared for release from Guantanamo in 2007 by the then President, George  W. Bush. In his graphic accounts of his torture at Bagram air base in Afghanistan, he details how he was subjected to the medieval abuse known as the ‘strappado’, devised by the Spanish Inquisition. ‘The US soldiers,’ says Mr Aamer, ‘would tie my wrists together and then hang me with either my feet just touching the ground or even just off the ground. ‘This would gradually result in the dislocation of the shoulders in a way that was excruciating.’ Guards at the gate of Guantanamo Bay Prison Camp in Cuba, where Mr Aamer has been held since his arrest . Mr Aamer alleges British intelligence continued to interrogate him after he was taken from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay, when UK spy chiefs were fully aware of the tortures being carried out there. Mr Aamer’s lawyer Clive Stafford Smith said: ‘Both Shaker and I know that the actions of MI6 continue to be an important reason why he is still in Guantanamo. I hope they will back off now, and stop stabbing him in the back.’ Mr Aamer, who has never seen his youngest son who was born after his capture in Afghanistan, says his only desire is to be reunited with his family in London. Last night a spokesman for the Foreign Office said: ‘Mr Aamer’s case remains a high priority for the UK Government and we continue to make clear to the US that we want him released as a matter of urgency.’ Scotland Yard declined to comment.","Shaker Aamer has been imprisoned in US base since war-zone arrest .

"By . Robert Verkaik . It is the most famous battle in English history - its date of 1066 learned by generations of schoolchildren. So suggestions that the official site of the Battle of Hastings - and an expensive visitor facility - may be in the wrong place have long been treated as little short of heresy. Tonight, however, a team of archaeologists led by Sir Tony Robinson will support claims first made in The Mail on Sunday that historians have indeed got it wrong. A new battle: In late 2013, experts claimed that King Harold died with an arrow in his eye not at the site of Battle Abbey (which has a dedicated vistor's centre - but on a spot that is now a roundabout on the A2100 . Their research suggests King Harold probably died not at the site of Battle Abbey, where English  Heritage has built a £500,000 centre, but on a spot that is now a round-about on the A2100. The evidence will feature on Channel 4’s Time Team following excavations of both the grounds around Battle Abbey, where English Heritage believes the fighting to have taken place, and another nearby site proposed by historian John Grehan. Despite expert analysis, Time Team found no archaeological evidence that either was where the army of William the Conqueror  triumphed over the forces of Harold, the English King. Harold himself was reputedly killed when an arrow struck him in the eye. Using aerial laser imaging, Time Team then mapped the terrain - on the basis of which a group of experts agreed that the most likely location for the battle was a roundabout joining Upper and Lower Lake in the town of Battle. Time Team said the mapping had ‘proved’ that the traditional battlefield - on the land directly below the Abbey - would have been too boggy for William’s cavalry. ‘Military analysts studied the data to see where Harold, a skilled commander, would most probably have mounted his defence,’ explained a Channel 4 spokesman. Battle: A Time Team 'soldier' is pictured in a re-enactment of the Battle of Hastings, which will air tonight . ‘They identified the only ideal battlefield. It seems Harold’s fearsome Saxon shield wall straddled a narrow strategic pass that is on today’s A2100.’ Mr Grehan, who proposed that the battle was fought at Caldbec Hill, about a mile north of the abbey, said last night: ‘The one thing that is absolutely certain is that the existing site can’t be the right one. According to Time Team the abbey site is facing in the wrong direction.’ Nick Austin, author of Secrets Of The Norman Invasion - whose own favoured site is Crowhurst, two miles south of the Abbey - asserted in The Mail on Sunday in 2011 that the traditional site was incorrect. Misdirection: If the experts' claims are correct, this sign is pointing people to the wrong location . He said: ‘The claim that the Normans fought the battle at Battle Abbey is not based on any physical evidence, either in archaeological finds or ancient manuscript.’ English Heritage disputes the Time Team claims. Roy Porter, a Battle Abbey curator, said: ‘Within living memory of the battle, the abbey was described in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as being founded by William “on the very spot where God granted him the conquest of England”.’","Experts claim Battle of Hastings did not take place at the accepted location .

Money for relief and reconstruction efforts following a devastating earthquake in the Italian city of L’Aquila were ‘misused’ and relayed to companies with links to organised crime, it warns.

The central Italian city of L'Aquila was devastated by a 5.9 magnitude . earthquake in 2009. Now it has been revealed that EU cash for disaster . relief and reconstruction may have fallen into the hands of the Mafia . Subcontractors were required to have mafia-free certification. But in a draft report on the effectiveness of this aid, Danish MEP Soren Bo Sondergaard reported serious allegations that part of the money was paid to companies with 'direct or indirect ties' to organised crime. Wanted criminals were even discovered at one premises rebuilt with EU funds, it found. The report also highlighted allegations by Anti-mafia prosecutor Olga Capasso that the funding had made L'Aquila the country's greatest challenge in combatting the mafia.

"By . Martin Beckford . and Robert Verkaik . MPs are demanding answers after Kenyan officials claimed MI5 were behind a decision not to lock up Michael Adebolajo for terrorism offences . The Security Services are facing demands from MPs to answer ‘deeply troubling’ claims that they left one of Lee Rigby’s murderers free to kill by helping him escape jail overseas. MPs have been told by senior Kenyan officials they wanted to lock up Michael Adebolajo for terrorism offences when he was caught trying to join a notorious Islamist group. But it is claimed that MI5 intervened and insisted Adebolajo be set free. He was allowed to return to Britain, and last year he mowed down and hacked to death the soldier outside Army barracks in Woolwich, South-East London. It is the first time politicians have discussed publicly the shocking claims, which British diplomats have tried to deny. Now the Commons Home Affairs Committee, which uncovered the evidence during private meetings  in Kenya, is demanding that the Security Services provide answers about their involvement in the case in Africa four years ago – and what opportunities they may have missed to avoid the killing of Drummer Rigby, 25. It has even been suggested that Adebolajo was acting as an informant for spies when he was sprung from jail in Nairobi in 2010. Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz has written to the group carrying out a high-level investigation into Drummer Rigby’s killing to ask for more information about MI5’s role. In a letter to the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), seen by The Mail on Sunday, he wrote: ‘The Home Affairs Committee visited Kenya, where Adebolajo was arrested in 2010, reportedly as part of a group who were trying to enter Somalia to train with Islamist militant group al-Shabab. ‘We heard competing accounts from British . and Kenyan sources about the circumstances under which Adebolajo was . returned to the UK. Keith Vaz, Home Affairs Committee chairman, has demanded more information on MI5's role from the committee investigating Lee Rigby's killing . Kenyan officials, where pressed by Mark Reckless MP, seemed to suggest they had wanted to charge Adebolajo with terrorist offences, but that the British Government actively sought his return. ‘It is suggested this might have been because he was providing intelligence to the Security Service, or he had indicated his willingness to do so. 'The suggestion this dangerous individual, who could have been prosecuted and convicted for terrorist offences overseas, might have been at large in London because of the intervention of UK authorities, is deeply troubling.’ A report to be published in July by the ISC is expected to confirm that MI5 had contact with Adebolajo in the months before Drummer Rigby’s murder, but did not know of  his plan to carry out the gruesome attack. Adebolajo is serving a whole-life term for the soldier’s murder. A Government source said yesterday that MI5 was co-operating with the ISC’s inquiry. Colleagues of Lee Rigby are planning a private vigil in his honour when they return from military exercises overseas. Members of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers missed ceremonies last week to mark the first anniversary of his death because they were training abroad. T . hey have pledged to pay their respects to Lee on the street where he died, even though officers have told them to keep things ‘low-key’. ‘This is something the Fusiliers want to do themselves at a time of their choosing,’ said a source. ‘They’re not going to let top brass stop them. They will gather where Lee was attacked.’","Michael Adebolajo is serving life for killing Lee Rigby in Woolwich .

"By . Duncan Gardham . and Robert Verkaik . Clampdown: Theresa May is to target radical mosques where terror suspects being monitored under control laws will be banned from worshipping . The Home Secretary is to draw up a list of radical mosques where terror suspects being monitored under controversial control measures will be banned from worshipping. The crackdown follows the escape of a suspect who went on the run after attending a mosque in London and leaving disguised in a burka. Terror suspects on Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPIMs), which replaced control orders in 2012, also face restrictions on the amount of time they spend in mosques. And police and Home Office officials will be told to move suspects away from their communities to other parts of their home cities. Where there is greater risk of absconding, suspects will be given longer curfews and made to report to police stations more frequently. Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, 29, who is accused of being part of terrorist cell targeting Western interests, is still at large after fleeing a mosque in West London on November 1 dressed in a burka. The Home Office crackdown comes as The Mail on Sunday can reveal there are now seven terror suspects on the run after evading the UK’s strict control laws. The Muslim men all escaped over the last eight years while being monitored by MI5 and the police. Most are believed to be abroad fighting with Islamic extremist groups. Sources said Home Secretary Theresa May was dismayed by the escapes of Mohamed and another suspect last year and is seeking to ‘significantly strengthen’ conditions placed on suspects. She has asked MI5 and Scotland Yard what measures are necessary but they are expected to include restricting access of TPIM suspects to specific mosques and limiting the time spent in those mosques they are permitted to attend. The list of banned mosques is likely to include a number that have caused concern by hosting speakers with radical views in recent years. The Home Secretary will also tell the security services that TPIM suspects can be moved from one part of a city to another in an attempt to disrupt their support networks. Mrs May also wants to increase the number of times a day suspects have to report to police stations and to lengthen overnight curfews to the legal maximum of 10 hours. On the run: Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed is still at large after fleeing a mosque in West London on November 1 dressed in a burka . Previous measures, known as control orders, included the ability to relocate suspects from one part of the country to another, along with curfews of up to 16 hours but were watered down on the insistence of Liberal Democrats. Emergency powers could be introduced but sources say the Home Secretary is instead making it clear she wants the police and security services to make sure ‘every available power is being used to its fullest extent’. ‘This is an operational matter for the police and security services but we want them to use all the powers at their disposal,’ the source said. ‘At the same time, we accept that unless they are behind bars there will not be a perfect solution.’ Alex Carlile QC, the Government’s former independent reviewer of terrorism laws, said the current TPIM regime introduced last year made it possible for suspects to abscond. He said: ‘The Government didn’t listen to our concerns. By not allowing the suspects to be relocated to other parts of the country, it made it easier for them to abscond. This was a mistake.’ The Mail on Sunday can disclose that Mohamed was described in court papers as being ‘deeply involved in the terrorism-related activity’ of a British-based network and was suspected of procuring weapons for terrorist attacks which were to include the Juba Hotel in Mogadishu, Somalia. He has access to false passports, documentation and money and is seeking to join three members of his network who are still at large in Somalia with Al Shabaab, the group behind the Nairobi shopping centre massacre.

"By . Hannah Roberts . Pope Francis sent an 80-year-old £170 after she wrote to him saying she had been mugged on a bus while visiting her sick husband . He habitually telephones those who write to him to offer wise words, support and guidance. But lately Pope Francis has been offering followers more than just a sympathetic ear after he sent 200 euros (£170) to an elderly woman who told him she had been mugged on a bus. The Venetian woman, in her late 80s, had written to the Pope saying that her purse containing 54 euros has been stolen as she travelled to visit her sick husband in hospital. Much to the surprise of the local priest, a mysterious letter arrived at a parish near her home last week. Clergyman Don Gianni Antoniazzi said he hands shook as he opened the envelope sealed by the Vatican Secretary of State. The priest said he was ‘overwhelmed with emotion’, adding: 'It is an extraordinary series of events: Francis knows not only how to interact with people, communicating brilliantly and infusing them with great hope, but also responds to personal requests. ' A note signed by Francis’s new alms master Archbishop Konrad Krajewski, said: 'Please deliver in the manner it deems appropriate, the relevant amount to the lady in question, that it is a gift of His Holiness, who offers her his apostolic blessing accompanied by desired aid and divine comfort for her and for her husband.' The priest then cashed the cheque and presented the money to the disbelieving parishioner. The move comes a week after the Pope sent funds to each survivor of the Lampedusa shipwreck that claimed the lives of 300 migrants. The pensioner couldn't believe it when her Parish priest arrived to tell her had had been sent a cheque by the Pope (file picture) He also sent each one a phone card to enable them to call relatives back home or in Europe. Francis yesterday announced that he would auction his Harley Davidson motorbike to collect funds for a hostel for the homeless. The Harley was presented to the Pope in June this year when he addressed a group of 35,000 bikers.","The 80-year-old woman had £45 stolen while on a bus .

Francesca Pascale, who first met Berlusconi as a teenage activist in his party, says that before her arrival, his staff were paying absurd sums for food that would never be eaten. The 28-year-old, who has been dating Berlusconi, 77, for two and a half years, told Italian gossip weekly Oggi: ‘They were paying 80 Euros a kg for beans. Can you believe it?’ Silvio Berlusconi and Francesca Pascale attend a Champions League match between AC Milan and Zenit St Petersburg in Milan last December . Garlic and onions were also in the house even though Silvio can’t stand he presence of them, raw or cooked, she said. ‘Crates of fish would arrive when everyone knows that the prime minister hates fish and won’t even tolerate the smell of it cooking.’ She added: ‘In short there was no woman in the house.’ The Neapolitan claimed Berlusconi, who has a personal fortune estimated at £4.75billion could be with someone much more glamorous than her, but likes her because she stops people taking advantage of his generosity. She said: ‘People always think why is Prime Minister Berlusconi with her and not with someone much more beautiful. 'Not all that': Francesca Pascale says Berlusconi could easily attract a more beautiful girlfriend . ‘Physically, I’m not all that. But I use my head, I say what I think, I sort the house out. He likes that.’ Miss Pascale first met Mr Berlusconi when she joined his Forza Italia party as a teenager but had to keep her feelings hidden because he was married. Even after his divorce she had to watch the 77-year-old media mogul become entangled with a succession of prostitutes, showgirls and actresses before finally convincing him to settle down. Eventually she got his attention by starting a fan club in Naples called ‘We miss you Silvio’ sending a plane with a banner with the club’s logo over his house every day for a week. In a recent interview he promised to make he an honest woman. But Miss Pascale said he is reluctant to set a date because of his experience in the divorce courts. Berlusconi pays £19million a year in alimony to his ex wife Veronica Lario. She said: ‘I kick him under the covers when we are in bed at night. ‘But he just says ‘no’, sometimes quite fiercely, because of the all the money he is paying his ex wife. ‘In which country a man is sentenced to pay €3million a month to his ex-wife and there is no public outcry?’","Francesca Pascale, 28, is engaged to 77-year-old Silvio Berlusconi .

"By . Kit Holden . Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola has admitted that he fears losing his job at the end of the coming season. Speaking at a press conference prior to Bayern's pre-season tour of the USA, the Catalan said, 'there are no secrets. If I don't win, then a different coach will probably come in'. The remark came in the context of concerns that the six members of Bayern's side who had just won the World Cup with Germany would suffer under lack of motivation upon returning to club football. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Robert Lewandowski scores his first goal for Bayern Munich . Concern: Pep Guardiola has said he could be out of a job in Bayern don't have a successful season . Winner: Bastian Schweinsteiger . Winner: Philipp Lahm . Winner: Thomas Muller . Winner: Jerome Boateng . Winner: Manuel Neuer . Winner: Mario Gotze . Both the media and Bayern's Director of Sport Matthias Sammer have voiced fears recently that Bayern would emulate their performances in 2006 and 2010, and start poorly after a World Cup summer. 'We can't allow ourselves a phase like that', said Sammer. Guardiola, though, whose Champions League winning Barcelona team of 2011 also contained newly crowned World Cup winners, is adamant that Germany's triumph is a good thing for his side. 'I am happy for Germany that they won the World Cup. It is a great gift for FC Bayern that six of our players were able to contribute to it.' Easy does it: Guardiola has been sporting a casual look as he guides Bayern through pre season . Nonetheless, further success is absolutely expected this season of Guardiola and his team. The Catalan begins the second year of his three year contract this summer, and despite winning the Double and the Bundesliga in record time last season, Bayern's exit to Real Madrid in the Champions League was enough to keep the jury out on their new coach. European success is the reference point for judging Guardiola's success at Bayern. After taking over a treble winning team, and leading them to a record Double, anything short of the European Cup title this year will be considered a failure for Guardiola. Concern: The former Barca boss is under pressure to succeed after his Champions League disappointment . The Munich press are already ramping up the pressure, with tabloid TZ publishing a survey which showed Bayern as clear Champions League favourites for next season. Guardiola knows himself that failure to win the tournament again may put his job at risk. He remains determined to avoid such a fate, and cool in the face of the pressure.

"By . Robert Verkaik . Worrying: Graham Freeman says publication of the names of the companies would rock the City and lead to high-profile prosecutions . A private investigator at the centre of a row over a secret list of blue-chip companies that hired  corrupt private detectives has claimed they are being protected by the police. Graham Freeman, one of four private detectives jailed last year for stealing confidential information on behalf of big business clients, says publication of the names of the companies would rock the City and lead to high-profile prosecutions. He claims the police and the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) are also reluctant to release the details because it would expose their own failure to investigate serious fraud allegations over years. Last year’s case prompted SOCA secretly to compile a list of 102 names of well-known financial institutions, law firms and insurance companies all linked to the corrupt investigators. Freeman is the first of the four detectives to break his silence about SOCA’s controversial list and the extent of the alleged conspiracy. His revelations will add to concerns that while Lord Justice Leveson has dealt with some newspapers’ use of criminal private detectives, nothing has been done to tackle the much greater use of them in the City. Freeman told The Mail on Sunday last night that City clients sometimes turned to private investigators because the police failed to investigate claims of property and investment fraud. Freeman, who lives in Spain and now works on maritime security, was jailed for six months last year for conspiring to defraud by ‘blagging’ – or stealing – personal information through phone calls to banks and companies. The investigation was led by SOCA and codenamed Millipede because its ‘legs’ connected so many financial institutions, firms and high- profile figures to the work of corrupt private investigators (PIs). But before the trial started, SOCA and the Crown Prosecution Service took the decision not to let the names of the PI clients become public knowledge. None of the clients’ names was read out in court as would have been customary. Instead, SOCA, often described as Britain’s version of the FBI, secretly compiled a list of many of the country’s best-known financial institutions, law firms and insurance companies linked to the four PIs convicted in the case. It is this list that was finally surrendered to Parliament by SOCA last week, but only on the strict condition that it was kept under lock and key and not shown to the public. SOCA claimed names could not be released because of human rights concerns or the risk of harm to the companies’ commercial interests. MPs now want to know which companies on the list behaved illegally. Speaking out: Freeman, who was released from Wandsworth Prison, pictured,  in London after just eight weeks, warns that the SOCA list is a 'Pandora's Box' Freeman, who was released from Wandsworth Prison in London after just eight weeks, warns that the SOCA list is a ‘Pandora’s Box’ which, once opened, will bring about a criminal investigation that will end in the jailing of dozens of bankers, lawyers and boardroom executives. He says any of the PI clients that  requested the information could be charged with the same conspiracy for which he and the three other detectives were jailed. He said: ‘If they were to name our clients, on the evidence we were charged on, our clients would be open to the same conspiracy [charges].’ In 2011, Freeman, 52, Daniel  Summers, 33, Philip Campbell Smith, 54, and former policeman Adam John Spears, 73, pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to defraud. Freeman, who received the shortest sentence, says he was working for three major clients at the time – a law firm in the south of England, an international foreign exchange company and a third unidentified company. His detective agency, Brookmans International, was at the centre of the trade in personal information ‘blagged’, or stolen, from banks and Government agencies. Action: MPs are now keen to know which companies have behaved illegally . Freeman and business partner Campbell Smith, a former Army intelligence officer, used Summers, who specialised in ‘blagging’ private data by calling banks, phone companies and other organisations and impersonating ‘targets’ or pretending to be an employee to obtain confidential details. Freeman, who was a co-director of Brookmans and has also provided personal security for celebrities including Mel Gibson, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, still refuses to name his clients because he says he doesn’t want to go through any more court proceedings. But he told The Mail on Sunday: ‘SOCA doesn’t want to give up the Millipede names because if they did, they would be forced to investigate them and charge them for conspiracy to defraud as they did us. On that list are the names of law firms, banks and insurance companies who all used private detectives for all sorts of reasons.’ He said many of the cases he was involved with were driven by a police refusal to act and commit resources to investigate fraud. ‘One solicitor who hired me had 35 clients who had lost millions in a property scam. The police didn’t want to know, so she resorted to private investigators,’ he said. A SOCA spokesman said that while further investigations were on-going, the information provided to MPs ‘does not allege that the individuals and companies named in it .  .  . have or even may have committed a criminal offence.’ He added: ‘Evidence chosen to be presented to the court is a matter for the CPS.’","Graham Freeman was jailed for stealing confidential information for firms .

The clunky five-seater is a throwback to the pontiff's old car in his native Argentina.

The second-hand Renault was a present from Reverand Renzo Zocca, a priest from Northern Italy, who used it to drive children to play groups. He handed it to Pope Francis at an informal event yesterday. Rev Zocca refers to the old banger, which has 190,000 miles on the clock, as 'the car of French farmers'. And news has emerged that the Vatican is not impressed by the gift. Rev. Zocca told Italian magazine Famiglia Cristiana: 'The security guard standing next to me was really worried because he knew that from now on he’ll be going around the Vatican in my car.' It is not the first stir Pope Francis has caused since he was chosen to serve in February. Atheists won’t face eternal damnation after all, he declared yesterday, as long as they are morally upstanding. In an extraordinary open letter, Pope Francis indicated that well-behaved non believers are not in fact committing a sin. Pope Francis recently stunned journalists when he said homosexuals should not be judged . He wrote: ‘What matters for those who don’t believe is to follow their conscience. ‘Sin only happens when those who don’t have faith go against their conscience.’ The letter, published in the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, was responding to a question posed in an editorial by the paper in July. 'Will God forgive those who do not believe in him? 'it asked. The pontiff’s seemingly softened line on atheists is at odds with Catholic doctrine stating that only believers will be saved. Earlier this year Vatican spokesman Padre Rosica insisted ‘all salvation comes from Christ, the Head, through the Church which is his body. Quoting from doctrine in the Cathechism, he said: ‘Hence they cannot be saved who, knowing the Church as founded by Christ and necessary for salvation, would refuse to enter her or remain in her. Since his appointment in April Francis has repeatedly reached out to non-believers. On Ash Wednesday he washed the feet of a Muslim woman in a juvenile detention centre. And on Tuesday he suggested converting empty convents into homes for refugees. The u-turn comes as the Pope’s new deputy signalled that the Vatican could also be softening its stance towards married priests. Professor Richard Dawkins has regularly spoken out against religion and is a prominent atheist . Incoming Secretary of State Pietro Parolin told Venezuelan newspaper El Universal that the tradition of priestly 'celibacy is not dogma', or a law of divine origin, and is therefore open to discussion. 'While the church is not a democratic institution, it needs to reflect the democratic spirit of the times and adopt a collegial way of governing.' he said.","The car is a second-hand gift from Rev Renzo Zocca, an Italian priest .

"By . Hannah Roberts . An American woman has been found dead in a luxury penthouse apartment in Florence. The lifeless body of Bonnie Marie Guerra, 50, was discovered by a maid on Tuesday in her bedroom in Piazza Pitti, one of the city’s finest Renaissance squares. The Italian-American had been in the city for a fortnight and had taken the apartment for a year. She had arrived in the city from California on 17 August, her 50th birthday and had celebrated it with family members, the newspaper reported. Grim: The body of Bonnie Marie Guerra is removed from the property . Investigation: Police cars can be seen outside the apartment . A maid came into the apartment at about 15.20 on Tuesday afternoon and discovered the guest’s unresponsive body face down on the floor of the bedroom. She called for medical help but it was too late. Near the body police found dietary supplements, vitamins, diabetes medicine and  anti-histamines. Her corpse was particularly thin, Italian media reported. Although police found no signs of violence on the body, they have not ruled out murder. A spokesman for the Florence police confirmed the identity of the woman. She told Mail Online: ‘I can confirm the presence of the body of a woman inside an apartment in Piazza Pitti, number 7. Probe: Detectives remove evidence from the flat in Piazza Pitti, one of the city¿s finest Renaissance squares . Italian American Bonnie Marie Guerra, 50, was found dead in the bedroom of her bedroom penthouse flat in Florence (pictured) ‘The discovery was made by a maid around 16.00 and a medical team was called. ‘We are continuing to investigate and our team are attempting to reconstruct the scene. There were no signs of violence. However we have not excluded from our investigation any hypothesis.’ An autopsy to ascertain the cause of death will be carried out this afternoon, she said. The central Florence apartment faces directly onto the 15th century palace once owned by the ruling Medici family. It was later used as a power base by Napoleon and served as the home of Italy's King Victor Emmanuel III before he donated it to the Italian people in 1919.","Bonnie Marie Guerra, 50,found dead in bedroom of her penthouse apartment .

"By . Hannah Roberts . The funeral of a Nazi war criminal has been postponed following security fears, after neo-fascists attempted to highjack the event. There were violent clashes between protesters and far right extremists outside the service for former SS officer Erich Priebke, prompting riot police to set off tear gas canisters. Authorities were forced to remove around twenty extreme right wing activists from the church, in Albano Laziale, a suburb of Rome. Scroll down for video . Violence: Locals and anti-fascist protesters show their disgust as the car with the body of Erich Priebke arrives at the church in Albano Laziale, Italy . Anger: Hundreds of people shouted 'murderer' and 'executioner' jeered the coffin of Priebke as it arrived for a funeral Mass in the Roman suburb . Hatred: Riot police set of tear gas to subdue the crowds outside the funeral for former SS officer Erich Priebke in Albano Laziale, a suburb of Rome . Priebke, a mass murderer who never repented his crimes, died on Friday aged 100 as he was serving a life sentence in Rome for his part in the 1944 massacre of the Ardeatine Caves. Nazi officers rounded up and shot more than 300 Italian men and boys in a reprisal attack for the killing of German soldiers by resistance fighters. It is considered the worst atrocity of World War II on Italian soil. Despite being explicitly prohibited by the Vatican and the mayor, an ultra-conservative Christian sect had offered to conduct the ceremony, although not a burial. The Society of Saint Pius X, which has split from the Vatican gained notoriety in 2009 when a British member, Richard Williamson, denied the Holocaust had taken place. Justice served: The former SS captain at his 1996 conviction . The funeral came on the 70th anniversary of the emptying of the ghetto in Rome from which only 15 Jews returned alive. As . the closed door ceremony was due to begin, demonstrators outside the . church landed kicks and punches on the hearse and set upon the priest . until he was rescued by riot police. Several . dozen skinheads and right-wing extremists dressed in camouflage clothes . and combat boots came to pay their last respects to a man who had . become an icon for the far right. Some, wearing helmets and scarves over their faces, were removed as they were neither friends nor relatives of Priebke. Several . gave fascist salutes, prompting a crowd that included relatives of . victims,  anti-fascist protesters and Jewish survival groups to surge . forward chanting ‘Executioner’ and ‘Murderer!’ Protesters . and right wingers clashed, landing punches and throwing bottles, until . armed police in full riot gear stepped in, launching tear gas. Priebke's lawyer Paolo Giachini confirmed that the rites had not taken place. Death: Erich Priebke, who carried out one of Italy's worst massacres, died today aged 100 . Outrage: In the lead up to his birthday Jewish groups called for celebrations to be banned . Earlier in the day the mayor of Albano Laziale, Nicola Marini, had signed an order blocking the funeral from taking place. But he was overruled by the Prefect of Rome who said he had to accede to the family's wishes. Mr Marini said : ‘We tried to prevent it with the all the methods at our disposal. But we have been overruled by higher powers. 'To . have to endure this ceremony so near to the scene of the crime is a . cause of shame for the whole town, which is why we are here to bear . witness to their pain, their shame.’ The residents of Albano Laziale had turned out in force to oppose the funeral. Doctor . Ugo Piccarreta said: ‘It’s a national disgrace. The wounds that Priebke . has left in the hearts of the Italian population mean that he cannot be . compared to any other criminal. He doesn’t even deserve to transit . through this town. ‘I don’t understand how the church can pardon him – he never even repented. ‘ . Local . resident Giuliana Uccino said: ‘We are afraid that our town will become . a symbol or even a place of pilgrimage for neo fascists.’ ‘This is not a fascist town. Priebke is not welcome here and not welcome in Italy. A row has raged for days over the officer's last burial place after because authorities fear the grave could become a site of pilgrimage for his neo-Nazi fanbase . Fascist followers: Italian King Victor Emanuel III, (right) Adolf Hitler (centre) and Benito Mussolini (left) It . is not known when the ceremony will go ahead as Priebke's coffin will . remain in the church overnight. A row has raged for days over the . officer's last burial place after because authorities fear the grave . could become a site of pilgrimage for his neo-Nazi fanbase. Both . his birth town of Hennigsdord, in Germany and his adopted homeland of . Argentina have made it clear that his remains are not welcome. The Jewish Community in Rome threatened renewed protests if Priebke is permitted a tomb in the Italian capital. ‘It would be like killing those victims a second time,’ said Riccardo Pacifici, the Jewish organisation's president. After the war Priebke had fled justice, making a home in San Carlos de Bariloche, a small town at the foot of the Andes. He . managed to escape the Nuremberg Trials and although the Israeli secret . services hunted him for years, he remained at large until 1994, until an . American journalist tracked him down. A . year later he was extradited to Italy and convicted of mass murder. But . because of his age he was allowed to serve his sentence under house . arrest with permission later granted for him to leave the house to go . shopping, go to Mass and to the pharmacy. In . the run up to his 100th birthday in July, Holocaust survivor groups . argued that he should be prevented from celebrating.

"By . Hannah Roberts . Venice's famous gondoliers are to be banned from the city’s Grand Canal following the death of a tourist in a waterway collision.Fifty-year old Joachim Vogel from Germany died earlier this month when the vessel he was travelling on collided with a vaporetto water taxi.Now the lagoon city is drawing up proposals to introduce a floating congestion zone, which would prevent the traditional boats from operating during rush hours. The city of Venice is implementing new rules which prevent gondoliers from travelling the Grand Canal during rush hour . The gondolier in command of the vessel Mr Vogel and his family were travelling on tested positive for cocaine use prompting new regulation on drug and alcohol use to be rushed through as well. The customary serenades that honeymooners have enjoyed for centuries will only be able to take place at night, according to the proposals, and vessel captains will no longer be allowed to use mobile phones while they are in command. Plans already in motion to introduce breathalyser tests for gondoliers to regulate drug and alcohol use will now be rushed through. Earlier this month a gondola collided with a larger water taxi, crushing a German tourist to death in front of his family . Until now Venice has operated as something of a free for all with cruise ships speed boats and water taxis joining small craft jostling for space on the major canals. But following the accident on the 17th August authorities have set out proposals to bring Venice closer in line to cities based on dry land. The city’s mayor Giorgio Orsoni said: 'We have to think of the Grand Canal as a street, a main street like that of all cities, with particularly heavy traffic. We need some discipline.' The mayor of Venice said the city ought to treat the Grand Canal like a main street with heavy traffic in order to avoid further accidents . To avoid future accidents, he said, 'these measures will require some sacrifices for citizens'. Gondolas will only be allowed to operate at certain times of the day after morning rush hour, he added. Some perilously narrow passageways could be widened by removing structures such as small docks, he said. Drug and alcohol consumption will be more heavily regulated after it emerged the gondolier responsible for the crash had taken cocaine . Other larger water craft including taxis rubbish collection boats and commercial boats carrying freight will also have to operate in limited hours. Jaochim Vogel and his family were flung into the water when their gondola collided with a vaporetto water taxi, near the famous Rialto Bridge, one of Venice’s most popular and picturesque sights. Mr Vogel was crushed to death. His three-year-old daughter was treated in hospital for head injuries, but survived. Police say the gondolier tested positive for cocaine use. Only last month the gondoliers' association announced a crackdown on drunkenness after a series of complaints.","Gondoliers will only be able to cruise Grand Canal at night .

"By . Hannah Roberts . A baby, born as its mother drowned, is among the latest victims of the boat tragedy that has claimed the lives of more than 300 migrants off the coast of Sicily. Their fishing boat caught fire and sank last Thursday just half a mile offshore. The Eritrean woman, who was seven months pregnant, would have given birth in her death throes, the mayor of Lampedusa Giusi Nicolini told reporters. The premature male baby was still attached by the umbilical cord when rescue divers pulled their corpses - 288 and 289 -  from the wreck. Coffins of those who died when a ship carrying African migrants towards Italy sank after a fire. A woman, who gave birth as she was dying, and her prematurely born son are among the dead. They are to be buried together, rather than in the small white children's coffins (at front) The child will be buried in the same coffin as its mother rather than in a small white coffin like the other children. The mother herself was only around 20 years old. The tragic story only emerged when European Union Commissioner Jose Manuel Barroso asked why one coffin was noticeably bigger than the rest, the Italian newspaper Il Messagero reported. The newspaper wrote: 'It was up to the mayor of the island to tell the terrible, unimaginable events. 'Doctors had told her an Eritrean woman had died and as she died she brought her son into the world. They didn't even separate, there was no time.' Italian Coast Guards rescue a survivor of the ship transporting hundreds of migrants which caught fire and sank off the Sicilian island of Lampedusa, Italy . Victims after a boat packed with African migrants caught fire and sank off the southern Italian island of Lampedusa. A mother and her prematurely born son are among the dead . Police diver Renato Sollustri said he had not slept since he had brought up the two corpses, the baby hidden in the folds of his mother's white leggings, under pulled-down trousers. He said: 'It was three in the afternoon when we finally got into the last cabin in the bow after having got past a wall of bodies.' The divers still had ten minutes' oxygen left when they got to the last cabin in the bow and saw a mother with a baby bump. Mr Sollustri told La Repubblica: 'We couldn't leave without doing something for her. We took her out forming a human chain with our arms. Then we lay her on the sea bed. 'With a rope we joined her to the other bodies and with buoyancy aids we took them towards the light. 'It wasn't until we passed the body to our colleagues in the boat that they made the shocking discovery - in her leggings was a newborn baby. A bunch of flowers reading 'Dead at sea' floating in the sea near the Lampedusa harbour after the boat with migrants sank killing more than a hundred of people . 'None of us could believe it.

'The baby may never have seen light - only the darkness at the bottom of the sea. It was a horrible job.' Italian . premier Enrico Letta has ordered that all the victims be given state . funerals.

"By . Hannah Roberts . Pope Francis said he was resolved to reform the church which had a tendency to get caught up in 'small minded things' The Catholic Church could fall ‘like a house of cards’ if it continues in its obsession with abortion, gay marriage and contraception, the pope has warned. In a remarkable 12,000 word interview to mark six months in the church’s top job, Francis said he was resolved to reform the church, which had a tendency to get caught up in ‘small minded things ‘. He said: ‘We need to find a new balance otherwise even the moral edifice of the church is likely to fall into a house of cards.’ ‘It is not necessary to talk about these issues all the time,’ he said. ‘We cannot insist only on issues related to abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods.’ The extraordinarily frank interview, conducted by a Jesuit priest in Rome, was published simultaneously by 16 of the order’s newspapers around the world. In a typically humble stance Francis declared himself a sinner. ‘This is the most accurate definition,’ he said, when asked what sort of man he was. ‘It is not a figure of speech or a literary genre. I am a sinner.’ He also claimed he had made mistakes earlier on during his career as Archbishop of Buenos Aires and had a propensity to become ‘authoritarian.’ Because of this he had been wrongly perceived as ultra-conservative, he said. The interview was not entirely self critical - Francis claimed to be so conscientious, that he prays even when at the dentist. The pontiff insisted that he worships morning, noon and night and even falls asleep in the midst of a silent prayer. He said: “I pray the breviary every morning... Then, later, I celebrate Mass…What I really prefer is adoration in the evening, even when I get distracted and think of other things, or even fall asleep praying.. But I pray mentally even when I am waiting at the dentist.’ The extraordinarily frank interview  was published simultaneously by 16 of the order¿s newspapers around the world . The Pope used the interview to set out his set out his vision for the church and his priorities as pope, expanding on his ground-breaking comments over the summer about gays. He repeated the tone he had taken at the end of his trip to Brazil in June when he said ‘who am I to judge?’ He also hinted at a greater female role in the church hierarchy, saying ‘the deep questions of women must be addressed.’ He himself was only alive because of the work of a nun he said. When in hospital with a infection that eventually took his lung, a nun went against doctors orders to increase the dose of penicillin. Francis explained: ‘The sister who was on duty tripled my doses because she was daringly astute; she knew what to do because she was with ill people all day. While asserting that he was determined to bring in reforms, Francis also hinted at the pressures he has faced since becoming Pope. He has previously said that he feels like he is in a cage. In the interview, which in the UK is published by Thinking Faith, he spoke of  ‘a great darkness’ that came over him on the day he was elected, and which accompanied him until his election later that day. Explaining why he chooses to live among visiting priests in a humble Vatican guesthouse, he said the papal apartment was like ‘a funnel’ through which people could only enter ‘in dribs and drabs’. When he went to enter the accommodation for the first time God told him not to, he said. ‘When I took possession of the papal apartment, inside myself I distinctly heard a ‘no.’ ‘[The papal apartment in the Apostolic Palace] is like an inverted funnel. It is big and spacious, but the entrance is really tight. People can come only in dribs and drabs, and I cannot live without people.’","Pope Francis said he wanted to reform the church which gets caught up in 'small minded things'

"By . Hannah Roberts . Threats: A Falklands protest group have threatened to disrupt Princess Anne's visit to Argentina . A militant group has threatened Princess Anne as she begins a five-day visit to Argentina amid rising tensions over the Falklands. The Princess Royal, in Buenos Aires in her role as president of the International Olympic Committee, is the first senior royal to undertake an official engagement in Argentina for 14 years. Last night she was due to attend the opening ceremony of the 125th session of the IOC, which has the task of deciding the venue for the 2020 Games. But Quebracho, an extreme Left-wing group that led protests against Prince William’s military role in the Falklands last year, has threatened to breach security, bringing chaos to proceedings. Declaring that it is not going to let the ‘pirate princess swan around Argentina as if nothing had happened’, the group called on activists to descend on the Colon Theatre in Buenos Aires, where the IOC event was set to open last night. In a statement it describes the princess as ‘Anne of England, sister of Charles, daughter of Elizabeth II, the Queen, who ordered the attack on the Falklands in 1982’. It continues: ‘She “honours” us with her presence at the Colon Theatre. She comes here, and thinks that she can pass through Argentina as if nothing had ever happened. ‘But when she walks through the city, we will be there; and when she goes to the Colon Theatre, we will be waiting for her. ‘We Argentines are not going to let her swan around as if it were nothing to us.‘We want to remind her – her and her  family – that she is not welcome here … We Argentines do not forget. The Falklands are Argentinian and the English have to go. There is no alternative.’ Anger: Masked members of Quebracho group, brandishing clubs, march to protest against Prince William's military posting in 2012 . Hatred: Protesters burn an effigy of Prince William outside the British embassy in Buenos Aires . The declaration was published on the group’s website next to an image of a Union Jack ablaze and refers to the last official visit by a royal to Argentina in 1999 when Prince Charles went to lay a wreath for the Argentinian war dead. When Prince William was serving in the Falklands as an RAF helicopter rescue pilot last year the group sprayed graffiti on British banks saying ‘Get out of the Malvinas’. The princess’s visit comes with president Cristina Kirchner of Argentina ratcheting  up anti-British rhetoric over the Falklands with back-up from Spain. Critics say she is trying to divert attention from the country’s economic woes. A spokesman for the Princess Royal said: ‘We never comment on security arrangements or threats.’ Official business: Jacques Rogge, President of the International Olympic Committee  attends a press conference after the IOC Executive Board meeting in Buenos Aires, Argentina .

Stretching out tall with one hind leg kicked-out, this is the moment a grizzy bear mimicked Jungle Book character Baloo by using a wall at Rostov-on-Dov Zoo in Russia to satisfy an itch . Oh that feels bear-y nice; the grizzy has a satisfied look after fully extending against the wall to scratch an out of reach spot, as one member of the crowd shouted out 'Baloo', much to the amusement of other bear lovers .

Khangeldyan, 52, at Rostov-on-Dov Zoo in Russia, the bear slowly . approached the wall before leaning back in a rather extravagant manner.

"By . Steve Hopkins . Disgraced Luis Suarez has returned home to Uruguay to a hero's welcome despite being kicked out of the World Cup. Standing on the deck of his mother's home in Lagomar, near Montevideo, he looked carefree as waved to crowds while holding his son Benjamin and daughter Delfina. While Benjamin might not yet be old enough to know not to sink his teeth into others, perhaps Delfina could teach her father a thing or two about acceptable behaviour. Scroll down for video . Luis Suarez holds his children Benjamin and Defina as he greets fans from his mother's home in Lagomar . Suarez looked carefree as he greeted fans despite news breaking that Liverpool are planning to sell him . Suarez's return came as his team-mates . trained in Rio ahead of their clash with Colombia and news that . Liverpool are set to sell him to Barcelona for £80million. Fans flocked to Carrasco International Airport to greet the arrival of the banned striker who was handed a nine-game international ban and four-month suspension from all football. Supporters turned out in force to greet the Liverpool star, with some wearing masks as a tribute. Uruguayan President Jose Mujica was at the airport at one point, but returned home because Suarez's flight was delayed. Because of the delay, the crowd of about 1,000 fans were moved from the airport terminal to an adjacent air force base to await his arrival. Suarez fans flocked to Carrasco International Airport to greet him, some with oversized images of his face . Suarez was still very much a super star in his home country, with fans holding cutouts of his head aloft . Suarez was earlier seen with the rest of the team in Rio as they were pictured arriving at their hotel. The Uruguayan Football Association are preparing an appeal against the severity of the sentence, which also includes a £64,000 fine. But there is no chance of Suarez appearing at Brazil 2014 again. FIFA’s strict regulations barring him from any involvement in football mean he cannot even watch Liverpool or Uruguay in action — he is banned from football stadiums and must train alone away from Liverpool’s Melwood training ground. Suarez can be sold during his spell in football exile — a strong possibility — but cannot personally join in negotiations in mooted moves to Barcelona or Real Madrid. Biting may have got Suarez kicked out of the World Cup and banned from all football for four months, but that didn't stop his fans from making fun of his sinister move while they awaited his homecoming . Liverpool are taking specialist legal advice before deciding what to do about Suarez — a world-class footballer who comes with more baggage than any other elite star. Given the length of his ban, Liverpool, who have not been contacted by FIFA or the Uruguay FA, feel aggrieved to be punished for something in which they had no part. The news was greeted with dismay by the club’s owners in Boston. Uruguay FA president Wilmar Valdez said: ‘We are preparing our appeal to present to FIFA in the next few hours. It’s an extremely excessive punishment, there was not enough evidence and I have seen more aggressive incidents. It feels like Uruguay have been thrown out of the World Cup. We all know what Suarez means to Uruguay and to football around the world. Luis will travel home to recover with his family.’ Following this third, high-profile biting incident, it is no surprise that Suarez’s major sponsor adidas are thinking of ditching him. He has already been punished for racially abusing Patrice Evra and biting Branislav Ivanovic. Suarez can be seen biting the shoulder of Italian Giorgio Chiellini in this still from TV footage of the game . A statement said: ‘Adidas does not condone Luis Suarez’s recent behaviour and we will again be reminding him of the high standards we expect from our players. We have no plan to use Suarez for any additional marketing activities during the World Cup. We will discuss all aspects of our future partnership directly with Suarez and his team after the tournament.’ Another of Suarez’s backers, 888poker, are likely to drop him, with a spokesman saying: ‘888poker is seriously reviewing its relationship with the player as we will not tolerate unsporting behaviour.’ The independent FIFA disciplinary committee, chaired by  Claudio Sulser of Switzerland, reached the decision to hand  Suarez a World Cup record ban after 10 hours of talks spread over Wednesday night and Thursday morning before it was announced at FIFA’s daily briefing at the Maracana. The player and the Uruguay FA had been informed minutes beforehand. The suspension starts with immediate effect. The committee took into account that this was the third time Suarez had bitten an opponent. His first victim was PSV Eindhoven’s Otman Bakkal in 2010, for which he received a seven-match ban, and then Chelsea’s Ivanovic in 2013, which brought a 10-game ban. Sulser said: ‘Such behaviour cannot be tolerated and in particular not at a World Cup when the eyes of millions are on the stars on the field. The disciplinary committee took into account all the factors of the case and the degree of Mr Suarez’s guilt in accordance with the relevant provisions of the code.’ The Uruguayan media claimed that Sulser’s committee had come under pressure from South American football chiefs, including the English-hating Argentinian football president Julio Grondona, not to punish Suarez too severely. But FIFA insisted that there was no interference at all in the process. The world body’s president Sepp Blatter had been in Manaus watching Switzerland beat Honduras and  flew back to Rio while the Suarez hearing was going on. Meanwhile, the Football Writers’ Association, who made Suarez their player of the year last season, decided not to strip the Liverpool star of his title. Uruguay face Colombia in the last 16 on Saturday Central defender Jose Maria Gimenez said the team were ‘more united than ever’, while the country’s sports minister Liliam Kechichian commented: ‘We are hurt by this excessive sanction. Now let’s see how we can help this human being and whether the group can show its class and its love for La Celeste.’ Britain’s FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce said: ‘The punishment is fully justified. Hopefully he will realise now that behaviour of this type will not be tolerated.’","Suarez returns home as Liverpool plan to sell him to Barcelona .

The secret waiting list scandal that led to a national focus on the problems plaguing the Veterans Affairs administration is 'just the tip of the iceberg,' Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn said today in issuing a report on the department's history of misconduct. 'This report shows the problems at the VA are worse than anyone . imagined,' Coburn said in a statement. 'The scope of the VA’s incompetence – and Congress’ indifferent oversight – is breathtaking and disturbing.' The Republican senator conducted a year-long investigation into . the VA and found that more than 1,000 veterans died over the last . decade as a result of the VA's incompetence, and taxpayers footed the bill for $845 million in medical malpractice payments. Sen. Tom Coburn, right, confers with Sen. John Tester, left, during a meeting of the Senate-House Veterans Affairs Conference Committee at the Capitol today . Veterans listen to opening remarks by members of Congress during a meeting of the Senate-House Veterans Affairs Conference Committee today to discuss a bill that would expand veterans' access to care . The VA has a long history of mismanagement, dating back to president George W. Bush's administration, but the appetite for reform ripened only after a retired physician at a VA hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, came forward earlier this year with allegations that more than 40 veterans in the Phoenix area had died while waiting for care. Veterans at that hospital were routinely put on secret waiting lists, the whistleblower, Dr. Sam Foote, said, to cover up to cover up how long it was actually taking VA doctors to see vets for the first time. Official documents showed that veterans were being seen within two weeks to a month of requesting an appointment, as required by VA guidelines. In reality, they were waiting months on end. Around the time of the Phoenix revelations, other VA whistleblowers came forward, reporting similar behavior at their facilities. The Office of the Inspector General was subsequently compelled to launch a system-wide investigation into the VA's facilities across the country. The VA launched it's own investigation, spearheaded by the White House, as well, and two VA officials, including Secretary Eric Shinseki, stepped down. The department's internal audit of 731 medical facilities was released last Thursday. It showed that more than 56,000 veterans waited more than 90 days for their initial appointments. More than 10 percent of veterans seeking care faced wait times of more than 30 days, the report said, contradicting government claims the week before that only 4 percent of vets weren't seen in a timely manner. Many VA schedulers were motivated to lie about wait times in order to receive goal-based bonuses, the audit discovered. A scheduler at the Phoenix hospital confirmed to CNN in an interview that aired Monday night that she was told to put new requests for appointments on a 'secret list' in a drawer instead of in the VA's appointment scheduling program. The scheduler, Pauline DeWenter, said she decided to report her hospital to the authorities after she called a veteran's home to follow-up on an appointment request and found out he had passed away. DeWinter said she'd note in a veteran's records if he had died before receiving care, and on at least seven occasions, someone went back and changed the information to cover up the death. 'So if you change . that to, ""entered in error"" or, my personal favorite, ""no longer . necessary,"" that makes the death go away. So the death would never be . reported then,' she said.The Office of Special Counsel told President Barack Obama in a letter on Monday that the VA's behavior shows a 'troubling . pattern of deficient patient care' and its Office of Medical Inspector repeatedly ignored the testimony of whistleblowers. 'This approach has prevented the VA from . acknowledging the severity of systemic problems and from taking the . necessary steps to provide quality care to veterans,' U.S. Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner said. Sen. Tom Coburn's report noted that a lack of funds isn't the VA's problem, it's waste and abuse of taxpayer resources. In 2011 the VA held a conference at the Orlando World Center Marriott and attendees were treated to lavish spreads of cheeses and breakfast sandwiches yet still received meal reimbursements from the government . The VA held an 11-day conference at the DoubleTree Paradise Valley Resort in Scottsdale, Arizona, for 40 employees in 2011 to the tune of $220,000 . Likewise, Coburn said his own investigation 'found the problems at the VA are far deeper than just . scheduling.' The criminal behavior at the VA is 'pervasive' he said. Among the examples included in his report was a nurse at Lexington, Kentucky's Veterans Affairs Medical Center hospital who was charged with murder after she gave a veteran too much morphine and he died. The nurse pled guilty to involuntary manslaugher, but was only sentenced to time served eight days. Two other patients of the nurse 'died under suspicious circumstances' involving morphine, as well, according to a local news report. The head of security at the Bedford VA Medical Center pleaded guilty to . charges 'two sadistic kidnapping, rape and murder conspiracies,' according to the FBI. A male neurologist at the Colmery-O’Neil Medical Center in Kansas was placed on paid administrative leave for two years after five female veterans filed sexual misconduct charges against him. It took the VA two months after his arrest to suspend him without pay and a year to terminate his employment. The neurologist eventually admitted to 'conducting inappropriate pelvic and breast examinations on patients.' Another doctor who worked at Colmery-O'Neil at the same time was hired within two years of being acquitted of sexual harassment charges by 16 former patients. A social worker at an Oregon VA hospital was paid for a year after she was placed on leave for having sex with one of her patients and 'socializing with five clients.' She was paid $65,000 a year in salary before she was fired and 'stripped of her license' by the Oregon Board of Licensed Social Workers. 'In these cases, paid administrative . leave is the equivalent of disciplining a misbehaving child by . suspending his chores while continuing to pay him an allowance,' Coburn . said. Just as troubling is that Coburn's report is based on information on information readily available to the VA - and the public. The 124 page document is merely a compilation of Government Accountability Office and Office of the Inspector General reports and accounts of the VA's bad deeds in local and national newspaper. This is how backed up one VA office is on processing veterans claims, Coburns report said . 'The vast majority of VA employees are dedicated public servants who . demonstrate genuine passion to care for veterans and their families . every day. At VA, we depend on the service of VA employees and leaders . who place the interests of veterans above and beyond self-interest,' the . VA said in a statement on Tuesday. Coburn released his report as members of the House and Senate Veterans Affairs committees were convening for a joint conference on similar bills passed by their respective chambers that would allow veterans to go to hospitals outside the VA network to get care. The House's bill bans bonuses for VA . employees until the end of 2016, while the Senate's bill only bans . scheduling-based bonuses. The bills would also give the VA permission the money to open 26 to 27 new hospitals in order to meet growing demands for appointments. Coburn says that a lack of funding  is not the VA's problem, however, it's waste and abuse. The department spent $220,000 on an 11-day conference at a Scottsdale, Arizona resort in 2011. The cost for 40 employees who attended to stay at the Doubletree Paradise Valley Resort was more than $90,000, and the contractor who organized the event was paid upward of $100,000. The same year the VA spent a total of $6.1 million on two conferences in Orlando, Florida. Attendees handsomely rewarded with artisan cheese spreads and SWAG like notebooks and water bottles and were treated to karaoke and daily recap videos of the conference that cost $16,500 to produce. 'As is typical with any bureaucracy, the excuse for not being able to . meet goals is a lack of resources.  But this is not the case at the VA . where spending has increased rapidly in recent years,' Coburn said.","Sen. Tom Coburn released a report on Tuesday documenting the Veterans Affairs Department's misconduct throughout the last decade .
Coburn found out in the course of his research that 1,000 veterans died because of VA mismanagement .
The VA has had to pay out close to $1 billion for instances of medical malpractice .

"By . Matthew Blake . The Pope waded into the Middle East peace process last night, uniting the leaders of Israel and Palestine through the power of prayer during a tranquil sunset summit in the gardens of the Vatican. Political and religious differences were put to one side last night as Israeli President Shimon Peres and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas joked and hugged at Francis' Vatican residence before attending an al fresco invocation of Jewish, Christian and Muslim worship. In a meeting that better resembled an outdoor summer wedding than a diplomatic parley, the three men passed along a receiving line as guests mingled on the lawn to the serene harmonies of a string ensemble.

The pope, the two presidents and Patriarch Bartholomew then planted an olive tree and members of each delegation shook hands as music played before adjourning for private talks. 'Peacemaking calls for courage, much more so than warfare. It calls for the courage to say yes to encounter and no to conflict; yes to dialogue and no to violence; yes to negotiations and no to hostilities,' Francis said during the ceremony. The pope spoke after Jewish rabbis, Christian cardinals and Muslim Imams read and chanted from the Old Testament, the New Testament and the Koran in Italian, English, Hebrew and Arabic in the first such inter-religious event in the Vatican. At times the chanting made it seem that participants were in a synagogue or outside a mosque in the Middle East rather than a primly manicured triangular lawn, a spot the Vatican chose as a 'neutral' site with no religious symbols. Interfaith: The pope, the two presidents and Patriarch Bartholomew stood for a picture before heading off for private talks.

Differences aside: Presidents Peres and Abbas joked and hugged at the ceremony, which included a group handshake as a gesture of peace . In his strong speech in Italian, Francis called for respect for agreements and rejection of acts of provocation. 'All of this takes courage, it takes strength and tenacity,' he said. Francis, who made the surprise invitation to the two leaders during his trip to the Holy Land last month, said that the search for peace was 'an act of supreme responsibility before our consciences and before our peoples' and noted that millions around the world of all faiths were praying with them for peace. 'We have heard a summons and we must respond. It is the summons to break the spiral of hatred and violence, and to break it by one word alone: the word 'brother',' the pope said as Peres and Abbas listened intently and read the live translations. Friendly: In a meeting that better resembled an outdoor summer wedding than a diplomatic parley, the three men passed along a receiving line as guests mingled on the lawn to the gentle harmonies of a string ensemble before the ceremony began under the shadow of St. Peter's Basilica . 'Supreme responsibility': Francis, who made the surprise invitation to the two leaders during his trip to the Holy Land last month, said that the search for peace was 'an act of supreme responsibility before our consciences and before our peoples' He said the children who have been the innocent victims of wars and conflicts made the search for peace an imperative. 'The memory of these children instils in us the courage of peace, the strength to persevere undaunted in dialogue,' Francis said. It was the first public meeting between the two presidents in more than a year and took place more than a month after United States-led peace talks collapsed amid bitter mutual recrimination. Peres, who is 90 years old and whose mandate expires next month, departed from his prepared speech in English and Hebrew to say that he was an old man who had 'seen war' and 'tasted peace' and that all leaders owed their children a better future. Abbas prayed to God 'to bring comprehensive and just peace to our country and region so that our people and the peoples of the Middle East and the whole world would enjoy the fruit of peace, stability and coexistence'.","Israel's Shimon Peres and Palestine's Mahmoud Abbas met in Vatican garden .

"By . Matthew Blake . The Queen will tour France in an old Renault during her state visit next week because none of Francois Hollande's Citroens have the space to fit her large hats, it has been reported. The French president has personally invited Her Majesty to Normandy to help him commemorate the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings on June 6. But heads have been spinning at the Elysee Palace ever since the announcement after staff realised she would not be able to sit upright in either the pokey presidential Citroen DS5 or the larger C6 model if she wears any one of her large hats. Many hats: The French president has personally invited Her Majesty to Normandy to help him commemorate the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings on June 6 . Head spin: But heads have been spinning at the Elysee Palace ever since the announcement after staff realised she would not be able to sit upright in the pokey presidential Citroen DS5 if she wears any one of her many hats . Old friends: Queen Elizabeth II last met President Hollande in 2012 when he paid a visit to Windsor Castle . Their first option was a C6 Citroën limousine, rolled out primarily for dignitaries on ceremonial occasions, but its low roof line would not have accommodated Elizabeth II's lavish headgear, The Times reported. Then there was the DS5, but that, they found, had the same problem. Their only other choice was one of the large people carriers used to ferry Elysee staff and security, but that was quickly dismissed, deemed unfit for royalty, said the newspaper. So after much toing and froing, Hollande decided it best to wheel out his old Renault Vel Satis, which - at 62.2 inches - stands 2.6 inches taller than the 'compact executive' DS5. However, the expensive Vel Satis . was a commercial failure for Renault a decade ago and production was . halted in 2009 after seven years. The model provided for the Queen is an armoured 3.5-litre V6. Tall car: After much toing and froing, Hollande decided it best to wheel out his old Renault Vel Satis (pictured), which - at 62.2 inches - stands 2.6 inches taller than the 'compact executive' Citroen DS5 . Too small: Staff at Elysee Palace's first option was a C6 Citroën limousine, used primarily on ceremonial occasions, but its low roof line would not have accommodated Elizabeth II's lavish headgear either . President Hollande first rode out in his new Citroen DS5 for his inauguration in 2012 in which he got drenched on an embarrassing open-topped drive up the Champs Elysee. He chose the DS5 in display of modesty as he attempted to contrast himself from predecessor Nicholas Sarkozy's lavish image. On their visit, beginning next Thursday, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, who will be aged 88 and 92 respectively at the time, will undertake a series of engagements to mark the British war effort before travelling on to Paris where they will be formally received by President Hollande at the Elysee Palace. It is her first visit to France since she made the same trip to meet president Jacques Chirac ten years ago. Long time coming: The last time the Queen visited France was in 2004 with then-president Jacques Chirac . After Friday’s ceremonies by the Normandy beaches, with the Prince of Wales and much of the senior royal family, the Queen will return to a state banquet at the Elysée. She will be presented with an album of photographs from her first two French visits, an official trip in 1948 as Princess Elizabeth and a state visit with the Duke of Edinburgh nine years later. Hollande is so keen to impress 'La Reine d’Angleterre', as she is always known, that he has ordered fois gras to be at the top of the menu because he knows it is a royal favourite, claimed The Times. The royal couple will then tuck in to a main course of lamb with small vegetables and a Bordeaux wine, followed by a cheese platter of reblochon, a pungent specialty of the Alpine region of France.","The Queen is visiting France to commemorate 70th anniversary of D-Day .

At . least three men, including one policeman, have been arrested in . connection with the crime. Officials are searching for another three . men, one of whom is also a police officer. India . tightened its anti-rape laws last year, making gang rape punishable by . the death penalty, even in cases where the victim survives. The . new laws came after the fatal gang rape in 2012 of a 23-year-old woman on a . moving bus in New Delhi that triggered nationwide protests. Scroll down for video . Outrage: The attack is the latest of a string of appalling rape cases that have sent shockwaves through India in recent years sparking protests across the country . The . endemic rape culture of India was brought to international attention in . 2012 by the shocking case of a woman who died after being gang raped in . New Delhi. The woman, a . 23-year-old intern, was attacked while riding a bus through the capital . on 16 December 2012. She was set upon by a gang of six men - one of . whom was under 18. A . court heard the woman was seized by the men, raped repeatedly and given . horrific injuries after they had beaten a male friend who was with her . with an iron bar, throwing him to the back of the bus. The men were said to have been drinking heavily beforehand. Details . were also given of the horrific internal injuries the woman suffered - . which were held up as proof they wanted to kill as well as rape her. She . died in hospital on 29 December. Ram . Singh, 33, Mukesh Singh, 27, Vinay Sharma, 21, Pawan Gupta, 28, and . Akshay Thakur, 20, were arrested for the crime. The youth was not named. The . six accused were taken into custody after the attack. Ram Singh hanged . himself in prison, and the rest were found guilty of kidnap, rape, . robbery and murder. The youth was given the maximum possible sentence of . three years, while the remaining four men were given death sentences. Rape . remains a huge problem in India, and reports of the crime have been on . the rise since the horrific incident on the bus. From January to October . 2013, 1,330 rapes were reported in Delhi and its suburbs, compared with . 706 for all of 2012, according to government figures. In . the wake of the incident the Indian government opened 73 'fast-track' courts in the hope of speeding up the rate at which rapes could be . processed. It was planned that eventually 1,800 such courts would exist, . and spend three years working through the backlog. However, . conviction rates remain low. Of the 706 rapes reported in 2012 in . Delhi, only the most shocking and famous incident resulted in any . convictions. These are . among 1,800 fast-track courts the authorities plan to set up and run for . three years, focusing on violent crimes and other serious offences . against women, children and the elderly, as part of broader judicial . reforms, the report said. Following the latest incident, it . emerged today that the mother of a victim was stripped in the street and . beaten by the accused's father for refusing to drop the case against . his son. The woman was set upon by Basant Yadav and four accomplices on Monday in Etawah, Uttar Pradesh. Two weeks earlier, Yadav's son, Sunny, was arrested for allegedly breaking into the woman's house and raping her daughter. The victim's mother has since led a . campaign to have Sunny charged with the crime despite sustained pressure . from his family to drop the case. She is now lying in critical condition . in hospital, rendered completely speechless since the attack. Still, no . arrests have been made. India's government continues to face fierce criticism over its handling of such cases and inability to eradicate sexual attacks on women and children. And . in a further horrifying case, the owner and manager of a children's . boarding school in western India were arrested after five minors said . they were raped, forced to watch pornographic films and act them out . with one another. The children were made to eat faeces as a punishment if they did not comply. The . 52-year-old owner of the Chandraprabha Charitable Trust and his . 30-year-old female manager were arrested on Monday after a police raid . on the school in Karjat city in Maharashtra state. 'We . received a police complaint from the Childline charity saying that one . child had gone home for the holidays and confessed to his mother that . abuses were happening,' Karjat's Police Inspector R.R. Patil told the . Thomson Reuters Foundation late on Thursday. 'Five . children in total have now come forward and we have booked the two . suspects under various offences,' he said, adding that these included . unnatural sex (sodomy), wrongful confinement and sexual assault. Inspection . mechanisms for children's homes, shelters and schools are inadequate . and many privately run facilities are not even registered, a February . 2013 report by Human Rights Watch said. Records show a rape is committed every 22 minutes in India, a nation of 1.2 billion people. Activists . say that number is low because of an entrenched culture of tolerance . for sexual violence, which leads many cases to go unreported. Women . are often pressed by family or police to stay quiet about sexual . assault, experts say, and those who do report cases are often subjected . to public ridicule or social stigma. Last . month, the head of Uttar Pradesh state's governing party, the . regionally prominent Samajwadi Party, told an election rally that the . party was opposed to the law calling for gang rapists to be executed. 'Boys will be boys,' Mulayam Singh Yadav said. 'They make mistakes.'","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"By . Matthew Blake . Twenty-one people have been killed in the east of Ukraine after a pitched battle between 500 pro-Russian separatists and troops loyal to Kiev. Ukraine's Defence Ministry said 20 insurgents were killed when they attacked a convoy of government troops in the eastern village of Rubizhne yesterday evening. A soldier loyal to Kiev was killed in a separate clash near the same area early this morning. The announcement comes after eight people were killed earlier today during a fierce gunfight between pro-Russian and Ukrainian militia, in the latest indication that Ukraine is edging closer to all-out civil war. GRAPHIC CONTENT WARNING . Grief: A member of the pro-Russia Vostok Battalion folds the arms of a dead colleague after at least eight people between the two sides, including one civilian, were killed in an early morning firefight . Rest: Pro-Russia Vostok Battalion rest after the battle which erupted when the Donbass Battalion, a pro-Ukraine militia, attacked their in the nearby town of Karlivka . Ready for battle: Vostok Battalion assemble along the side of the road . Danger: While many in eastern Ukraine resent the government in Kiev, they are also growing increasingly exasperated with the insurgents, whom they blame for putting civilians in the crossfire . Today's battle broke out when the Donbass Battalion, a Ukraine-loyal militia, attacked a Vostok Battalion checkpoint in the town of Karlivka, to the east of the embattled nation. Harrowing . pictures showed the aftermath of the bloodshed as fighters from both . sides collected their dead, which included one civilian. It . is believed the attack was in retaliation for an ambush by Russian . separatists near Donetsk yesterday, which killed 16 Ukrainian soldiers - . the deadliest confrontation since the conflict began. As . tensions between the two countries rose, Russian President Vladimir . Putin insisted his country will respect the outcome of Ukraine's . presidential vote this weekend but voiced hope that Ukraine would halt . its military operation against separatists in the east. In Kiev, Ukraine's leader urged all . voters to take part in the crucial ballot to 'cement the foundation of . our nation' but pro-Russia insurgents still battled government forces in . eastern Ukraine. Speaking . at an investment forum in St. Petersburg, Putin said Russia will . 'respect the choice of the Ukrainian people' and will work with the new . leadership. He said Russia wants peace and order to be restored in . Russia's neighbor. Pain: A seriously wounded member of a pro-Ukrainian militia bites his hand in pain after he was shot several times during the battle . Earlier, Putin had blamed the West . for encouraging a 'coup' in Ukraine when the nation's pro-Russian . president was chased from power and for plunging the country into what . he described as 'chaos and a full-scale civil war.' In . a live televised address from Kiev, acting President Oleksandr . Turchynov, who is not running, emphasized the importance of Sunday's . vote to choose a new leader. 'Today, we are building a new European country the foundation of which was laid by millions of Ukrainians who proved that they are capable of defending their own choice and their country,' Turchynov said. 'We will never allow anyone to rob us of our freedom and independence, turn our Ukraine into a part of the post-Soviet empire.' Authorities in Kiev had hoped that a . new president would unify the divided nation, where the west looks . toward Europe and the east has strong traditional ties to Russia. But . they have now acknowledged it will be impossible to hold the vote in . some areas in the east - especially in Donetsk and Luhansk, where . insurgents have declared independence and pledged to derail the vote. 'We will respect the election': Speaking at an investment forum in St. Petersburg, Putin said Russia will 'respect the choice of the Ukrainian people' and will work with the new leadership . Election workers and activists say gunmen there have threatened them and . seized their voting materials. Joao . Soares, coordinator for an observation mission of the Organization for . Security and Cooperation in Europe, said Friday he expects problems with . voting in 'less than 20 percent of the polling stations.' Twenty-one candidates are competing Sunday to become Ukraine's next leader. Polls show billionaire candy-maker Petro Poroshenko with a commanding lead but falling short of the absolute majority needed to win in the first round; his nearest challenger is Yulia Tymoshenko, the divisive former prime minister, who is trailing by a significant margin. If no one wins in the first round, a runoff will be held on June 15. Most polls predict Poroshenko's victory in that contest. Civil war: Earlier, Putin blamed the West for encouraging a 'coup' in Ukraine when the nation's pro-Russian president was chased from power and for plunging the country into what he described as 'chaos and a full-scale civil war' Important vote: In a live televised address from Kiev, acting President Oleksandr Turchynov, who is not running, emphasized the importance of Sunday's vote to choose a new leader . At a security conference in Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov urged the West to reach a settlement based on mutual interests. 'If we sincerely want to help the Ukrainian people overcome this crisis, it's necessary to abandon the notorious zero-sum games, stop encouraging xenophobic and neo-Nazi sentiments and get rid of dangerous megalomania,' Lavrov said. Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea Peninsula in March, triggering the worst crisis in relations with the West since the Cold War. Pro-Russian insurgents also have seized government buildings in eastern Ukraine and fought government troops for more than a month. Deadly attack: In the deadliest attack yet, pro-Russia insurgents attacked a military checkpoint and killed 14 soldiers Thursday, casting a shadow over the presidential vote . Bombed: The head of the General Staff of the Russian military, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, on Friday criticized Ukrainian authorities for what he said was using artillery and other heavy weapons against civilians . Meanwhile, armed . pro-Russian separatists ambushed a convoy of Ukrainian self-defence . fighters today, a day after pro-Russia insurgents attacked a . military checkpoint and killed 14 soldiers yesterday, casting a shadow . over the presidential vote. A number of Ukrainian soldiers were wounded in the attack, which took place near the eastern city of Donetsk, military sources said. 'They . (the separatists) are using automatic weapons, snipers and grenade . launchers against the battalion,' Semen Semenchenko, the commander of a . pro-Ukrainian militia group called the Donbass region battalion, said on . his Facebook page. Yuri . Bereza, the commander of pro-Ukrainian self-defence forces in a nearby . region who had headed to the scene, told Reuters by telephone: 'The . fighting is still going on, we are evacuating the wounded.' He gave no . figure for the wounded. Armed: A separatist shows off the array of weapons his group seized . Hours later, Russia accused the . West of triggering the Ukrainian crisis by its 'megalomania,' as . fighting continued in Ukraine's east between pro-Russia insurgents and . government forces two days before a presidential election. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov urged the West to reach a settlement based on mutual interests. 'If . we sincerely want to help the Ukrainian people overcome this crisis, . it's necessary to abandon the notorious zero-sum games, stop encouraging . xenophobic and neo-Nazi sentiments and get rid of dangerous . megalomania,' Lavrov said in a speech at a security conference in Moscow . organized by the Russian Defense Ministry. Under fire: Slovyansk, a city which has been the epicenter of clashes for weeks, has seen continuous shelling by the Ukrainian government forces, who have retaliated to the rebel fire . Still burning: There were no casualties, as the family living there had left the previous day, according to local residents . Speaking at the same conference, the . head of the General Staff of the Russian military, Gen. Valery . Gerasimov, blamed the West for encouraging massive protests that chased . Ukraine's pro-Russian president from power in February. It . comes a day after at least 14 Ukrainian servicemen were killed in a . firefight with rebel gunmen south of Donetsk, an industrial hub where . the separatists have proclaimed a 'people's republic' and have vowed to . disrupt Sunday's presidential election. In the deadliest clash yet in the conflict in Ukraine, three . armoured vehicles were destroyed and a series of other lorries and vans . burned out. The destruction of armoured vehicles . shows that the rebels have access to heavy weaponry and are not . lightly-armed freelance operators. It is likely to raise fears that they . have been armed by Moscow. A group of rebels in the town of . Horlivka claimed responsibility for the attack near the village of Blahodatne, near the town of Volnovakha, Donetsk. While many in eastern Ukraine resent the government in Kiev, they are also growing increasingly exasperated with the insurgents, whom they blame for putting civilians in the crossfire. The village of Semenovka on the outskirts of Slovyansk, a city that has been the epicenter of clashes for weeks, has seen continuous shelling by the Ukrainian government forces retaliating to rebel fire. Early on Friday, a house was destroyed by mortar fire that came from Ukrainian government side, but locals reported no casualties. Shelling continued later in the day, targeting Slovyansk, where several other buildings were also damaged. There was no word of casualties.","Pro-Russian forces attacked a convoy of government troops yesterday .

"By . Matthew Blake . The moonwalking hologram of Michael Jackson that rocked the Billboard Music Awards last night has landed the show's organisers in a legal row after the British billionaire behind its technology claimed it was used without his permission. The ghostly apparition of the King of Pop wowed spectators with a rendition of Slave To The Rhythm, a track taken from Jackson's posthumous new album Xscape, dancing about the stage in a golden jacket and red trousers as fireballs shot around him. But despite the gimmick's apparent success at Las Vegas' MGM, Alki David - who owns Hologram USA - says his holographic technology was stolen, a claim organiser Pulse Entertainment's CEO John Textor denies. Hologram USA holds the patents for the state-of-the-art technology with Musion Das Hologram Ltd. Scroll down for video . Still rocking the house: A hologram of Michael Jackson performed at the Billboard Music Awards on Sunday . Judge Nancy J. Koppe of the Nevada court granted Alki last minute emergency access to the show - sparking angry backstage scenes as he and his team of lawyers clashed with MGM bosses. During the heated confrontation, Alki alleged that a former Musion employee was discovered backstage and . that the court had been misled. It is also understood that Musion . believe the quality of the show would have been far more spectacular had they been involved. The British billionaire: The controversial holographic representation of Jackson at the Billboard Music Awards at the MGM in Las Vegas went ahead despite a request for an injunction by media mogul Alki David's company Hologram USA . Mr David said: 'It is no surprise that Pulse was stealing our technology. I partnered with the inventor Uwe Maas to bring the magic back to entertainment and it’s just such a shame that people like John Textor and his cronies felt it necessary to behave this way.' Pulse were not immediately available for comment. The . onstage resurrection garnered a standing ovation by the massive . star-studded audience, who were clearly moved by the performance nearly . five years after his death. However, only . on Friday did a federal judge rule that the Billboard Music Awards . could use the hologram, rejecting efforts from tech companies seeking to . block the digital performance. Judge Kent Dawson said there wasn't . enough evidence to show the planned 3-D image would violate patents held . by Hologram USA Inc. and Musion Das Hologram Ltd. The . companies own rights to technology known for digitally resurrecting . deceased rapper Tupac Shakur at the 2012 Coachella music festival. 'The court's decision is not . surprising,' attorney Howard Weitzman, who represented Jackson's estate . and dick clark productions, wrote in an email. 'The request to stop this . extraordinary Michael Jackson event was ludicrous.' Plans . to use the hologram during the show on Sunday emerged with the lawsuit, . but were not confirmed until the hearing Friday afternoon. Show producers . had been promoting only a 'history-making performance' at Las Vegas' MGM Grand Garden Arena that would promote Xscape. Mesmerising: The incredible performance resulted in a standing ovation from the star-studded audience . Hologram USA and Musion said in their . emergency lawsuit on Thursday that one of their products was being used . without authorisation by a competitor to create a segment that depicts . Jackson performing Slave to the Rhythm. Attorney . Michael Feder, representing the show and Jackson estate, filed a . response on Friday, saying the holographic performance had been planned . for months and was discussed with Alki David, who owns the rights to the . technology that creates and projects lifelike images to appear . alongside live performers through Hologram USA and Musion. New track: The hologram performed Slave To The Rhythm, a new song off the posthumous album Xscape . Amazingly realistic: The hologram even did the moonwalk while dancers were beside it, and fire shot out around it . Plaintiff's attorney Ryan G. Baker said his clients were disappointed with the ruling, but the lawsuit will continue. 'It's . only the very beginning of a case that will continue to be prosecuted . by my clients, and ultimately they are confident that they will prevail . and will recover all available damages for the defendants' infringing . conduct,' Baker said. Hologram USA obtained the rights to the patents after the bankruptcy of Florida effects house Digital Domain, which created the Shakur image to wide acclaim two years ago. The lawsuit also named John C. Textor, the chairman of Florida-based Pulse Entertainment Corp. who was the former head of Digital Domain. Pulse is accused of using the hologram techniques without a proper license. A phone message left for Textor was not immediately returned. Back in the day: Michael is seen here in February 1988. He died nearly five years ago, in June 2009 . The lawsuit names Atlanta-based Pulse Entertainment Inc. as a defendant. Spokesman Ken S. Johnson said the company was listed incorrectly because it had no connection the Billboard Music Awards. In March, Hologram USA sued Cirque du Soleil and MGM Resorts International over its show, Michael Jackson ONE at Mandalay Bay Hotel & Casino. The show features a performance by a digital rendition of Jackson, which the company also contends is an unlicensed use of its technology. The case is being handled in a Los Angeles federal court and Cirque du Soleil and MGM Resorts have been granted an extension until May 23 to respond to the lawsuit.","Hologram wowed audience singing Slave To The Rhythm in Las Vegas .

"By . Matthew Blake . A 67-year-old serial rapist suspected of committing nearly 100 rapes in his lifetime has been caught in Russia. Valery Makarenkov prowled the streets and parks of capital Moscow preying on women in a reign of terror that spanned more than 30 years. Always wearing a mask to hide his identity, he would strangle his victims until they lost consciousness before raping them and stealing their money and valuables. Campaign of fear: Valery Makarenkov prowled the streets and parks of capital Moscow preying on women in a reign of terror that spanned more than 30 years . Cowardly: Always wearing a mask to hide his identity, he would strangle his victims until they lost consciousness before raping them and stealing their money and valuables . And his campaign of fear finally came to an end last month when Makarenkov attacked a 29-year-old woman in a park in the city. His brave victim was able to fight him off and get a good look at his face after pulling off his mask in the tussle that ensued. After escaping the attack, the woman alerted police nearby who tracked him down and arrested him, after the woman identified his as the face behind the mask. 'Old age finally caught up with him and he was unable to complete the act, as his victim was able to beat him off,' said a police spokesman. The investigators were able to . establish the involvement of Makarenkov in numerous crimes, some of them . through DNA. The most recent victims were also able to identified him. In . the years leading to Makarenkov's arrest, detectives studied . handwriting they had of the suspect and compiled a list of around 20,000 . Moscow residents who bore resemblence to the suspect's description. Final crime scene: Makarenkov was arrested after he allegedly tried to rape a 29-year-old woman in Kuzminki Park (pictured) Behind bars: Always wearing a mask to hide his identity, he would strangle his victims until they lost consciousness before raping them and stealing their money and valuables . Police say Makarenkov didn't targeted women who would be easy to subdue, acting spontaneously . 'After several years of hard analytical work, Valery Makarenkov, who was born in 1947, was detained,' Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for Russia's Investigative Committee, said. 'According to investigators, in the period from 1987 to 2014, he carried out a series of attacks on women in Moscow that were associated with robberies.' Investigators say many of the attacks followed a specific 'modus operandi' in which Makarenkov would pose as an ordinary cyclist late at night or early in the morning. He would follow his victims in Moscow parks or in the backyards of apartment buildings, where he would choke the women unconscious and rape them before stealing any valuable possessions they were carrying. 'Thanks to the modern high-tech equipment of the Russian Investigative Committee's Main Criminalistics Department, a rapid molecular-genetic study of the suspect's DNA samples allowed investigators to quickly establish his involvement in 19 crimes,' Markin explained. 'The young woman who was attacked three days earlier confidently identified the suspect.'","Valery Makarenkov prowled the streets and parks of Russian capital Moscow .

"By . Dan Bates . Wendi Deng has hired a top New York divorce lawyer in her split with Rupert Murdoch suggesting things could became messy and expensive. Deng has retained William Zabel whose clients include billionaire financier George Soros and the late author Michael Crichton. She reportedly interviewed eight potential attorneys before choosing him. Lawyer up: Wendi Deng isn't messing around when it comes to her divorce from media mogul Rupert Murdoch. She recently hired top attorney William Zabel to represent her in the split . Mr Murdoch, 82, has turned to high-flying lawyer and friend Pamela Sloan who advised Miss Deng on her prenuptial agreement with him when they married in 1999. He is also taking counsel from New York attorney Ira Garr and Gerson Zweifach, the the general counsel of his companies News Corporation and 21st Century Fox. Mr Murdoch will be hoping to avoid a repeat of his split from his second wife Anna which cost more than $1.7billion, one of the most expensive divorces in history. And even though Mr Murdoch and Miss Deng did sign a prenuptial and two post-nuptial agreements, there is still room for discussion over issues like custody and child support for their daughters, Grace, 11, and Chloe, nine. Miss Deng, 44, will also reportedly want a share of some assets like their $44million Manhattan penthouse and one of their yachts, though it is not clear which of his fleet that would mean. Eye on the prize: Deng hopes to get the couple's $44million Manhattan penthouse . Another issue is the Murdoch family trust - Mr Murdoch announced in 2006 that Grace and Chloe would not have the same voting rights as his other children, something which angered Miss Deng. The couple reportedly almost broke up over this and Miss Deng has apparently negotiated more favorable terms for the girls. Proud mother: Deng nearly split up with Murdoch in 2006 when he announced that their children - Grace and Chloe (above) - would not have the same voting rights in the family trust as his other children . Mr Zabel is already representing Mr Soros in the $50million lawsuit brought by his former girlfriend who has claimed that he ‘snapped’ and throttled her whilst they were in bed together. Adrianna Ferreyr, 30, has claimed that the 82-year-old choked and slapped her during a row over property. Mr Zabel has also represented Jane Beasley Welch during her acrimonious split from her husband John, the former chief executive of General Electric, and US shock jock Howard Stern. A spokesman for Miss Deng confirmed that Mr Zabel had been hired but declined to comment further.","Deng has retained top New York divorce lawyer William Zabel .

"By . Peter Rugg . A liquor entrepreneur affectionately known as 'Dr. Vodka' was killed in a high speed crash early Thursday morning on Florida's MacArthur Causeway. Malcolm Lloyd was sitting in the passenger seat of a 2012 model Lamborghini traveling toward the mainland at more than 100 miles per hour when it slammed into an SUV parked at a red light. Lloyd, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Old Nassau Imports, died at the scene. Known as 'Dr. Vodka' for his advanced degrees and prowess in the liquor business, Malcolm Lloyd was killed in a car crash early Thursday . The driver of the car, Andres Esteban Toro, was hospitalized at Jackson Memorial Hospital where the Miami Herald reports he is in critical but stable condition. Toro is Lloyd's brother-in-law. The Lamborghini, with a sticker price of roughly $400,000 according to Car and Driver, was completely destroyed. Authorities say the car was traveling so fast it launched through the air 100 yards from the crash scene . The SUV's driver, Raul Alfonzo, is also in the Jackson Memorial Hospital and is also in stable condition. A stretch of the MacArthur was shut down for more than 10 hours for cleanup after the accident, causing backups on the nearest connectors from Miami Beach to the mainland. Toro was driving so fast the car was lifted into the air and propelled more than 100 yards from the crash site. Miami Beach police spokesman Bobby Hernandez said charges are pending. The driver of the Lamborghini as well as the driver of the SUV it crashed into are both hospitalized in critical but stable condition . Authorities said charges are currenty pending against the Lamborghini's driver Raul Alfonzo . Toro had a history of reckless driving, and in the past three years racked up five moving violations, including failure to stop at a light and disobeying a stop sign. In each case, the charges were either dismissed or Toro pled no contest. The pair were reportedly returning from a night at Versace Mansion, the former home of designer Giannia Versace which was reopened as a luxury hotel and club last month. Alfonzo's attorney, Glen Z. Goldberg, said his client is in 'really bad shape' and that he has no idea 'how he is alive.' Driver Raul Alfonzo has a history of reckless driving with at least five moving violation charges in recent years . The crash so was horrific a section of the MacArthur Causeway had to be closed for 10 hours for cleanup . Before starting Old Nassau Imports in 2005 with his godfather, who spent more than 30 years in the liquor industry, Lloyd earned an engineering degree from John Hopkins and a medical degree from Dartmouth. Lloyd, 42, has been featured in numerous lifestyle magazines in New York City, where he made his home. In 2011 he credited an 'incredible master distiller' he from the Terra Mountains of Slovakia for the success of his imported, mid-price vodka. He was honored by Goldman Sachs in 2012 as one of the top 100 innovative entrepreneurs in the country. Malcolm Lloyd and driver Raul Alfonzo were headed home from a night at the Versace mansion, which is now an exclusive club and hotel .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The Pope’s pilgrimage to the Middle East was controversial because of the holy leader’s impromptu prayer session at the West Bank’s barrier. And a playful religious disagreement also took place between Pope Francis and Israel’s prime minister, which revolved around Jesus’ linguistic skills. Benjamin Netanyahu and the Pope had a small, good natured squabble about the language spoken by Jesus Christ. Scroll down for video . Aramaic! Benjamin Netanyahu (left) and the Pope (right) had a small, humorous squabble (pictured) about the language spoken by Jesus Christ, with Israel's prime minister saying that the religious leader spoke Hebrew, while the Pope said Aramaic . Most Biblical scholars agree that Jesus and his disciples spoke Aramaic, which was the common language of Judea in the first century AD. It is likely that Jesus spoke a local Galilean dialect and the towns of Nazareth was an Aramaic speaking community. Despite the increasing importance of Greek, Aramaic was the dominant language among Jews in the Holy Land and across the Middle East until the Arab conquest in the seventh century. Aramaic words frequently pop up in Biblical text, such as 'Abba, Father, ‘and place names including Gethsemane - the place where Jesus took his disciples to pray before his arrest - are thought to have an Aramaic root. No-one really knows whether Jesus could write. Some experts believe he could speak Hebrew.Opinion is divided as to whether the religious leader knew any Greek or Latin. At a meeting in Jerusalem, Mr Netanyahu told the Pope: ’Jesus was here, in this land. He spoke Hebrew,’ in a bid to discuss the strong ties between Judaism and Christianity. To which the smiling Pope corrected: ‘Aramaic. He spoke Aramaic, but he knew Hebrew.’ Most historians accept that Jesus existed, although the events of his life are far from concrete. Dr Sebastian Brock, emeritus reader in Aramaic at Oxford University told BBC News that both leaders are correct. Hebrew was the language of scholars and the scriptures, while Jesus would have used the Aramaic tongue for his everyday conversations, he explained. Most Biblical scholars agree that Jesus (illustrated) and his disciples spoke Aramaic, which was the common language of Judea in the first century AD as well as perhaps a little Hebrew. But opinion is divided as to whether he know any Greek or Latin . Most scholars agree that Jesus spoke Aramaic in Bible, which was also the predominate language used by Mel Gibson in his film, The Passion. People also spoke Latin and Greek during the time of Jesus, while Arabic arrived later in Palestine. Jonathan Katz, stipendiary lecturer in Classics at Oxford University, does not believe that Jesus – a carpenter’s son from Galilee – would have spoken any more than a few words of Latin. The language was largely spoken by Roman soldiers and was the language of law. It is slightly more likely that Jesus would be more familiar with Greek, which was used by administrators across the Roman Empire. But again, Dr Katz does not think that Jesus would have been fluent. According to Jewish historian Josephus, Greek was seldom spoken at all in first century Israel and that it was extremely rare for a Jew to know any Greek. Despite the holy leader’s influence, it is unlikely that Jesus could write in any language, Dr Brock said. However, there is one account of Christ writing in the dust in John’s gospel. The account of events though does not stipulate which language Jesus was using, or whether he was drawing.","At a meeting in Jerusalem, Israel's prime minister told the Pope that Jesus spoke Hebrew and the Pope corrected him by saying 'Aramaic'

"By . Peter Rugg . After waiting 31 years for the man who raped and murdered her daughter to face justice, mother Nola Mahon had a message for him as he was finally sentenced in a California courtroom. 'I forgive you,' she told Gregory Seamons, who had pled guilty to charges of manslaughter and rape in the March 1983 murder of 11-year-old Rebecca Lemberger. 'Not for his sake, but for ours,' Mahon said as family and friends around her broke into tears. Gregory Seamons confessed to the rape and murder of 11-year-old Rebecca Lemberger after DNA evidence tied him to the scene . Seamons was sentenced to serve a 1-15 year prison term and a 5 years to life prison term, The Standard-Examiner reported. Seamons, 46, raped and murdered the girl when he was 15-years-old. Lemberger was missing for one day before her body was found. She had been beaten to death with a rock near a shed in Ogden. The case was cold until July 2011 when DNA evidence from the crime scene was found to match Seamons. His sentences will run concurrently with a sentence he is already serving in Idaho State Prison for a 2007 kidnapping conviction. Once his sentence in Idaho is complete, he will serve rest of his time in Utah State Prison. His defense team made a plea deal with the prosecution in the case reducing a murder charge to manslaughter. As the case had been dormant for years and as Seamons was a minor at the time of the crime, Prosecutor Chris Shaw said he was comfortable with the deal. And as sentence was handed down Mahon was there to address the court. Rebecca's mother, Nola Mahon, said she forgave Seamons because of her religious faith . 'When . this happened, my brain wouldn't accept what was going on,' she said. 'I had been praying that she was at a friend's house. When the . realization hit, for 29 years I suspected everybody. I suspected family, . friends and neighbors. I felt so ashamed.' Her own father, who survived Nazi-occupied Holland, was brokenhearted at the end of his life over Rebecca's death. 'I understand you were 15 years old,' she told Seamons. 'I don't understand why, but I forgive you.' After she was finished, Judge Mark DeCarla was shaken and moved by the gesture. 'This case has been on the minds of the community for 30 years and has been a part of my entire career,' he said. 'I cannot understand how you . can look this man in the eye and say you forgive him, but I appreciate . that.' Rebecca's sister, Cindy Hawke, also spoke remembering the happy girl that had been taken from them. 'She was . our 'Boo Boo bear'. She was a bundle of joy and she loved everybody,' she said. 'When I got that call that she wasn't coming home, it turned . my world upside down.' Hawke noted that may of Rebecca's classmates are now adults. They were so hurt by her death they formed a Facebook group to keep in touch over the years. Several attended court for the sentencing. Hearing Maho's words, Seamons began to cry. 'I've . thought about it for a long time, and these tears are too late. Nothing . I can do can fix this,' Seamons told the court. 'I don't expect the family's . forgiveness.' He also hoped this would finally clear the name of his late father, Larry Bingham Seamons, who he had blamed for the murder in several letters to the media. 'I've recommitted . myself to God,' Seamons said. 'I'm not afraid of what Judge DeCaria can do to . me, I'm afraid of what God will do with me.' As Mahon did not seek financial restitution the case was finally closed. 'I'm glad to finally get closure, but I can never fully put it behind me,' she said. She credited her faith for allowing her to find forgiveness. 'I felt sorry for him. I realized I could forgive him . because of what awaits him on the other side if he does not repent.' she said.","Greg Seamons confessed to the 1983 murder of Rebecca Lemberger, 11, after DNA evidence tied him to the crime .

"By . Damien Gayle . Pope Francis stopped his car on a quiet country highway to kiss a young disabled women who was waiting by the side of the road with her family to see him pass. The leader of the Catholic Church had been returning from an appearance in Cassano allo Jonio in Calabria, southern Italy, when he spotted signs asking him to stop. Disregarding any danger - he had hours earlier threatened to excommunicate members of the Mafia - he ordered his driver to pull over and he got out to greet and bless the group. Scroll down for video . Big hearted: Pope Francis kisses the forehead of a disabled woman after responding to signs asking him to stop as he drove through rural Calabria on Saturday afternoon on his way back from a mass in the Mafia heartland . The Vatican’s news.va website reported that people had been waiting with banners reading, 'Please Pope stop here to see an angel who has been waiting for you'. As soon as the Pope stepped out of his characteristically modest blue hatchback, the group approached him with the young woman, called Roberta, who was lying on a stretcher. He bent over and kissed her on the forehead before shaking hands with her family, to cries of 'bravo' and 'grazie' Catholic News Agency reported that Roberta, whose surname is not yet known, is so badly disabled she cannot travel far from her home and is reliant on a machine to breathe. The whole incident was captured on video and uploaded to YouTube, where it has been viewed nearly 500,000 times. The impromptu stop on Saturday is something that would never have been expected of Francis's predecessors, but the current Pope is becoming well known for his spontaneity, courage and personal touch. It comes just over a week after he revealed he was to dispense with the bullet-proof shield on his popemobile, saying: 'It is true that anything could happen, but let's face it, at my age I don't have much to lose.' Previously, he's taken a boy with Down's Syndrome for a spin in the papal runabout, embraced a man whose face is badly disfigured, and washed the feet of children in jail during a Holy Week ceremony.

Ivan Vania, a family friend who helped make the posters that drew Francis's attention, wrote: 'Today we can say that Christ stopped in Sibari in the vestments of Pope Francis.

Apprehended: Kevin Canty was taken into custody for shooting his wife dead in their Queens home . According to CBS, a neighbor shopping at a nearby deli saw the two children run from the house, yelling, 'Daddy shot Mommy!' 'They came in screaming, crying saying their dad just shot their mom and there’s blood all over, please help,' local Heidi Gamble said. For those who knew the couple the shooting was horrifying but somehow inevitable. Shanique Varlack, 22, said Canty often threatened his wife and was prone to drunken rages. 'He told more than one person - 'I'm gonna kill this b---h one day,’' Varlack told the New York Daily News. 'Everybody is just so distraught. He's a cop. He's supposed to protect . us.

"By . Associated Press . and Peter Rugg . Authorities say a seventh suspect in the kidnapping of a North Carolina prosecutor's father has been arrested in Atlanta. Quantavious Thompson is the seventh person to be arrested in what the FBI has called an 'elaborate plot' to kill the father of Assistant District Attorney Colleen Janssen . FBI spokeswoman Shelley Lynch said in a statement that Quantavious Thompson was taken into custody late Wednesday afternoon. Details on his arrest weren't immediately available Thursday. Frank Janssen was kidnapped April 5 from his home and driven in a rented hatchback to Atlanta, where he was held for five days before his rescue. Thompson is the seventh person to be captured in what the FBI has called an 'elaborate plot' to kill Janssen as his daughter, Assistant District Attorney Colleen Janssen put a gang member away for life, Fox News reports. The last subject remaining at-large is Jakym 'Jak' Camel Tibbs, known simply by his last name. The 20-year-old New Yorker is considered armed and dangerous. A $25,000 reward has been offered for information that leads to his arrest. Janssen was taken from his Wake Forest N.C. home and restrained, then eventually rescued Wednesday in an FBI raid on an Atlanta apartment complex. Tibbs and Thompson allegedly used a stun gun on Janssen when he answered his door, then took him to Atlanta. Once there they texted his wife pictures of Janssen tied to a chair with messages they would cut him if she did not cooperate. Federal agents claim Kevin Melton, 49, . was the mastermind behind the scheme, coordinating with text messages . from his prison cell. Suspect Jakym Tibbs remains on the run .

"By . Margot Peppers . Most women wear perfume to mask their body odor, but one artist is making waves for doing exactly the opposite. New York-basedhas launched a fragrance called Eau de M, which is crafted using the 'aromatic elements from her body' - namely her sweat, tears and hair. The unusual scent debuted in the May issue of Harper's Bazaar, with a description calling it 'unique and intensely addictive' as well as 'wet, sweet and sensual like a hot, humid summer day.' Au naturel: New York-based artist Martynka Wawrzyniak has debuted a fragrance called Eau de M, which is crafted using the 'aromatic elements from her body' - namely her sweat, tears and hair . The former model's sweat was produced by sleeping in the same T-shirt for five nights, or by doing Bikram yoga and then putting her shirt in a sterile mason jar. To elicit and then bottle her tears, she watched films and cartoons that reminded her of her childhood in communist Poland. According to her website, Martynka spent a year working with a research team of Hunter College chemistry students, who helped create an 'olfactory-based self-portrait' based on the scents she produced. We asked a selection of MailOnline employees what they thought of the fragrance. (The women knew what it was, and the men did not.) Here's what the women had to say... It's that smell of a girl's T-shirt when her deodorant almost but doesn't quite completely mask the sweat smell. It smells tangy, like sweat on a summer's day. And the men said... To extract her scents, the students - . overseen by Professor Donna McGregor - used a complex process of . treating 100per cent cotton clothes that she had worn, then washing the . clothes with ethanol and leaving it to evaporate. 'Any water in the sweat samples allows for . bacteria to grow,' Dr McGregor explained to the Wall Street Journal. 'That's what gives rise to the . body odor that everybody associates with sweat or the scent of the human body.' The . process left behind just the aromatic essential oils, which were then . delivered to scent director Dawn Goldworm and perfumer Yann Vasnier so . they could reconstruct her natural aroma. The elements they ultimately chose were tropical coconut infused with cacao absolute, fresh grass and passionfruit - abnormally fresh human scents that are likely linked to the fact that she is a vegan. 'The analysis of the exact odor... there were a lot of materials that are not available in the perfumist's palette. So you have to recreate it with lots of pieces from [different elements],' Mr Vasnier told VICE. 'We tried a musky smell, a milky smell, a sweaty fruity smell. It's hard to recreate the exact molecules of her body.' Creative process: The former model's sweat was produced by sleeping in the same T-shirt for five nights and by doing Bikram yoga. To elicit tears, she watched films from her childhood in communist Poland . Harper's . Bazaar readers likely didn't even look twice at the page in the . magazine, which looked like any other fragrance ad, with a nude portrait of the artist and a . photo of a perfume bottle. And that's exactly what Martynka intended, as she explains in her artist's statement about the work. Have a whiff: A scent strip of the unusual 'perfume' was featured in the May issue of Harper's Bazaar (pictured) 'By running a fake advertisement with a . scent strip in the full print run of Harper's Bazaar (circulation . 950,000) magazine, I will be expanding the self-portrait beyond the . traditional art context by performing olfactory guerrilla tactic,' she wrote. 'The advertisement will become a vehicle for spreading my . essence across the country, letting the mass market consume artwork . unwittingly.' She added . that the fragrance and its production has a special significance. 'The . piece represents the true essence of a woman - free of visual . prejudice,' she explained.

Their bodies were discovered by a family member on the morning of Feb. 7 lying side by side in bed, each wearing pajamas.

The Gaston Gazette reported that tests to measure gas in the house's air came back negative. A gas leak in the couple's neighborhood sparked rumors they may have died of carbon monoxide poisoning .

"By . Alasdair Glennie Tv Correspondent . The BBC is to spend £20,000 sending staff from Salford and London to Birmingham... just so they can meet for the first time. Around 200 staff will be forced to travel hundreds of miles by train to attend the four-hour conference on June 27 so they can have ‘a chance to get acquainted’. And despite spending £1billion on new headquarters in Salford, bosses have hired a state-of-the-art conference centre for the event, as well as laying on refreshments at further cost to the licence-fee payer. New headquarters: The BBC is to spend £20,000 sending staff from Salford and London to Birmingham for a four-hour conference. This is despite the corporation spending £1billion on new Salford headquarters (above) Yesterday, the plan was branded a ‘complete waste of money’ by a BBC employee, who contacted the Daily Mail anonymously. He said holding the event in Birmingham, which is 90 miles from Salford and 120 miles from London, would double the rail cost, adding: ‘Most of us are not getting pay rises, again. Yet there is money to waste on this. We want answers and accountability from over-paid bosses.’ In an email to staff on the BBC’s ‘platform group’, a part of its Media and Technology department, a senior executive said the conference would: ‘Give us a chance to get acquainted.’ She said: ‘Our team is split across London and Salford, but we want everyone to be together in one place – just for the one day, and we feel it’s well worth the effort! Host city: Around 200 staff will be forced to travel hundreds of miles by train to attend the conference in Birmingham (pictured) on June 27. The event aims to give BBC employees 'a chance to get acquainted' ‘Having researched the options available, we’ve chosen a venue in Birmingham.In terms of cost and time, this was the best option for getting everyone together in one location. We’re going to book rail travel for staff, which we also feel is most convenient and time efficient.’ She added: ‘One of our goals for the day is that it’s interactive, and provides sufficient opportunity for you to meet and talk with colleagues in a way that you don’t normally have the opportunity to do. In other words, we promise the Conference WILL NOT be loads of Powerpoint!’ Concern: Andy Silvester, of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said the Birmingham conference was 'a shocking waste of the licence fee' Since the BBC set up its £1billion headquarters in Salford in 2011, it has repeatedly come under fire for wasting money shipping staff around the country. Last year, it emerged it had paid its own staff £24million to relocate to the North without asking them to provide receipts to prove their expense claims. Staff who did not wish to move to Salford permanently were instead allowed to commute there for two years and receive £1,900 a month to cover the cost of renting an apartment in the city. So far, the BBC has spent £4million on trains and hotels for staff visiting the base, with more than £300,000 going on first class rail tickets. Yesterday, Andy Silvester from the Taxpayers’ Alliance said the Birmingham conference was ‘a shocking waste of the licence fee’. He added: ‘There’s no reason why staff from Salford couldn’t come to London, or vice versa, and using a halfway house is only pushing up the cost. 'There has to be more accountability among senior bosses at the BBC, or sympathy for the licence fee will swiftly evaporate.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘This is a one off meeting and the only time this year the teams from London and Salford will be brought together. 'Birmingham is the most practicable location for teams that are split across the country, and we have made savings wherever possible.’","BBC to spend £20,000 sending around 200 of its staff to Birmingham centre .

"By . Alasdair Glennie Tv Correspondent . Chris Evans is oficially the king of breakfast radio after attracting a record-breaking 9.83million weekly listeners (pictured with son Noah) He spent years in the showbusiness wilderness after his first stint at the BBC ended in disaster. But Chris Evans, 48, is now the king of breakfast radio after he pulled in a record 9.83million weekly listeners. The presenter helped Radio 2 to its highest ever ratings over the past three months, the latest listener ratings have shown. As The Chris Evans Breakfast Show added 10,000 listeners in a quarter, his Radio 1 rival Nick Grimshaw lost almost 400,000, according to audience measurement system Rajar. Evans is now nearly 1.7million ahead of veteran DJ Terry Wogan, whom he replaced in 2010. Sir Terry managed a peak audience of 8.1million listeners in his final three months. Radio 2 drew in 15.6million weekly listeners, up from 15.3million last year and its highest audience since records began in 2009. Radio 1’s figure of 10.5million was up 200,000 on this time last year, but down 400,000 on the last quarter. Grimshaw, 29, lost 526,000 listeners over the age of 25 in just three months but gained 130,000 under-24s. His overall weekly audience of 5.9million is almost a million down on his predecessor Chris Moyles who stepped down as the station tried to attract younger listeners and make it more distinctive from Radio 2. Last night Radio 1 controller Ben Cooper said despite the audience decline, Grimshaw’s figures showed the strategy is working. He said: ‘I was asked to build a younger audience for Radio 1 and regenerate the brand, and these figures show we’re doing exactly that. Grimmy and the Breakfast Show continue to gain young listeners, which is the challenge I set him.’ Evans’ continued success is particularly remarkable considering how spectacularly his career imploded in the 1990s. Nick Grimshaw has lost Radio 1 almost a million listeners since he took over the slot from Chris Moyles, but has attracted nearly 130,000 under-24s as the show looks to attract a younger audience . The former TFI Friday presenter once admitted hosting most of his shows with a hangover when he was a Radio 1 star, and in 1995 was fined £7,000 when he turned up for work after a 17-hour pub crawl. He eventually quit two years later after managers refused to give him Fridays off so he would have more time to recover from his binges, which saw him drink up to 20 pints of lager a day. BBC radio boss Helen Boaden said: ‘The continuing success of the Chris Evans Breakfast Show is a tribute to all those who work so hard to make the show utterly unique.’ Radio 4’s weekly audience of 10.95million was up from last year’s figure but down from the last quarter’s record high of 11.2million. Radio 3 added 100,000 listeners in the past three months.","Chris Evans attracts 1.7million more listeners a week than Terry Wogan did .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A punk whose dramatic 'make under' was one of the most memorable to feature on BBC show Snog, Marry, Avoid has returned to her previous look - and is now planning her punk-themed wedding to her bodybuilder boyfriend. With her pink mohawk, pierced cheeks and leather outfits, Mel Wildman, 21, was one of the more extreme dressers to appear on the show. The tattooed woman was given a dramatic 'make under' - where she was stripped of her bold make up, studded outfits and numerous piercings. And the effect was stunning. Taken out of . her favourite leather jacket, the . artist from Morecambe, Lancashire, went from 'intimidating' to being flooded with . offers of marriage. Scroll down for video . From a punk to a lady: Mel Wildman was one of the more memorable individuals to appear on the BBC show Snog, Marry, Avoid - and was completely transformed for her 'make under' Ms Wildman was originally happy with her more conventional look, saying she felt 'like a lady' Ms Wildman claims she looked like her mum Jill, pictured here, after appearing on Snog, Marry or Avoid . Ms Wildman, an artist from Morecambe, decided her new look was not for her - saying she felt uncomfortable and felt as though she  'looked like her mother' in her more conventional dress . Ms Wildman looked phenomenal in a red dress, long curly-haired wig and subtle make up for the show, filmed in February 2013. The look was so dramatic that - a year later - her transformation is still a viral hit on the internet. A clip of the show on YouTube has gained over 1million hits - and has recently been picked up by a number of beauty bloggers. But despite saying she 'loved' the look when it was revealed on the show, Ms Wildman confirmed today she had returned to her previous punky style - saying she felt more comfortable as she was. Speaking to MailOnline, she said: 'I just thought it was more comfortable. I didn't feel comfortable or myself on the show. 'I liked the look, but I felt like I looked like my mother. I really liked the dress but I just felt so uncomfortable.' Ms Wildman, who has been with her partner Andy Bell (pictured) for 12 months, is now planning her wedding to the body builder - and says she wants to match her mohawk with her bridesmaids's dresses . Ms Wildman and Mr Bell, pictured, met shortly after she appeared on the show. Ms Wildman said her partner 'loves her the way she is' The 21-year-old, pictured recently, said today she does occasionally wear the wig featured in the show when she wants to be a bit more girly . Ms Wildman shows off her figure in one of her less punky looks . Writing online, she added: 'It is true that the tv . adds 10lbs! Haha! I kept my old look. Wasn't that extreme to begin . with!! Just had to bang extra makeup on for it since its telly :)' Ms Wildman said she does still wear the curly-haired wig when she wants to look 'a bit more girly.' 'Sometimes . I do want to be a bit more girly so I wear the wig and tone it down. I . keep my piercings in though - I just forget they are there now.' Ms Wildman lives with her bodybuilder partner Andy Bell, 47, in the small Lancashire town. Although the two are not engaged, the artist says the two will marry - and she's already planning her wedding. 'I . won't wear my leather jacket, no,' she said, 'I will wear a dress. But I . will probably match my mohawk to my bridesmaid's dresses. Maybe they'd . be pink.' The 21-year-old says her partner of a . year Mr Bell 'loves her just the way she is' and has no preference for what she wears. She added: 'Andy knows everyone in Morecambe. I think everyone knows who we are now as we do look a little bit different.' On the show, Ms Wildman spoke about her extreme look - and said she 'couldn't care less what people think'. This was despite the fact that her own . mother Jill said: 'People look at her as if she's scum. It just makes . me feel ashamed, sometimes.' But . today Ms Wildman revealed her look, which she has been wearing for about . six years, was an 'armour' she adopted because she was bullied at . school. The . artist described how she had a 'miserable' childhood where she was . bullied throughout primary and secondary education as a shy young woman. She said: 'I was always that little geek at the back of the classroom, always getting bullied. Must have been an easy target. 'I . was once beaten up for dropping a pencil on the floor. I was just . picked on. All the way through primary and secondary school. Mel loved her unique look but her parents were worried that people were judging her 'intimidating' look . The young woman, from Morecambe, said she had never worn clothing similar to the red lacy dress . 'I think I started dressing like this as a sort of armour.' Before . her make-under she said she was frightened of being . stripped of her 'fakery' - saying she couldn't remember a time when she . wasn't dressed in such an extreme fashion. But . the results were a pleasant surprise to her. Although she . initially said she felt 'naked'  without her piercings, she gasped 'oh . my God!' when she saw the results. She thanked the team who gave her the new look, saying: 'I've never seen myself like this before. 'It's like someone else in the mirror. I feel like a lady and feel like I look sexy.'

"By . Alasdair Glennie Tv Correspondent . Duncan Weldon (pictured) was the 'best candidate for the job' according to Newsnight editor Ian Katz, despite never having worked as a journalist before . Newsnight editor Ian Katz has defended his controversial new economics correspondent, insisting he was the ‘most suitable candidate’ for the job. Duncan Weldon, who starts work with the flagship BBC show next month, has come under fire for his strong links to the Left and the trade unions movement, as well as a youthful flirtation with the far Right. Others have questioned why he was preferred over more experienced candidates, given he has never worked as a journalist before. But in a letter Tory MP Andrew Bridgen - who had raised concerns about the appointment - Mr Katz said Mr Weldon’s ‘specialist expertise’ in economics was more important than his training as a reporter. He said: ‘Duncan was one of several candidates we considered who came from an economics rather than a conventional journalistic background…we believed a deep knowledge of economics was more important than journalistic experience for this role.’ He added: ‘It will certainly not be the first time that an individual’s communications skills and specialist expertise have made him or her the right choice despite a comparative lack of formal journalistic experience.’ Mr Weldon’s previous jobs include a stint as an adviser to Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman and time as an economist at the TUC. Last week, the Mail revealed he has penned hundreds of left-wing articles on his economics blog in which he consistently attacks Conservative economic policy. But Mr Katz – who is the former deputy editor of The Guardian – rejected concerns his political affiliations could affect his impartiality, saying: ‘It is a fact that BBC journalists are required to put any personal views to one side when employed by the Corporation’. He even described Mr Weldon’s blog as being ‘highly respected’, despite the concerns over its partisan content, and said it was considered to be ‘relevant experience’ when he was considered for the job. Last night, Mr Bridgen said Mr Katz’ letter failed to address his concerns about the appointment as he did not explain how many other candidates had been interviewed for the post. Mr Weldon is also the author of several left-wing blogs attacking the government, prompting fears the corporation is becoming biased against the Conservatives . He said: ‘There has been no transparency in this process and there are still more questions than answers. ‘Mr Weldon’s position is becoming increasingly untenable given he has admitted supporting the BNP in the past, and more recently has had strong ties to the left. ‘It is difficult to believe that someone with such strong beliefs is going to be impartial when he is conducting interviews on Newsnight. ‘How long is Ian Katz going to carry on defending him?’ In a recent blog post Mr Weldon admitted he had a ‘misguided flirtation with the ideas of the far Right’ when he was a teenager. He was also accused of taking part in a ‘racist’ BNP leafleting campaign before he rejected right-wing politics and joined the Labour party. A BBC spokesman said: ‘We are not going to comment on political affiliations of people in their teenage years whatever they may have been.’","Ian Katz has defended appointment of Duncan Weldon as economics editor .

"By . Alasdair Glennie Tv Correspondent . We should cut funding for opera and give more money to brass bands, the former head of the Arts Council said yesterday. Liz Forgan – who was in charge of the Government’s arts spending until last year – admitted organisations such as the Royal Opera House should be forced to raise more private money rather than rely on public funds. Perhaps surprisingly for a woman who presided over the nation’s cultural elite for four years, she even claimed to prefer the brass bands of working-class northern towns to the music of Verdi and Wagner. Money matters: The former head of the Arts Council Liz Forgan said funding for opera should be cut, and more money given to brass bands . She told the Commons culture, media and sport committee: ‘Brass bands can be as excellent as opera, no question. Indeed if you ask me, I’d rather listen to a brass band mostly. ‘The funding for opera is historic and extraordinary and it is an exception to all rules... It is completely bizarre and extraordinary.’ Earlier this month, Tory MP Philip Davies – whose constituency is in Shipley, west Yorkshire - revealed brass bands only received £1.8million in Arts Council funding over the past five years, compared with £347million for opera. He asked Dame Liz why brass bands were considered to be an inferior art form, and whether opera should be forced to raise more money on its own. She agreed that although the Royal Opera House, in London’s Covent Garden, was a ‘beacon of excellence’, it could survive with less money. She said: If I was left to myself I would fund early and late opera, I wouldn’t fund the middle at all. I have 19th century opera. So I would fund Handel and Britten. That would be much cheaper. Beacon: Dame Liz agreed that although the Royal Opera House, in London's Covent Garden, was a 'beacon of excellence', it could survive with less money . Tradition: Dame Liz said she preferred the brass bands of working-class northern towns, such as the one depicted in 1996 film Brassed Off, to the music of Verdi and Wagner . ‘It is capable of raising a very great deal of private money and the more pressure that is put on the Royal Opera House in particular to raise that money privately is good policy.’ She said it would be impossible to spend the opera budget all on brass bands, but added: ‘You probably could put the squeeze on Covent Garden a bit more.’ Dame Liz was appointed chairman of the Arts Council in 2009 but was asked to step down by former Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt. She was criticised last year for spending £8,130 of public money on her leaving party at the British Museum. The Arts Council reclassified the event as a lecture in an already approved part of its budget.","Former Arts Council head Liz Forgan says opera funding should be cut .

Mrs Osbourne has openly spoken of spending a fortune on cosmetic surgery since her first operation, a breast reduction and lift, in 1978.

"By . Alasdair Glennie Tv Correspondent . The BBC has admitted overpaying one in eight of its employees and allowing the wage bill for junior staff to soar by £35million in three years. While the Corporation repeatedly boasts that it is cutting back on top-level salaries, new figures show it has simultaneously allowed its middle management to become increasingly bloated. Thousands of employees now earn more than they are entitled to under the BBC’s own pay grade system, leading to accusations it is allowing costs to spiral out of control. Confession: The BBC has admitted overpaying one in eight of its employees and allowing the wage bill for junior staff to soar by £35million in three years. Above, the Corporation's headquarters in White City, West London . Figures released under the Freedom of Information act show 2,164 of its 17,447 staff earn more than their pay grade allows. Critics suggested the practice of overpaying middle managers and more junior staff allows the Corporation to boast it is cutting senior posts while continuing to pay inflated salaries. Last night Tory MP Angie Bray, who sits on the Commons culture, media and sport committee, said the figures show the BBC is ‘never knowingly underpaid’. She added: ‘I honestly find it extraordinary that the BBC is breaking its own rules on pay. We had been led to believe it was only a handful of staff at the top who were being overpaid. Now it seems the rot runs much deeper.’ Surprised: Last night Tory MP Angie Bray said the new figures show the BBC is 'never knowingly underpaid' The BBC divides its staff into 18 pay bands. The top two, which include senior managers and top presenters, have seen their numbers slashed after director general Tony Hall vowed to cut the proportion of executives to around one per cent of the workforce. Between 2009 and 2013 the number of senior managers was reduced from 640 to 429, although a further 216 jobs need to go to hit the target. But the amount spent on lower levels has risen. The pay bill for employees on the rung . below senior management – known as ‘band 11’ – increased by a fifth to . £65.5million in the past three years. Of them, 61 per cent are given more than the salary ceiling of £73,888. The next rung down includes 1,325 staff, including many of the BBC’s on-air journalists. ‘Band 10’ cost the BBC almost £97million in 2012/13. Almost half of those were paid more than the agreed salary ceiling of £66,460. The BBC denied that it is simply reclassifying senior managers at a lower grade but giving them the same pay to artificially reduce executive numbers.

'While these salary bands are internal guidelines only, we have consistently reduced the number of staff earning outside the guided amount since 2010 in these grades,' the spokesman said. 'However, there continues to be members of staff who possess a skill-set that commands a higher market premium than the guide for their grade.'","The Corporation has admitted overpaying one in eight of its employees .

"By . Alasdair Glennie Tv Correspondent . Under fire: The BBC's new economics correspondent Duncan Weldon has admitted he has flirted with the far Right . His impartiality has already been questioned because of his Left-wing politics and links to the trade union movement. Now the BBC’s new economics correspondent – also under fire for a relative lack of journalistic experience – has admitted he has flirted with the far Right. Duncan Weldon, who starts work with flagship current affairs show Newsnight next month, has been accused of taking part in a racist leafleting campaign organised by the British National Party. After being confronted over the allegations, he wrote a blog post admitting he had a ‘misguided  flirtation with the ideas of the far Right’ as a teenager. However an article Mr Weldon wrote for his student newspaper in Oxford has also emerged in which he admitted having been a fascist and argued it was ‘possible to hold extreme Right-wing views… without being a racist or homophobe’. In his blog on Saturday, he denied having joined any Right-wing political party or attending any meetings but admitted: ‘This chapter of my teenage life was witless and intensely embarrassing and I compounded the idiocy with a boastful and ill-judged piece of student journalism a few years later.’ He said his teenage rebellion  was ‘pretty tame’ and consisted  mainly of reading about British fascist Oswald Mosley. Mr Weldon now faces calls to quit his new post after he was accused of taking part in a banned BNP campaign in 2000, suggesting he may have downplayed his links to the Right. A report in the Mail on Sunday revealed he helped distribute scaremongering leaflets suggesting that a London council wanted to rehome 16,000 asylum seekers in Newcastle and saying this would lead to riots and ‘whites living in fear’. BNP leader Nick Griffin was later forced to apologise for the campaign, organised by self-confessed racist Kevin Scott. In another student article, written under the false name Sam Healey, Mr Weldon reportedly admitted taking part in a number of BNP events and handing out ‘decidedly racist’ leaflets. He also said he attended a demonstration of around 200 members at which protesters clashed with the police. Past: In a student article, written under the false name Sam Healey, Mr Weldon reportedly admitted taking part in a number of BNP events . In the article he added: ‘I don’t know if my parents ever suspected, but most of my friends at home knew. They were incredibly relieved when I stopped attending meetings.’ The revelations come after Mr Weldon’s BBC appointment was questioned because of his Left-wing views and relative lack of journalistic experience. A former adviser to Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman and economist at the Trades Union Congress, he has written hundreds of Left-wing blogs attacking Conservative policy. Mr Weldon said he was ‘confident’ he would be able to leave his political views aside once he starts at the BBC. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Mr Weldon is a highly respected professional who has assured us he has not been a member of  the BNP.’ Mr Weldon claimed that he joined the Labour Party after he became disillusioned by far-Right politics. He said his student article, published in the Cherwell newspaper, embellished his ‘far Right adventure’ because he was keen to impress his fellow peers. Writing in his blog this weekend, he added: ‘Among the many lines in it that now make me wince with embarrassment was the opening one: “Like a lot of bad things this started with the Tory party”. ‘I suspect I may be reminded of that line a few times in the coming months.’ Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who has already written to the BBC questioning Mr Weldon’s suitability for the role, said: ‘Given the revelations about his secret BNP past, it is clear Mr Weldon is unsuitable for a position in our national broadcaster.'","Duncan Weldon starts work with flagship show Newsnight next month .

"By . Alasdair Glennie Tv Correspondent . Martin Amis, pictured with wife Isabel Fonesca, has been criticised for his comments, with one psychologist calling them 'soul-destroying' Martin Amis has been accused of ‘glorifying sexual violence’ after he said women secretly love being ‘ravished’ by men. The writer claimed that English novels from the 18th century catered for ‘female fantasies’  because the heroines only ever had sex if they had been drugged. He says women friends have told him it was a ‘good fantasy’ to have because ‘if you enjoy it it’s not your fault’. His comments were immediately seized on by critics, who accused him of perpetuating the myth that women enjoy such encounters. They also said he was contributing to a culture in which sexual violence was seen as normal. Amis, 64, who was nominated for the Bad Sex award in 2012 for a section in his novel The Pregnant Widow, made his comments in an interview for  the BBC4 show Martin  Amis’s England. They appear in this week’s Radio Times before the programme screens this Sunday. Discussing the development of the English novel since the 18th century, he said: ‘In that formative period of the English novel, the only way that a heroine can have sex is by being drugged and that ties in with fantasies, female fantasies of being ravished. ‘I talked to women about this and they said, it is a good fantasy, especially when you’re young, because if you enjoy it, it’s not your fault.’ Amis said in later novels, women of the lower classes and decadent society ladies are allowed to have sex, but heroines are not. He said the only exception is Elizabeth Bennet in Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, adding: ‘It’s perfectly clear that she is far and away the most sexual of Jane Austen’s heroines.’ Last night, clinical psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos said she was ‘horrified’ by the writer’s remarks. ‘I find these kind of comments soul-destroying, as a woman and as a mother,’ she said. ‘This is the kind of thing you see in porn all the time. Women are depicted as objects at the whim of men’s desires. ‘Men are brought up not to take no for an answer when it comes to sex. Several of Amis's novels - including The Pregnant Widow and The Rachel Papers - have been criticised for lurid sex scenes and he was nominated for the Bad Sex Award in 2012 . ‘They are encouraged to think that if they push harder, women will enjoy their advances. Martin Amis’s comments just reinforce that view. 'He makes sexual violence seem normal, even desirable. It is sending out an awful message, not least to young men.’ A spokesman for Rape Crisis said last night: ‘If the implication is that women enjoy being raped, that’s of course incredibly unhelpful myth-peddling and potentially not just offensive but distressing to the large numbers of sexual violence survivors who’ll inevitably read the Radio Times interview.’ Amis made the comments in his show Marti Amis's England which were printed in this week's Radio Times . Several of Amis’s own novels – including The Pregnant Widow and his 1973 book The Rachel Papers – have been criticised for lurid sex scenes, which are mainly written from a male point of view. In 2012, the author admitted that he thought women were better at writing about sex than men, because men often felt inadequate about their own performance. At the time, he said: ‘I’d say the reason why women write better about sex – which is almost impossible to write about and no one has done it very well, ever – is that as a novelist you are in a God-like relation to what  you create. 'You are omnipotent and the question of potency is embarrassing for men.’ Amis is married to American heiress and writer Isabel Fonseca, who is his second wife. He has credited her with finally bringing an end to his womanising ways, and the pair have two teenage children together, Fernanda and Clio. In June 2011, Amis moved to New York with his family to be closer to her parents as well as his best friend, the writer Christopher Hitchens, who has since died of cancer. They now live in the Cobble Hill area of Brooklyn. Sir Kingsley Amis had 'erotic dreams' about the Queen according to his son Martin . Martin Amis has told how his novelist father Sir Kingsley had ‘erotic dreams’ about the Queen. He said the celebrated author, who died in 1995, had been ‘very keen’ on the monarch. ‘My father used to hang out with the Queen a bit, went to lunch there several times and he was knighted by her,’ he said. ‘He was very keen on her and even used to have erotic dreams about her.’ Discussing class and the monarchy for a BBC4 show, Amis also claimed the Royal Family is ‘nearing the end of the road’. Praising . the monarchy’s ‘remarkable quality’, he added: ‘It’s connected with our . love of Upstairs, Downstairs, those country-house dramas, it’s . nostalgia for that class society.’ Amis . also revealed that his father – who won the Booker Prize in 1986 for . The Old Devils – had spoken in a ‘lah-di-dah way’ in a bid to sound . smarter. And he said class in the UK was now replaced by money.‘If you put your son’s name down for Eton it’s because you can afford to,’ he said.","Martin Amis made the remarks while speaking about early novels .

"By . Alasdair Glennie Tv Correspondent . TV presenter Noel Edmonds is preparing to buy the BBC with the backing of a group of wealthy investors to save it from ‘inevitable disaster’, he claimed yesterday. The former BBC star – who now hosts Deal or No Deal on Channel 4 – said renewing the corporation’s current licence fee agreement would be ‘as futile as giving medicine to a corpse.’ Instead, he wants to turn it into a not-for-profit broadcaster run along commercial lines and slim down its ‘bloated’ bureaucracy. Noel Edmonds rose to fame when he started out as a DJ on BBC Radio 1 - but now he has his sights set on a promotion after he has said that he would now like to part-own the corporation . The 65-year-old said he has assembled a group of rich backers under the name Project Reith, after the corporation’s first director general Lord Reith. He insisted they ‘could and would pay’ the market price of the BBC, as calculated by a team of advisers and former BBC executives. He said that finding the money to buy the corporation would not be a problem.’ Writing in The Sunday Times, Mr Edmonds said that he had meetings with business people across the globe and they all believed that a business model could be found to save the BBC. He said: ‘Believe me, these people can make it happen. If ailing British companies such as Rolls-Royce, Land Rover, British Airways and Cadbury can be turned around, there is still hope for the BBC.’ Mr Edmonds first found fame on BBC Radio 1 before hosting TV shows including Top Of The Pops and Noel's Hose Party. But he quit in 1999, publicly criticising the corporation’s management culture. In the past, he has refused to pay the licence fee in protest at the ‘threatening’ way in which it is collected. Yesterday, the star claimed the BBC could face a mass ‘licence fee revolt’ and could collapse if just five per cent of households refused to pay the £145.50 annual charge. Noel Edmonds blasted the 'bloated bureaucracy' at the BBC but said that there is still hope for the organisation . He said that he believes people 'deserve better' than the current organisation. 'BBC management has pursued an expansionist strategy that defies logic and the founding laws of commerce,' he said. He blasted the organisation for purchasing new buildings rather than focusing on quality television. My Edmonds declined to say how much it would cost to buy out the BBC, although experts have said its commercial arm, BBC Worldwide, is worth about £2billion alone. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Long-term polling shows that the licence fee is the funding method with single most backing and it’s been rising. ‘Support for the licence fee is at 53% - way ahead of subscription and advertising. It’s the top choice for funding the BBC across all ages, classes and whether you are in a Freeview, Virgin or Sky household.’","Television presenter claims he has backing of investors across the globe .

Channel 4’s controversial Benefits Street documentary has now received more than 1,700 complaints as one of its stars was charged with drug and firearms offences. The broadcaster and TV watchdog Ofcom have been deluged with calls, letters and emails from viewers who accused the five-part documentary of glamourising crime, promoting drug use and celebrating welfare dependency. Yesterday it emerged one of the core participants - Samora Roberts, known in the show as ‘Black Dee’ - will face prosecution for a string of charges alongside five of her neighbours. The 32-year-old - who was also arrested last week for allegedly stealing a packet of condoms from a branch of Boots - has been charged with conspiracy to supply class A and class B drugs including crack cocaine, possession of class A drug diamorphine and possession of firearm ammunition without a certificate. West Midlands Police raided her house on the now infamous James Turner Street in Birmingham last June. She will appear at Birmingham Magistrates Court on February 6 alongside other residents, including Benefits Street co-star Charlene Wilson, 29.

"By . Alasdair Glennie Tv Correspondent . BBC news chief James Harding hit back at critics who suggested the Corporation was to blame for a decline in local newspaper sales . The BBC’s news chief has denied claims the corporation is destroying local newspapers with its  publicly funded free websites. In his first public speech since being put in charge of the BBC’s 5,000 journalists, James Harding hit back at critics such as Home Secretary Theresa May, saying they were ‘mistaken’. In November, Tory MPs accused the BBC of undermining local democracy by competing with print titles and called for it to close some of its news websites. But Mr Harding – who is the former editor of The Times – said online rivals such as Google and Facebook, rather than the BBC, were to blame for declining local newspaper sales. Despite promising to ‘do anything to help’ struggling competitors, he insisted the BBC would not ‘rein in its local news coverage’. Giving the WT Stead lecture at the British Library on Monday he said: ‘There is what I consider to be a mistaken view that the BBC should rein in its local news coverage for fear of aggravating the economic woes facing local newspapers. 'We have a direct interest in the health of local newspapers and regional newsrooms. 'We thrive thanks to vibrant public debate and courtesy of the stories and ideas unearthed by our colleagues in rival news organisations. 'But, let me be clear, the problems facing the local newspaper industry are not the BBC’s fault.’ In the past year, the BBC’s news output has been attacked by a series of senior politicians for biased reporting. Conservative chairman Grant Shapps warned that the licence fee could be cut if the corporation’s output is not made more impartial. In November, Mrs May said the BBC’s local websites were ‘dangerous for local politics’, adding: ‘It’s destroying local newspapers and could eventually happen to national newspapers as well…the BBC has to think carefully about its presence locally and the impact it has on local democracy.’ Home Secretary Theresa May said the BBC's local websites were 'dangerous for local politics' while Conservative chairman Grant Shapps warned the licence fee could be cut if the Corporation's output is not made more impartial . But Mr Harding hit back, saying: ‘I worry when politicians and judges weigh in, either frequently or eagerly, on the behaviour of journalists and news organisations. ‘At a time when our society needs curious, inquisitive journalism more than ever, I think we need to be extremely vigilant against encroachment on press freedom and freedom of expression.’ He added: ‘The local newspaper industry’s problems lie with the likes of Google, Facebook, Amazon, Gumtree, Ebay and a long, long tail of others. 'I am acutely concerned by the pressures facing the local newspaper industry and we at the BBC will do anything to help. ‘But the BBC’s primary responsibility must be to serve licence fee payers – and they want and are entitled to the best possible local news services we can deliver.’","News chief said Google and Facebook were to blame for decline .

"By . Alasdair Glennie Tv Correspondent . The row over the BBC’s Left-wing bias escalated last night after it emerged that its latest recruit has written hundreds of blogs attacking Government policy. Senior Tories are furious that Duncan Weldon, a former adviser to Harriet Harman and economist at the TUC, has been made economics correspondent of Newsnight despite little experience as a journalist. He is the latest in a series of Left-wing appointments at the BBC – including Newsnight editor Ian Katz and former Labour Cabinet minister James Purnell – prompting concerns that the corporation is becoming increasingly biased against the Conservatives. Newsnight, the BBC current affairs programme fronted by Jeremy Paxman (pictured) has hired Duncan Weldon as its new economics expert despite him writing a series of left-wing blogs attacking Conservative policy . John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons culture, media and sport committee, said there were question marks about Mr Weldon’s ability to report objectively given his strong political beliefs. Noel Edmonds says he and a group of wealthy investors want to buy the BBC to save it from ‘inevitable disaster’. The presenter proposes to run it along commercial lines, saying yesterday that renewing the corporation’s licence fee agreement would be ‘as futile as giving medicine to a corpse’. Edmonds, 65, who used to work for the BBC but now hosts Deal Or No Deal on Channel 4 – said his group was willing to pay the fair market price of the BBC and would slim down its bloated bureaucracy. ‘If ailing British companies such as Rolls-Royce, Land Rover, British Airways and Cadbury can be turned around, there is still hope for the BBC,’ he wrote in The Sunday Times. ‘The long-suffering British people deserve better. BBC management has pursued an expansionist strategy that defies logic and the founding laws of commerce.’ ‘It is extremely important that whoever holds that position is seen to be both qualified and objective,’ he said. ‘There are certainly question marks raised in both those areas about this appointment.’ Tory MP Angie Bray, who also sits on the culture, media and sport committee, said: ‘There is a one-way street between the Left-wing and the BBC. 'This appointment is the equivalent of sticking two fingers up at those who are concerned about Left-wing bias.’ Over the past few years, Mr Weldon has made clear his hostility towards the Coalition’s spending cuts. He has written a string of blogs on Left-wing websites, including LabourList, Left Foot Forward, the Fabian Society and the Guardian, repeatedly praising Labour leader Ed Miliband and criticising Chancellor George Osborne. In one, he accused Mr Osborne of being ‘hyper-political’ and said his economic record was ‘disastrous’. Despite signs that the economy is recovering, Mr Weldon has not moderated his hostility. Last month he dismissed improvements in the labour market, arguing: ‘There are causes for concern beneath the headlines.’ Concern has been raised at Mr Weldon’s lack of qualifications – he has never reported on economics nor worked in television. Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘It will be extremely interesting to see how someone who helped formulate TUC and Labour economic policy can report on it objectively. Mr Wledon, who has limited journalism experience, was former adviser to Labour politician Harriet Harman . ‘I’m not sure what broadcasting experience Duncan Weldon has but it must be very good for the BBC to risk the objectivity of its flagship news and  current affairs programme.’ Mr Katz insisted he interviewed ‘at least ten’ candidates for the role but refused to say whether the BBC had encouraged Mr Weldon apply. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Duncan’s economic commentary is widely respected on all sides of the political spectrum as fair and intelligent. BBC journalists do not bring political views to work and Duncan will be no different.’","Duncan Weldon hired as new economics expert for BBC's Newsnight .

"By . Alasdair Glennie Tv Correspondent . Nearly half a million TV viewers avoid paying the licence fee every year by only watching BBC content online, it has emerged. The corporation has admitted that up to two per cent of all households exploit a legal loophole that permits them to catch up on their favourite shows on BBC iPlayer for free. And although households are technically required to buy a £145.50 licence if they watch live broadcasts on tablets or computers, it is thought many avoid detection because the BBC is unable to monitor who is watching on the internet. Up to two per cent of all households exploit a legal loophole that permits them to catch up on their favourite shows on BBC iPlayer for free . Critics said the figures prove the licence fee is now ‘out of date’, and even the BBC admitted its current funding model creates ‘perverse incentives’ that encourage viewers to use its catch-up service instead of watching live. As director general Tony Hall pushes ahead with an ambitious £100million a year plan to put even more of the BBC’s content online, some suggested the Government will have to rethink the entire licence fee arrangement when it renews the BBC charter in 2016. Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘The model for the licence fee is long out of date thanks to technological advances. It’s time to reform this out of date tax so as to ease the burden it places on households while ensuring the BBC has a fair and sustainable source of funding.’ Writing to the Commons culture, media and . sport committee – which is conducting an inquiry into the corporation’s . future – the BBC this week admitted its licence fee arrangements may . need to be modernised to keep up with new  technology. 'We don't pay a television licence - he watches next door's telly' It said: ‘The licence fee definition remains robust, with only 1-2 per cent of households consuming exclusively on-demand content and so not requiring a licence fee. ‘However, the definition could start to create perverse incentives, with a fee payable for some ways of consuming BBC TV but not others. ‘We would welcome discussing this issue with the committee to consider whether and when the licence fee should be modernised again.’ Given there are 26.4million households in the UK, the BBC’s admission means that as many as 528,000 could be evading the licence fee by using the catch-up loophole. Last year, 428,359 signed official declarations saying they did not need a TV licence. Viewers are only required to buy a licence if they watch live broadcasts, regardless of whether they own a television set or not. However, the BBC has no access to data from internet providers that would enable it to identify the names and addresses of those who watch its programmes live online, meaning it is virtually impossible to track down those who do so without paying. A BBC spokesman insisted ‘we can and do prosecute people watching TV on equipment other than TV sets’. However, in reply to a request by the Daily Mail, the corporation said it was unable to provide any statistics on the number or frequency of such prosecutions. BBC iPlayer is increasingly popular with viewers, receiving more than 242million hits a month, with 25 per cent coming from tablet computers. The corporation has also experimented with showing some programmes – including all BBC3 scripted comedy – on iPlayer before airing them on terrestrial TV. A TV Licensing spokesperson said: ‘Our enforcement approach enables us to catch and prosecute people watching live TV online. Well under 2 per cent of households watch only catch up TV so don’t need a licence. ‘Households declaring they do not need a TV Licence have remained stable for the past three years. ‘Reasons a licence may not be required include if the address is unoccupied, if no TV receiving equipment is being used, if a TV is used only to watch DVDs, or if only catch up services are used.’","Up to 2% of households exploit loophole that allows them to watch for free .

Leaving: BBC arts presenter Mark Lawson has announced he is leaving Radio 4's Front Row programme after 16 years for 'personal reasons' BBC arts presenter Mark Lawson has announced he is leaving Radio 4’s Front Row programme after 16 years for ‘personal reasons’. His surprise departure comes just a month after the station’s arts unit, which makes the programme, was embroiled in a bullying row although is not known whether the events are connected. In a statement today, the 51-year-old said: ‘The BBC and I have agreed that I should step down as presenter of Front Row and for personal reasons I shall be taking a break from live daily radio journalism.’ He added: ‘It has been an extraordinary experience and privilege to work on the programme for 16 years and I very much hope to be able to return to work on Radio 4 in the future.’ Mr Lawson’s decision to step down was met with surprise by Front Row’s listeners yesterday. Since the flagship evening programme started in 1998, Mr Lawson claims he has conducted more than 3,000 interviews, many of them with celebrities such as Dame Helen Mirren, Robert De Niro and Woody Allen. A new series of the presenter’s BBC Four interview show, Mark Lawson Talks To..., is scheduled to start next week. Today, a BBC spokesman confirmed his departure, saying: ‘He has been away from the programme for a month on medical advice. 'Front Row will continue to be presented by John Wilson and Kirsty Lang, alongside other guest presenters such as Tom Sutcliffe.’ Success: Since the flagship programme started in 1998, Mr Lawson claims he has conducted more than 3,000 interviews. Above, the presenter (right) is pictured with author James Ellroy at London's Southbank Centre . Guests: He has interviewed the likes of actress Dame Helen Mirren (left) and U.S. actor Robert de Niro (right) The controller of Radio 4, Gwyneth Williams, added: ‘Mark has been an outstanding presenter of Front Row and we hope to work with him again in the future on Radio 4.’ Today, BBC news reports about Mr Lawson’s departure prominently mentioned bullying complaints at the BBC’s Radio Arts Unit, which makes programmes including Front Row, Saturday Review and The Film Programme. However, there has been no suggestion Mr Lawson was involved in the incidents in any way and the BBC has refused to comment on the allegations. Venture: A new series of the presenter's BBC Four interview show, Mark Lawson Talks To..., starts next week . Filming: Above, Mr Lawson began his career as a TV critic for the Catholic newspaper The Universe in 1984. Above, the presenter is pictured in Washington, U.S., recording the BBC 2 programme, The Clinton Complex . In January, it was revealed the corporation had launched an investigation after 15 members of staff at the arts unit accused a presenter and a producer of bullying. An email from the corporation’s human resources department reportedly said there were allegations of ‘a culture of bullying and a failure of management to protect staff’, although it did not name any individuals accused of bullying. Last year, director general Tony Hall pledged a ‘zero tolerance’ approach to bullying following a damaging report by Dinah Rose QC in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. Co-stars: Front Row will continue to be presented by John Wilson (left) and Kirsty Lang (right), said the BBC . Mr Lawson, who studied English at University College London, began his career as a TV critic for the Catholic newspaper The Universe in 1984 before moving to the Sunday Times and then the Independent. He went into television by making a series of one-off arts documentaries before he was hired by BBC Radio 4 when it rebranded its arts show from Kaleidoscope to Front Row in 1998. In 2010, actor Russell Crowe stormed out of the Front Row studio after Mr Lawson suggested the new Zealander’s accent in the film Robin Hood sounded Irish.","Mark Lawson quits Radio 4's Front Row programme for 'personal reasons'

"By . Alasdair Glennie Tv Correspondent . The BBC has been condemned for paying its staff up to £150,000 each to move to its new base in Salford without keeping a full record of who authorised the sums. In a report published today, the public accounts committee of MPs said many of the allowances, which totaled £24million, were ‘excessive’ and ‘difficult to justify’ to licence fee payers. In total, the corporation has spent £942million setting up a new northern base to help redress a perceived ‘imbalance’ in its coverage, but has had to offer 900 staff an average of £28,000 each to persuade them to move. 'Difficult to justify': The BBC has been condemned for paying its staff up to £150,000 each to move to its new base in Salford Quays (pictured), Greater Manchester, without recording who authorised the sums . Last night, the PAC’s chairman Margaret Hodge praised the BBC for moving to Salford on time, but condemned its financial management saying: ‘The scale of some of the allowances paid to staff to relocate to Salford is difficult to justify. ‘There were 11 cases where the cost of relocating staff exceeded £100,000 per person, with one costing £150,000. 'And it is not acceptable that the BBC also failed to make a proper record of the exceptions it made to its allowance policy.’ The PAC report said the BBC Trust acknowledged that ‘some of the individual relocation packages involved ‘huge’ amounts of money that would aggravate licence fee payers’. Critical: The PAC's chairman Margaret Hodge has condemned the corporation's financial management . It found around ten per cent of staff were granted more than they were entitled to under the BBC’s standard allowance, but failed to keep a full record of why these exceptions were granted. Miss Hodge said the failure to keep proper records was ‘not acceptable’. The report follows a damning study by the National Audit Office published in May, which found the BBC’s financial oversight was ‘inadequate’. Relocation perks offered to BBC staff included a guaranteed minimum price on their old home if they sold it and moved north. They could also claim a two-year ‘remote location allowance’ worth £1,900 a month to cover the cost of travel and renting a property in Salford if they were unwilling to commit to move north. Among those taking advantage of the generous offer is BBC Breakfast presenter Susannah Reid, who makes the 200-mile commute three times a week at licence fee payers’ expense. Other staff were offered a one off payment of £5,000 to help them move, while homeowners could claim £3,000 towards household goods. Despite the huge expense of moving to Salford, the BBC does not own its new office space or studios. Instead, it rents them from real estate giant the Peel Group. The PAC raised concerns about the 10-year arrangement, saying the BBC could risk locking itself into making payments for buildings it may not use. It also warned the corporation risked damaging its reputation by associating itself with the company, which was accused of avoiding corporation tax earlier this year. The Peel Group has always denied the allegations. The PAC said: ‘The BBC needs to . demonstrate to the BBC Trust that it has assessed the potential risks of . the Peel Group having a dominant position at its Salford site and taken . appropriate steps to address them. Fortunate: Among those taking advantage of the generous offer is BBC Breakfast presenter Susannah Reid, who makes the 200-mile commute three times a week at licence fee payers' expense . ‘It should also make clear its expectation that, as an organisation funded by the licence fee, it expects companies with which it contracts to pay their fair share of tax.’ It added: added: ‘The BBC’s relationships with the Peel Group and other partner organisations involve potential reputational risks, for example, regarding the extent to which partner organisations are transparent about their tax status in the UK and the amount of tax they pay.’ Miss Hodge said her committee would report later in the year on another case of BBC financial mismanagement, the Digital Media Initiative. The disastrous project was scrapped earlier this year at a cost of £100million. She said: ‘We are dismayed at the abandonment of the BBC’s Digital Media Initiative at a cost to the licence fee payer of £100 million. 'There have been conflicting reports from the BBC and the BBC Trust on what the project did or did not deliver.

"By . Alasdair Glennie Tv Correspondent . Whatever you do, don’t try this at home. While the BBC might think it’s a bright DIY idea, sawing the top off an old rusty gas canister to create a custom-made light fitting just happens to be illegal - and highly dangerous... and potentially fatal. Renovators Ruth and Tony Lawrence’s idea was described as ‘a fantastic example of homespun  creativity’ on BBC2 show The House That £100k Built. The canister was owned by gas company Calor, which yesterday condemned the . programme, broadcast at 8pm on Wednesday October 2. Scroll down for video . Renovator Tony Lawrence was praised for his 'innovation' for turning a gas canister into a lampshade on The House That £100k Built but Calor Gas said the process is illegal and can be fatal . A spokesman for Calor Gas said residue gas in the canister can explode when the metal is cut. By law, all empty canisters must be disposed of by qualified technicians. The programme gained an audience of 1.9million people who watched TV architect Piers Taylor encourage the couple to salvage junk from their Shropshire farmyard and put it to use indoors. The pair were trying to build a new home . for under £100,000 to replace their crumbling farmhouse, and were . understandably glad to save on the cost of expensive light fittings. Mr Lawrence was soon seen . enthusiastically chopping the top off a large gas canister with a . circular saw, sending sparks flying around his feet. Calor Gas said residue gas in the canister can explode when the metal is cut and branded BBC 'irresponsible' He later proudly showed off his new improvised light shades to the TV cameras. As the show’s narrator . said: ‘Their low-cost solutions are a fantastic examples of homespun . creativity and Tony’s prized cylinder lights are a great statement.’ ‘We can’t believe the BBC and Endemol would be so irresponsible. I hope their insurance is good. This isn’t so much DIY, more DYI – Do Yourself In' - Calor Gas spokesman . But . it seems nobody in the programme - produced by independent company . Endemol - realised just how close Mr Lawrence came to a nasty accident. Experts said sawing canisters is potentially lethal as residue gas can be ignited by sparks caused by cutting the metal. Last year, a 48-year-old man from . Oxfordshire was killed when he tried to turn an old gas cylinder into a . barbecue. It exploded as he used an angle-grinder to cut open the . 40-gallon drum. In 2011, the health and Safety Executive . fined a building company £2,000 after an employee suffered extensive . burns while cutting open an empty canister. Spokesman Paul Blacklock said: ‘Not only is sawing open a gas canister unlawful, it is also highly dangerous. ‘Decommissioning one of our gas canisters is an extremely hazardous process which should only be carried out by qualified technicians, in specialist facilities and by the bottled gas company that always own the cylinder - in this case Calor. The custom-made lampshade. The BBC has since removed the segment from repeats of the show . ‘Given that someone killed themselves last year trying to convert an oil drum into a BBQ, the chances of someone getting hurt, indeed fatally, are extremely high. ‘We can’t believe the BBC and Endemol would be so irresponsible. I hope their insurance is good. ‘This isn’t so much DIY, more DYI – Do Yourself In.’ After it was alerted to the dangerous segment the BBC removed it from last week’s episode. A spokesman for the programme said: ‘The episode of October 2, 2013, with Tony and Ruth featured a short section on the reuse of gas cylinders. Cautionary lines were included in the programme warning viewers that any modification of found objects needs to be carried out safely. ‘As soon as we were made aware that the cylinders remained the property of the gas company the programme was taken down from the BBC iPlayer.  We have also amended the programme for any further repeat.’","Shown on BBC2's The House That £100k Built .

"By . Jan Moir . Felicity Cloake has just made a batch of chocolate chip cookies. They are luxurious yet light, as big as hockey pucks, completely scrumptious and oh yes, I'd love another, thank you. However, according to Felicity, they're not perfect. Repeat, not perfect. Felicity Cloake takes inspiration from other celebrity chefs then makes the recipe her own . 'I chopped the chocolate far too much,' she says. She pours a cup of excellent coffee and pushes it across her kitchen table. The coffee is not perfect, either. 'It's not Fairtrade,' she sighs. 'I feel slightly guilty about that. I fight a battle every time I go to the supermarket.' Such standards! Yet perhaps we should expect nothing less from the woman known as the Perfect Cook. In her three cookbooks and her newspaper and magazine columns, Felicity's mission is to rigorously test established recipes to find the best elements. She then uses these to produce the perfect dish, using the expertise from established cookery authors. She does this with a quiet authority one can only admire. 'People get touchy about others offering advice on how to cook. You set yourself up with a high bar when you call something perfect. It makes you anxious about everything.' She is 31, with a scrubbed face and uncomplicated hair. She oozes trustworthiness the way a figgy pudding oozes spicy fumes. When she read English at St Peter's College, Oxford, she had no idea she'd end up winning awards as a food writer and become the go-to cook for the best way to make coffee and walnut cake or beef stew. 'I'm not a trained cook,' she says. 'I certainly couldn't say I was an expert chef. But I would say that I'm a moderately good cook for the amount of practice I've had. And I've had an awful lot of practice. Five years of cooking relentlessly.' It is her meticulous approach that sets Felicity apart. Each week she selects a dish, then sources five or six recipes for it from her collection of over 200 cookbooks. Her library includes titles from Elizabeth David, Simon Hopkinson, Nigel Slater, Delia Smith, Jamie Oliver and Nigella. Felicity doesn't make much of Nigella's tiramisu . Then, in her ordinary kitchen with her four-burner hob and 'bog-standard' domestic fan oven, she rigorously tests these recipes. Finally, taking the best elements from each, she will create a master recipe. Recent triumphs include clam chowder (thicken with flour, not crackers), coffee and walnut cake (Nigel's is better than Nigella's) and tiramisu (Jamie Oliver adds orange, Felicity does not approve). To this end, her life is spent cooking and shopping, then doing more shopping before cooking. From the three-storey townhouse in Islington, north London, which she shares with barrister boyfriend Richard and her dog, a cairn terrier called Wilf, she sallies forth with empty bags and returns laden. When I visit, she's made six batches of goulash, concluding that shin of beef is the best cut to use, as recommended by Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. The house pulsates with the rich aroma of paprika and lard, while the fridge is crammed with tubs of goulash. The thing that bothers her most is the wastage. What can you do with six goulashes? 'Last night, Richard almost rebelled. 'He said to me, “Not goulash again!” I said, “Come on, man up! We've got to get through this. Me and the dog can't eat it all.” I mean, look at Wilf. That's why he's a little bit fat.' Felicity's new cookbook, Perfect Too, has 92 recipes that have gone through her strict tests. It's an entertaining read, even if you've never picked up a saucepan in your life. However, she likes to choose recipes that 'most people who cook a bit will know something about'. Over the next three weeks, some of them will be serialised in Weekend, including tarte au citron and beef Wellington. The kind of straightforward grub that's popular and delicious is Felicity's speciality. Everything is subjective, she feels, but there are a few recipes she thinks she finessed until they were spot on. 'A ragu Bolognese, which I think is pretty perfect. A moussaka I thought I really cracked.' But she's not dictatorial and says authenticity can be overrated. 'If it works for you, go for it.' Neither is she a slavish respecter of culinary reputations. For her, it's all about what works. She's not afraid to suggest Delia might have got it wrong, or Elizabeth David's recipes are too underpowered for the modern palate. She also dismisses the efforts of Pippa Middleton. 'I haven't used her recipes, although I'm sure they're wonderful. I did see her book in the Oxfam shop window and I contemplated going in and buying it but I had the dog with me so I didn't. Oh, that sounds catty! I just think Pippa and I are doing different things.' How did we get here? Felicity grew up in Hertfordshire where her father was a John Lewis executive and her mother was a French teacher. 'I dislike lemon curd, tinned tuna makes . me heave, I hate parsnips and I'm not keen on parsley. I don't like . truffles either. They're sort of armpitty.' Her first food memory is gnawing a plastic-wrapped Stilton, nicked off a supermarket shelf when she was in her buggy. She went to board at Rugby at 13, and remembers making fudge on rainy Sundays. After university, she went into publishing. 'I had a dream of discovering the next JK Rowling.' Instead, she discovered herself, and her super-charged taste buds – which are surprisingly fussy. 'I dislike lemon curd, tinned tuna makes me heave, I hate parsnips and I'm not keen on parsley. I don't like truffles either. They're sort of armpitty.' Felicity's books promote nourishing food. She was appalled by a recent survey that claimed the most popular evening meal in the UK is sandwiches. 'People say they don't have time to cook, yet the average person spends four hours a day watching TV. It's a life skill. People should know how to do it.' She cites Nigella's spaghetti and Marmite as an easy home-made supper. 'Chefs on TV make it too complicated, but it doesn't have to be like that.' So what did everyone have to eat today at Felicity Towers? The menu went like this. Felicity had avocado on toast and a biscuit, Wilf had squid, Richard made himself a plate of tuna with Felicity's roasted garlic salsa and leftover lamb-rice. 'He mixed it all together into a sludge, put Japanese mayonnaise on top and ate it. Revolting,' she says. But at least it was home-made.","Felicity Cloake has made her fame by reinventing recipes .

According to Russia's daily newswire Life News, Anastasia Volochkova, the 38-year-old ballerina lover of Bakhtiyar Salimov, 45, said that the injuries had been caused because they had been having sex together, after which he was left in such pain they had to call an ambulance. Anastasia became known all over the world in 2003 after she was fired when the Bolshoi Ballet complained that she was too fat and, at five foot six inches, too tall.

"By . David Mccormack . President Obama doesn’t believe comments made by Hillary Clinton about how she and former President Bill Clinton were ‘not only dead broke but in debt’ when they exited the White House in 2001 will become a big issue if she chooses to run for president. ‘As soon as you jump back into the spotlight in a more explicitly political way, you’re going to be fly-spec like this,’ the President told George Stephanopoulos in an interview aired on ABC’s This Week on Sunday. ‘She’s accustomed to it. Anybody who gets involved in public life is accustomed to it. Over time I don’t think it’s going to make a big difference.’ Scroll down for video . The President told George Stephanopoulos in an interview aired on ABC's This Week on Sunday that 'Hillary has been to this rodeo a bunch of times' and her comments wouldn't harm her chances in a presidential run . The President went on to say that his former Secretary of State has a political record that speaks for itself. ‘I think that Hillary has been to this rodeo a bunch of times,’ he said. ‘She is in public service [be]cause she cares about the same folks that I talked to here today. Her track record on that speaks for itself.’ The president comments come as a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Annenberg poll reveals that 55 percent of Americans say Hillary can relate to and understand the problems of average citizens as well as other presidential candidates can. By comparison, 37 percent of respondents disagreed, saying she can’t relate as well as other candidates can. 'Not really well off': Following a blistering 2012 presidential campaign in which Democrats pilloried Republican Mitt Romney for being super-wealthy and out of touch, Clinton risks falling into that category . The poll of 592 adults was conducted June 26-28 and it has a margin of error of plus-minus 5.1 percentage points. Clinton made the widely criticized comment while promoting her new book Hard Choices. 'We came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt,' she told ABC's Diane Sawyer, answering a question about the six-figure payments she and her husband command when giving paid speeches. Democrats argue that Clinton's personal wealth won't be able to overshadow a long career in public service, which began as an advocate for poor families at the Children's Defense Fund and led to years of work in Arkansas and Washington on issues such as early childhood education, expanded health care coverage and job creation. 'Attacks are most effective when they play into a pre-existing stereotype about a candidate,' said Ben LaBolt, a former Obama campaign spokesman. Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton waves to the crowd as she arrives to sign copies of her new memoir at Books & Co. at The Greene in Beavercreek, Ohio, on Friday . 'Nobody thinks that Hillary Clinton spent her career focused on making money. She was in the public eye advocating for a policy agenda.' In the interview with PBS NewsHour broadcast on Wednesday, Clinton said her record 'speaks for itself' and her 'unartful use of those few words doesn't change who I am, what I've stood for my entire life, what I stand for today.' 'Bill and I have had terrific opportunities, both of us, you know, have worked hard,' she said. 'But we’ve been grateful for everything that we’ve been able to achieve, and sadly that’s just not true for most Americans today.'

"By . Jan Moir . 'She implores you to love, love, love her': Susanna Reid is pictured on Good Morning Britain yesterday . Former BBC Breakfast star Susanna Reid made her debut on ITV’s rival Good Morning Britain yesterday. The show, which replaces the struggling Daybreak, has been modelled on Good Morning America and opened with ex-Strictly Come Dancing contestant Miss Reid and co-hosts Ben Shephard, Charlotte Hawkins and Sean Fletcher seated at a glass desk. Here, JAN MOIR gives her verdict on ITV’s latest bid to win back early morning viewers. Susanna Reid is the marquee name launching ITV’s new breakfast programme Good Morning Britain. For two-and-a-half hours on the debut show, Susanna gives it all she’s got – and then some. She talks, she walks from desk to sofa to chair and back again, this time without the aid of a choreographer. She grills politicians, she giggles with guests, she pours herself down the camera and wills you, begs you, implores you to love, love, love her as much as she loves herself. If you thought her cha cha on the last series of Strictly Come Dancing was effortful, just watch Susanna try to win over the breakfast nation – and sparkle at dawn without the aid of sequins.Oof, there were times when it was painful viewing. ‘Have you got that Monday morning feeling, as you manage to drag yourself into the kitchen and the bathroom?’ she asks at one point. No, Susanna, but it is creeping up on me. Good Morning Britain has a logo in the form of a yellow teardrop – a terrible omen? – and signs which flash onscreen to let viewers know what is going on. Every now and again there is a DEVELOPING STORY or something that is NEW THIS MORNING. Top stories include an item about a family with 16 children and some footage of pop group One Direction, which is relentlessly plugged. Susanna is rather off beam when talking from the studio to the mother of the 16 children, admitting that she has a problem remembering the names of her own three boys. Really? That’s awkward. Behind the desk: Sean Fletcher, Miss Reid, Ben Shephard and Charlotte Hawkins are pictured on the ITV show . Debut shows are invariably clumsy, but this one was more glitch-ridden and clenched than most. Cues were missed, while presenters talked over each other as if they were trying to impress at a speed dating night. You could sniff the shredded nerve ends and collective anxiety, as potent as frying bacon, crisping in the air. In the ITV studios, Susanna is the leader of a quartet of chummy broadcasters; each of them resplendent in plasticated high-def make up, super-bouncy blow dries and regulation neon dentistry. During the very first minutes of the very first episode of Good Morning Britain, a chirpy weathergirl regretfully informs viewers that the outlook is Dull, Misty, Murky and Foggy. Soon . after Good Morning Britain began at 6am yesterday viewers took to . Twitter to ask why they were not able to see more of Miss Reid, who was . poached from the BBC on a salary of around £400,000. One . commented: ‘Why has ITV paid so much for Susanna Reid only to put her . behind a desk? It’s like buying a Ferrari and keeping it in the garage.’ Another asked: ‘How many thousands of people turn back to BBC after Susanna Reid has a desk spoiling view of her legs?’ A . third said: ‘Good Morning Britain they have Susanna Reid behind a . desk!! Really the best legs in the country stuck behind a desk!’ No . doubt to their relief, after ten minutes she stepped from behind the . desk and moved to a chair for an interview about changes to benefits. There . were also tweets in praise of co-host Charlotte Hawkins, poached from . Sky, with one calling her ‘the only one who doesn’t seem nervous’. OK. Now that we’ve got the nicknames for the new presenters out of the way, can we get on with the show? So it’s anchors away, with Charlotte Hawkins, Ben Shephard and mandatory sports dude Sean Fletcher; all of them crowded with Susanna behind a glass desk. Is it a panel show, is it a game show – or is Simon Cowell going to appear at any minute and press his red buzzer? I do hope not. The guest for their first show is ‘legendary chat show host Paul O’Grady’, which is hardly a scoop as the old boy is rarely off the network. Susanna informs us that he is going to be talking about  his most recent heart attack. Oh that’s nice. Behind the presenters, there is a view of the sparkling Thames and St Paul’s Cathedral, basking in the sunshine under a clear blue sky. Ominously, this is a fake view, which only adds to the sense of fraught claustrophobia. In reality it is a grey and damp morning in London, as confirmed by the weathergirl, who is annoying me already. ‘You can find out what April showers are by checking out my blog,’ she says. Don’t mind if I don’t, luv. However, if you happen to be the only over-five in the entire United Kingdom who doesn’t know what rain is, go right ahead. ITV are pinning all their hopes on Susanna, the former BBC Breakfast presenter who gained much apparent popularity after Strictly. Yet while lots of men love Susanna’s obvious charms, I have always felt that women find her flinty, head girl persona a little more resistible. Can she really deliver the audiences that ITV crave? Yesterday she wore an elegant red dress, with cape sleeves. Weirdly, she keeps her left elbow aloft for most of the programme, presumably to show off the drape of the cape. No matter, I think red is her signature colour in the way that yellow is a queen bee’s signature colour or brown is favoured by the dung beetle. It’s just so her! Reading matter: Former BBC Breakfast star Miss Reid makes an early arrival at the ITV studios for her first day . Susanna has said she really wants to connect with ITV viewers, and makes a big breakfast effort to do this. Sometimes she does her Happy Face, sometimes, when broadcasting serious news items, she does her Concerned Face, but quite a few times on the launch edition of Good Morning Britain the mask slips and she does her Annoyed Face instead. Especially when she makes a mistake and blames others. ‘Someone is putting extra words in my head,’ she snaps when she fluffs a line. Then she gets all ‘discombobulated’ and can’t hide a flash of bad temper when she misreads the autocue. Ooooh, my diva antenna are twitching like worms at the spectacle of a star being quick to blame others during a live broadcast. And all this on a breakfast television show! I shudder to think what Susanna would be like if she was a big Hollywood star and someone didn’t peel her avocados or steam press her flesh-coloured tights in her Winnebago. Frightening! Tragically, Hollywood reporter and Daybreak leftover Ross King is still there – a man who has the colour and charm of a burnt pasty. Hey Ross, what’s the latest on the George Clooney getting married story? ‘No official confirmation, but then again, no official denial either,’ says Ross. Back in the studio, Susanna thinks the wedding will be a ‘pretty incredible affair’. ‘Sizeable,’ ventures Ben.

"By . David Mccormack . and Associated  Press Reporter . The federal government has launched a $1 million media campaign urging Central American parents not to send their children to the U.S. as illegal immigrants in a bid to combat the recent surge in unaccompanied children attempting to enter the country. The message aimed primarily at Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador is two-part: The trip to the United States is extremely dangerous, and immigrants who make it here will not be allowed to stay. ‘We have to stem the flow,’ said U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske, who launched the campaign on Wednesday while standing beside the Rio Grande. U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske launched the campaign on Wednesday while standing beside the Rio Grande . Kerlikowske said that 226 immigrants have died crossing the border since October. More than 52,000 unaccompanied children have been detained during the same period after entering the U.S. illegally, mostly in South Texas. The so-called Dangers Awareness Campaign will employ hundreds of billboards and some 6,500 public service announcements for radio and television stations in the target countries. One offering has an image of a child's footprints in the desert running toward the horizon with the message in Spanish: ‘I thought it would be easy for my son to get papers in the USA. ... I was wrong.’ The television and radio spots all finish with a similar parting message: 'They are our future. Protect them' A television spot slated to air in Guatemala shows a teenage boy preparing to leave home for the U.S. His mother pleads with him not to go. He confides to his uncle - already in the U.S. - in a letter that she's warning him about the dangers of the gangs on the train that immigrants ride through Mexico, the cartels that kidnap and the dayslong walk in the desert. Ultimately, he writes his uncle, ‘he who doesn't take a chance, doesn't win.’ The next image is of the boy dead on the cracked desert floor. A voiceover says smugglers' claims that new arrivals will easily get papers are false.

He will be traveling to cities with large immigrant communities in the U.S. as well to reach the parents or relatives on this side of the border who may help fund a child's trip. The effort will test high production value messaging against the pervasive gang violence and intense poverty that pushes many immigrants to flee their homelands. One offering has an image of a child's footprints in the desert running toward the horizon with the message in Spanish: 'I thought it would be easy for my son to get papers in the USA. ... I was wrong' ‘Families need to understand that the journey north has become much more treacherous and there are no “permisos” for those crossing the border illegally,’ said Kerlikowske. ‘Children, especially, are easy prey for coyotes and transnational criminal organizations and they can be subjected to robbery, violence, sexual assault, sex trafficking or forced labor.’ This week South Texas officials reported that the body of a Guatemalan boy, Gilberto Francisco Ramos Juarez, 15, was found in the brush about a mile from the Rio Grande.

"By . Alasdair Glennie Tv Correspondent . Showbusiness stars have launched a campaign to save BBC3 from being turned into an online-only channel. The corporation hopes to save tens of millions of pounds by slashing the youth-oriented station’s budget and moving its shows to the iPlayer internet service. But presenters and comedians including Jack Whitehall and Richard Bacon have started a Twitter protest to block director general Tony Hall’s move. BBC director-general Tony Hall last week said the BBC needed to make more cuts . Jack Whitehall, who wrote and starred in Bad Education on the channel, is one of a number of stars who has criticised the decision . Whitehall, . who appears in the BBC3 comedy Bad Education, claimed the channel was . vital for fostering new talent. Matt Lucas, who starred in Little . Britain with David Walliams, said the reports of the channel’s imminent . demise were ‘horrible’. It . is understood that Lord Hall plans to announce the online switch . imminently. Earlier this week, the Daily Mail reported he was preparing . to axe a channel to help meet a £100million-a-year savings target . announced last year. Putting . BBC3 online would go a long way toward delivering the savings, which . are designed to fund the BBC’s digital ambitions and are on top of . existing cuts of £700million. The . corporation is expected to save money by reducing BBC3’s commissioning . budget as well as cutting the money it spends on repeats and acquiring . shows from outside companies. It will be forced to focus on making just a . few dramas and comedy programmes for iPlayer rather than being expected . to fill a 24-hour schedule. Big break: Joanna Page and Mathew Horne in BBC3's Gavin and Stacey . Little Britain was one of the programmes which started on the channel and went on to become a huge success . The channel has been known to air a number of programmes with provocative titles, including Snog Marry Avoid? Mark Lawson is leaving BBC Radio 4's Front Row programme after 16 years . Mark Lawson is leaving BBC Radio 4’s Front Row programme after 16 years for ‘personal reasons’. His surprise departure comes just a month after the station’s arts unit, which makes the programme, was embroiled in a bullying row. It is not known whether the events are connected. In a statement last night, the 51-year-old said: ‘The BBC and I have agreed that I should step down as presenter of Front Row and for personal reasons I shall be taking a break from live daily radio journalism. ‘I very much hope to be able to return to work on Radio 4 in the future.’ Since the evening programme started in 1998, Mr Lawson has conducted more than 3,000 interviews, including with Helen Mirren, Robert De Niro and Woody Allen. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Front Row will continue to be presented by John Wilson and Kirsty Lang, alongside other guest presenters such as Tom Sutcliffe.’ Yesterday, BBC news reports about Mr Lawson’s departure prominently mentioned bullying complaints at the BBC’s radio arts unit, which makes Front Row, Saturday Review and The Film Programme. However, there has been no suggestion Mr Lawson was involved in the incidents in any way and the BBC has refused to comment on the allegations. In January, it was revealed the corporation had launched an investigation after 15 members of staff at the arts unit accused a presenter and a producer of bullying. Lawson’s BBC Four interview show starts a new series next week. In . the 2012/13 financial year, the channel’s content budget was . £90million, its infrastructure and support costs were £27million and the . BBC spent another £4.6million distributing it to other platforms . including Sky and Virgin. It is not yet known whether the corporation will keep the BBC3 branding when it moves online. Before . it can make the changes, bosses will need to put the proposal to the . BBC Trust. The long public consultation could be a stumbling block. In 2010, the BBC was forced to abandon plans to axe Radio 6Music after its stars organised a vocal public protest. Little Britain star Matt Lucas said the channel's closure would be 'really bad for new comedy' Yesterday, . Radio 5Live presenter Richard Bacon threatened to stage a similar . campaign against the proposed BBC3 cut, saying: ‘BBC3 makes lots of . great, clever, distinct programmes. If the rumours of it being cut are . true, we might need to retool that 6Music campaign.’ Comedian . Russell Kane, who regularly presents the BBC3 show Live at the . Electric, claimed the channel was the ‘crucible of upcoming comedic . artists’. Presenter Greg . James, who also regularly appears on the channel, said: ‘Such a load of . balls if the rumours about BBC3 being axed are true. Brilliant new . comedy and live music needs that platform.’ Mr . Whitehall added: ‘I really hope reports that the BBC may kill BBC3 are . just rumours. Their support of new comedy in particular is vital.’ Despite . the protests of BBC staff, others have supported the proposal and . expressed relief that Lord Hall will at least save BBC4. The high-brow . station, which has an older audience, had been seen as the other main . contender for the axe. On . the BBC’s online message board, Points of View, the overwhelming . majority of viewers said they would prefer BBC3 to be scrapped rather . than see BBC4 disappear. One said that BBC4, which mainly broadcasts . documentaries and arts programmes, is ‘too good to go’, while another . added: ‘BBC3 should go. Its programmes are pretty puerile.’ BBC3 was set up in 2003 and has launched comedies such as Little Britain and Gavin and Stacey. But . other programmes, such as Snog, Marry, Avoid?, have been less popular . with critics, and it has been accused of showing endless repeats of . EastEnders and films. Its . viewing figures are also much lower than other BBC channels, rarely . topping 800,000, while its target audience of 16- to 34-year-olds watch . more online television than older viewers. A BBC spokesman said: ‘While nothing is off the table, no decisions have been made.’ BBC Three started broadcasting in 2003 and has been the launch pad for some of the corporation's biggest shows, along with some of its most controversial. THE HITS . Gavin and Stacey - The sitcom story of an Essex boy and a Welsh girl's relationship started on the channel in 2007 before moving over to BBC1 where it became a massive mainstream hit and made stars of writing and acting duo Ruth Jones and James Corden. Little Britain - The sketch show and its stars, David Walliams and Matt Lucas, made two series before moving over to BBC1 and even inspired an American version Little Britain USA. Our War - The documentary, which used footage filmed by British soldiers on the front line in Afghanistan, won a TV Bafta last year. THE MISSES . Anthea Turner: Perfect Housewife - The show which starred the former daytime TV favourite helping make hopeless housewives house-proud ran for three series. Coming of Age - The BBC described the comedy as a 'frank look' at teenage life, but some people could not bear to look, with one critic calling it the 'worst sitcom ever'. Sun, Sex and Suspicious Parents - The show followed teenagers on their first holidays without their parents, who were in fact following their every move with secret cameras. One newspaper accused it of blazing a 'vomit-flecked' trail for subsequent shows.","Corporation executives plan to axe channel and move programmes online .

"By . Sally Lee . Australia's incoming Defence chief has unwittingly been drawn in to an internet fraud scam, with his identity being used to con women out of money. Police have confirmed a fake Facebook account in the name of Air Marshal Mark Binskin was set up and the fraudster contacted his latest victim last month. Unknown to Air Marshal Binskin, who becomes Defence chief on July 3, a German woman called Anna Linden, 54, was messaged on Facebook with declarations of love. The new Australian Defence Force, Air Marshal Mark Binkskin had his identity stolen to con women out of money with declarations of love . Messages including 'I really love you' and 'I promise you my life' were followed up with requests for money loans. Air Marshal Binskin's unknown impersonator asked Ms Linden if she could pay for a plane ticket to Spain which cost $403 as he was stuck in London without a valid visa, reported the Sun Herald. The imitator then told her that she would 'never regret' the decision as he planned on repaying her by selling his 5kg of gold. However this is not an isolated case as Ms Linden believes other women in Germany and two others from different countries were also contacted by the same impersonator. Women were contacted via Facebook with the fake Mark Binskin asking for money and sending messages professing his love . New Zealand has also been hit with a similar incident after they recently discovered a fake account claiming to be former defence chief Rhys Jones, whose identity was also stolen in 2012. 'This was referred to the New Zealand police and also to Facebook as a violation,' a New Zealand Defence Force spokeswoman said.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Michigan jail inmate just a month away from release faces even more time behind bars after his girlfriend was caught trying to smuggle heroin to him in a Folgers coffee can. Christopher Obermiller, who was doing time for having sex with a 14-year-old girl, claims he never asked girlfriend Tara Shupback to bring him smack, only coffee. She did it to 'screw him' after he began exchanging letters with another woman, he told police. 'She probably thought I needed heroin . because she knew I used to be a heroin addict,' said Obermiller, 24, according to court documents. Busted: Inmate Christopher Obermiller (left) says he asked girlfriend Tara Shupback (right) for coffee at the Bay County Jail, Michigan, but she instead delivered heroin to him inside a Folgers can to frame him out of jealously . Contraband: Jail staff noticed that Shupback's Folgers can, similar to the one pictured here, was no longer vacuum packed and had instead been resealed with glue . He has been in Bay County Jail since May after he was arrested for violating his probation from a 2012 conviction for criminal sexual conduct. Shupback claims Obermiller had begged her to smuggle drugs for him, according to the Bay City Times. She told investigators he once asked her to try putting the narcotic Suboxone in her letters to him. 'He's been bugging me the whole time he's been in jail,' Shupback, 22, told police. She was busted Monday when she dropped off a plastic can of Folgers for Obermiller containing a hypodermic needle and a small plastic package with heroin. Jail employees noticed the can was no longer vacuum-sealed and had glue around the rim, Captain Troy Stewart told MailOnline. Delivery girl: Shupback claims her jailed boyfriend had begged her to smuggle drugs for him in prison, once even asking her to send the narcotic Subxone inside a letter . Junkie: Obermiller says he was only going after his caffeine fix but admits he's a former heroin addict . Even if the can did contain coffee, family members are not allowed to bring food in for inmates. Coffee and other treats must be purchased directly from the jail, the captain added. Obermiller pleaded guilty in 2011 to a felony charge for having sex with a 14-year-old girl he met online. At the time, his attorney claimed the girl had told Obermiller she was 16, which is the age of consent in Michigan. He was sentenced to three years probation in 2012. He was sent to Bay County Jail in May for violating the conditions of his release, according to Troy. Obermiller faces up to 10 more years in prison on the drug charge.","Chistopher Obermiller, 22, says he only asked Tara Shupback for coffee, but she framed him out of jealously .

"By . Ted Thornhill . It was a bust in more than one sense of the word. Footage has emerged of Arkansas officers pursuing and arresting a naked female who was running through a parking lot. The incident led to the phrase ‘tripping balls’ being used possibly for the first time ever in a police report. Scroll down for video . Naked ambition: Melissa Valencia, 21, is filmed by a police unit streaking through a parking lot in Fayetteville . Giving chase: Valencia made a concerted to evade capture . Charged: Valencia was booked for misdemeanor public intoxication and resisting arrest . On the evening of July 1 police in Fayetteville received a call from a member of public who said that a naked woman ‘intoxicated on drugs and “tripping balls”’ was running around the town center. Two squad cars were dispatched, with the woman in question, later named as 21-year-old Melissa Valencia, filmed on an in-car camera. At the start of the footage she is seen running away from the police units and an officer giving chase on foot. The clip then shows her struggling with officers as they try to arrest her. A police report about the incident seen by The Smoking Gun website said: ‘I was dispatched to the area of Church and Center for a naked female running down Center Street. The caller stated she was intoxicated on drugs and ""tripping balls"". Resisting arrest charge: Officers claim that Valencia screamed and kicked her legs when they tried to detain her . I observed a naked female, later identified as Melissa Valencia running through the parking lot of this intersection... Valencia ran approximately 75 feet to a pole in the parking lot and appeared to be attempting to hide from me. Valencia was speaking but was not making any sense. While attempting to handcuff her, Valencia pulled away and was thrashing her arms about.' The report noted that Valencia screamed and kicked her legs while on the ground. She was taken to Washington Regional Medical Center and treated for a possible drug overdose. A nurse later told the officer who filed the report that Valencia had admitted to 'taking acid at her boyfriend's house'. The officer noted that the following day she was 'calm, polite and cooperative'. She was charged with misdemeanor public intoxication, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest charges. According to the urban dictionary, 'tripping balls' means 'being under the influence of a substance that is extremely altering your mental and/or spiritual state'. Its exact origins are unknown, but some say it was coined as a result of bouncy balls being used by LSD users to help them connect with reality. It's been in popular use in America since the mid-1980s, with the phrase seeping into popular films, TV shows and books over the years. On hit animation American Dad Roger the alien sings a song called 'Trippin' Balls' in an episode when the characters visit a theme park. It's also been used on a variety of occasions on South Park. It's thought that the earliest broadcast of the phrase was in 2004 comedy film Harold & Kumar Goes to White Castle.

"By . Daniel Mills . This is the hair-raising moment an A380 Singapore Airlines plane flew straight into the oncoming path of an electrical storm before narrowly missing a stray bolt of lightning. Passengers aboard the long-haul flight from London to Singapore woke up gasping at the site of the frightening electrical storm shortly before the aircraft's arrival at Singapore airport. It sent the stomachs of at least two passengers churning as they struggled to hold down their in-flight breakfast, which was served at the same point the storm engulfed the aircraft some 20,000 feet above sea level. The plane was on descent into Singapore when it brushed passed this huge bolt of lightning at more than 20,000 feet above the ground . Using his iPhone, photographer Gary Brown scrambled for his iPhone to capture the storm at 120 frames per second . Gary Brown was the man aboard who photographed the incredible light show . It was anything but a relaxing descent into Singapore for photographer Gary Brown and the passenger seated to his left in the aircraft's emergency exit row. Mr Brown, 40, described the moment as a test of 'man's best engineering versus something as simple as the nature of lightning.' And while he had heard about an aircraft's ability to withstand the electrical force of lightning, it didn't make he nor his frightened passenger feel any more at ease. 'I was sitting there capturing these photos and the person sitting next to me freaked out,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'To see lightning in the middle of the sky, surrounding the plane was gob-smacking.' 'Just the way these planes are designed to take all that electrical power, enough to light up a whole city, is unbelievable.' Just minutes before Mr Brown captured the iPhone images at 120 frames per second, the aircraft had been hovering above the storm in the pre-dawn sky with next to no light around. It then began making its descent straight through the storm on approach into Singapore. Incredibly the aircraft experienced very little turbulence as a result of the storm. Mr Brown said when the realistation that he and other passengers on board would be safe, his fear quickly turned to delight. 'It was, although quite scary, very very pretty,' he said. More...

"By . Daniel Mills . Abdullah Elmir Fled Australia with one other teenager where it is believed they will join insurgents fighting in Iraq . A Sydney teenager who fled Australia and is believed to be planning to join the conflict in Iraq may have been brainwashed after watching Jihadist recruitment videos posted online. The lawyer for the family of missing teenager Abdullah Elmir, 17, has told Daily Mail Australia that he was most likely recruited to join an Islamic terror group to fight in the troubled war zone. Lawyer Zali Burrows said she could not confirm the content of the videos or the group(s) responsible, but did say that it was likely he was offered an 'inducement' to fly to Iraq to fight. Elmir disappeared from the family's home in Bankstown, western Sydney, more than a week ago and he has only once made contact to tell his mother he was in Turkey. Ms Burrows and the family said they now want to know who paid for the teenager's ticket to fly and why, at just 17, he was allowed to fly with another teenager unknown to the family. Elmir lied to his parents about 'going fishing', then vanished. It has been reported that he may be planning to cross the border into Iraq. Scroll down for Video . An ISIS recruitment video titled There Is No Life Without Jihad showed five extremists, including this Australian on the left, urging people to 'respond to Allah' and 'wake up and be part of the effort' Ms Burrow claims Elmir's actions are out of character and that he had shown no signs of radical behaviour before leaving. The family also said they do no know why he would abandon his family and the promise of a university education. Elmir is the third Australian teenager to walk out on his family this month bound for Iraq. Speaking to The Sun Herald, the family described him as a normal child, who enjoyed a simple life in Sydney's west. The family only learnt of his travel arrangements to Iraq via a text message he left with a friend which simply said to tell his mother he was 'gone'. The family said they hold grave concerns for his safety and fear he may 'never be seen again'. 'We wish for his safety and we want the government to help bring him home,' a family member told Fairfax Media. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) told Daily Mail Australia they could not comment due to privacy obligations. Australia does not have an embassy or consulate in either Syria or Iraq so the Government's ability to deliver assistance in the Middle East is limited. Ms Burrows says she is convinced the Government knew that Abdullah was leaving. A family member told the Sydney Morning Herald: 'What is concerning is that if the Federal Police and ASIO had the intelligence, then why did they fail to stop him from departing or fail to stop the boy while he was in Turkey?' Ten Australians have died in Syria and Iraq, the latest a 22-year-old Sydney man, Zakaria Raad, who appeared in a recruitment video for the terror group The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) shortly before being ambushed in Syria. Brother Abu Nour al Iraqi (left) is said to be from Australia, and says in this video that his 'reasons for coming to jihad are plenty' More than 100 Australians are believed to be fighting with Middle East extremist groups. Australians involved in extremist activity have been warned by Prime Minister Tony Abbott that the Government will crackdown on home-grown terrorists. He said: 'The Government that stopped the boats will stop the jihadists,' he said. Mr Abbott said that while there would be no new invasion of Iraq to quell the violence in that country's north, Australia would redouble its efforts to protect its national security.","Abdullah Elmir, 17, may have been brainwashed to leave Australia for Iraq .

"By . Daniel Mills . Australians lucky enough to own property in one of the nation's major capital cities are sitting on a gold mine, if new figures on soaring house prices are anything to go by. RP Data figures released on Tuesday show the full extent of Australia's steep capital city house prices, led by Sydney, which is clearly ranked the nation's top place to own a house. In the 12 months to June this year, house prices in the nation's largest city rose 15.4 per cent, which in dollar terms means it now costs buyers an average of $690,000 to purchase house. Scroll down for video . This Bondi pad, in Sydney's east, recently sold for $15 million and is an example of the city's rising house prices . Vaucluse, like Bondi, also has a reputation for being an expensive suburb with this house selling for $19 million . Buoyed by record low interest rates, a lack of availability and high demand, Sydney had gains of more than five per cent on Melbourne, the next nearest capital city with 9.4 per cent growth, and was 5.4 per cent higher than the national average of 10 per cent. A house in Sydney, based on the latest figures, costs double the price of a home in Hobart which recorded just 2.5 per cent growth. The average price of a Hobart home is just $328,250. More... Is the property market slowing already? New mortgages slide to 11-month low as tough new rules bite, but homeowners borrow most for six years due to high house prices . FURTHER FALL IN MORTGAGE APPROVALS . However, according to some economists, the soaring rise in house prices has peaked and the market can now expect to see a drop-off in the next financial year. CommSec economist Savanth Sebastian said a rise in the amount of available housing should stop house prices getting too steep.

Mr Sebastian described the increase in house prices over the past year as 'phenomenal.' 'The pent up demand for housing, low vacancy rates and strong rental yields have increased the attractiveness of property as an investment class,' he said. 'In addition, substantial cuts to interest rates continue to drive activity.' RP Data research director Tim Lawless agreed, declaring house prices peaked in August last year and since that time said the 'rate of capital gain has generally trended downwards.' St George economist Janu Chan said house prices will continue to keep gaining, but at a more moderate pace.'Affordability constraints and less attractive rental yields for investment may start to deter some buyers,' she said.

"By . Daniel Mills . and Aap . Police allege Reni Maitua was fueled by alcohol when he assaulted taxi driver last year . NRL star Reni Maitua was intoxicated the night  he swore at a Sydney taxi driver before punching, kicking and hitting him with a tree branch, a court has heard. Maitua, 32, has pleaded not guilty to one count of common assault and one of intimidation following the alleged incident in November last year. The Canterbury Bulldogs player, who was banned form the NRL in 2009 for taking a banned substance, is applying for the matter to be discharged under Section 32 of the Mental Health Act. But police have alleged it was alcohol, and not depression, which fueled his aggressive behaviour. During his taxi fare police said Maitua swore at a taxi driver before punching, kicking and attacking him with a branch. Prosecutor Rick Mansley told the Downing Centre Local court that Maitua rejected suggestions that his mental health played a part in the attack and said he exhibited these aggressive traits because he was drunk: 'It is clear that when the accused isn't intoxicated to the level he was on this occasion, these sorts of incidents don't occur.' His lawyer, defence barrister Murugan Thangaraj, told Downing Centre Local Court that Maitua was having a depressive episode when he got into the taxi, and revealed personal details about how the troubled NRL player had attempted to commit suicide just three months prior. Mr Thangaraj said the dumped Cronulla Shark forward, who was given another chance at the Bulldogs where his career begun, had shown positive signs of rehabilitation. Reni Maitua was dumped by Canterbury in 2008 but is back playing for the club he won a premiership with in 2005 . 'This year, despite his injury, despite his surgery and despite his mental health issues he is in first grade at a club that is higher up the ladder than the one that didn't want him anymore.'

While police allege Maitua delivered a barrage of punches and kicks, Mr Thangaraj argued that CCTV footage revealed the backrower may have just given the driver an 'open-handed push'. Maitua was suspended by the Bulldogs after he was charged over the assault but he was reinstated after one month on strict conditions, including that he agree to an alcohol ban. Controversy has never been far from the one-time Australian representative whose playing career began to unravel in 2006 when he lost his license for drink driving. The former Test lock was also sacked by his current club back in 2008, after turning up late several times to training. In 2009 he tested positive to the banned substance Clenbuterol, a stimulant used to boost muscle mass.  He maintained his innocence at the time, but it later emerged he was a recreational drug user and that may have been what lead to his positive test. He returned to be with the Bulldogs this year on a one-year contract and told the ABC he was excited to be be back where his first grade career began. 'I'm really grateful for the opportunity and it'll be great to finish off my career where it all started,' he said. The hearing continues.

"By . Daniel Mills . Rupert Murdoch issued an instruction to his newspaper editors to 'kill off' the Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam . News Corporation boss Rupert Murdoch wanted Gough Whitlam ousted as Australian Prime Minister, according to US Diplomatic documents that reveal he made very clear instructions to the editors of his newspapers to 'kill off' the former PM. The US National Archives has just declassified a secret diplomatic telegram from January 20, 1975 that shows Murdoch's role in trying to undermine the Labor-led prime minister, much like he did Kevin Rudd in the 2013 national poll, 10 months before he was controversially dismissed by Governor-General Sir John Kerr. Fairfax Media has reported that a telegram, entitled 'Australian publisher privately turns on Prime Minister,' from US Consul-General in Melbourne, Robert Brand, reported to the State Department that 'Rupert Murdoch issued confidential instruction to editors of newspapers he controls to 'Kill Whitlam.' Mr Brand noted Murdoch had been 'the principal publisher supporting the Whitlam election effort in 1972 Labor victory', but the head of a publishing empire that includes The Australian, as well as The Daily and Sunday Telegraphs, quickly turned on the Labor leader and told his newspapers to do the same. He had become unsatisfied by Labor's economic management an thought Whitlam appeared to have abandoned his election-winning hopes. Murdoch's new editorial direction changed the face of Australia's political landscape completely, and less than a year later, on November 11, 1975 Governor-General Sir John Kerr dismissed Whitlam as the prime minister after the opposition blocked the budget in the Senate. Tony Abbott was on the receiving end of Murdoch's Daily Telegraph campaign which helped him win the 2013 Australian election . It led to a crushing defeat for the Labor Government in the national election on December 13, largely as a result of the Murdoch-backed campaign for the Malcolm Fraser Government. Labor did not return to Government until seven years later under Bob Hawke. AAP has reported that In the diplomatic telegram, Mr Brand makes it clear that the words ""kill Whitlam"" were used in a political context and not as a physical threat. Brand also said that Murdoch had previously supported Mr Whitlam's election before his publishing empire turned against the leader. ""If Murdoch attack directed against Whitlam personally this could presage hard times for Prime Minister; but if against Labor government would be dire news for party,"" the telegraph reportedly said. Last year, Murdoch and his Australian title The Daily Telegraph waged war against former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd consigning him to the 'bin of history.' The newspaper ran a relentless Tony Abbott-backed campaign including a front page article which told voters 'the time is up for Kevin Rudd and his Labor government.' The article stated: 'On September 7, Australia will indeed find a new way - by throwing out a government that has completely lost its way.' The Government was heavily defeated and Abbott was installed as the new PM.","New Corp boss wanted Australian PM Gough Whitlam defeated at 1975 poll .

"By . Daniel Mills . Lance Corporal Todd John Chidgey died in a non-combat incident in Afghanistan . Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey, the Australian who died in Afghanistan from a 'non-combat related incident,' was a consummate gentleman who always remembered birthdays and loved Manchester United - but never spoke of wanting to join the army. The family of the soldier, who was found by friends with a gunshot wound about 2pm on Tuesday, said they were bewildered at Todd's decision to join the special forces in 2006 in a statement they released after the soldier's death on Tuesday. Parents Kerrie Baker and Adam Chidgey said although he became accustomed to the discipline, structure and camaraderie of military life, they were mystified when he told them of his plans to pursue a military career back in 2006. 'The reason is still a mystery to us,' Ms Baker and Mr Chidgey said. 'But Todd had his heart set on joining Special Forces, so he put his heart and soul into the selection process.' As well as a fighter, they said Todd was a man who put his family first and would often be found playing in the park with brothers Adam and Paul or cheering on his favourite NRL side the Canterbury Bulldogs with cousin Gareth. 'If you were his friend, he'd stick by you and he was a champion of the underdog ... he was just so loyal and seemed to have been born mature,' they said. Lance Corporal Chidgey was on his sixth tour of Afghanistan when he was found dead in the Australian headquarters at the main coalition base in Kabul on Tuesday. He was farewelled during a special memorial in Kabul and a ramp ceremony will be held when his body is returned to Australia. A special memorial service was held for Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey this week at Kabul . Todd Chidgey was found by his military friends on Tuesday with a 'non-combat' gun shot wound . Defence has refused to go into the details surrounding the 29-year-old's death while an investigation is pending, but in the meantime Todd's parents have sent their heartfelt appreciation to his 2nd Commando Regiment who found him injured inside the Kabul administration building. 'We would like to take this opportunity to praise the 2nd Commando Regiment for the support they've given us during this sad time,' the statement said.

The decorated soldier was born in Gosford, NSW and joined the Australian Defence Force in 2006. He was posted to what is now the 2nd Commando Regiment, serving in Afghanistan on tours ranging from two weeks to six months.

Lance Corporal Chidgey is survived by his mother, father, brothers and partner. Defence Force chief Mark Binskin on Wednesday said after the incident he soldier was taken to a nearby medical facility for emergency treatment. 'Sadly, the soldier's injuries were too severe and he later died surrounded by his mates,' he said. Defence Force chief Mark Binskin would not reveal what happened to the solider but he is Australia's 41st soldier to die in Afghanistan . The base was in lock down last night so evidence could be collected and the Defence Force has since launched an investigation.

Defence offered its condolences to the soldier's family and friends. So did Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss who described the incident as tragic considering Australia's engagement in Afghanistan had largely ended. 'We don't know a great deal about the details as yet but I certainly extend sympathy to the family and friends of the soldier whose life has been lost. Our feelings are with the family,' he said.

"By . Daniel Mills . Bali Nine drug mule Scott Rush has proposed to a successful London banker whom he met for just one day in 2005 before his dramatic arrest for trying to struggle heroin. During a prison visit this month Rush dropped to one knee and asked 38-year-old mother-of-two Nikki Butler to marry him, more than nine years after they met for just a few hours before he was stopped with 1.3kg of the drug strapped to his body. Ms Butler had lost touch with the 28-year-old drug smuggler during his years of incarceration, but reunited with him in April after she recognised an image of him on British TV which referenced the Bali Nine. Scroll down for video . Bali nine inmate Scott Rush has proposed to successful London banker, Nikki Butler, who has agreed to marry him . Rush and Ms Butler spent just one day together when they met briefly close to 10 years ago . The 28-year-old, one of nine Australians jailed for attempting to traffick drugs from the Indonesian island in 2005, has battled drug problems since he was sentenced. 'Nikki, I love you and you love me. I think we can have a happy ending. Will you marry me?' he said according to The Sunday Telegraph. Ms Butler was on holiday in Bali when she met Rush for just one day before his arrest at Denpasar airport. The pair then parted ways before she recognised an image of the drug criminal on British TV and contacted him in January last year. She flew to Indonesia to visit him in April and again this month when Rush proposed to her. Ms Butler said the marriage 'feels like the right thing to do,' provided that former addict Rush can turn his life around. Speaking to The Sunday Telegraph from London she said she feels convinced that the 28-year-old has been punished enough for the crime he committed as a teenager. 'I love him. I know the person Scott really is and he is really, really beautiful person,' she said.

"By . Daniel Mills . Australian tennis star Lleyton Hewitt is on the verge of calling it quits on an illustrious career after admitting he is just one injury away from retirement. The Aussie ace, who at 33 has spent almost half his life playing at the professional level, made the revelation that his career might soon be coming to a close after going down in a five-set thriller to  15th seed Jerzy Janowicz. The second-round loss to his Polish opponent was the 42nd five set match Hewitt has played - the most of any player in the modern tennis era. The two-time grand slam champion said he felt incredibly frustrated following the defeat given his relatively good bill of health, and admitted post-match that it may be the last time tennis fans get to see the Australian at Wimbledon. End is nigh: Lleyton Hewitt admits he is one injury away from having to retire after losing to Jerzy Janowicz . Good game: Janowicz and Hewitt shake hands after an epic five-set clash on Friday . Lleyton Hewitt said he is just one injury away from retirement after his grueling five-set loss to Polish player Jerzy Janowicz. Hewitt has endured years of struggle on and off the tennis court with injury and multiple surgeries . 'I don't know if I'll be back, you never know,' he Hewitt, after his 7-5 6-4 6-7 4-6 6-3 second round loss to the 15th seed. 'I'm one injury away from hanging up the racket at any time. 'The body felt fine out there, which is obviously a positive thing.' Hewitt said the loss was a hard pill to swallow, and had he the opportunity over believes he would have improved on his second round struggle. 'But, you know, still frustrating to walk off the court feeling fine, feeling like you could have bounced back and played another five-setter tomorrow.' 'But you don't get that opportunity. With all that I've been through, the surgeries, it's going okay at the minute.' The 2002 Wimbledon champion registered his 42nd five-set clash in major tournament action, to move past Andre Agassi's record.

He also said, despite years of  injury setbacks, he has never once lost an ounce of enthusiasm for the sport. Radical foot surgery in 2012 saved Hewitt from premature retirement, while regular hip trouble has plagued the former world No 1 who still holds the record for the youngest player ever, at 20, to rise to the top ranking. Hewitt admitted that should he retire at the end of the current campaign, he will do so proud of his ability to fight back from a number of career-threatening problems. 'I'd much . rather win in three or four sets than go the distance all the time, I . seem to put everyone through the wringer quite a bit,' he said. 'I still enjoy it, I still enjoy doing the hard work: for moments out there like today, to play five-setters against the best guys in the world.

"By . Daniel Mills . This adorable little marsupial might not know it, but he will soon become a vital link in an Australian-only conservation program designed to preserve the dwindling Yellow-Bellied Glider from extinction. This four-month old marsupial, who is not yet named, is one of a declining number of vulnerable gliders who are being displaced from their habitat at an alarming rate. Found mostly along Australia's eastern seaboard, their homes - old-growth trees of more than 120 years old - are being uprooted and cleared as new development moves in. The situation, wildlife expert Wendy Gleen said, will become dire without human intervention: 'We need to get the message out there that we must do everything we can, because they will disappear if we don't help.' This Yellow-Bellied glider emerged from her mother's pouch last week, and is less than the size of a normal human hand . apart from being 'very very cute' Australian animals wildlife keeper Wendy Gleen said the marsupial is a very social and friendly animal . Vets examined the healthy and happy looking joey after it emerged from its mother's pouch last week at Taronga Zoo . Luckily, it is vital reproductive projects like Sydney's Taronga Zoo which is heeding the call and coming to the tiny marsupial's rescue. The captivity breeding program is the only program worldwide which is aiming to undergo a rapid turnaround in the animal's dwindling population. This tiny glider is one of 13 joeys already born into the captivity breeding program. He emerged bright eyed and bushy tailed last week from his mother's pouch where he was swiftly taken into the capable hands of the zoo's animal handlers . In the last few days, keepers at the nocturnal exhibit, Australian Nightlife, have been able to get a good look at the little youngster who is roughly the same size as a rabbit. Also known as the Fluffy Glider, the remarkable marsupials weigh just 700g but can effortlessly glide from treetop to treetop at an incredible distance of up to 140 metres. It is most distinguishable by its grey-brown fur which is highlighted by the orange to yellow fur on its belly. Australian Mammals keeper Wendy Gleen said: 'they have the softest fur of any animal. It’s so soft that you can see your hand touching it but can’t actually feel it against your hand.' If it's cute and fluffy appearance isn't enough to persuade people to help, than Mrs Gleen said she don't know what will. She said the Yellow-Bellied Glider faces an uphill battle of survival as recent development along Australia's eastern seaboard, where the glider inhabits, has seen the removal of much of its natural bushland. At full size the animal weighs less than 1kg and is roughly the same size as a rabbit . The biggest problem facing the declining animal population is the destruction of its habitat along the eastern seaboard of Australia . Taronga Zoo's social media team are running a naming competition on Facebook with an Australian-based theme for this little marsupial . This little joey, when fully grown, has the ability to fly up to about 140 metres between treetop-to-treetop . It requires an area the size of 50-hectares to fly in, and old-growth trees of up to 120 years old to nest. Ms Gleen said many Australians who live with the animal by its back door do not even know it exists. 'The biggest problem for the gliders is local bushland being broken up by development along the eastern seaboard where they’re found,' Ms Gleen said. 'I live in the Central Coast and you would be amazed at how many people don't know what the Yellow-Bellied Glider is.' More... Could the passenger pigeon be raised from the DEAD?

She is urging people to help regenerate the population's natural habitat by planting trees, such as the mahogany, which it is best suited too. 'People can help by planting trees and shrubs that are found locally in backyards to create wildlife corridors and by getting involved with local bush regeneration groups.' She said it is vital that the message of the animal's vulnerability is spread throughout the community.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott obviously forgot to refer to the Socceroos' teamsheet on Saturday when he awkwardly referred to Australia's captain Mile Jedinak as 'Mike' in a cringeworthy World Cup video message. The patriotic-looking PM, sporting a Socceroos scarf and standing before the Australian flag, delivered his stirring message of support to the Socceroos in a YouTube message on Saturday morning as they prepared to play in their first World Cup match. But as if a 3-1 defeat to Chile wasn't bad enough, the PM only managed to make it to the three-second mark before butchering his well intended message by referring to team captain Jedinak, as 'Mike', instead of Mile. Draped in Green and Gold and the Australian flag in the background, the stage was set for Mr Abbott who just needed to do bit more research before delivering his message . Thankfully he didn't also have a problem with the coach, Ange Postecoglou. 'Ange, MIKE and the Socceroos,' he said, 'in this World Cup you have the opportunity to make the world game our national game'.

"By . Daniel Mills . and Richard  Shears . A young British woman who plunged to her death at Kings Canyon in central Australia may have been posing for a photograph, it emerged today. ABC journalist Jesse Dorsett revealed in a tweet that several witnesses had seen the woman, whom police have confirmed was 23 and from the UK, was on the highest part of the a canyon in Watarrka National Park, the Ridge Walk, when she posed for a photo. It was then that she fell up to 100m to her death - although she was able to talk briefly to people before she died. Because of the remoteness of the area - Watarrka is 450km south west of Alice Springs - her body was not recovered until 24 hours later. An English tourist, in her 20s, has fallen to her death while walking in the Watarrka National Park in remote Central Australia . The Kings Canyon walking trail is 100 metres high in some parts, and it is understood the tourist fell from one of the highest points known as the Rim Walk' Police said she initially lost consciousness after falling up to 100m, but died while being treated by park rangers and paramedics. A helicopter was on its way but couldn't reach the remote canyon in time. Other tourists managed to raise the alarm and police, park rangers and paramedics drove to the scene from Alice Springs. The woman was reportedly able to talk to paramedics while a helicopter was flown to airlift her out. Northern Territory police Superintendent Kylie Proctor told Daily Mail Australia the woman had travelled to Watarrka National Park as part of a tour group, but was walking alone at the time of the incident. 'There are police on the ground investigating the incident, but I can't confirm whether she simply fell, was skylarking, or slipped,' Suptd Proctor said. More... Murder investigation launched after a man's body is found at a popular tourist spot near Sydney . A Parks and Wildlife Commission spokesman also told Daily Mail Australia he was not aware of the exact circumstances which led to the woman's death, but confirmed the commission was assisting police with their inquires. 'How, or why she fell, I don't know,' Media Manager Edwin Edlund said. 'At this time of year, being much cooler, it is a popular place for tourists ... but generally speaking it is also quite an isolated area.' The Wararrka National Park is surrounded by rough walking terrain and is difficult to reach in emergencies because of distance from the nearest regional centre, Alice Springs . He said he couldn't recall a death inside the park during his nine years with the Parks and Wildlife Commission, and most emergencies calls that do come through relate more to heat distress and heart attacks. 'But someone falling like this, I am not aware of it.' He said more than 250,000 people visit the park each year, and it is most popular with interstate and overseas travellers. Tourists visit Kings Canyon because of its spectacular scenery, historical links with the mythical Aboriginal 'Dreamtime' and the region's wildlife. It offers three walking trails, the highest being the Rim Walk, and in order to reach the highest point people climb up a steep trail known as 'Heart Attack Hill'.","Woman, 23, fell from highest point of walking trail in remote NT park .

"By . Louise Cheer . and Freya Noble . and Daniel Mills . A Southport man has been charged over a sickening crime where a cat's blood was smeared on a garage door of a Gold Coast home and a car set alight during an early morning attack. The 19-year-old man will appear in Southport Magistrates Court on Wednesday charged with injuring animals by night, wilful damage and arson. It is alleged he killed a cat during the incident as well as setting a car on fire and damaging the garage door of the home. The owner of the cat that was slaughtered in the June 17 attack, Mady White, told Daily Mail Australia she had no idea how Moo - a black and white feline - became entangled in the Arundel crime. Scroll down for video . Moo was the cat left decapitated during the attack. Her owner, Mady White, has described it as 'absolutely disgusting' Ms White said she had not noticed her cat was missing from her Bundall home - about 10km away from the Hazel Court address where the crime took place - until Gold Coast police officers showed up at her door. 'I knew of the threatening stuff from the news but I didn’t know it was my cat until the police came,' the 20-year-old said. 'It didn’t feel real. I thought I had seen her that day, but I had been unwell that day and the day before so I was unsure when I had last seen her. 'I was asleep when I suspected she was taken by one of my friends, which would have been Monday night.' A message was left on a garage door at a Gold Coast home in the early hours of last Tuesday while a resident's car was set on fire . 'I never expected someone to do this to me and for no apparent reason to me. It wasn’t a threat to me. 'Pretty much it was my cat being at the wrong place at the wrong time.' Ms White's other cat, Sylvester, is also mourning the loss of his playmate. 'They used to hide together and play together – they were always together,' Ms White said. The cat's head was left on the front door of the Arundel home on Hazel Court in Queensland . The moment when the crime happened was captured on a fixed CCTV camera across the road and emerged last Wednesday. Despite it's poor quality and a lack of light, the video manages to show at least two people loitering at the front of a garage door presumably scribbling the message: 'Whers (sic) my money? Tik Tok!' in cat's blood. The silhouetted figures make it difficult to pinpoint exactly how many people are in the footage, but police have previously confirmed it was more than one. The culprits can then be seen moving towards the car holding a flame fueled by an accelerant, before throwing it inside. The car is quickly engulfed in flames before the footage ends with it still burning. In the rear of the image, at least two people can be spotted loitering in front of the garage door where it is presumed a message is being scrawled in cat's blood. The silhouettes are lit up by the flame which is later used to throw into the car parked right to the right of the screen . A Queensland police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia last week the pivotal moments of the film were at 2.17am and 2.19am in real time where the footage starts and car was set alight. 'At 2.17am you can clearly see people in front of the double garage door, and to the right you can see the small black square which is the car later set set alight,' the spokesperson said. Detectives described the grisly slaughter of the cat, and the message which it was used to write, as 'abhorrent.' The RSPCA also offered a $5000 reward to anyone who had information that led to an arrest. During initial investigations, a 19-year-old man was taken into police custody but was released without charge. A Queensland Police spokeswoman said the man charged on Tuesday was not the same one. 'There have been a number of people questioned by police since the event occurred as part of the investigations,' she said. A burst of bright light fills the screen the moment the flame is thrown at the car . Senior Sergeant William Lithgow from Southport Station told MailOnline last week the incident was likely to be an ongoing matter with the occupants. 'It's not a random act, the home was targeted specifically,' he said. The cat had been 'decapitated and otherwise dismembered', Senior Sergeant Lithgow said. Residents and neighbours were woken by a loud explosion at 2.45am and police found the severely mutilated cat near the burning vehicle. The cat's head was left at the front door of the house. People thought to be the homeowners were seen cleaning the graffiti off the garage door later on Tuesday morning. Detective acting inspector Greg Aubort said the occupants were disturbed by the message. But he would not say whether they had an idea who was responsible or if there were likely to be organised crime links.

"By . Daniel Mills . Protestors have stomped on the steps outside Immigration minister Scott Morrison's office today in a 'symbolic' objection to the Australian government's policy on refugees. More than 400 people marched from Munroe Park, in Sydney's south to Morrison's electorate office at Cronulla in a united stand against the 'abhorrent' conditions some have claimed refugees are being placed under by the country's top politicians. A few of the major talking points in Saturday's protest, which coincided with World Refugee Day, was the controversial Nauru and Manus Island detention centres and a $10,000 government handout being offered to refugees to help them return to their country and assimilate back into society. Saturday's protests in Sydney were a peaceful objection to the government's hard-lined approach on refugee . Families, individuals, not-for-profit and political groups turned out today to have their say against the Abbott Government's asylum seeker policies . Protest organiser Ian Rintoul from the Refugee Action Coalition group called the Abbott Government's cash incentive, reported in Fairfax Media, a 'shoddy bribe' and what the government should be concentrating on is processing refugees in Australia and protecting them with temporary refugee statuses. The issue is particularly sensitive given the hostile climate currently being experienced in Iraq, Mr Rintoul said. 'They are just trying these shotty bribes on to get around their obligations of processing people in Australia,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'It is just disgusting.' There should be no stopping the boats, the Government should be making sure these people get to Australia safely.' Labor Immigration spokesman Richard Marles agreed. He said the Government should focus on processing asylum seekers, instead of offering them money to leave before their claims are assessed. 'We don't need blank cheques, we need people being processed.' But Mr Morrison said the financial incentives are a positive for refugees, and it's not just money the Government is offering but 'training, support and other issues to assist people to get on their feet when they return,' he said. It has been reported the return packages for Iranians amount to $7,000, while Afghans are being offered $4,000. It is not known whether Iraqi's are being offered any money or are eligible under the scheme. Manus Island, Narau and Australian detention centres were a major talking point at Saturday's rally . Mr Rintoul called the resettlement package a 'desperate' bid by the Government to avoid more in-detention crises such as the death of Reza Barati on February 17. An independent review handed down into riots at the Manus Island detention centre in Papua New Guinea on February 16-18, found protests turned fatal after months of repeated violence, clashes and tension between Iranian asylum seekers and PNG nationals working there.

The attorney-general’s Department Robert Cornall found Mr Berati, 23, died of a cardiac arrest, and suffered brutal head injuries when attacked in the compound of the Manus Island centre. Jordan Humphreys, also representing the Refugee Action Coalition, said he was not anti-Abott, but did not agree with his hard-lined approach to refugees coming to Australia and being shipped off shore. 'We marched outside Morrison's office as a symbolic protest against his policies.' he said. He called the march symbolic because being a Saturday,  Morrison's office was empty but he still hoped the message got across. On a Facebook page dedicated to today's march, organisers wrote 'Manus, Nauru or in the domestic detention network, Aus­tralia inflicts serious suffering on refugees whose only ‘crime’ is to ask Australia for help.' Children in detention and those risking  the journey to Australia from abroad sparked protestors into action . Finger pointing: Many are blaming the government for Reza Berati's death on Manus Island, February 17 . Rally organiser Ian Rintoul said the sentiment among protestors was largely the same - end offshore processing for good . The rally was designed to send a message to Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison that they have gone to far in the 'war' on refugees .

"By . Daniel Mills . A Tamil man, who suffered years of torture at the hands of the Sri Lankan army, reached his 'tipping' point on Friday by setting fire to himself inside a Melbourne home when he heard his brother may have been murdered back home. Daily Mail Australia has learned that the 40-year-old, who can not be identified for fear he will be returned back to Sri Lanka, was jailed in his home country in 2007 and beaten because he donated food to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (Tamil Tigers) during the Sri Lankan civil war. He, along with his brother, were partners in a business which donated food to the Tamil Tigers, an independent militant organisation who were at war with the Sri Lankan government over a bid to create a separatist, independent state. The brother's links with the then terrorist organisation, which the Tamils were classed, landed them in jail. The Tamil refugee was rescued by his housemates and taken to Dandenong Hospital with only minor burns, after he burned himself on Friday . The man set himself alight at a home in Noble Park, south east of Melbourne . The Tamils where locked in a civil war with the Sri Lankan government over the region to the north east of the country, which they wanted to separate from the rest . The man suffered severe psychological trauma during his time in jail and underwent treatment, but Tamil Refugee Council spokesman Trevor Grant said his mental state deteriorated so badly, that on Friday he set himself on fire when he heard his brother was missing in Sri Lanka. More... Protestors rage over Abbott Government's 'shoddy bribes' to refugees as groups march outside Scott Morrison's electorate office . Fleeing Iraqis join large tide of displaced people . 'This is what tipped him over the edge - discovering his brother was missing,' Mr Grant told Daily Mail Australia. 'He (his brother) was tortured as well, and there is some suspicion that he may have been murdered but I don't know.' AAP reports the man doused his body in petrol, before lighting himself inside his Noble Park home, south east of Melbourne. It is the third such report of Tamils setting fire to themselves, including an incident in which one man died. Mr Grant said the man was beaten and tortured while incarcerated, including having his legs broken, before he managed to escape the country where he arrived to Australia by boat in 2012. He was taken to Christmas Island where he spent seven months in detention before being settled in Victoria. He has been unable to work because of new laws which restricted temporary refugees to undertake employment. Mr Grant has been in direct contact with the Tamil man who is recovering from minor burns inside the Dandenong Hospital. He said he is in complete fear that he will be returned to Sri Lanka by the Australian Government, and this was what ultimately led him to set fire to himself. He is alive purely due to the intervention of his housemates, who doused the flames. 'We are very lucky on this occasion that the man's housemates were aware of what he was planning to do otherwise we may have had another death on our hands,' Tamil Refugee Council spokesperson Sri Samy said. 'I have had seven young men tell me in the past few weeks that they are thinking of doing this.' She said they all share the same fear of being deported back to Sri Lanka, and would 'prefer to die here than be sent back to torture, which is what the Australian government is doing to many Tamil asylum seekers.' The unknown Tamil, in this latest case, has a wife and daughter living back in Sri Lanka. Ms Samy said the previous Labor Government and the current Coalition Government, had sent back more than 1000 Tamil asylum-seekers under an enhanced screening process. Mr Grant said he believes there are about 6,000 to 7,000 Tamils living in Australia, and urged the government to reconsider sending them back to Sri Lanka. 'We implore the Immigration Minister to reconsider,' he said.","The unidentified man had his legs broken for engaging in 'terrorist' activity .

"By . Daniel Mills . Forget Sydney's beaches and harbour or Melbourne's pubs and cafes, because the nation's best place to live and work is our often mocked national capital. That's based on data from one of the world's most respected economic bodies, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, using a 'well-being' index that compares factors such as the environment, income and health and safety of citizens in 362 regions around the world. The territory received three top 10 scores, more than any other region included on the list, for safety, income and civic engagement. Even its lowest score, for the environment, was still a massive 9.1. Of all the eight indicators, Canberra total score was 77.7 out of a possible 80. Scroll down for video . While living conditions in Canberra might be top class, it has built up a reputation as a boring city with little to do . Canberra is truly the place to visit all-year round. During summer it's dry and desolate while in the winter months it is one of the coldest places in the country . As the political heartland of the country, Canberra, along with six other of our state's and territories received top score of 10 for its civic engagement - meaning Australia is more in tune with its political system than just about anywhere else. The high number of voter engagement, about 95 per cent, was taken from the 2013 Federal Election and largely reflects the fact that voting in Australia is mandatory.  Australia had the highest average voter turnout of any other region based on the previous national election. Voter turnout is defined as the ratio between the number of voters to the number of persons with voting rights. The statistics also confirmed the capital has a higher average income than the 360 regions identified, and it terms of its murder rate - that's practically non existent. Canberra has the lowest murder rate across Australia averaging just one in 100,000 people. It's commonly confused that Sydney, and not Canberra, is referred to as Australia's capital city. Despite its knockers, Canberra seems to be making its place on the world stage. A New York Times article recently told its readers that while it does not compare to the 'glitzier city of Sydney' and  'there are no beaches or iconic opera houses' it does have 'big-sky beauty, breezy civic pride and a decidedly hipster underbelly.' The best way to enjoy Canberra, the Times said, is 'with deep intakes of mountain air and an ear tuned to the calls of sulphur-crested cockatoos and crimson rosellas.' Unlike most cities, Canberra was purposefully built as the nation's capital and the road network is built with an incredibly high number of roundabouts . Income 10/10 . Safety 10/10 . Civic Engagement 10/10 . Health 9.9/10 . Accessibility to services 9.6/10 . Jobs 9.6/10 . Environment 9.5/10 . Education 9.1/10 . It also recommended going for a bicycle ride which loops one of the capital's premier attractions, it's lake. But it isn't just any lake, it was named after Chicago man, Walter Burley Griffin, who designed the capital built in the centre of Melbourne and Sydney. Tasmania's score for education is 5.6, putting it in the bottom 27 per cent of the OECD regions. The ACT is high on the list, in the top 19 per cent, but when it comes to the country's natural environment, look no further than Tasmania, NSW and QLD which all score a perfect 10 out of 10. The Northern Territory doesn't fare quite as well as its neighbouring state's and territories, scoring just 4.1 for health and 1.4 for safety.Its health score is in the OECD's bottom 29 per cent, while its safety score is in the bottom 13 per cent. Canberra and the ACT can count itself a lucky place to live, with a higher average income, civic engagement and better safety than some of the 300 regions on the OECD list . The war museum in Canberra, it was revealed recently, was Australia's number one tourist attraction . Lake Burley Griffin was named in honour of Water Burley Griffin, the Chicago-born architect which designed the capital city from scratch . Tasmania, along with Queensland and NSW, scored 10 out of 10 in the environment category .

Jacquie Crump, 55, who looks after Alzheimer's and dementia patients, was knocked over after being hit as she tried to cross the road in Blackwell, West Midlands. She initially thought her eye had fallen out and only realised she had been egged when she spotted bits of shell on her clothes. Anger: Jacquie Crump, 55, was left with a swollen black eye after the attack in Blackwell, West Midlands. She said she initially thought she had lost her eye in the attack - and she only realised what had happened when she saw egg shell on her clothes . Mrs Crump suffered a black eye in the attack but said the group could have caused her permanent damage. 'They need to be told how dangerous it is, it's not funny, it's not a joke,' she said. 'I was crossing and a car whizzed up. I stopped to let it pass. It was a gang of lads inside, there was loud music and they were laughing. 'One leaned through the side window and I leaned back and thought ""he's going to throw a brick"".' Although she tried to take cover, the carer was hit in the face by the egg. 'I thought it was a brick that hit my eye and the stuff running down my cheek was my eye or blood. It was horrendous,' she said. Anger: Dementia patients' carer Mrs Crump said that a pensioner could have been blinded if they had been targeted . She continued on her journey home after the attack - and was walked to her front door by a group of women who took care of her. 'They took me to my door. There are some bad apples but then you get someone so nice like that,' she said. 'My husband was very shocked. We were sat in the hospital and you could see the worry on his face.' Doctors at Sandwell Hospital said she did not suffer any lasting damage in the attack but she will have to undergo further checks to make sure her vision is unaffected. Mrs Crump said if the gang had targeted a pensioner the consequences could have been far more serious. She said: 'I'm of a disposition where I suck it up and get on with it, but an elderly person could have been blinded.' Police are now investigating the incident which happened at around 7.30pm last Friday. Anyone with information should contact Sandwell Police on 101.

"By . Nazia Parveen . A dance student told yesterday how she fought off a sex offender who tried to drag her into his car in broad daylight. Nicola Thompson, 22, said she was determined not to be raped by sexual predator Mark Trim and screamed and struggled to escape his clutches. She has waived her right to anonymity to speak out, and  to urge other women who find themselves at the mercy of sex attackers to put up the same resistance she did. Courage: Dance student Nicola Thompson, left, summoned all her strength to fight off attacker Mark Trim, right, who tried to grab her off a street in St Helens, Merseyside, on May 3, this year, Liverpool Crown Court heard . ‘I found it natural to fight back, she said. ‘He’s a disgusting man and it shows how his twisted brain works.’ Trim, . 36, described as having a warped sexual appetite, has been jailed for . more than five years for attempted kidnap and attempting to commit a sex . offence. Miss Thompson said: ‘I wanted to speak out to show other women . they should fight back. If it wasn’t me, it would have been someone . else, or even a child. ‘I feel relieved Trim is locked up. If any . other woman is in that position, make as much noise as possible to get . someone’s attention.’ Trim had been driving the streets of St Helens, Merseyside in his Golf GTi looking for a victim when he spotted Miss Thompson. The student, who had been texting her friend, found her path suddenly blocked by Trim, who dragged her towards the vehicle. But . she gave him a shock when she fought back, resisting his attempts to . bundle her into the car and eventually pulling free. She said: ‘He . grabbed me by the upper arms. I screamed and he tried to drag me into . the car and I was trying to fight him off.’ Alarmed by the noise she . made, Trim gave up and sped off, leaving Miss Thompson sprawling on the . road with cuts and bruises to her body. She managed to note the last . three digits of the Golf’s registration plate before getting help from a . passer-by. But Miss Thompson was left so traumatised by the attack . on May 3 that she lost the ability to speak and now suffers panic . attacks when she is out alone. Caged: Mark Trim - described as a 'predatory offender with a warped sexual appetite' - was jailed for five years at Liverpool Crown Court, pictured, for the attack on May 3 . She added: ‘After it happened, I . couldn’t speak. I was in shock. I was fine until a couple of months ago . when it really hit me and I started struggling and had to go to the . doctors for help with everyday tasks. 'It affected my college work, it . impacted on me massively and I started having panic attacks, flashbacks . and nightmares.’ Trim initially denied involvement in the attack, . but changed his plea at Liverpool Crown Court last month after number . plate recognition technology and analysis of his mobile phone records pinpointed him to the scene. Jailing him for attempted kidnap and intent . to commit a sexual offence, Judge Robert Warnock said: ‘Your motive was . to gratify your own warped sexual appetite. ‘You present a serious . risk of significant injury. You are a predatory offender from whom the . public are entitled to be protected.’ He contrasted Trim’s ‘cowardly . attack’ with the courage demonstrated by Miss Thompson, saying: ‘The . public have cause to be grateful to her.’ Trim, a registered sex . offender with a previous conviction for indecent exposure in 2011, had . become a regular cocaine user following the breakdown of his marriage.

"By . Ryan Lipman . and Daniel Mills . Australian Midfielder Tim Cahill has revealed the moment a Chilean opponent openly admitted to being a cheat during the Socceroos 3-1 defeat to the South Americans. Cahill, at a post-match press conference, told reporters that he directly called Jara a 'cheat' to his face following a heated scuffle in which the pair jostled for the ball. The Australian midfielder made the remark because he felt unfairly yellow carded, and blamed the referee's wrong decision on Jara who Cahill said fouled him first. It left the Australian midfield with a bitter taste in his mouth post match where he told reporters it was remarks like this that undermined sportsmanship in the game. Cahill said the Chilean intentionally fouled him first when he 'kicked-out' at the Socceroo: 'The left back (Jara) kicked out at me when I was trying to run past him for a cross and I pushed him away - and I got the yellow card.' In the heat of the moment, Cahill said he called Gonzalo a 'cheat', leaving the Australian midfielder in disbelief when Jara allegedly replied 'yes, I'm a cheat, so what?' Tim Cahill claims Gonzalo Jara, right, admitted to being a cheat following an altercation the pair had when both challenging for the ball . The Socceroo said Jara's blatant admission is the kind of behaviour Cahill wants stamped out of the sport, particularly when it comes to such a high-profile tournament like the World Cup. 'That is not gamesmanship ... this needs to be out of the game."" Cahill's, and the Socceroos only goal in the 3-1 defeat to Chile, now mean's the Australian has scored more goals in World Cups than both Argentinian Lionel Messi,  Portugal's Christiano Ronaldo and England's Wayne Rooney combined. Cahill's goalscoring tally of four, is three more than Messi who has just one goal=and double Ronaldo's tally of two. Rooney is yet to score a goal in 594 minutes of World Cup soccer. Passionate fans in Brazil and Australia got right behind the Socceroos as they watched the team's 2014 World Cup  opening match against Chile at Arena Pantanal in Cuiaba. Despite facing stiff competition from the South American nation in the Group B opener, fans were hopeful as they cheered on the squad, captained by Mile Jedinak. With Chile scoring two early goals in the first 15 minutes a of play within two minutes to lead 2-0, a goal by Tim Cahill in the 35th saw Australian fans rejoice, with the side's chances of winning given a major boost.

'It's hard to believe a Mt Druitt boy is out there playing in the World Cup for Australia.'

"By . Nick Fagge . Intruder: Mark Hill was found sleeping in a child's bedroom. This photograph was taken minutes later . A couple were left traumatised after they found an intruder high on drugs in their sleeping four-year-old son’s bedroom. But another shock was to follow when police said they would not prosecute the man, even though he had confessed. Tanja Compton found the man asleep on the floor when she went to wake her son Rubins. Her screams disturbed him and he fled, but not before her partner James Attrill took a picture of the 6ft bearded stranger. Mark Hill was swiftly caught. He was  arrested and admitted he had been in the boy’s room. But to the astonishment of Mr Attrill and Miss Compton, police dropped all the charges and let him go. Officers told the couple that Hill had been cautioned for drug offences but otherwise had not broken the law – as he had gained access to the house through the back door, which had been left unlocked. The only action that could be taken was for trespass – which is a civil matter, not a criminal offence. That would mean the couple taking out their own court case against the unemployed 24-year-old. ‘I can’t believe the police have dropped the charges and are refusing to prosecute him,’ said Mr Attrill, 31, who even tracked Hill down to confront him over what he had done. ‘He has admitted he was there. But still the police won’t do anything about it.’ Miss Compton told of her horror when she discovered Hill in Rubins’s room when she went to wake her son up one morning last month at their home in Sandown, Isle of Wight. The stranger was lying on the floor. She kicked him awake and yelled for Mr Attrill to call the police. ‘I couldn’t believe it – there was this man in Rubins’s room,’ she said. ‘I kicked him and shouted at him. He came around and started mumbling. Soon he was up on his feet and telling me everything was OK. James was on the phone to the police and we chased him out of the house. Terrified: Tanja Compton (left) found Mark Hill asleep on the floor when she went to wake her sons (pictured). Her partner James Attrill (centre) was able to take a photograph of the 6ft bearded stranger . ‘Police found him down the road shortly afterwards and arrested him. ‘Rubins assures us that the man didn’t touch him or do anything horrible to him but I still worry what might have happened. ‘Surely it must be against the law for a stranger to go into a little boy’s bedroom without his parents’ consent.’ The couple, who have another son Mika, four months, have since decided to move, she added. ‘I couldn’t stay in that house after that. I just didn’t feel safe. We’ve had to move to another property which is more expensive but what else could we do?’ Hill, of Newport, Isle of Wight, is believed to have got in through the back door, which had been unlocked to let the family dog out earlier that morning. Police told the couple he could not be pursued for burglary or breaking and entering as he had entered via an unsecured door. Frustrated by the lack of police action, Mr Attrill traced Hill, who asked for forgiveness. ‘He admitted he was the intruder and said he was sorry,’ said Mr Attrill, who works at St Cecilia’s Abbey in Ryde. ‘A child’s bedroom should be somewhere where they feel happy to play and are safe. This could easily have made Rubins afraid of being on his own. Luckily he has coped really well.’ Hill admitted to the Daily Mail yesterday that he was the intruder – but he insisted Rubins was never in danger. He said he had lived at the property himself about two years ago and had thought he was returning home. ‘I had taken some drugs and I didn’t know where I was. It wasn’t medication, it was recreational, I wanted to get high,’ he said. ‘I’ve got children myself so there was never any reason for that boy’s parents to worry. I’ve spoken to them and told them I’m sorry so I don’t know why they keeping going on about this. ‘I was arrested and charged with causing criminal damage and possession of drugs but the police dropped all the charges. Hampshire Police said: ‘A man was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and drugs offences. He was released with no further action in respect of criminal damage and was given a formal caution for drugs offences. ‘No other criminal offences were identified by our officers.’","Drug addict Mark Hill, 24, was found sleeping in a four-year-old's bedroom .

"By . Rob Cooper . Big Fat Gypsy Wedding star Paddy Doherty headbutted his brother in the face twice during a pub fight with two siblings at a wake, a court heard today. The Channel 4 star attacked Douglas McDonagh while they were drinking at the bar. Another brother - Martin McDonagh - was initially acting as a peacemaker but snapped after hurtful comments about his son who died 16 years ago, Flintshire magistrates' court heard. Scroll down for video . Big Fat Gypsy brawl: Paddy Doherty (left) and his brother Martin McDonagh who both attacked their brother Douglas McDonagh in a pub at a wake . Martin 'lost it' and punched Douglas to the floor - before punching him twice more when he got up. The court was shown CCTV footage of the pub brawl in The Melrose public house in Shotton, Flintshire, last October. Martin, 52, and his TV star brother Paddy Doherty, . the 2011 Celebrity Big Brother winner had both previously admitted . assaulting their brother during the incident. Paddy will be sentenced at Manchester Crown Court next week on March 6, when he could face jail because the latest attack put him in breach of a suspended prison sentence. Court appearance: Paddy Doherty (right) and his brother Martin McDonagh with their solicitor Michael Sopholeous after a previous court appearance where they admitted assault . Pub brawl: The fight happened at the Melrose in Shotton, Flintshire, last October, the court was told . Prosecutor Justin Espie said that . during the incident Doherty appeared to touch the victim on his face and . the defendant’s demeanor changed. 'Doherty then head-butts him twice to the face as a result of that he falls to the floor. 'He was dragged to his feet by McDonagh,' he explained. The . prosecutor said Doherty continued with his aggressive behaviour towards . the victim and was seen with his hands in the air trying to approach . the victim but was prevented from doing so by Martin . 'who appears to be looking after the victim.' Mr Espie said that Martin McDonagh had also been hugging the victim. But then he suddenly punched him three times. Douglas . was left with a cut around three inches long above the left eye, a . small cut above the right eye and a small cut to his left ear. Michael Sopholeous, defending Martin, said that there had been a long running family dispute. That day they had travelled as a group at the request of their mother to attend the funeral of another family member. He added that Martin McDonagh was still struggling to come to terms with the death of his own son 16 years earlier. The defendant suddenly reacted when his brother said to him:  'Your son David is better off in the grave than with you.' Doherty with Sally Bercow and Ken Livingstone: The court heard there had been jealousy over the success enjoyed by some members of the family while others were struggling to get by . Success: Doherty leaving the Big Brother house after being named winner of Celebrity Big Brother in 2011 . Mr Sopholeous said Martin had never got over the death of his son. 'They were incredibly close. He turned to alcohol for support over the years but that became a problem for him,' the lawyer said. The lawyer said that the victim had confirmed that he had provoked his brother. 'Emotions were running high,' he said. There had been some jealousy within the family. 'Part of the family have had some success and parts of the family have struggled along in life. There has been jealousy between those who have had success and those who have not,' he said.

"By . Rob Cooper . A council is planning to spend £2.5million on a traveller site for just 13 caravans - which will cost as much as the average first time buyer spends to get on the property ladder. Bath and North East Somerset Council will spend £190,000 on each pitch on the green belt site while neighbouring properties sell for just £160,000. Opposition councillors have slammed the project and insisted it would be cheaper to buy properties for gypsies to live in. Greenfield site: The travellers moved into this picturesque site on the outskirts of Bath, Somerset, without permission around five years ago. It is now set to be transformed into a permanent site at taxpayers' expense . Mess: The muddy site is currently littered with rubbish and has no waste collection. The council said if it was turned into a permanent traveller site they would be able to collect council tax . Idyllic: Views of the River Avon in bath just yards from where the traveller site is located . The travellers moved onto the council-owned site without permission five years ago. Once the building work is finished, each one of the 13 secluded spots on the green belt site will have its own driveway and street lighting. The entire site will also be surrounded with soundproofing to block out noise from the nearby road and railway so the travellers can get a good night's sleep. The Liberal Democrat-controlled council has allocated £1.72million to spend on the site, with a further £750,000 potentially being provided by central government. If they spend the full amount, it will work out as £190,000 per pitch, while the average price paid by first time buyers to get on the property ladder was £189,000 in December. A two-storey masionette is currently on sale on the same road for £159,000. Tim Warren, Conservative councillor for the Mendip area, said: 'The issue is the cost - it would be cheaper to buy 13 houses with drives. 'We have a moral duty to make traveller sites but we also have a moral duty to look after taxpayers' money. Location: The traveller's site is just off the Lower Bristol Road (marked in red) on the outskirts of Bath. The city centre is on the right of this map, and the site is around two miles out of the centre . Streetview: The traveller site as seen from the Lower Bristol Road, around two miles outside the centre of Bath . Traveller site: A council is planning on spending up to £2.5million to turn this make this temporary traveller site permanent with 13 pitches - at a cost of £190,000 each . Row: Opposition councillors have condemned the cost of turning this into a permanent travellers' site - and said it would be cheaper to buy everyone a house . 'If you took every penny that Twerton collects in council tax, that site would use 85 per cent of the money.' Liz Richardson, Shadow Cabinet Member for Housing and Chew Valley North Councillor said: 'I haven't ever come across another site that has cost that kind of money. 'It's not as if they're putting them into Georgian terraces. 'The average spend across the UK for a traveller site is about £63,000. And the council owns this land - we haven't even got to buy it.' The site, in Twerton, Bath, is located in a field off the main road two miles outside the city centre. It is expected to be ready by March 2015 but planning permission is yet to be granted. There will be eight permanent plots and five plots for caravans in transit. A spokesman for Bath and North East Somerset Council said they hoped to keep the final cost of the project down to £1.72million. Tim Ball, Twerton councillor and Cabinet Member for Homes and Planning, said the council has set a £1.8m 'ceiling' figure for its contribution towards the project. He blamed the high cost on the fact that the site is located both in a green belt and on a World Heritage Site. The site is currently a transit traveller area but it is not yet regulated by the council meaning that no rent or council tax can be collected. High cost: Making this traveller site permanent will cost up to £2.5million - with the money being spent on soundproofing, new roads and lighting . But once completed the site will generate £6,000 per tenant per year and become 'cost neutral' Mr Ball added. 'Once the site becomes official the residents will have to pay rents and council tax,' he said. Mr Ball said that by creating an official site, the council will avoid costs such as moving travellers on and taking legal action. 'There's no official transit site in Bath and North East Somerset - that's a requirement for the government,' he said. Mr Ball said that his constituents had not raised any concerns about the site. He said: 'The community accepts that the site needs to be cleaned up - no one has come to me saying there is a problem.' Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance said that it would be cheaper to buy everyone a house than build the pitches. 'Taxpayers will rightly question why they have been landed with such a large bill for the development of this site,' he said. 'Providing pitches for travellers shouldn't cost the earth, and at this price the authorities could just about buy a house for every pitch, let alone build one. 'The council need to set a reasonable budget, and then stick to it, to ensure the whole scheme provides value for taxpayers’ money.' Gypsy camp: The group of travellers moved onto this bit of land (centre) around five years ago - after this satellite image was taken . Iconic: The council said they needed to spend so much money 'soundproofing' the site because the city of Bath is a Unesco World Heritage Site.

"By . Tom Kelly . and Nick Fagge . Free: Shajul Islam, who was accused of kidnapping a British journalist in Syria, leaving Belmarsh prison last night. All charges were dropped today . An NHS doctor accused of kidnapping two journalists in Syria is expected to return to practising medicine in Britain after the case against him collapsed yesterday. Shajul Islam was alleged to have been a ‘key figure’ in the militant group that abducted British photographer John Cantlie and his Dutch colleague Jeroen Oerlemans. The pair were held at gunpoint, shackled and blindfolded, and told to prepare to ‘meet their maker’ after straying into a terror camp while covering the civil war in Syria last year. Islam and his alleged accomplice, fellow British resident Jubayer Chowdhury, walked free after prosecutors said the victims were unable to give evidence. The doctor’s brother, Najul Islam, who was accused of helping to bankroll the operation and supplying equipment, was also formally cleared. Islam, 27, from Stratford in East London, was given an interim suspension by the General Medical Council after being charged last year. But the suspension could be dropped after his acquittal and his friends say that if it is, they expect him to return to medicine as soon as possible. Islam had always denied involvement in the kidnapping and said he travelled to Syria on a humanitarian mission soon after completing his training at St Bartholomew’s Hospital in London. Prosecutors had claimed at a previous hearing that he joined a camp of jihadists, including 15 British nationals, and became a ‘key figure’ because, as a doctor, he was ‘much respected’. The journalists were taken hostage in July last year because the jihadists believed they were spies when they entered the camp to try to interview rebel fighters, the earlier hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court was told. Allegation: John Cantlie, a British photojournalist, who was held captive by Islamic extremists in Syria for nine days before the Free Syrian Army stormed the camp and freed him and Dutch photographer Jeroen Oerlemans . Mr Cantlie and Mr Oerlemans feared . they would be executed and tried to escape, but were shot at and . injured, the hearing was told. They were released after nine days when the Free Syria Army stormed the camp near the border with Turkey. Denial: Henry Blaxland QC said Mr Islam played no part in any acts of terrorism or false imprisonment . Islam was arrested at Heathrow last October after he arrived on a flight from Egypt with his wife and one-year-old daughter. He and Chowdhury, 25, had both denied unlawful imprisonment under terror laws. Islam’s brother Najul, 32, had denied engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts. The . three men had been expected to stand trial at Kingston Crown Court in . Surrey yesterday, but at the start of the hearing, prosecutor Mark . Dennis QC said: ‘The two victims in the case are the two prosecution . witnesses on which the case rested wholly on their evidence. ‘The prosecution are unable to call either victim for the purposes of the trial listed.’ Mr . Dennis added: ‘We notified the defence on Friday evening that the . prosecution will be offering no evidence when the case was listed.’ He then told the court: ‘I formally offer no evidence.’ He gave no reasons why the victims were unable to give evidence. Judge Nicholas Price QC said: ‘I understand, and I formally record verdicts of not guilty for each of the three defendants.’ Henry . Blaxland QC, for Islam, told the court his client ‘played no part in . any kidnappings and is relieved that this case has come to an end and he . has been cleared’. Last week MI5 head Andrew Parker told a parliamentary committee the threat of ‘terror tourism’ to Syria was growing. He . warned: ‘We’ve seen low hundreds of people from this country go to . Syria for periods and come back – some large numbers are still there – . and get involved in fighting. It is a very important strand of the . threat we face.’","Shajul Islam was due to stand trial alongside co-accused Jubair Chowdhury and his brother Najul Islam at Kingston Crown Court but walked free today .

"By . Chris Pleasance . When it comes to flying, most people hope for a quiet flight without any interruptions from noisy passengers. But for 178 people flying from Seattle to Hawaii on Wednesday, that illusion was quickly shattered when a man began chanting loudly. In fact, his chanting was so disturbing that the captain turned the plane around after his fellow travelers complained he was making them nervous. Alaska Airlines flight 877 was forced to turn around 90 minutes into a journey from Seattle to Hawaii after a passenger began chanting loudly and refused to stop . A spokesman for Alaska Airlines said crew were unable to understand what the man was saying, and couldn't figure out a reason for his behaviour. Airlines spokesman Nancy Trott added that flight attendants tried to reason with the man, but without any success. The plane, which initially took off from Sea-Tac airport, landed back at the same airport at 9.30pm where the man was handed over to waiting police officers. Crew said they tried to reason with the man, but with no success. A spokesman for the airline added that he was handed over to police when he arrived back at Sea-Tac airport, but was not arrested . Authorities said the man did not have to be restrained during the flight, and was not arrested after landing, but was simply told to rebook with another airline. Flight 877 then continued its journey to Kona, Hawaii, where it landed at 1.16am local time. Ms Trott added that that pilot made the right decision for the safety of everyone on board.","Man began chanting loudly 90 minutes into flight from Seattle to Hawaii .

"By . Leesa Smith . Three daring Darwin men have been captured on film using their thongs to fight a grass fire caused by a firecracker on the Northern Territory’s annual day to set off fireworks across the state. Laughter erupted from bemused onlookers as the bare foot men made the halfhearted attempt to put out the billowing blaze with one man encouraging them to ‘keep going for it’ while fireworks can be heard going off in the background. The footage shows another man using the garden hose in an attempt to control the fire before a fire engine turns up to save the day, and a fireman extinguishes the blaze with a hose from the truck. Scroll down for video . One of the three men who attempted to put out a grass fire caused by a firecracker in Darwin on Northern Territory's firecracker night . Bemused onlookers urged the three men to keep going with their attempts to put out the fire . Bushfires NT director Mark Ashley describes the attempts by the men as inappropriate . A Northern Territory Fire and Rescue spokeswoman told MailOnline she was not aware of the incident but there were 70 incidents that firefighters had been called out to that night. ‘I was down there in amongst it and there were a lot of people doing a lot of strange things, so I’m not really surprised, although it hasn’t been brought to our attention,’ she said. More firecrackers wreaked havoc in Stuart Park with a boat catching alight and at Bees Creek where a firecracker torpedoed into a hayshed and burnt it down. Despite these dramatic scenes, authorities were impressed with the behaviour of most Territorians on the only day of the year when it is legal for locals to let off firecrackers as part of the Territory Day celebrations. Bushfires NT director Mark Ashley had expected 30 to 50 significant fires, however  there was just one main incident where 100 hectares were burned at Acacia Gap, but wasn’t a threat to homes or people, and just nine fires in total. Mr Ashley described the actions of the men who used their thongs as 'Inappropriate'. He advised people should have a bucket of water nearby on firecracker night in case of a fire. There have been 15 people so far who have turned up to emergency departments and clinics with fire cracker injuries, with most suffering burnt hands and fingers. The most major incidents were when a 19 year-old woman was struck in the ear while another suffered burns to the neck. The garden hose was put to use before the fire brigade turned up . Public Health Registrar Pasqualina Coffey said this was a significantly low number compared to last year with 25 – 35 incidents reported. ‘Although it varies from year to year – we have been monitoring it since 1998 and there seems to be no overall trend,’ she said. But Ms Coffey said it was expected more people would come forward with injuries over the coming days as their condition worsened and possible further firecrackers being let off. The men breath a sigh of relief as the Fire and Rescue service arrive on the scene .

"By . Leesa Smith . A father was stunned when he returned to find his car scratched and an abusive note on his windscreen telling him not to park in a 'parents only' space outside a shopping centre. Adam Scarlett returned to his Toyota Hilux dual-cab ute outside Woolworths in Mona Vale, on Sydney's Northern Beaches, with his three year-old son Willo on Sunday to discover the scrawled letter, lambasting him for not being a 'parent with a pram'. Although he didn't use a pram, Mr Scarlett held his son's hand and put him in a nearby trolley - enough for him to feel the wrath of a fellow shopper. Adam Scarlett was shocked to receive this note on his car when he came back from shopping at Woolworths, in Mona Vale, on Sunday . ‘You are not a ""parent with pram"" you lazy f****** t****r,' the note said. 'I have just let your tyres down and scratched your ute. Have a nice day and remember p***!!!' Mr Scarlett's wife Philippa was so horrified by the incident she decided to post the note on a Facebook page called Northern Beaches Mums Facebook. ‘It left a bitter taste in my mouth,’ she told the MailOnline. ‘I hoped that the woman saw it on the page and felt ashamed.' Ms Scarlett said her husband believed it was a woman who was waiting to park in the ‘parent with pram space’ next to him and shook her head for having to wait until he got his son out of the car. 'My husband took my son by the hand and walked him over to put him in a trolley,' she said. 'There's no way he would walk around the supermarket for a full grocery shop.’ The irate driver scratched Adam Scarlett's car . Even though the tyres were not slashed, Ms Scarlett described the reaction as 'overkill'. 'It doesn't matter whether they had a bad day or not - they must have had nothing better to do' she said. 'We are completely in the right to park there, as far as I’ve been told the parking sign doesn’t mean you have to have a pram in the car - it means you have small children so it's OK to park there to carry them in or put them in a trolley.' Abusive notes being left on cars parked in ‘parent with pram’ spaces has been an ongoing  problem across Sydney’s northern beaches, she said. 'The issue has come up at least four times this year on the mums' page,' she said. Two mothers replied to Ms Scarlett’s post saying they had experienced similar experiences. ‘Sounds like the nut job that abused me in Frenchs Forest on Friday. Report her!’  Theresa Amos said. While Honie Farrington said ‘same thing happen to me but they snapped one of my windscreen wipers off’.

Greek police said today they have arrested a childless couple in Athens on suspicion of buying an eight-month-old Roma girl and trying to register her as their own. The arrest comes amid an international search for the parents of another little girl known as Maria who was found living with unrelated Gypsies in Greece. Bulgarian authorities are now trying to establish whether local Roma woman Sasha Ruseva, 35, is the mother of Maria, a strikingly-fair girl aged 5 or 6. The woman has been tested for a DNA match and served with preliminary charges of child selling, but has not been detained.

In Bulgaria: A Bulgarian Roma girl smiles holding a toddler on her back in a Roma neighborhood of Nikolaevo, where Maria's alleged family are from . The case of Maria has drawn global . attention, playing on the shocking possibility of children being stolen . from their parents and sold.

Authorities are looking for the baby's birth parents and potential intermediaries in the alleged transaction. The suspects, aged 53 and 48, were expected to be charged later today with child abduction, which under Greek law can include cases where a minor is voluntarily given away by its parents outside the legal adoption process. The same charges were brought against the couple with whom Maria was found living in a Roma settlement outside Farsala, in central Greece, a week ago. They have been jailed pending trial and are also suspected of fraudulently obtaining birth certificates for a total 14 children. 'Blonde angel': The arrest comes amid an international search for the parents of another little girl known as Maria (left) who was found living with unrelated Gypsies in Greece. Bulgarian authorities are now trying to . establish whether local Roma woman Sasha Ruseva (right), 35, is her mother .

Concern: The case of Maria has drawn global attention, playing on the shocking possibility of children being stolen from their parents and sold . Charges: The suspects, aged 53 and 48, were expected to be charged later today with child abduction, which under Greek law can include cases where a minor is voluntarily given away by its parents outside the legal adoption process . Scam? Greek authorities are trying to work out whether the children all exist, or whether the alleged document fraud was part of a welfare scam - the couple allegedly received more than 2,500 euros a month in family benefits . Greek authorities are trying to work out whether the children all exist, or whether the alleged document fraud was part of a welfare scam - the couple allegedly received more than 2,500 euros a month in family benefits. They insist they were looking after Maria with their own five children after an informally arranged adoption. The girl was placed into the care of a children's charity and her DNA details were provided to Interpol which has so far failed to match her to any missing children declared in its records, from Poland to the U.S. Informal: The couple in Greece insist they were looking after Maria with their own five children after an informally arranged adoption (pictured: a Roma family in Bulgaria) Charges: The same abduction charges were brought against the couple with whom Maria was found living in this Roma settlement outside Farsala, in central Greece, a week ago . It comes after mother-of-ten Mrs Ruseva, the Bulgarian Roma woman believed to be the real mother of Maria - dubbed the 'blonde angel' - demanded authorities hand her daughter back. Mrs Ruseva, 35, claimed she did not sell Maria, now four, but was forced to leave her daughter with a friend in Greece as a baby because she could not afford the legal documents required to take her home to Bulgaria. But the Daily Mail can reveal that a woman of her name has twice previously been arrested for trying to sell babies in Greece – and on both occasions skipped bail. A DNA test has confirmed Sasha Ruseva a Bulgarian Roma woman is the mother of a mystery girl known as Maria, found living with a couple in Greece . The Mail tracked down Mrs Ruseva, who police believe will be shown by DNA tests to be Maria’s real mother, to an impoverished gypsy camp in Nikolaevo in rural Bulgaria where her family share a one-room home without running water. Her husband Atana Rusev, 37, has an albino gene in his family that may have resulted in Maria’s blonde hair and pale complexion. Five of the couple’s other children are blonde and closely resemble Maria. Mystery has surrounded the identity of the parents of the blue-eyed girl since she was discovered after police raided a Roma gypsy camp in central Greece last week. A couple who posed as her parents for four years to make money from her begging are believed to have bought the child for £850. Maria’s case attracted global attention, with thousands of calls from people who believe they may know her identity. Mrs Ruseva wept yesterday as she insisted: ‘I did not sell Maria, nor did I give her away. For the past four years I have never forgotten Maria. I pray for her every day. I want her back, I want her back.’ Mother-of-ten Sasha Ruseva, 35, whose children are pictured here, claims she did not sell Maria . A woman with the name Sasha Ruseva has twice previously been arrested for trying to sell babies in Greece . Mrs Ruseva, who was just 13 when she had her first child, said she was pregnant with Maria when she went to Greece to work as a field hand on a farm with her husband. She said her eldest daughter remained in Bulgaria to look after her other children but that arrangement stopped when she got married and wanted to move out, forcing Mrs Ruseva to return home. She claimed she could not bring Maria back with her as the Greek authorities required she pay ‘hundreds of euros’ for a birth certificate for her daughter, which she could not afford. She said: ‘I gave birth to Maria about four and a half years ago. I can’t remember the exact date. ‘I cared for Maria for seven months but I had to come back to Bulgaria look after my other children. ‘I left my daughter with my room-mate. She is also Roma. When I left Maria I asked the woman to send  her to Bulgaria. But she hasn’t. I cannot remember her name, it was four years ago. This is the family's one-bedroom home in the impoverished gypsy camp in Nikolaevo in rural Bulgaria . ‘I missed Maria but I don’t have any . money so I did not know what to do. I called the woman several times and . I knew she was safe and well. I don’t know why she kept her so long, . why they did not send her back to me. ‘I . don’t have enough money to call the woman in Greece any more so I . stopped trying to get in touch with her. I didn’t know what was . happening with my child. But I have never stopped wanting her, she is my . own flesh and blood.’ Mrs Ruseva and her husband registered the birth of a child four years ago at a hospital in Lamia, an hour from the Farsala camp where Maria was found. Greek police think Maria may have been sold on by a baby-smuggling gang who offer newborns to childless couples for up to £22,000. It is believed that Maria was sold for a knockdown price because police were moving in on child smugglers in the area.","Couple, aged 53 and 48, allegedly paid a Roma woman 4,000 euros for baby .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Police sniffer dogs are being brought in to search the cars of two suspects questioned over the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, it has been reported. South Wales police confirmed they have sent two victim detection dogs across to Portugal to help Metropolitan Police officers with their investigations. Four arguidos - or 'persons of interest' - were quizzed in Portugal on Tuesday as part of the latest stage of the Metropolitan Police’s multi-million-pound reinvestigation of the case. Officers from Operation Grange are believed to be using sniffer dogs to search the cars of two suspects quizzed earlier this week (it is not known if the men pictured are the ones having their vehicles inspected) Scotland Yard officers were present during the questioning of four men earlier this week at a police station in Faro (pictured) as part of a reinvestigation of Madeleine McCann's disappearance . None of the suspects have been identified by police though three are believed to be Portuguese while another is originally from Russia . The suspects are said to be three Portuguese nationals and Russian computer expert Sergey Malinka, whose Praia da Luz home was searched by police shortly after Madeleine went missing in May 2007. A spokesman for South Wales police told MailOnline: 'I can confirm that two South Wales Police specialist dog handlers, and victim detection dogs, have been deployed to assist with the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. 'The officers are working as part of a small team of team of British police officers, led by Metropolitan Police Service, in conjunction with the Portuguese authorities. 'They can be deployed in a wide a variety of locations such as buildings, open areas and vehicles.' According to the Daily Mirror, the animals will search cars belonging to two of the suspects being quizzed by officers from Operation Grange. The dogs, 7-year-old English Springer Spaniels named Tito and Muzzy, were used in the search for April Jones in 2012. The four men emerged as key suspects after analysis of mobile phone records suggested they were close to the scene of her disappearance when she went missing. Madeleine, then aged three, went missing from the Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz in May 2007 . Sniffer dogs were earlier used by officers to search waste ground near to the site where Madeleine vanished . Officers from Operation Grange scoured three sites in Praia da Luz but found no new evidence . All of those being questioned are Portuguese citizens, while one is believed to be of Russian origin. They have all been summoned to be interviewed but there have been no arrests. In June, Portuguese and British police searched three sites in Praia da Luz but found no evidence relating to the case. Scotland Yard said at the time that ‘more activity’ had been agreed with Portuguese police and the searches were the ‘first phase’ of a major investigation. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, who is leading the Metropolitan Police inquiry, was among those present at the interviews earlier this week. The new round of questioning comes less than three weeks after police dug up waste land near the Ocean Club where the McCann family were staying at the time of their daughter's disappearance. Officers inspected sewers using a hi-tech camera over nearly a fortnight in a grim search for Madeleine's body. The search and this week's police quizzes have happened at the request by Operation Grange detectives leading the British hunt for Madeleine. Scotland Yard are working on the theory burglars killed Madeleine during a bungled break-in while her parents ate tapas nearby with friends - and then buried her body on waste ground in the resort.","South Wales police have sent two victim detection dogs to Portugal .

Mohammed Fahim Ahamed Riyad took the moving image as a fire tore through Dhaka the capital of Bangladesh destroying around 400 shanty homes and killing four people. The powerful photograph shows a fireman searching for signs of life amidst the wreckage left behind by the disaster. The winner: Photographer Mohammad Fahim Ahamed Riyad, Bangladesh, won the Atkins CIWEM for his photograph of a fireman looking for signs of life after a fire in Dhaka, Bangladesh . Faisal Azim, Bangladesh, was awarded winner of the Atkins City Scape Award 2014 for this photograph of beggars in Bangladesh . Mr Fahim Ahamed Riyad said: 'About 400 shanty homes were gutted and four people died in this incident, including a child of six years old. 'However, no casualties were ever officially reported and the reason for the fire remains unknown.' Launched in 2007 by the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management  the exhibition showcases the best in environmental photography and film. This year, there were more than 1,000 entries which were judged on impact, composition, originality and technical ability by the panel of expert judges. Selector Brigitte Lardinois said: 'This image of a helmeted fire-fighter amidst the smoking ruins evokes the heroism of civic society coping with calamity. This entry by Prasanta Biswas, India, of a lady collecting rainwater in West Bengal, India, in 2012 . British photographer Ashley Cooper's picture of a collapsed coastal road between Skipsea and Ulrome on Yorkshire's east coast in 2013 was one of the finalists . Alnis Stakle, from Latvia, entered this picture of a suburb with semi-cleared old buildings in preparation for the construction of new skyscraper precincts in Shanghai, 2013 . 'The caption contradicts our expectations, recounting a shanty town devastated by a fire whose dead go unreported, its cause unrecorded. 'This photograph gains power from the contrast between evocation of heroic endeavour and a sense of dispiriting futility.' The final 94 works will now go on display at the Royal Geographical Society, London, from June 23 until July 4 - then touring nationally until November.

"By . Leesa Smith . A pregnant 15-year-old girl who penned a heartfelt letter about her fears of becoming a young mother and how she dealt with the public's reaction has been stunned by the positive response she has received. Georgie Hageman, from Auckland, New Zealand, said she often got disapproving looks as she walked down the street and felt she needed to write about her experiences as her due date approached. The letter, which impressed her father so much he sent it to a local newspaper, prompted huge support from mums-to-be - both young and old - around the world. 'When I’m having a hard time, I write things down so I can put my feelings into perspective  – a bit like venting on paper,' Georgie, who is 36 weeks pregnant, told MailOnline, with her father's permission. Georgia Hageman's letter about being a pregnant teenager has received support from all over the world . 'No outsider will ever understand what a teen parent goes through until it happens to them. It's so easy to say that they've ruined their life.' 'I do miss my old life sometimes, but my role in this world has changed and that's okay.' 'It's no longer about me; it's about my gorgeous baby boy who I will be meeting in a few weeks.' 'There is a life that is relying on you, and no matter who stares, who judges, who talks, the fact that you're staying strong for that child is success.' 'Next time you go to judge somebody about their age and situation, I can tell you with 100 per cent confidence they know what they're missing out on and they know how their life will never be the same as yours and they do not need reminding.' Excerpts from Georgia' open letter that was published in The New Zealand Herald . Georgia's honest and heartfelt words struck a chord with people on social media across the globe - particularly teenage mums and mums-to-be. ‘I have had girls from other countries like Australia and America thanking me for doing the article because they felt they could relate to it and they said I spoke up on behalf of them,' she said. 'I was incredibly shocked by the reaction but it was also really amazing.' Georgia told other young pregnant girls in the letter, sent to The New Zealand Herald, not to ‘let the stares and whispers win, prove them wrong’. 'Most days it would be so much easier to give up, but the truth is there is another human being inside of you and you're their mummy,' she wrote. She said although it can be humiliating to draw so much unwanted attention, all that mattered was her son, whom she has already named Mason ahead of his expected arrival on July 22. ‘I just walk around trying to hold my head high and think within myself that people can judge but I know the deeper meaning to the story,’ she told the MailOnline. Georgia has already named her unborn son, Mason, who is due to be born on July 22 . She said that teenage pregnancy was often associated with irresponsible behaviour but this was not the case in her situation. 'I have never drunk or smoked,' she said. 'I was just with the person I loved.' Georgia said in the letter that she 'shared a bond and connection that I had never had with anyone else before'. 'We took a step into the unknown, and that was the day that my life changed forever,' she wrote. 'I do miss my old life sometimes, but my role in this world has changed and that's okay,' she wrote. 'It's no longer about me; it's about my gorgeous baby boy who I will be meeting in a few weeks.' Although, Georgia admitted to feeling terrified about breaking the news to her parents in November, she said their support had been unwavering. Georgia wouldn't change being pregnant for the world (the ultrasound of her son on May 15 pictured) Georgia admitted that it took her a few months to completely come to terms with her pregnancy but now she 'wouldn't change it for the world'. 'A lot of times I wish I could be a normal teenager – still attending school - but for me there’s a lot to look forward to,' she said. 'It's not all about having a normal teenagehood, it’s about having a different one.' Georgia (pictured with her horse, Milo) is eternally grateful for the unwavering support from her parents since she told them about her pregnancy .","Georgie Hageman,15, wrote an open letter about how dramatically her life has changed since discovering she was pregnant .

"By . Leon Watson . One of the three British jihadists who joined terror group Isis in Syria has used ask.fm to urge others to join the fight. In a series of new online postings, 17-year-old militant Aseel Muthana, from Cardiff, south Wales, told a would-be jihadist how he felt 'so excited' before leaving for the Middle East. He also told another fanatic on the social network answer-and-question site to pray 'every night' in order to realise a dream of joining him in Syria. Scroll down for video . Young recruit: 17-year-old Aseel Muthana was allegedly a member of a violent Cardiff gang before he fled to join his brother Nasser fighting for Isis in Syria . Aseel made worldwide headlines last month when it emerged how he, brother Nasser, 20, and friend Reyaad Khan, 20, had joined the Islamist extremist group. In an interview with the BBC last week said 'Jihad is obligatory' and how he was willing to die for Isis, which has taken over large swathes of Syria and Iraq. In his latest postings on ask.fm, Aseel was told by a would-be Isis fighter: 'I love the khalifa (Islamic state) even more from my heart, I wish I was there so badly.' The teenager replied: 'I remember a couple months before I left I had those feelings. I was so excited, I didn't even want to wait. I used to wish I was there.' When the questioner asks whether they need to go through tazkiyah (a spiritual transformation) before joining him, Aseel replies: 'We can sort something out'. Details of his latest online posts came as the UK Treasury announced it had frozen the bank accounts of the two older men, who have both appeared in an Isis recruitment video. Cardiff link: Britons Reyaad Khan and Nasser Muthana appeared in this Isis recruitment video this month . Cardiff militant Aseel Muthana used the social network answer-and-question site ask.fm (pictured) to tell a fanatic to pray 'every night' in order to realise a dream of joining him in Syria . Violent: Brother Nasser Muthana also tweeted a picture of a weapon that he hoped would help decapitate an enemy . They both feature on a list, published on Friday evening, of 25 individuals and 27 organisations facing sanctions. Isis has demanded officials and soldiers pledge allegiance to the Islamic state they recently declared or face execution. More than one million Iraqis have fled their homes after Isis seized Mosul, Tikrit and other cities in the north-west. At least 2,461 people were killed in June, the UN and Iraqi officials say. The Muthana brothers and Khan appear to be using social media to talk about brutal executions and life on the frontline. Aseel has defended the brutality of Isis killings in Syria by saying he stood by Sharia law and was glad to be out there. In one account Nasser mocked the publicity which followed the release of the Isis video in which he called for others to join the fight in Syria. He gave a graphic account of a battle and referred to beheadings. In one comment he said: 'Two tanks were taken... and we brought back heads with us.' And on a Twitter account, which has since been suspended, Nasser sent his friends a chilling picture showing an apparent stash of home-made bombs - and warned that the British Government should be 'afraid' about him returning with his new skills. He also posted a chilling photograph which appears to show a home-made weapon believed to be taken from an enemy Shia Muslim - and his plan to behead the captive fighter. The brothers' devastated father Ahmed Muthana has appealed for them to come home. He said: ‘This is not the son I know. Maybe if they have a heart they’ll come back. ‘What they are doing or posting online, they are being told to by the people with the guns who feed them, look after them and have control over them. They are trapped in the situation and that makes it hard for them to come back or leave the place.' Meanwhile, Khan yesterday posted what he claimed were the latest details of factional in-fighting between Isis and al-Qaeda offshoot Jabhat al-Nusra. He wrote: 'Caught a convoy of JN murtadeen, over 100 prisoners, heavy weapons, cars etc and an ex-JN shari'i just spoke back 2 JN telling them 2 make tawbah [repentance].'

"By . Leon Watson . A British investigator and his American wife who were hired by UK drugs giant GlaxoSmithKline are to face trial in China charged with illegally obtaining and selling private information. Prosecutors in Shanghai have filed charges against Peter Humphrey, 58, and Yingzeng Yu, 61, the official Xinhua news agency said. The couple's arrest last year coincided with a Chinese probe into allegations that Glaxo staff had funnelled hundreds of millions of pounds through travel agencies to bribe doctors and health officials to boost sales and raise prices. Charged: Peter Humphrey, 58, was paraded on Chinese state TV with his wife Yingzeng Yu, 61. They are accused of illegally obtaining and selling private information . Mr Humphrey and his wife are accused of obtaining information on Chinese citizens by illegally buying it from others, as well as with hidden cameras, or by following people . Their trial, reportedly due to take place next month, will be behind closed doors but the Foreign Office said it was pressing China to allow UK embassy staff to attend. The latest development in the saga saw Mr Humphrey and his wife appear wearing orange vests on state broadcaster CCTV. They are accused of obtaining information on Chinese citizens by illegally buying it from others, as well as with hidden cameras, or by following people. It is said that the couple, who ran the Shanghai-based corporate intelligence and consulting firm ChinaWhys, compiled information for reports to clients that were mainly multinational companies such as Glaxo. Mr Humphery's American wife Yingzeng Yu, 61, was also shown on state TV while in custody . Senior Glaxo executive Mark Reilly, pictured here with one of his daughters, has been accused by Chinese authorities in relation to bribery claims in a separate investigation . Peter Humphrey and Yingzeng Yu were hired by UK drugs giant GlaxoSmithKline, which is at the centre of corruption allegations in China . In media reports from China today, Mr Humphrey said he had been contacted in April last year by Glaxo's China manager Mark Reilly who wanted him to find out who had leaked bribery allegations to Chinese authorities and senior Glaxo executives. It has also been reported that the investigators were looking into the origin of a sex tape involving Mr Reilly - who has himself been accused by Chinese authorities in relation to the bribery claims. Mr Humphrey said on state television that he found out during his investigation that the bribery claims were true, and that he felt 'betrayed and used' by Glaxo. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of Mr Humphrey's case and are continuing to provide consular assistance to him and his family. 'Although the court has announced that it will be a closed trial, we have made clear to the Chinese authorities that we would like Embassy staff to attend the trial and the need for a transparent and fair process. We will continue to do this.' Glaxo had yet to respond to a request for comment.

Wu Lei, 54, from Taiwan, was so keen on 23-year-old Ling Lin he went to the hairdresser and asked for a short back and sides that would help him stand out. And he got it when his hair was styled into a perfectly right-angled flat top - a bit like a Lego man. With that, he thought he could corner her. Scroll down for video . Edgy: Wu Lei, 54, said he had wanted to impress a 23-year-old girl who he had tried to chat up but who had rejected his advances . Unfortunately, it didn't work and Wu's beau rejected his advances. Ling said the hairdo had made her even more unlikely to respect him as he looked like a Lego figure or character from the video game 'Warcraft'. She added: 'My friends call him blockhead, I can imagine he might have found someone as he had a good and respectable job as a medical laboratory scientist at the National Taiwan University Hospital. But he should act his age.' Wu who is still single despite the expensive hairdo said: 'I can't understand it. I make an attractive monthly income of TWD 70,000 (£1,400). Bit of a square: The young woman, Ling Lin, said the hairdo had made her even more unlikely to respect him as he looked like a lego figure . Cornering her: Wu, who is still single despite the expensive hairdo, said: 'I can't understand it' 'I adopted this hairstyle because I wanted to look like a guy in his 20s or 30s to attract the girl who rejected me. Or in fact any girl.' Styling his hair was not an easy task. He reportedly needs to use up two cans of gel and spends two hours doing his hair. He can also only comb it once every 15 days to get rid of dead hair. But the hairdo and the media coverage it attracted has made Wu a hit on the streets, with people pointing out 'Blockhead' to their kids and taking snaps of him. The famous local comic artist Cherng Li even featured Wu in one of his stories after seeing him on the metro, saying 'I could not get his figure out of my mind, so I had to put it onto paper.'","Wu Lei, 54, from Taiwan, wanted a cut that would help him stand out .

"By . Leon Watson . A businessman has won a legal case against easyJet after challenging the airline's sky-high cancellation fees for a flight. Father-of-three Adam Rubens, of Bushey, Hertfordshire, had booked a ticket to Tel Aviv, Israel, last December, but changed his plans half an hour later. The budget carrier charged the 47-year-old a total of £135 to cancel the £306 he paid for the flight and extra fees. 'Unreasonable': Budget airline easyJet charged businessman Adam Rubens a total of £135 to cancel a £306 flight he booked in December, which Mr Rubens claimed was a 'rip-off . On top of a £60 flight cancellation fee and £17 credit card charge easyJet also 'retained' the £38 baggage fee and £20 seat allocation fee. Mr Rubens said he was happy to pay the cancellation fee and credit card charge, but claimed the additional charges were only legally enforceable if they were seen to be 'reasonable'. Deputy District Judge Kenneth Arnold rejected easyJet's claim at Watford County Court it was entitled to the full fees because Mr Rubens agreed to the terms and conditions. Instead, Judge Arnold ruled easyJet's terms and conditions were 'unreasonable'. He awarded Mr Rubens his £58 baggage and seat fees plus £50 legal costs. EasyJet told The Sun on Sunday the policy was 'clearly stated in our terms and conditions which passengers agree to' 'That's the equivalent of 44 per cent as a cancellation charge,' he told the Jewish Chronicle. 'In my opinion, that was wholly unreasonable and I challenged them to justify it. 'Their response was that they were entitled to make those deductions under their terms and conditions.' He added: 'This was never about the money. It was all about the principle that one should not accept what is blatantly unfair. 'This has implications for millions of passengers travelling using budget airlines. Too many people accept their fate because it is written in a company's terms and conditions. 'The court held that those terms still have to pass the test of reasonableness.' An EasyJet spokeswoman said: 'easyJet is a non-refundable airline and our cancellation policy is clearly stated in our terms and conditions, which passengers agree to and acknowledge as part of the booking process. 'easyJet permits refunds within 24 hours of the booking subject to a cancellation fee of £30 per passenger, per flight which allows customers to retrieve money from an unwanted flight while covering our administration costs.'","Adam Rubens booked a ticket to Israel but cancelled half an hour later .

"By . Leon Watson . Uganda's main airport is under a major terror alert today after the U.S. embassy in Kampala warned of a 'specific threat' by an unknown group. The alert came as travellers flying to the U.S. from Europe and the Middle East faced tighter security because of new concerns about the development of explosives that could circumvent airport security. 'The US embassy has received information from the Uganda police force that according to intelligence sources there is a specific threat to attack Entebbe International Airport by an unknown terrorist group today, July 3rd, between the hours of 9pm and 11pm (6pm GMT to 8pm GMT),' the statement said. UPDF soldiers and police forces patrol streets in Kampala with a tactical operation vehicle after the US embassy in Uganda warned of a 'specific threat' UPDF soldiers and police forces perform spot checks on travellers during patrols in the streets of Kampala . Although it did not name any group, Al-Qaeda linked Shebab insurgents have claimed recent attacks in Kenya and Djibouti, and at home in Somalia. Uganda has troops in Somalia as part of the African Union force fighting the Shebab and is on high alert amid fears of attacks by the Islamist militants. Army spokesman Paddy Ankunda said troops had been deployed at the airport and in the capital, some 20 miles from Entebbe. 'People must be vigilant in the face of this threat, report any suspicious individuals seen in their areas,' he said, calling on people to 'stay calm and alert.' An AFP reporter said there was a heavy security presence, with soldiers marching down city streets, including special forces and snipers. The U.S. embassy suggested people planning travel through the airport during Thursday evening should review their plans in light of the warning. The U.S. embassy in Kampala warned of a 'specific threat' by unknown group to Entebbe International Airport . UPDF soldiers and police forces patrol streets in Kampala. The alert came as travellers flying to the United States from Europe and the Middle East faced tighter security because of new concerns about the development of explosives that could circumvent airport security . Entebbe's airport, on the shores of the vast Lake Victoria, was the site of the daring 1976 raid by Israeli special forces to free hostages . It also warned its citizens of a general threat of attacks which could target hotels, restaurants, clubs, malls, diplomatic missions, government buildings and transport. But government spokesman Ofwono Opondo said the United States was being 'over sensitive in their warning', and urged people to continue with travel plans as normal. 'All the security measures have been taken,' he said. 'We encourage people to go on with their business.' The Shebab claimed responsibility for the assault on the Westgate shopping centre that killed at least 67 people in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi in September last year as well as for two nighttime attacks on the Kenyan coast last month that killed around 60 people. In May, a male and female suicide bomber blew themselves up in an attack on restaurant popular with Westerners in central Djibouti, killing a Turkish national. Entebbe's airport, on the shores of the vast Lake Victoria, was the site of the daring 1976 raid by Israeli special forces to free hostages kidnapped on board an Air France aircraft by Palestinian and German gunmen. Last month the U.S. warned citizens of the threat of attacks during televised screenings of the World Cup. During the World Cup final four years ago, Somalia's Al-Qaeda linked Shebab insurgents killed at least 76 people after setting off explosions that ripped through two restaurants in the Ugandan capital. Police spokesman Fred Enanga insisted the 'airport is very safe and secure', but added that security had boosted across the capital. 'We are at a very crucial stage because of the World Cup events held in town,' he said. In Somalia, the Shebab have warned that violence will intensify during Islam's holy month of Ramadan, carrying out a string of bomb attacks and killings. On Thursday, they claimed responsibility for shooting dead a lawmaker and his bodyguard.","U.S. embassy in Kampala warns of 'specific threat' by unknown group .

"By . Leon Watson . Underwear tycoon Michelle Mone is embroiled in a bitter row over plans to turn the house next door to her £1 million home into student digs. The Ultimo boss is fighting Strathclyde University's proposals to use the property for accommodation and functions and says she doesn't want 'anti-social' neighbours. Self-made multi-millionaire Mone bought the converted property off-plan in Glasgow's upmarket Park Circus area last year after splitting from her husband Michael. She paid £780,700 for the three-bedroom duplex and had extensive works done before moving into it last August. The property has a magnificent reception hall and stairway and is now worth more than £1 million. Bra tycoon Michelle Mone is embroiled in a row with university chiefs over building plans next door to her£1million dream home. She is pictured here (in yellow) at Wimbledon last week . Self-made multi-millionaire Mone bought the converted property off-plan in Glasgow's upmarket Park Circus area (pictured) last year after splitting from her husband Michael . She opened the doors of the home for a photoshoot with Hello magazine and described it as her 'new beginning'. However, the 42-year-old businesswoman was aghast at the thought of 'anti-social' university students becoming her neighbours or attending events at the house. In a strongly-worded letter to planning officials at Glasgow City Council, she said: 'I am replying to strongly object to this application. 'Having looked at the plans, I object as I having paid in the region of £1 million for my home, I do not under any circumstances want the adjacent property being used by or for university students. 'I would also like to object on the grounds of potential for anti-social behaviour which, despite the best intentions, cannot be avoided where student accommodation is concerned. 'I believe university students to be unsuitable tenants for this area, and would result in a loss of amenity and could also have an adverse impact on the conservation area.' Despite Mone’s concerns, the university has previously said the house’s living accommodation will mainly be used by its principal Sir Jim McDonald and not by students. The letter Michelle Mone wrote to planning officers objection to the university's proposal . However, it will be used to host corporate events and business engagements. Mone said this would impinge on her privacy and cause traffic problems in an area where parking is 'virtually impossible'. She added: 'I value my privacy and believe that an increased flow of traffic in the area as a result of this dwelling and its outlined function would eliminate this privacy, which is one of the main reasons I purchased a home in this area in the first place. 'Also, with this new dwelling there will be a large increase in the number of people and, therefore, vehicles associated with that. Glasgow City Council are due to make a decision on the planning application later this month . 'The proposed exit and entrance route to the flats is already overcrowded with vehicles and parking is virtually impossible as it is.' Mone, who is the only person who has objected to the plans, finished her letter by stating: 'I imagine you will receive many similar objections from other residents living nearby and I trust you will refuse this application on the basis that they most definitely are not in keeping with planning regulations in this area.' The university’s application states it wants to use the building as a 'university residence with guest accommodation and associated university function use'. Mone's previous house in south Lanarkshire, which she bought with her then husband Michael six years ago . Bosses at the institution were criticised when it emerged they had spent around £1 million buying the five-storey townhouse last year at a time of public spending restraint. In her shoot with Hello, Mone showed off her home’s spiral staircase, luxurious bedroom suite and grand piano. She said: 'I work away a lot and I love coming home to it. It’s very special.' In 2010, Mone was at the centre of a row with neighbours over plans to extend her former family home in Thorntonhall, Lanarkshire. Five residents objected to her proposals to add a sauna, gym and bar to the six-bedroomed property. One said the development would 'completely dwarf' the rest of the street but it was given the go-ahead by planners. A spokesman Strathclyde University said: 'This is a matter for the planning authority.' Glasgow City Council are due to make a decision on the planning application later this month.","Ultimo boss is fuming after Strathclyde University unveiled proposals .

"By . Kieran Gill . Robin van Persie is confident Nigel de Jong will play for Holland before the World Cup ends, despite the Dutch side announcing the midfielder's groin injury could rule him out for 'two to four weeks'. De Jong was forced off nine minutes into the Oranje's last-16 win over Mexico, and with it saw his tournament all but come to an end. Van Persie, though, thinks differently: ‘The miracles are not out yet. I’ve talked to him about it and he’s going for it, even if it is for only one game.'

It means Louis van Gaal would have to orchestrate a win on Saturday, should De Jong make his World Cup return in a later game. ‘I have known Nigel for over 20 years and he is a fighter,' added Van Persie, as reported by VI. ‘At Costa Rica we are really going to miss him. You could see against Mexico, even though Daley Blind did well. ‘It’s great that Nigel stays with the group. 'Even off the field he makes with his energy a difference for young and old. He always exudes: “We are going to devour everyone.” Nigel would be the final pick.' Switch: De Jong creates energy in the dressing room and will stay even if he cannot play through injury . And Van Persie knows it will be tough to replace De Jong for Saturday's showdown with Costa Rica. 'It is primarily terrible for Nigel himself,' said Van Persie. 'He was working on an unprecedented World Cup. 'I know that scanning is only one scan, then we will see an injury sometimes is very much not always the same in practice. ‘He is our tower of strength. I hope and we hope all together, he’s still going to make World Cup minutes. Nigel is a fighter, the miracles are not out yet.' The KNVB, though, were more pragmatic in a statement: 'An MRI examination at hospital confirmed that Nigel de Jong is struggling with a tear in his groin muscle. 'The 75-times capped international is therefore presumably out for two to four weeks. 'De Jong, who in last Sunday’s match against Mexico was injured after nine minutes, remains with the team in Brazil to work there on his rehabilitation.'

"By . Leon Watson . Haunting and poignant, these previously unpublished First World War pictures capture the bloody conflict in Italy like never before. The images and documents are on display at Italy's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, commemorating the war's 100th anniversary. The exhibit features images of executions and emaciated prisoners of war that were censored during wartime, as well as notifications for military tribunal death sentences that were posted on the streets of Rome. In this 1917 photo, an Italian soldier stands in front of an executed soldier  during the First World War in Italy . It also includes videos, letters and diaries that detail the horrors of trench warfare. 'Now we are like beasts that are hunted,' wrote a 37-year-old Italian corporal. 'You go to the slaughterhouse without realising it.' Much of the material was discovered in government archives through a re-cataloguing process that began in 2006. Franco Marini, head of the national anniversary committee, said that the war, which mobilised millions of soldiers from all over the country, was instrumental in constructing the nation's identity after Italian unification in 1861. 'They came from completely different realities,' he said. 'It was three years, not just 15 minutes, three years that they lived together, day and night, sharing the same dangers.' A modern series of photographs by Luca Campigotto revisits the remains of trenches, shelters and villages on the Italian front. A victim lies dead in the streets of Gorizia, Italy. This picture is one of the previously unpublished images on show at the Museo Centrale del Rinascimento in Rome . Previously unpublished: A barbed wire fence is used as a defence on the Italian Front in 1917 . A soldier guards inside of a rock bunker at an alpine defence position in Italy in 1918 . An interactive iPhone and iPad app allows visitors to learn more about the history behind the photos during their visit. Marini said the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was a particularly apt location for the exhibit because it 'is the emblem of the great sacrifices made during the world war.' The exhibit runs till July 30. Italian soldiers use a beacon from a bunker during the First World War on the Italian Front . Italian soldiers sit in a trench on the Italian Front during the First World War . When war broke out in the summer of 1914, Italy declared itself neutral in the conflict, despite its membership in the so-called Triple Alliance alongside Germany and Austria-Hungary since 1882. Over the course of the months that followed, Italy and its leaders weighed their options; wooed by both sides, they carefully considered how to gain the greatest benefit from participation in the war. The decision to join the fray on the side of the Allies was based largely on the assurances Italy received in the Treaty of London, signed in April 1915. On May 23, 1915, Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary. The Italian declaration opened up a new front in World War I, stretching 600 kilometers - most of them mountainous - along Italy's border with Austria-Hungary. By the time fighting ended on the Italian front on November 4, 1918 - a week before the general armistice - 615,000 Italians had been killed in action or died of wounds sustained in First World War.","Poignant images on display at Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Rome .

Stunned witnesses described seeing the giant funnel of cloud over the English Channel near the seaside town of Selsey around 7.15pm.

The 57-year-old said: 'I was driving to Selsey from Chichester to deliver some lights when I saw out of the window a long way in front of me. 'It was an incredible sight, something I've never seen before in England. I've seen them on TV of course, but not here. 'I stopped the car and took some pictures and then drove on to a car park near the lifeboat station to take some more. It really was quite dramatic and the pictures rather belittle it.

The Dutch FA claim Arjen Robben's confession to diving in the World Cup has been misinterpreted, and say the Holland winger admitted he was 'falling too easily'. Robben could face retrospective disciplinary action from FIFA if he did admit diving during the first half of Holland’s 2-1 win over Mexico, and will make a statement on Monday afternoon after training.

"By . Caroline Graham, Mail on Sunday LA Correspondent . There are those whom Father Time chooses to bless... and to say he has been generous to Christie Brinkley would be a vast understatement. In her 1980s prime she was a supermodel before the word had even been invented, and today, just three months shy of her 60th birthday, she looks almost exactly the same as she did when she starred in the video of Uptown Girl, the song her now-ex husband Billy Joel wrote for her. Christie has grown accustomed to exclamations of amazement over her appearance and finds what she calls the ‘pushing 60 obsession’ hilarious. Less amusing, however, is the frequent assumption that her life is without problems. Protective: Christie Brinkley said she will never let online trolls drive her daughters Alexa Ray Joel, left, and Sailor Lee Brinkley Cook, right, to depression . In fact, she and her family have been through a very modern ordeal, one that underlines just how much the world of celebrity has changed. Indeed, her daughter with Billy Joel, Alexa Ray, was rushed to hospital following a suicide attempt – a victim, Christie says today, of the now pervasive culture of vicious online bullying, or ‘trolling’. No wonder the model says it is now time to the insidious internet anonymity that allows people to persecute others without consequence. Alexa, now 27, was already in a fragile state of mind in 2009 following a break-up with a boyfriend when the bullying began, explains Christie. And in her delicate condition, the online taunts about her appearance and talent were enough to push her over the edge. Recently, Alexa – a budding singer-songwriter who hopes to follow in the footsteps of her father – singled out gossip blogger Perez Hilton as being one of the worst culprits, saying: ‘They used to pick on my looks and I used to care too much about how they perceived me. Perez Hilton labelled me a slut. I know what it feels like to be bullied .  .  . on a very large scale.’ Sitting in her sprawling home in The Hamptons, Long Island, Christie makes no attempt to hide her distress as she describes the traumatic events that hit the family. Star parents: Alexa attracted criticism from online bullies who accused her of cashing on the fame of her parents Billy Joel and Christie Brinkley . Choked with emotion, she says: ‘What Alexa has to deal with, what she’s been through, is the most upsetting thing I’ve ever had to face. As a parent you want to protect your child. Your whole life revolves around wanting to keep your kids safe, happy and healthy. That’s your goal. And when you have these evil, hurtful forces that you can’t protect them from it’s just agonising.’ Describing Alexa as a ‘sensitive, late-blossoming child’, she says her daughter was deeply wounded by the constant criticism she received, purely as a result of being the daughter of famous parents. Christie remembers one particularly vicious comment: ‘They said she looks like the father and sings like the mother.’ It is a mentality that is incomprehensible to her. Revelation: Christie, pictured during her modelling days, said she was shocked when she discovered the world of online bullies . She says: ‘It bothers me as a human that our society has got to this level. My daughter is a beautiful, talented person. Now she has blossomed, looks-wise, they say, “Oh, it’s all plastic surgery”. She had a tweak on her nose and that’s the only thing she’s ever had done. ‘But what bothers me on a personal level is Alexa seems to be under so much scrutiny and she’s just a kid. We’ve turned into a society which is used to focusing on the negative. We should be supporting each other.’ Bullies have also attacked Christie’s youngest daughter Sailor, now 15, who has recently taken her first tentative steps into the modelling world. Christie – who also has an 18-year-old son, Jack – may be an internationally famous model and actress, but she sounds like any ordinary mother when she speaks about her concerns. ‘It’s a different world today to the one I grew up in,’ she says. ‘Bullying follows children home. The invasiveness is new and every parent is trying to deal with it. ‘I call it “the other people at the table”. You have to share your kids with the computer and the mobile phone and you don’t have as much influence as a parent any more because these other people are in your kids lives 24/7. 'Driving to and from school was my time to talk to the children in the same way my parents talked to me. Now I say something and I hear ‘uh huh’ and I look in the rear view mirror and my children are texting.’ She says she first discovered the online bullies while going through a bitter divorce from Sailor’s father, architect Peter Cook. During their court battle it was revealed he spent thousands on internet porn and cheated on her with the 18-year-old daughter of  a neighbour. ‘The blogosphere is the meanest, nastiest place in the world,’ she says. ‘I was never in the computer world until my last divorce. For the very first time I got on to the computer and started trawling. I looked at some of the stories and would scroll down to the comments. Target: Alexa, above, was criticised by celebrity and showbiz blogger Perez Hilton among other online bullies . ‘I’d never even heard of some of the words they were using. I was shocked. I discovered the internet  is where people with chips on their shoulders can assume a fake identity and just spew venom and bitterness.’ She has been shocked to discover that every stage of her children’s lives has been documented in often cruel detail, but says she now does not even read the comments: ‘At this point none of us go there. We do not look.’ Christie admits she uses social networks to keep her fans up to date – and believes ensuring everyone is identifiable online is the answer. ‘I think people need to operate on the worldwide web as themselves,’ she says. ‘I think that’s the solution. We should insist that they use their real identity – like a driver’s licence. ‘People need to be responsible and accountable for their actions and what they have to say about people.’ Trim: The 59-year-old supermodel is the same height and weighs the same as her 15-year-old daughter . She can’t have failed to notice the attention her own appearance receives online. In her case, most of the comment are positive,  yet she is keen to downplay the obsession with her age. ‘I’m not the only 59-year-old who looks good,’ she says. ‘I think there are millions of fit, fabulous 59-year-old women out there but they  are telling everyone they’re 49. Women should own their age. We shouldn’t fudge the figures.’ Christie has never commented previously on rumours her good looks could have had artificial help, but today, for the first time, she admits to experimenting with Botox – but says: ‘It’s not for me.‘I didn’t like the feeling. I like to make lots of faces. I like to hold up my eyebrows. When I couldn’t move my forehead it made me feel depressed. 'I looked like a boxer who had taken a blow to the head. Plastic surgery is up to an individual. I would caution young girls not to go there. You see people with overinflated lips and overinflated cheeks. I think that look is ageing rather than anti-ageing.’ She is proud of the fact that she and her 15-year-old daughter – both 5ft 9in – weigh exactly the same. ‘We share clothes but it’s a different weight distribution. She’s a smaller jean size. I’ve got child-bearing hips’. Christie has followed a vegetarian diet since the age of 12 and works out regularly in her home gym. Two years ago, she played Roxie Hart in the West End and Broadway production of Chicago, receiving plaudits for her stamina. She does admit to using ‘tricks’ to improve her appearance, including clip-in hair extensions, which she is selling through the hair2wear.com company. ‘I started using them during Chicago.

The Netherlands and Mexico became the first teams to take a drinks break during this year's World Cup after temperatures in Brazil reached 39C. As temperatures rose in Fortaleza, the teams were given official three-minute 'cooling breaks' on the 30 and 75 minute marks to take in drinks at Estadio Castelao. The extreme heat, which saw fans retreat to the back of the stands to avoid the sun, prompted fears over the suitability of Qatar as the 2022 tournament hosts, as temperatures there often approach 45C.

Proenca was the first match official of this year's tournament to halt . play for a mandatory water break, which ruling body FIFA said would be . put in place should temperatures reach 32C or more. The three minutes, which also gave Mexico . boss Miguel Herrera and Holland manager Louis van Gaal time to talk . tactics with the teams, were added to stoppage time at the end of each half. Van Gaal claimed he used the second one . to change his tactics and bring about his team's eventual 2-1 victory. The Dutch had come from a goal down against Mexico, winning a penalty deep in injury time with the scores level. Empty seats: Many fans left their seats in an attempt to avoid the intense heat and scorching sunshine . Time: The water breaks gave Miguel Herrera - still wearing his suit jacket despite the raging heat - three minutes to talk tactics with his players . Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored from the penalty spot after Mexican captain Rafael Marquez was punished for his foul on Dutch winger Arjen Robben. The new Manchester United manager said: ' First I had changed to 4-3-3 and we created a lot of opportunities. 'Then I moved to plan B and yes I did that in the cooling break. That’s a clever way of benefiting from these breaks.' This is the first World Cup where cooling breaks have been used, with each venue's medical teams monitoring the temperatures at pitch level and employing breaks if the mercury rises above 32C. Referees can decide when to stop play in order for the players to take on water and cool down. The breaks would certainly be needed in Qatar, given temperatures can . rise to a worrying 50 degrees between May and September, and has been as high as 53C. Winner: Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored from the penalty spot deep into injury time, taking The Netherlands into the World Cup quarter finals . It has been argued that such heat would prove dangerous for both players and supporters, while the area can also be subjected to sandstorms during the dry season. If the tournament was moved to the winter, as has been proposed, the temperature would be likely to be between the mid 20s and 30s. Prior to yesterday's match, both teams had been forced to switch training venues because FIFA deemed the pitch at Estadio . Castelao unable to cope with two practice sessions and a match in two . days. The Dutch coach had warned before the last-16 game that players may have hallucinated were they not allowed to take on water during the match. Rio too!

But one man who the seemed to not be bothered by the heat was Herrera, who kept his suit jacket on throughout as he watched his team concede two goals in as many minutes to crash out. Herrera, the least-paid manager at the World Cup on £125,000-a-year, coped well with the heat since the tournament began, leading Mexico out of a tough Group A at the expense of Croatia and Cameroon.","Referee Pedro Proenca ordered breaks on the 30 and 75 minute marks .

'As a footballer I feel with him that such a . punishment... it hurts, it hurts,' Blatter said at his final press . conference in Rio.

'Brazil has improved since South Africa (whom he rated as nine out of 10). Those who get a clear 10 at universities have deals with the professor.' In terms of excitement, few World Cups can compete with this one. There were 171 goals - a record only matched by France '98 - and there were plenty of shocks too. Costa . Rica's run to the quarter-finals was a genuine good news story, . Colombia also surprised a few by reaching the same stage while Algeria, . Switzerland and Mexico also won many admirers.

'What makes this World Cup very special this time is the quality of the football, the intensity of the games. 'In the first phase teams tend to not to want to lose matches.

They don't share my style. I'm demanding. I want dedication and effort.' His two primary assistants were former players Paulo Wanchope and Luis Marin. Pinto's contract ended after the World Cup.

Juan Mata thinks Manchester United will be challenging for silverware this year under Louis van Gaal.When Mata signed for United last January, the club were in the midst of a dreadful run of form that cost manager David Moyes his job. Despite the £37.5million arrival of the Spaniard, United could only finish seventh and Moyes was replaced by Van Gaal. United fans will get a first glimpse of their new boss in the dugout on Wednesday night when the Red Devils take on the Los Angeles Galaxy at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. Confident: Juan Mata says Manchester United's prospects under Louis van Gaal look promising . Trophies: Mata says United will be pushing for silverware under Van Gaal after finishing seventh last campaign . Van Gaal has only been in his position for six days, but his arrival has injected optimism into a squad previously short on confidence and Mata is looking forward to a successful season ahead. United finished 22 points behind winners Manchester City last term, but Mata sees no reason why his team cannot challenge for the Barclays Premier League and other trophies under the vastly experienced Van Gaal. 'It's the start of a new era for the club, with a new manager and players coming in,' United's club-record signing said. 'I'm really happy with the manager's style of football and hopefully at the end of the season we can celebrate something, which would be amazing for him and for us. 'We're focused on improving and trying to learn from the manager, to play at our best level during the season. The main idea is to play as a team and compete for titles.'

Like his style: Mata says he likes Van Gaal's approach to the game - 'I'm really happy with the manager's style' Man for the job: It's a new era for the Red Devils, says Mata, with the new manager and player turnover . And if they needed another reminder that they are playing for their futures, then it was duly delivered by Ed Woodward on Sunday when he told United fans to expect more incomings and outgoings over the next few weeks. While Mata understands the need for tough training, the Spaniard thinks it is important the players do not overdo it.

"By . Paul Hirst . Argentina defender Pablo Zabaleta would love nothing more than to win the World Cup in the spiritual home of Brazilian football. When the World Cup draw was made last December, South American football fans dreamed of a Maracana final involving the continent's two super powers. But instead of facing Brazil in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday, Argentina will instead take on Germany, who obliterated Luiz Felipe Scolari's men in the first semi-final on Tuesday. Brazilians and Argentina have been bitter rivals ever since the beautiful game was brought to the continent by Brit Charles Miller in 1894. VIDEO Scroll down to see David Beckham predict an Argentina victory . What it means: Pablo Zabaleta says winning the World Cup in Brazil would be particularly special for Argentina . Hard man: Zabaleta goes in hard against Holland's Arjen Robben in their semi-final in Sao Paulo . Argentina detest the fact that Brazil have won three more World Cups than them. There is a never-ending debate in the two countries about who was better - Pele or Diego Maradona - and this summer Neymar and Lionel Messi were branded as big rivals for the Golden Boot. Local fans in Sao Paulo were firmly against Argentina in their semi-final against Holland on Wednesday - and that has been the case throughout the tournament. But such vitriol against the old enemy has been counter-productive as it has only served to fire the Argentinians up during the tournament, according to Zabaleta. 'It's special for us to play in this country,' the Manchester City defender said. 'Especially because Brazilian fans have been against Argentina for this World Cup. 'Sometimes, if you have all the people against you, you feel even stronger. I think that we showed that against Holland and we feel very proud to have made the final.' Even though Argentina is next door to Brazil, some 1668 miles separate Rio de Janeiro from Buenos Aires. That has not stopped thousands of Albiceleste supporters driving to Rio, many of them in camper vans that are parked along the central reservation on the Avenida Atlantica next to the Copacabana. Passionate: If Brazil fans don't see their team win, they certainly don't want Argentina to lift the World Cup . Support: Argentina thank their fans amid jeers from Brazilians after beating Holland in their semi-final shootout . And many more will flood the city this weekend in the hope that they will watch history unfold before their eyes. 'You can imagine people from Argentina selling their cars to come here, even without tickets,' Zabaleta added. 'This is something that happens in Argentina. 'We love football. We know how special it would be for this country to win another World Cup. But obviously we appreciate how Argentinian fans are doing everything to support the team. As a player I feel very proud, everyone feels very proud. Hopefully we can give them another trophy.' Unlike Germany, Argentina only just squeezed through to the last two. Alejandro Sabella's men needed a penalty shootout to defeat Holland and make it through to their first final in 24 years. The bookmakers have Germany as favourites for the showdown after their 7-1 win over Brazil, but that does not faze the Argentinians. 'We are just 90 minutes away,' Zabaleta said with excitement. 'This is special, we have been working really hard for this moment. 'Germany are probably the best team in this World Cup. But as we say in Argentina ""we don't play the final, we win the final"". This is something that we are thinking about and hopefully we can play a great game and try to win it.' Out in force: Thousands of Argentina supporters have converged on neighbouring Brazil for the tournament . Going through: Jasper Cillessen lay distraught in the goalmouth as Holland are knocked out . Zabaleta's theory does not quite add up. Argentina have lost two of the four finals they have contested. Their last victory came in 1986 when Diego Maradona captained the Albiceleste to a 3-2 win over West Germany. This time it will be the turn of Maradona's heir, Messi, to skipper the side in the showdown. Messi has scored four of Argentina's goals in this World Cup and he also set up Angel di Maria for the second round winner against Switzerland. Zabaleta believes it would be fitting, therefore, for the Barcelona star to lift the trophy this weekend. 'He is our main player, he is the captain of this team, he is the leader of this group of players,' the right-back said. 'We can imagine how special it would be for Messi to lift the World Cup.' Di Maria is Sabella's only injury doubt for the match in Rio. The Real Madrid winger has missed the last two games with a thigh problem, but he returned to training on Thursday and could feature in the final.","The nations have been fierce rivals since football reached South America .

Appearing on Fox Sports show 'The Buzzer', Iron Mike predicted the Americans would 'Kick Belgium's asses' in the knockout meeting in Salvador.

'You gotta be careful because the officials have been giving some bad calls, they're giving horrible calls,' he rants. 'You know they're gonna try and screw the Americans any chance they have!' He concludes the team talk by promising the Belgians he will ram some chocolate where the sun doesn't shine, apparently whatever the result. VIDEO Team Profile & Qualifying Goals .

Concerns: Klinsmann admitted he had reservations over the appointment of Algerian official Djamel Haimoudi .

Tyson is alluding to Klinsmann's fears the appointment of French-speaking Haimoudi could do his team a disservice in the match. Asked by a journalist at his press conference on Monday whether he had a problem that Haimoudi would be able to speak French to the Belgian players, Klinsmann remarkably claimed that he had. 'We hope it’s not a concern,' he replied. 'He did two games already and did them well. I hope he continues to referee in the perfect way he has so far.

They have shown no fear. That can only be a plus.' England were greeted by temperatures of 33 degrees Celsius when they touched down in Manaus on Thursday. The temperature is expected to be the same on Saturday, and humidity levels are forecast to hit 60 per cent. Ageing squad: Henderson (left) could face Italy's 35-year-old playmaker Andrea Pirlo on Saturday . It is a significant increase in heat compared to the milder climes of Rio de Janeiro, where England are based, but Henderson thinks the team will be able to cope with the conditions thanks to their extensive preparation, which has included warm-weather camps in the Algarve and Florida. 'The heat is difficult but you have to try and not even think about it,' the 23-year-old said. 'We have done adaptation training, either in chambers or warm weather training in Miami, Portugal and now in Brazil. 'Hopefully our bodies have adapted to it a little bit. You can see it is going to be hot but we have just to forget about that and concentrate on the game. I am sure we are fit enough for our bodies to deal with it.' All that preparation work is a thing of the past now. The squad watched Brazil versus Croatia in their luxurious hotel in Manaus on Thursday night and the reality and excitement about what lies ahead finally started to sink in. 'Everybody watching the game could see how big the World Cup is,' Henderson said. 'When Brazil scored fireworks were going off outside. The whole world is watching the World Cup. It just makes it even more exciting.' Ready: Henderson believes the England squad are fully prepared for the heat and humidity of Manaus . Last summer Henderson was way down the pecking order with England despite going to Euro 2012 the previous year. He had just had a woeful year with Liverpool, who almost sold him to Fulham. To make matters worse, Sir Alex Ferguson criticised Henderson's running style in a well-publicised chapter of his autobiography that did not go down well at Anfield. But the former Sunderland man responded perfectly by having an excellent year at Anfield and he is now expected to start alongside Liverpool team-mate Steven Gerrard in central midfield against Italy. New man: Henderson (right) believes he has improved a lot following an impressive season at Liverpool . 'I feel I have improved over the course of the season and that is what I want to keep doing,' he said. 'I will keep working hard and listening to the right people. Hopefully I can continue doing that and doing my best for England. 'I hope I have a key role to play (against Italy). If I do play I will make sure I give everything I have got.'","Jordan Henderson thinks Italy will face a fearless England on Saturday .

"By . Adam Shergold . Brazil's nail-biting World Cup win over Chile on Saturday night set records tumbling on Twitter. The engrossing last-16 tie, which saw the hosts progress on penalties after a 1-1 draw, generated an unprecedented number of Tweets Per Minute (TPM) for a sporting event. The peak of the 140-character soundbites came when Chile's Gonzalo Jara saw his penalty rebound back off the inside of the post, sending Brazil through 3-2 in the shoot-out. Talking point: Gonzalo Jara's decisive penalty miss for Chile against Brazil at the World Cup set new records on Twitter . Crucial: Jara's penalty miss proved the difference between the two South American sides in an engrossing contest in Belo Horizonte . On trend: How the key moments of the penalty shoot-out converted into Twitter mentions . That moment saw 389,000 TPM, eclipsing the previous record set during Superbowl XLVIII between the Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos earlier this year. During that event, Twitter traffic reached a high of 382,000 TPM. More and more fans took to the social networking site to share their views as the penalty shoot-out went on. As David Luiz walked up to take the first kick, 199,731 TPM were recorded. Spot on: David Luiz converted the first penalty for Brazil in the shoot-out, prompting the first spike in Twitter traffic . No mistake: Neymar handled the pressure of the penalty shoot-out and sent Brazil into the last eight .

"By . Adam Shergold . Every day Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent. After their season ended in La Liga disappointment, Barcelona are already working on the masterplan to restore themselves to the top of the tree next season. Mundo Deportivo report their big idea is to strengthen the spine of the team, particularly in defence, with Valencia's Frenchman Jeremy Mathieu and PSG's Brazilian Marquinhos on their shopping list. Core strength: Barcelona will try and sign Valencia's Jeremy Mathieu and PSG's Marquinhos to improve the centre of their defence this summer . Merry-go-round: Sport report that Barcelona have made a bid for Atletico's Miranda and that Cesc Fabregas could go to Man United . With Carles Puyol retiring and the ongoing uncertainty over Javier Mascherano, a centre-back is an essential first purchase for the deposed champions and they appear to be linked to quite a few. Sport report that Barca have offered Atletico £16m for centre-half Miranda in order to fill the void left at the back. Interestingly, they also have on the front page that Manchester United would offer as much as £43m for Cesc Fabregas as new manager Louis van Gaal looks to make a statement in the transfer market. 'Hot market' reads their headline as the summer transfer merry-go-round starts to gain speed. The responsibility for carrying out this transfer business will fall to Luis Enrique, who was appointed as Barcelona's new first-team coach on Tuesday, signing a two-year deal. He will be presented to the media on Wednesday. In Madrid, the summer can wait. They have a Champions League final to look forward to, involving the city's two biggest clubs. Desperate measures: Atletico striker Diego Costa has flown to Serbia for placenta treatment on his hamstring injury, according to Marca . Up for the Cup: AS have an interview with Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who says he has already dreamed of lifting the European Cup again . Marca go with a line on Atletico and the 50-50 fitness of their key man Diego Costa, who has flown to Belgrade in a 'desperate' attempt to cure the hamstring injury that could force him to miss the match in Lisbon. The striker has gone to visit 'placenta doctor' Marijana Kovacevic, who has previously worked with Frank Lampard, Robin van Persie and Vincent Kompany. As, meanwhile, have been talking to Real goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who says he 'has more enthusiasm than when he won their eighth and ninth European Cups' and he has already 'imagined lifting the Decima [the tenth]' on Saturday night. The stopper played in the 2000 final, when Real beat Valencia 3-0, and also in 2002, when they defeated Bayer Leverkusen 2-1. In Italy, they're talking about transfers too. Gazzetta dello Sport report that Juventus have Barcelona's Alexis Sanchez at the top of their list and are close to reaching agreement on a £16m deal. Overhaul: Gazzetta predicts how Juventus will line up next season, with Nani, Morata, Evra and Alexis Sanchez in their line-up . Close watch: Milan will move to bring Carlo Ancelotti back to Italy if Real Madrid lose the Champions League trophy, according to Corriere . In love: Juventus are really keen on taking Real's Alvaro Morata, either on loan or permanently, according to reports in Tuttosport . They add that Barcelona might pull something out their sleeve and ask for Fernando Llorente in return. They've mocked up a pitch showing how the Bianconeri could line up next season, with Manchester United's Nani and Patrice Evra, and Real Madrid striker Alvaro Morata leading the line. You're restricted to 140 characters anyway, but Italy coach Cesare Prandelli has introduced a Tweet limit on his players during the World Cup in Brazil, presumably to avoid secrets leaking from the camp. Corriere dello Sport say that AC Milan will await the result of Saturday's Champions League final with interest - if Real lose, they will try and lure Carlo Ancelotti back to Italy. Also on their front page, fears from Juventus that star man Paul Pogba may fancy a change of scenery after just two years at the club. Tuttosport say Juve are 'in love' with Morata but say that the Real Madrid man could arrive on loan rather than a permanent deal.","New Barcelona coach Luis Enrique will try to strengthen centre of defence .

With Colombia's exit in the World Cup quarter-finals, the scramble to sign superstar James Rodriguez has begun in earnest. And Real Madrid are the latest club to throw their hat in the ring, at least according to Marca in Spain. Perfect 10: Real Madrid have identified Colombian sensation James Rodriguez as their next Galactico, according to the Spanish sports daily Marca . Semi showdown: AS looks forward to the World Cup semi-final between Argentina and Holland, billing it as Messi vs Robben . Euphoria: Mundo Deportivo go with Lionel Messi on their front page, as he helped Argentina into their first World Cup semi-final in 24 years . 'James 10' reads the headline on their Sunday edition, that being the rating Real have given to the 'Colombian pearl' after his outstanding performances at the World Cup. According to the paper, they believe the Golden Boot favourite has all the attributes necessary to be a Galactico - 'class, flexibility, leadership, impact and personality.' The top of their front cover reflects the sad news that Real legend Alfredo Di Stefano is in a serious state after suffering a heart attack. 'Football in suspense for Don Alfredo,' reads their headline, while AS report that he suffered the problems while with friends celebrating his 88th birthday. AS lead on Saturday night's dramatic quarter-finals in the World Cup which saw Argentina and Holland advance to the last four. 'Robben challenges Messi' is how they bill Wednesday night's showdown in Sao Paulo, hailing Louis van Gaal's 'masterstroke' of bringing on Tim Krul for the penalty shoot-out. Unsurprisingly, Catalan daily Mundo Deportivo focus on Barcelona's Lionel Messi, who was 'euphoric' after helping Argentina beat Belgium 1-0 to reach the semi-finals. They quote coach Alejandro Sabella saying, poetically, 'Messi is water in the desert.' But while Messi's World Cup dream lives on, it's all over for his club team-mate Neymar, who faces a race to be fit for the start of the season after fracturing the third vertebra in his back. In Italy, the focus is on Argentina's match-winner - Gonzalo Higuain of Napoli. He is pictured on the front of La Gazzetta Sportiva, who call him 'Golden Pipita' - that being his nickname - after he fired his country into the World Cup semi-finals for the first time in 24 years. In transfer news, Gazzetta say that Ashley Cole's move to Roma is close to completion and Juventus are set to launch a fresh bid to sign the Real Madrid striker Alvaro Morata. Golden Boy: Gazzetta Sportiva hail Napoli striker Gonzalo Higuain after he scored the winning goal for Argentina against Belgium . Golden bite: Luis Suarez is on the verge of completing his move from Liverpool to Barcelona, according to Corriere dello Sport . Their interest in the 21-year-old is well known and Real are believed to be receptive to a deal. Corriere dello Sport lead on Luis Suarez's impending move from Liverpool to Barcelona - 'A Golden Bite' they say, referring to the fact his reputation does not seem to have been damaged by his chomp on Giorgio Chiellini's shoulder. They report that Manchester United are trying to push through a move for Juve's Chilean midfielder Arturo Vidal. And the transfer fest continues in Sunday's Tuttosport, who claim Juventus will bid for another Chilean, Alexis Sanchez, if one of their big players departs. That could either by Vidal, or Paul Pogba, who is again attracting interest following some fine performances for France at the World Cup. Incoming: Tuttosport report that Juventus are interested in Alexis Sanchez but will face stern competition from leading Premier League sides .

"By . Damian Spellman, Press Association . Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert is convinced former England international Joe Cole still has the fire in his belly to make an impact in the Barclays Premier League. The 32-year-old midfielder swapped West Ham for Villa Park last month when he agreed to become part of Lambert’s new-look set-up. Success: Joe Cole celebrates Chelsea's title win after beating Bolton Wanderers in April 2005 . The former Hammers youth product, who was regarded as one of the most gifted players of his generation when he was a youngster, has won 56 England caps during a career which has taken him from Upton Park to Chelsea, Liverpool and Lille. Cole has struggled for form and regular football over the last few years though, but Villa boss Lambert remains convinced that the experienced playmaker has what it takes to succeed at the highest level. Happier times: Cole celebrates scoring against Tottenham for West Ham in February 2013 . Back on track: Cole is looking ahead to a new challenge with Aston Villa this season . He told the Birmingham Mail: 'As soon as you start to lose the fire from your stomach as a footballer, there’s no point. 'He still wants to do really well and he’s still hungry to do really well. That’s a sign of a top, top player. Lambert added: “If you have still got the attributes at that age that you had when you were 16 or 17 starting out, you will not go far wrong. “He can make things happen. If he can perform the way I know he can, then we have got a really good player on our hands.”","Paul Lambert says Joe Cole still shows the signs of being a 'top, top player'

"By . Adam Shergold . Follow @@adamjshergold . His name only seems to float into the wider consciousness every four years and, right on cue, Germany's Miroslav Klose is making the headlines once again. The veteran 35-year-old has been named as the only out-and-out striker in Joachim Low's squad for the World Cup, giving him the opportunity to make a nice bit of history out in Brazil. He needs two more goals to overtake Brazilian legend Ronaldo and become the record all-time goalscorer in World Cup tournaments. Here we go again: 35-year-old Miroslav Klose has been selected as Germany's only out-and-out striker for the World Cup finals in Brazil . Chosen one: Coach Joachim Low (left) picked his final 23 names for the finals in Brazil on Monday and included Klose for his seventh major tournament . Goalkeepers: Manuel Neuer (Bayern Munich), Roman Weidenfeller (Borussia Dortmund), Ron-Robert Zieler (Hanover 96) Defenders: Jerome Boateng (Bayern Munich), Kevin Grosskreutz (Borussia Dortmund), Erik Durm (Borussia Dortmund), Benedikt Hoewedes (Schalke 04), Mats Hummels (Borussia Dortmund), Per Mertesacker (Arsenal), Philipp Lahm (Bayern Munich) Midfielders: Julian Draxler (Schalke 04), Matthias Ginter (Freiburg), Mario Gotze (Bayern Munich), Christoph Kramer (Borussia Moenchengladbach), Sami Khedira (Real Madrid), Toni Kroos (Bayern Munich), Thomas Muller (Bayern Munich), Mesut Ozil (Arsenal), Lukas Podolski (Arsenal), Marco Reus (Borussia Dortmund), Andre Schuerrle (Chelsea), Bastian Schweinsteiger (Bayern Munich) Forward: Miroslav Klose (Lazio) And Ronaldo magnanimously said he would be happy for Klose if he stole the honour in his own backyard. 'I am very proud of that record but records are there to be broken,' Ronaldo said. 'It would be nice to keep it for a while longer but I am cheering for someone to break the record. It will be good for the sport.' Ronaldo's record is 15 goals in 19 appearances at the World Cup finals. Klose's stands at 14 in the same number of matches. If Germany reach the latter stages, Klose will be 36 and, despite his incredible longevity, it's a safe bet to say he won't get another chance to claim the record. He is also currently tied with Gerd Muller on 68 as the German team's all-time leading scorer and so could claim a double if he finds the net. Record to beat: Klose has a chance to overhaul Ronaldo's record of 15 goals in World Cup tournaments . Top of the charts: Klose also needs one more goal to overtake Gerd Muller's all-time record of 68 goals for the Germany national team . 1 Ronaldo (Brazil) - 15 goals in 19 games2 Gerd Muller (West Germany) - 14 in 13= Miroslav Klose (Germany) - 14 in 194 Just Fontaine (France) - 13 in 65 Pele (Brazil) - 12 in 146 Sandor Kocsis (Hungary) - 11 in 5= Jurgen Klinsmann (Germany) 11 in 17 . Given the wealth of attacking midfield talent at his disposal, Low decided it wasn't necessary to take Hoffenheim's Kevin Volland alongside Klose as he named his chosen 23 on Monday. Klose scored eight goals in 29 appearances for Lazio last season, half the haul of his previous campaign. Volland managed 11 goals and nine assists for Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga but the 21-year-old will undoubtedly get his chance in the future. Klose's international record is beyond question, however, spanning 13 years, seven major tournaments, three managers and a good few strike partners. It was Rudi Voller who handed him his debut back in March 2001, rewarded by Klose's first goal as Albania were beaten 2-1 in a World Cup qualifier. Many will remember the hat-trick he scored in Germany's 8-0 demolition of Saudi Arabia under the Sapporo Dome at the 2002 finals, followed up by strikes in the other group matches against the Republic of Ireland and Cameroon. Heads you win: Klose nods home one of his five headed goals for Germany at the 2002 World Cup finals, against the Republic of Ireland in Ibaraki . Flying: Klose scored five goals in all at the 2002 finals, including a hat-trick against Saudi Arabia . Head over heels: Klose celebrates his World Cup goal against Cameroon back in 2002 in customary fashion . 1 Gerd Muller 68 goals in 62 games= Miroslav Klose 68 in 1313 Jurgen Klinsmann 47 in 108= Rudi Voller 47 in 905 Lukas Podolski 46 in 1136 Karl-Heinz Rummenigge 45 in 957 Uwe Seeler 43 in 728 Michael Ballack 42 in 989 Oliver Bierhoff 37 in 7010 Fritz Walter 33 in 61 . All the goals were headers and his front-flip celebration became something of a trademark as Germany finished runners-up to Brazil out in the Far East. On his way back from a knee injury, Klose wasn't fully fit at Euro 2004 and Germany bombed out in the group stages. Decent form in the friendlies leading up to the 2006 World Cup gave Klose, who at that time played for Werder Bremen, a chance to make amends for 2002 on home territory. He duly scored twice in the opener against Costa Rica, two more against Ecuador and a crucial late equaliser against Argentina in the quarter-finals - enough to carry home the Golden Boot - but Germany suffered heartbreak in the classic semi-final with Italy. Klose's good form after making a £12m move to Bayern Munich made him a cert for Low's Euro 2008 squad and he boosted his tournament goals tally by scoring against Portugal in the last eight and Turkey in the last four. Heading for victory: Klose heads the winner as Germany beat Poland 1-0 in Dortmund during the 2006 World Cup .

But for the second time in his career, there would be disappointment in a major final as Spain beat them 1-0. Seven goals in qualifying helped Germany to the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa and Klose again saved his best for the knockout stages, scoring the first in the 4-1 win over England and a double in the 4-0 rout of Argentina. Klose moved from Bayern to Lazio midway through the Euro 2012 qualifying campaign, but it didn't halt his regular goalscoring form as nine goals earned Die Mannschaft their spot in Poland and Ukraine. A goal against Greece in the quarter-finals was all Klose had to show from the tournament itself as Germany again came up short in the semi-finals. But with plenty still in the tank, Klose again spearheaded Germany's attack through another qualification campaign and, entering his seventh finals tournament, earned himself the chance to write himself permanently into the record books as he pens the final chapter of a long and successful career chock full of goals.

"By . Adam Shergold . Jose Mourinho turned up in the West Flanders town of Waregem on Thursday night on a very important scouting mission. The Chelsea manager could cover most of western Europe each and every week checking up on the progress of his battalion of loanees, but few in his extended squad are as special as Thorgan Hazard. The 21-year-old brother of Eden has been in spectacular form ever since the unglamorous and unheralded Belgian Pro League outfit Zulte-Waregem borrowed him last summer and now Mourinho had come to see if all the positive feedback was true. Scroll down for videos... Young gun: Chelsea winger Thorgan Hazard (L) looks set for a loan move to Borussia Monchengladbach . Sibling rivalry: Thorgan Hazard is rated by some as an even better prospect than brother Eden (R) Wearing a navy blue overcoat and a shirt casually untucked and unbuttoned, Mourinho sat at the front of the main stand in the compact 10,200-seater Regenboogstadion with his assistant Rui Faria. He carefully studied a teamsheet on which just the one name would have been familiar - the man in the all-red strip, wearing the No 10 on his back. Ahead of kick-off, the home fans behind one goal would have caught Mourinho’s eye as they unfurled an enormous white banner that covered the stand from pitch to roof. Next to the face of Thorgan Hazard, written in English, the slogan: ‘Arrived as “Little brother of...” Leaving as OUR golden boy.’ Thorgan will always be the younger sibling of Eden but he’s been making plenty of noise of his own without having to rely on the reflected glory of his big brother. 14 goals and 17 assists during the Pro League season took Zulte into the six-team Championship Play-off, where they are on the brink of qualifying for next season’s Europa League. On the night of his late-season visit, Mourinho was able to watch Thorgan in action for a full 90 minutes but came away without seeing him find the target as he had done in his last three outings. Zulte went down 2-1 to Anderlecht, the favourites to win the league when Belgium’s complex format of play-offs come to their conclusion this weekend. Even Eden, regarded by many Chelsea fans as their best player following a season of 17 goals and 10 assists, concedes that Thorgan is the better player. Scout and about: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho visited Belgium to personally check on Thorgan's progress . Mr Versatile: The winger has impressed during two seasons on loan at Belgian side Zulte Waregem . There is no sibling rivalry it seems, just an appreciation that Thorgan has, or soon will have, the more complete suite of attributes. A creative No 10, Thorgan possesses well-honed dribbling and shooting skills, a deft touch and close control. He has come on leaps and bounds during his second loan season at Zulte, finding the net far more often and offering more for his teammates. His sense of adventure on the field is summed up by this quote from a couple of years back: ‘When I have two strikers in front of me, I have fewer possibilities on the sides to widen the play. Blues brother: Eden Haxard was voted Young Player of the Year after an impressive season at Chelsea . ‘But it’s easiest to find me and to play deeply. It’s a matter of movement and animation in front of me. ‘But in fact, I don’t care. I like to play direct football as much as to build an attack on the sides. When you like to play in support of the striker, you have to adapt.’ So there you have it - play me wherever you like, I’ll prosper. His form fuelled speculation that he could be on the Belgian plane to Brazil with his elder brother. In the end, he had to settle for the standby list this time. He has played a full part in the Under 21s qualification campaign for the European Championships and it seems a matter of time before Marc Wilmots unleashes him on the world. Wanted man: Hazard has attracted interest from a number of clubs in Germany and the Premier League . Thorgan could not have done a great deal more during his loan spell in Belgium. The fact Mourinho made a trip just to check up on him suggests there’s every chance he’ll be at Stamford Bridge next season. Now he has to prove he can cope in the Premier League. But if he is truly the better Hazard sibling, then that shouldn’t be much of a problem.","Chelsea youngster Thorgan Hazard has been impressing on loan with Belgian club Zulte-Waregem - scoring 14 goals and making 17 assists .

"By . Ruth Styles . When Karen Gilbert learned she was pregnant with extremely rare identical triplets, she was stunned and delighted. But, she said, doctors took a different view of her one-in-200million pregnancy and twice gave her an option to terminate it. They feared the three foetuses could take each other’s fluid and space and might not survive. Later in the pregnancy she was told she could choose to keep only one or two of them. But Mrs Gilbert and her husband Ian were determined to have their three little girls. Now Ffion, Madison and Paige – who were born two months early on August 2 – have come home from hospital. Delighted: Karen Gilbert with Ffion, Madison and Paige, whose birth weights were 3lb 80z, 3lb 5oz and 3lb 4oz . Mrs Gilbert, 32, said: ‘The pregnancy has taken its toll but now I’m taking my time to recover and get to know my three beautiful girls. ‘The doctors thought it could be up to three months before we could bring them home so we feel privileged to have them here with us.’ Mr Gilbert, a 34-year-old business manager, said: ‘We couldn’t consider termination – they were our babies. They were scanned every week to make sure they were growing fine.’ Identical triplets occur when one egg splits in three, a one in 200million chance without IVF say experts. The couple from Pontypool, Wales, also have an older daughter Faye, aged three. Beating the odds: (left to right) Ffion, Maddison and Paige Gilbert with their proud parents Karen and Ian . Doing well: The tiny trio spent the first six weeks of their life in intensive care but have now been allowed home . But medical professionals feared the rare birth and lack of space inside the womb could see the babies killing one another potentially killing one another. 'They were concerned about twin to twin . syndrome, when the babies take each other’s fluid or space and starve or . cramp each other,' revealed their father. 'Because they are identical, they all . share the same placenta and the same fluid. 'They all grew and fought so . quickly it was practically ripping Karen’s muscles apart. 'But we couldn’t consider termination - they were our babies. We were scanned every week to make sure they were growing fine. 'At . the last scan at Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny Karen was in very . serious pain. The doctors gave her pain killers but she started having . contractions. 'Karen gave birth at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, but we got transferred back for the ante natal care.' Painful: The strain of carrying the triplets took its toll on Karen and she is relieved the girls are safe and healthy . Sister act: The Gilberts' oldest daughter Faye, three, cuddles her trio of newborn siblings . Admin assistant Karen, 32, who gave birth by caesarian section two months early, said the experience had been 'crazy' but added that she was looking forward to getting to know her newborn daughters. 'It’s been crazy,' said Karen, who has another daughter named Faye, three. 'I still feel like someone’s going to tell me I’ve had my time with them now and take them away. 'We got married, went on honeymoon to New York, and came back to find out we were expecting. At first we thought it was one, but at eight weeks I got some really bad pains. We thought it was a miscarriage but it turns out it was three babies fighting for space. 'The pregnancy has taken its toll but now I’m taking my time to recover and get to know my three beautiful girls. 'Their personalities are already starting to shine through and I can’t wait to get to know them better.' Now eight weeks old, the three girls are still tiny and weigh just six pounds - smaller than the average newborn. 'At first they didn’t look real and you could pick them up with one hand,' said business manager father Ian, 34, who added: 'It was a bit of a shock. Intensive care: The babies spent the first six weeks of their life at the Nevill Hall hospital in Abergavenny . Home at last: The family are now back home in Pontypool and are looking forward to getting to know each other . 'Now we’ve got them home we are coming to terms with it. They are starting to feel like our own. We had a few scares during the pregnancy, especially when Karen fell top to bottom down the stairs. 'Our three-year-old daughter Faye was in bed and I was at work. I came home to find Karen unconscious on the floor. I was petrified. I still can’t believe we made it through.' 'We were worried the hospital wouldn’t have enough beds and we’d have to split them up. It would have been horrible,' added Karen. 'There was also the worry that one would be ready to come home before the others. Luckily, we managed to keep them together. 'The doctors thought it could be up to three months before we could bring them home so we feel privileged to have got them here with us so soon.' Julian Hayman, press office for Nevill Hall Hospital, said: 'The midwives were all thrilled to have a triplet birth at the Royal Gwent Hospital. 'Everyone involved has taken great care of the girls to ensure their speedy return home. We all wish [the] proud parents Ian and Karen all the very best for the future.'","Karen and Ian Gilbert welcomed their tiny triplets six weeks ago .

"Drops his threat of a veto against the defence bill even though he didn't like certain controversial provisions . Now American citizens can be arrested within the U.S. and sent to Guantanamo if they're linked to Al Queda or Taliban . By . Meghan Keneally . Updated: . 09:00 EST, 16 December 2011 . President . Barack Obama faced a civil liberties backlash today after he  signed a law that will allow terror suspects . to be held indefinitely- even raising the prospects of U.S. citizens being sent to Guantanamo Bay. The controversial move, revealed last night, effectively extends the laws of the battlefield to American soil. The move shows a clear hardening of Mr Obama’s anti-terror policies, and . a major shift from the liberal stance that helped him sweep into power three years ago. Under fire: President Obama is expected to sign the defence authorization bill, in spite of stipulations that allow prisoners to be held indefinitely . After . campaigning heavily on the need to close the controversial terrorist detention . base at Guantanamo Bay, he failed to deliver when met with legal obstacles. Now, showing that he has truly moved to the opposite end of . the spectrum, he is endorsing the tools and civil powers that he once rallied . against. 'It's something so radical that it would have been considered crazy had it been pushed by the Bush administration,' said Human Rights Watch spokesman Tom Malinowski. 'It establishes precisely the kind of system that the United States has consistently urged other countries not to adopt. At a time when the United States is urging Egypt, for example, to scrap its emergency law and military courts, this is not consistent,' Mr Malinowski continued. Considering he is now in the midst of running for re-election, comparisons between Mr Obama and Mr Bush are certainly not something the President wants going into the 2012 race. Civil rights groups are outraged . after he dropped the threat of a veto Wednesday, meaning the bill will become a law and . implement several controversial provisions, like the ability to keep all terror . suspects imprisoned. Though there are already 46 'indefinite detainees' at Guantanamo currently, this new provision would allow the government to consider  Americans with close ties to Al Queda or the Taliban. Controversial: The military base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba has always been a divisive topic because of the limited rights given to prisoners . One part of the debate has been whether terror suspects . should be prosecuted as criminals and tried in a civilian court, as Mr Obama . would like, or if they are deemed ‘enemy combatants’ and given trials in . military courts which have less civil liberties for the defendants, which Republican . lawmakers would prefer. The defence bill with the controversial . position shows that in light of the continued setbacks in the push for closure . of Guantanamo, the Republicans are seemingly winning the fight. Head office: Mr Obama has consistently wanted the ability to have prisoners tried in civilian courts . ‘While we remain concerned about the uncertainty that this . law will create for our counter-terrorism professionals, the most recent changes . give the president additional discretion in determining how the law will be . implemented, consistent with our values and the rule of law, which are at the . heart of our country's strength,’ the White House statement said. Congress passed the massive $662 billion defence bill Thursday , the Senate voting 86-13 for the measure. It would also authorize money for military personnel, weapons systems, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and national security programs in the Energy Department for the financial year beginning October 1. The legislation is $27billion less than Obama wanted and $43billion less than Congress gave the Pentagon this year, a reflection of deficit-driven federal budgets, the end of the Iraq war and the drawdown in Afghanistan.In a rare show of bipartisanship, the House voted 283-136 for the measure late on Wednesday. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the senior Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said Thursday the cooperation was a 'little ray of sunshine' in a bitterly divided Washington. It also shows some foreign-policy muscle in pre-emptively . freezing hundreds of millions of dollars tentatively headed to Pakistan in aid . unless the defence department gets firm assurances that the country will help . cut off the production and proliferation of homemade bombs. In addition to the concerns over a curtailing of civil . liberties, some critics speculate that the bill may give leeway to Republicans . in next year’s presidential elections by highlighting Mr Obama’s flip-flopping . on the issue. ‘It's really . distressing that the White House clearly shares the concerns of the national . security establishment [against the bill], but feels like a veto is not . politically sustainable,’ said Heather Hurlburt, executive director of the . non-profit National Security Network. The camp, which he once called a 'sad chapter in American history' seems to be one that will be going on for longer as his plans to close the controversial camp have failed his repeated attempts. Different rules: Military and civilian courts give detainees different rights, and the new bill will allow the military rules to continue without civilian trials . Originally opened by President George Bush in January 2002, the camp was originally used as a place to store particularly dangerous prisoners as they were not given any rights granted under the Geneva Conventions. Though their legal standing has changed slightly throughout the years, the camp is widely seen as a symbol of diminishing civil rights standards. During the 2008 campaign, Mr Obama promised to close the camp within his first year in office. He first took action within his first two days in office, issuing a suspension of prosecutions at the camp. Even though he followed up with an executive order, his efforts were thwarted by bureaucracy and legal posturing. First, they found the proper legal files on individual prisoners were not kept up to date, preventing a quick reassignment to other prisons elsewhere. The next problem was where to put them when moved out of Cuba: options in Kansas, Michigan and Illinois were exhausted after the local legislators put up fights because their constituents didn’t want to be living near terrorists. The biggest blow to the effort came in January of this year, when President Obama signed the Defence Authorization Bill stopping the talk of transferring the prisoners to mainland America or foreign countries who had offered to house the prisoners.","Drops his threat of a veto against the defence bill even though he didn't like certain controversial provisions .
