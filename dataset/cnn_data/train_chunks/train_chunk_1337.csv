"Brad Jones has vowed to fight for his Liverpool future and use his unexpected return to action to show he can win a new deal. The Australian goalkeeper is in a similar position to Glen Johnson, Kolo Toure, John Flanagan and Brad Smith in that his current contract expires at the end of the current campaign and talks have yet to start about an extension. Jones, 32, is in a position, however, where he can influence the club’s thinking, as he has replaced the out-of-form Simon Mignolet in goal and, according to Brendan Rodgers, he will stay there for an “indefinite” period. Brad Jones wants to seize his unexpected opportunity by winning a new deal at Anfield . Liverpool have conceded six goals in three games since Jones was brought back for an 'indefinite period' Liverpool have conceded six goals in three games since Jones was drafted back into the first team at Old Trafford and he is aware his performances will be subject to scrutiny but he is determined not to let the pressure impact on him. ‘Indefinite means no timescale,’ said Jones. ‘It is just up to me to go out and do my best and hold on to it for as long as I can. As long as that continues, great. If it is a couple of weeks, a couple of months, we will see. I just have to make the most of it when I can. ‘Everyone wants to link other players with us and that is probably not going to change. We will get linked with another 20 goalkeepers now but I won’t let it affect me. Every game that I play, I will just go out and do my best. Do I want to stay? Of course I do.’ Former No 1 Simon Mignolet (centre) trains after losing his place due to a series of poor displays . Some of Mignolet's performances have been unfairly criticised, according to Jones . Brendan Rodgers had previously expressed interest in signing free agent Victor Valdes . How Jones plays over the Christmas period will determine whether Rodgers, who had considered bringing former Barcelona No 1 Victor Valdes to Anfield, will press ahead with plans to sign a new keeper in January. ‘There’s pressure on every player in every position,’ Jones said. ‘You are expected to win every week; when you don’t you get criticised. At smaller clubs, you get away with certain things. The magnifying glass isn’t as big, if you like. When you are here, you have to deal with (pressure) as best you can.’ Rodgers has struggled to live up to the expectations from last season where Liverpool finished second . A Liverpool fan dressed as Jesus shows his support for the beleaguered Anfield manager . Rodgers replaced Mignolet as he felt a spell out of the team would benefit the Belgian; Jones would not speak about whether Mignolet’s confidence has been shaken but he did argue that the dissection of his performances has been unfair. ‘That is what TV pundits do, isn’t it? They pick holes in people,’ said Jones. ‘They pick holes in teams and point out things. A lot of time, it can be unjustified. Sometimes it is justified. Certain people like to justify their position by jumping on the bandwagon and saying something that gets in the press. ‘It is up to them. That is their job. I have had (criticism) before and I’ll get it again. Simon and I have a very good relationship. We are old enough to know there is nothing petty between players. It is the manager’s decision. We just crack on in training and work as hard as we can.’","Brad Jones has replaced out-of-form Simon Mignolet in Liverpool goal .

"Jermain Defoe has flown back to England to thrash out his future ahead of the transfer window which re-opens next week - and Queens Park Rangers are the leading contenders to sign him. Defoe, who is contracted to MLS side Toronto FC, was in London last weekend and is keen on a return to the Barclays Premier League. Toronto are open to allowing him to leave but would prefer a deal that would see him go on a permanent basis rather than a loan. Jermain Defoe joined Toronto FC from Tottenham earlier this year but is set to return to England . Defoe has worked with QPR manager Harry Redknapp (second right) at three different English clubs . It is understood Defoe prefers a move to Loftus Road, where he would be reunited with Harry Redknapp - who he has worked with at West Ham, Portsmouth and Tottenham. Redknapp is keen to re-sign Defoe, 32, after failing in a bid to take him in the summer. But with owner Tony Fernandes keeping a tighter rein on the club’s finances, putting together a financial package could yet prove a stumbling block. Toronto want to recoup as much of the £6million they paid Tottenham as possible, while Defoe is on a lucrative £60,000-per-week deal.

"Jose Mourinho has revealed Mario Balotelli once stood him up to go watch Formula 1 instead. The Chelsea boss called the Italian in for a meeting during their time together at Serie A side Inter Milan. However, Mourinho was left high and dry as Balotelli failed to show because the striker was at the F1 qualifying in Monza.

I told him to be at 2pm in my office for a meeting and when I called him he'd gone to the Formula 1 qualification on the Saturday for the race on Sunday. 'He said, 'meetings in your office I can have every day, but to see the Formula 1 is only once a year in Italy'. A couple of days later I had to laugh.'

Balotelli was all smiles at the weekend despite his Liverpool goal drought . Balotelli in action for Inter against Chelsea and Ashley Cole back in 2009 . And Mourinho reckons the Liverpool forward could pen a bestseller. When asked what Balotelli's autobiography would be like, the Blues boss replied: 'A funny book, a good book! 'He's a nice kid, in my time, needed support, needed the older players to support him because it's not good when that educational relationship is just between the manager and the player. 'I always think that it's important that the people surrounding help the manager in that process.' So, could Mourinho pen his own book about Balotelli's exploits?

"Manchester City defender Pablo Zabaleta is confident the champions can keep the pressure right on Chelsea this Christmas. Chelsea top the Barclays Premier League heading into the festive programme but with City right on their tail. The Londoners, who held a nine-point advantage over City at one stage last month, are now just three points clear after their chief rivals hit form. Pablo Zabaleta hailed Manchester City's team spirit after making it eight wins in a row against Crystal Palace . The right back celebrates with David Silva after setting up the Spain international's opening goal . City have won their last eight games in all competitions - one short of a club record - and confidence is soaring with the indifferent results of October and November now firmly in the past. Zabaleta said: 'That (run) shows the spirit that this team has at the moment. 'When you think of two months ago, when we were not playing our best football, we kept working hard and I think at the moment the confidence is back and we are playing much better football. 'I think that, at Christmas, spirit is always crucial to try and win all the games, because it can make a big difference. It is especially the case for the top squads and the players that can rotate, because it will be very hard to play on the 26th and the 28th within 48 hours. Manchester City players visited Manchester Children's hospital on Tuesday . England goalkeeper Joe Hart was deemed to have safe enough hands to be left holding the baby . 'We are looking to win those games. Even if Chelsea are winning games and looking solid, it is normal to have some point of the season where you can lose points. 'Belief is what you need to keep going until the end.' City's victory over Crystal Palace last Saturday took them level with Chelsea at the top but Jose Mourinho's men responded by winning at Stoke on Monday.

Silva (right) struck his second goal after the interval against Palace on Saturday . Man City players celebrate Silva's goal as they move level on points with Chelsea at the top of the table . It promises to be a tight battle between the two leading clubs and Zabaleta never had any doubt that City would pull themselves back into contention. Prior to the November international break, City won just once in six games and questions were starting to be asked of the team's durability and manager Manuel Pellegrini's suitability. Zabaleta, 29, said: 'We know that we have enough talent in the team. 'We probably had to improve our performances collectively. In the way that we want the team to play, we were probably lacking intensity and concentration in some of the games. It cost us a few points.

It was a bit hard at the beginning with the fitness but now I think everyone is much better. 'That's why we have improved as a team and we have to keep playing at that level.

"Jose Mourinho has revealed that he would turn down the chance to manage his native Portugal if he was given the opportunity. Speaking to Clare Balding in a special programme for BT Sport, Mourinho also stated that he once accepted a part-time role as national team coach, but was not allowed to take it. When quizzed over whether he would like to manage his country, Mourinho said: 'No. They tried to take me lots of times and was only one time I accepted because it was a part-time job. Jose Mourinho speaks to Clare Balding (left) for a special BT Sport programme to be aired on Christmas Day . Mourinho has accumulated an impressive trophy cabinet over his long career in football management . 'I wanted to do the same time club and national team, and at the time I wanted to accept. But my president at the time decided not to let me do the national team job.' At that point, it was time for Mourinho to reflect, and he now believes that it would have been impossible, and unfair, to juggle both roles. 'After that I reflected and I have to agree it was not possible to do both jobs at the same time. It's not even ethical for a manager to have two jobs with so many managers without one job, it's not acceptable.' The now-Chelsea manager has also been linked with the England managers job, but admits his wife was right to advise him to turn the role down. The now-Chelsea boss admits he would not take the Portugal manager's job if he was offered it now . Mourinho, pictured facing up to Arsene Wenger, was also given the chance to manage England, but refused . Mourinho, he admits, enjoys the day-to-day running of a club too much to take a job that would only see him take charge of a handful of matches each year. 'She was right. It's too early for me. I love the day-by-day, I love to play, I love the pressure of the day-by-day, the training, the travelling, the matches, the competitiveness. 'I remember clearly there was a moment where the next match for England would be in Paris, France v England, a friendly match. And I was already thinking about who to select, who to play, how to do it. 'She came to me and said, ""When is the next match?"", ""Ah the next match is in two months"". ""What are you doing for two months, what are you doing, what are you thinking?"", she was saying, ""Forget it, it's not for you, maybe in 20 years.'

"Arsene Wenger admits teenager Calum Chambers has ‘hit the wall’ and needs a break from the rigours of life in Arsenal’s back line. Chambers has started 23 times for club and country this season, far more than Wenger envisaged. The Londoners have lapsed occasionally into defensive chaos, summed up by Sunday’s stoppage-time equaliser at Liverpool. Per Mertesacker shouldered the criticism after the 2-2 draw, having ducked away from the corner which was headed home by Martin Skrtel, but the Arsenal boss backed his 6ft 6in German, accusing his team of failing to organise properly. Calum Chambers in action for Arsenal against Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday - his 23rd start of the season . Chambers faced battles against two of his England colleagues in Adam Lallana (left) and Raheem Sterling . He also admitted Chambers was feeling the strain and a rest may come during the festive fixtures, with Mathieu Debuchy and Nacho Monreal fit again. Wenger said: ‘For a 19-year-old, he has played too many games. They all hit the wall after 15-17 games. You have to give them a breather. To have that level of responsibility in every single game is a lot at that age.’ The Arsenal boss preferred right back Debuchy rather than Chambers at centre half against Liverpool. ‘Debuchy is good in the air and at Stoke we suffered in the air,’ he said. ‘Sometimes experience can make a difference and the defensive responsibility is a bit less on the flanks.’ Mathieu Debuchy was preferred to Chambers at centre-back, and scored a header to equalise for Arsenal . Arsene Wenger says Chambers (pictured in training this week) has hit the wall after a large number of games . With Debuchy and Laurent Koscielny suffering serious injuries and a shortage of cover, Mertesacker has played every minute of Arsenal’s last 23 games in the Barclays Premier League and the Champions League. ‘Mertesacker gives his best,’ said Wenger. ‘Many people had a go at him for the corner but he had no chance to get that ball in the zone where he was. I don’t know why he ducked. Maybe he sees he hasn’t got the ball and somebody jumps over him and it’s a reflex. ‘It is more an organisational and collective problem because nobody really talks. We work on it. Usually we’re not bad on set-pieces. We have one of the best records in the league. Maybe they do talk but it doesn’t look like that when you see the pictures. It’s important to have someone organising.’ Per Mertesacker received criticism after he appeared to duck out the way of Martin Skrtel's equaliser . Arsene Wenger admits that Arsenal's back-line will be stronger when Laurent Koscielny (centre) returns . Mertesacker admitted earlier this season that he found motivation hard after the World Cup, but Wenger believes the 30-year-old German, who has since retired from international football, has improved. ‘It has not been easy for him,’ said Wenger. ‘He had a difficult start to the season but he’s been much sharper. I believe he’s on the way up. When Koscielny comes back, we will be more stable. ‘Even in midfield we need to get players back and to defend better. Mikel Arteta is missed because he’s a better ball-winner than people think.’ Arteta has not played for nearly a month, suffering a calf injury and then an ankle problem.","Calum Chambers has started 23 times for club and country this season .

"Leicester City have made a £7.5million bid for Burnley striker Danny Ings. Manager Nigel Pearson is desperate for a new striker to help kickstart his side's slump to the foot of the Premier League where they are five points behind the Clarets. They have been rebuffed in approaches for Andrej Kramaric of HNK Rijeka and Aleksandar Mitrovic from Anderlecht and could yet be rejected by Burnley over Ings. Danny Ings has scored four goals in 15 games so far this season for Burnley . Although the 22-year-old is out of contract in the summer, Burnley do not need to sell in January and have taken the view that finding his replacement would prove more expensive. They do not want to put the club's financial position in jeopardy and believe Ings would prefer to weigh up his future in the summer when he is expected to have more offers to choose from. Manager Sean Dyche this week said: 'The chairmen have come out and said he's going nowhere and I'm happy with that as a manager. We have open dialogue with him and his agent. Ings is a £7.5million target for the Foxes, who are also embroiled in a relegation scrap . 'The club have made it quite clear how much they value the players we've got and we're in a good position cash-wise because we haven't spent a lot of money.' Ings may yet ask to hear what Leicester have to offer but it will be down to Burnley to accept the fee. They will still be due compensation on Ings should he leave at the end of his contract. Newcastle, Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg have also shown interest.

"Paul Lambert will look to trigger the £7.5million purchase of Tom Cleverley from Manchester United once the January window opens but admits Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner and the player himself must agree first. Cleverley is on a season-long loan at Villa, who have a first option to buy, but could decide to wait until the summer when he is a free agent and assess his options. From a club perspective, Lambert said Lerner would need to be satisfied with the finances of paying cash up front to secure his signature. Aston Villa could trigger the £7.5million purchase of on-loan midfielder Tom Cleverley in January . Cleverley has made 14 appearances for Villa since his arrival from Manchester United . The England midfielder has impressed at Villa Park and is getting regular games, only missing the clash against his parent club through ineligibility and suspension. 'We’ve got the option to buy in January. I will definitely try. A lot will depend on finances,’ said Lambert. 'We’ve had one or two discussions with (chief executive) Tom Fox and Randy. If something comes up and he thinks it’s right for the club and affordable, I’m pretty sure he will look at it. 'I will have a discussion with Tom. I’ve never really had that with him. He’s still a Manchester United player. I’ve got him for a season anyway.’ Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert is keen to secure Cleverley on a permanent deal . Lambert said Cleverley was blossoming by featuring on a consistent basis after losing his place in United’s midfield. ‘Tom's been great around the place. Sometimes loan players are not like that,’ he added. 'I’m pretty sure he loves his football here. I think he’s played really well. ‘He’s only 25, he’s got years ahead of him I’m pretty sure he won’t want to sit around. Knowing Tom Cleverley the way I do now, I’m sure he’s not one of the lads who wants to keep sitting on a bench.'","Tom Cleverley has impressed since arrival on loan from Manchester United .

Thompson commented as he described a case brought against five people, including an airline baggage handler who was charged a day earlier by federal authorities in Atlanta. Thompson said he was not trying to scare anyone. But he said it's 'truly frightening' what investigators learned after a probe that started as a way to reduce gun violence in Brooklyn. He said former Delta Air Lines employee Mark Quentin Henry took guns aboard at least 17 commercial airliners this year from Atlanta to New York airports. Scroll down for videos .

Delta ramp agent Eugene Harvey, 31, has been charged with trafficking firearms, violating airport security and aiding others in the scheme recently busted by police . Surveillance: Mark Henry (far right under A1 sign) is seen boarding in an Atlanta airport on December 10... Arrival: ...and later getting off of a plane at JFK airport that same morning at 10:26am. He was arrested December 10 after he was followed to his residence in Brooklyn . Prosecutors alleged in a release that 'During the course of the investigation it was discovered that Henry, whose mother is a retired Delta employee, traveled back and forth between Georgia and New York for a nominal fee by using his mother’s employee privileges, which allowed him to take unlimited flights for life.' Henry's lawyer, Terence Sweeney, said his client, held without bail, 'maintains his innocence and he's looking forward to his day in court.' Henry was arrested December 10, when investigators videotaped him in the Atlanta airport prior to a morning flight to Kennedy International Airport in New York, where he was videotaped leaving the airport and was followed to his residence in Brooklyn. Thompson said Henry was confronted by investigators at his door, he told them there were guns in a knapsack. 'He said: ""I just brought them from Atlanta on the plane."" He made that admission,' Thompson said. The prosecutor said investigators discovered that guns were individually wrapped and that ammunition was in the bag next to them 'that he could have just put together and started shooting.' He said the scheme 'really poses a threat in terms of terrorism.' 'They can put guns on a plane, they could easily have put a bomb,' Thompson said. Authorities said Monday that an Atlanta airline baggage handler suspected of helping smuggle firearms onto passenger jets to New York City has been arrested by federal agents. A FBI affidavit said there was enough evidence to charge Delta ramp agent Eugene Harvey, 31, with trafficking firearms, violating airport security and aiding others in the scheme. Former Delta employee Mark Quentin Henry, who was fired in 2010, was arrested in New York on December 10 in a weapons trafficking investigation after an undercover agent bought a gun from one of his accomplices, according to the affidavit filed on December 19. Authorities: Brooklyn DA Kenneth Thompson, seen center, said of the alleged smuggling ring ''This was an egregious breach of our nation's air traffic security' Investigators said Eugene Harvey was assigned to work in the baggage transfer room at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, above, which is within a designated secure area . The investigation targeted firearms that were being sold in New York that had been purchased in the Atlanta area. Authorities looked at Henry's cellphone, airport surveillance footage and security records and determined that he conspired with Harvey to get the guns past security. Cellphone records showed the two had communicated via text message 12 times shortly before Harvey's flight departed Atlanta for New York City on December 10. When Henry was arrested, authorities confiscated a backpack that contained a smaller bag with 18 handguns inside. Henry told investigators he traveled from Atlanta to New York with the guns and ammunition in his carry-on bag, which would not have made it past TSA screening. Investigators said Harvey was assigned to work in the baggage transfer room at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, which is within a designated secure area. Investigators said security records show Harvey used his employee access card to enter the secure area just before 7 a.m. the day of Henry's flight to New York. Investigators said security footage showed Henry carrying a backpack and walking toward a gate in the B concourse around the same time he began texting Harvey. Harvey later entered a men's restroom across from the gate where Henry was waiting, and security footage recorded Henry walk into the same restroom soon after. A minute later, Henry walked back out carrying the backpack where the guns were later found. Henry later traveled to the A concourse and flight records show he departed from gate A1, investigators said in the affidavit. Federal authorities accuse Henry and Harvey of conspiring to smuggle guns through the airport several times. Between May and Dec. 10, Henry supplied 129 handguns and assault rifles to a co-conspirator who then made sales to an undercover officer, according to the affidavit. Henry, a former baggage handler and ramp agent, was fired from the airline for abusing its buddy pass system. He used pass benefits belonging to his mother, a retired Delta gate agent, to arrange for the flight between Atlanta and New York, according to the affidavit. 'Delta is cooperating with authorities in this investigation. We take seriously any activity that fails to uphold our strict commitment to the safety and security of our customers and employees,' airline spokesman Morgan Durrant said in an emailed statement. It's unclear if Harvey has an attorney.","Brooklyn DA Kenneth Thompson commented as he described a case brought against five people in which guns were taken onto passenger jets .

The festive visit to the hospital was the Spain international's first and like the playmaker, fellow midfielder Herrera was equally humbled by his time with the kids. 'If we can make the children smile, then I'm very happy. It's a pleasure for me to be here and I wish that they can have a good Christmas,' added the 25-year-old. Defender Jones echoed the duo's sentiments - adding that the sobering visit provided a reality check for Louis van Gaal's squad. 'It's a reality check for probably most of us. It's not nice to see the kids like this especially over Christmas. Hopefully the presents and toys will give them something to smile about,' said Jones. United's next excursion on-the-pitch is a Premier League home clash against Newcastle.

"Dylan Hartley escaped another lengthy ban which would have jeopardised his Six Nations participation but still left Stuart Lancaster facing a selection headache on Tuesday night. The 28-year-old Northampton hooker received a three-week suspension - the fifth ban of his career - at a disciplinary hearing in London following an ugly incident during Saturday’s East Midlands derby which saw him sent off by referee JP Doyle after 16 minutes for elbowing Leicester centre Matt Smith in the face. RFU judicial officer Jeremy Summers accepted Hartley’s guilty plea and mitigating circumstances, which included a degree of provocation by Smith, but took into consideration his appalling disciplinary record. Northampton hooker Dylan Hartley has been suspended for three weeks by the RFU for a wild elbow . Hartley's incident came during a flare-up between Northampton and Leicester players during the first half . During the melee, Hartley was caught planting a elbow into the face of Leicester Tigers' centre Matt Smith . Hartley's elbow was caught by the Television Match Official who reported the violence to the referee . VIDEO Aviva Premiership Highlights: Northampton Saints 23-19 Leicester . April 2007 - banned for 26 weeks after being cited for eye-gouging Wasps forwards James Haskell and Jonny O'Connor. March 2012 - received an eight-week suspension after being cited for biting Ireland forward Stephen Ferris' finger while playing for England in a Six Nations game. December 2012 - banned for two weeks after being cited for punching Ulster hooker Rory Best during a Heineken Cup match. May 2013 - sent off for verbally abusing referee Wayne Barnes during the Aviva Premiership final against Leicester at Twickenham. Received an 11-week suspension that sidelined him for the British and Irish Lions tour to Australia that he had been selected for. December 2014 - sent off for elbowing Leicester centre Matt Smith in the face. Banned for three weeks. * Hartley,  has now been banned for a total of 50 weeks during his playing career. ‘The sanction reflects the low-end entry point of the offence, which carries a two-week tariff,’ said Summers. ‘The entry point was aggravated having regard to Dylan’s previous record and a week was taken off to reflect mitigating circumstances. As such the sanction reflects the player’s record rather than the seriousness of the offence itself.’ With a nine-week ban available for elbowing offences deemed to be at the high end of the scale, Hartley can consider himself lucky only to be ruled out for three Aviva Premiership games before being available to return for Northampton’s European Cup clash with the Ospreys on January 18. Hartley, who admitted he was in the ‘last-chance saloon’ with England following the 13-week ban that saw him miss last year’s Lions tour to Australia, had feared an even lengthier punishment that would have seen him miss the Six Nations. England open their campaign against Wales in Cardiff on February 6. It was unclear on Tuesday night if Lancaster will take any further disciplinary action against his troubled hooker. The coach was livid with Hartley, who has won 61 caps, for getting a yellow card for stamping on South Africa’s Duane Vermeulen in November. Early indications suggest Lancaster, whose resources at hooker are not especially deep, will be willing to give the Saints captain another chance. His physicality, set-piece excellence and leadership qualities make him unquestionably England’s first choice. But the point when Lancaster decides enough is enough must surely be drawing near. Having exiled Danny Care from his squad in 2012 on disciplinary grounds, there will inevitably be murmurs of double standards if Lancaster fails to act against another persistent miscreant. Smith (left) and Hartley (right) have words after the incident, as the Leicester man is seen to by a physio . Referee JP Doyle (left) had no choice but to show Hartley a straight red card for his antics . Hartley pleaded guilty to elbowing Smith via video-conference and received support from Saints boss Jim Mallinder, who claimed in the aftermath of his side’s victory over the Tigers that there was ‘no malice’ in the stray elbow, which caught Smith square on the jaw. Mallinder argued the offence was only worthy of a yellow card, while claiming Smith was guilty of play-acting. Injured Saints prop Alex Corbisiero went as far as to accuse Smith of ‘deserving an Oscar’ for his reaction while commentating on BT Sport. ‘The red card was disappointing,’ Mallinder said after the game. ‘Dylan’s got to keep his arms down but he was being held. I don’t think there was any malice in it. In the nature of the game I don’t think it justified a red card.’ Northampton hooker trudges off despondently after being sent off for his vicious elbow . Saints were left fuming by Doyle’s decision. The referee had appeared ready to issue a yellow card before being persuaded it deserved red following consultation with television match official Sean Davey. ‘I think Smith went down pretty easily,’ Mallinder added. ‘It was probably a yellow card. It’s a tough game and Dylan plays to the edge. You won’t change Dylan. He’s competitive.’ Hartley has been unable to shake off a reputation as a troublemaker since he was banned for 26 weeks for eye gouging in 2007. He has subsequently served bans for biting, punching, swearing and now elbowing.","Dylan Hartley was sent off in during Northampton's win vs Leicester .

"Christmas Eve is shaping up to be windy, wet and warm instead of white across much of the country, making for a travel nightmare for those heading to their holiday destinations. While parts of the South cleaned up from severe storms that killed at least four people, a system that forecasters had feared could bring several inches of snow to Illinois, including the air travel hub of Chicago, was expected to track farther east. Still, by early afternoon Wednesday, more than 280 flights had been canceled in the US, according to flight tracking service FlightAware. Chicago's O'Hare International Airport was hardest hit, accounting for 98 of the cancellations. Waiting for liftoff: People sleep in a waiting area on the day before Christmas at LaGuardia Airport in New York .

Drenched and dreary: Woman holds an umbrella while walking under rain near a store decorated with Christmas trees in downtown Newark, New Jersey, Wednesday . More than 4,300 departing and arriving flights - and counting - were facing delays Wednesday. Several inches of slushy snow was still possible in the afternoon, mainly in areas southeast of Chicago along the Indiana state line and in far western Illinois. That was similar to the forecast for Indiana, where the National Weather Service said 2-4 inches of snow could leave untreated roads and bridges slick. Holiday travelers in Ohio, Michigan and New York faced the prospect of gusty weather. A high wind warning was issued from Wednesday evening to Thursday morning for much of northern Ohio. Meteorologists warned that gusts of 65mph in western New York could blow away holiday decorations. In Michigan, utility companies braced for extremely strong gales a year after a storm put thousands of people in the dark at Christmas. The weather service said the strongest winds are expected at night and would last nearly until dawn on Christmas Day. Crews are on standby Wednesday in anticipation of gusts of 45mph or higher in the Detroit area, said DTE Energy spokeswoman Randi Berris. A light but steady rain fell Wednesday along much of the East Coast. Balmy: In the Florida panhandle, mercury climbed into the mid-80s on Christmas Eve . Springtime in December: Temperatures topped near-record 50 degrees Wednesday morning in some areas of western New York. Temperatures topped near-record 50 degrees Wednesday morning in some areas of western New York. In northern New Jersey, forecasters warned thunderstorms could boom as temperatures head toward 60. A coastal flood advisory was in effect, and fog was predicted in the northern part of the state. Still, some parts of the country were welcoming bona fide snow in time for Santa’s arrival. Five to 10 inches was forecast in mountain passes and up to 3 inches on valley floors in Nevada's Sierras. And mountainous areas of Washington expected 3 to 5 inches to fall Wednesday. Power companies struggled to restore electricity to thousands of people in Mississippi after severe weather killed at least four people, injured about 50, and damaged or destroyed an unknown number of homes and businesses, including a day care center.

But not all winter weather lovers were so lucky. Snow isn't expected in other parts of South Dakota until Friday. Sioux Falls resident Alana Amdahl said she's disappointed about the lack of snow projected for Christmas. ‘We live in South Dakota for a reason,’ said Amdahl, 27. ‘We don't have palm trees to put Christmas lights on, we have evergreens. Of course, we need snow. It can melt after the new year.’ Aftermath: Jeff and Melissa McKenzie embraced in the ruins of their flower shop in Columbia, Mississippi, as four were killed and others wounded by tornadoes that ripped through the state .

An additional 6,000 households throughout the state lost power, with damage to the electrical grid due to the severe weather. Mississippi Power told The Associated Press about 300 customers were still without electricity by midday Wednesday, but most would have power by the end of the day. NBC reported that in addition to wind and rain, hail struck the state, with golf-ball sized hail falling in Enterprise, Mississippi, and pea-sized debris hitting . A Walmart in Columbia was structurally damaged, with skylights blowing out and flooding reported. Vehicles parked outside were also damaged. Governor Phil Bryant, who toured the twister-stricken area by helicopter and by vehicle before the news conference, said state emergency officials believe the destruction was caused by a tornado. Some 40 businesses and 30 homes were damaged in Columbia, Bryant said. About 10 to 15 buildings were damaged in the more rural Jones County. Columbia Mayor Robert Bourne said the tornado straddled US 98, so damage was on both sides of the four-lane highway. Bryant had said earlier that the tornado cut a swath of about 3 to 3.5 miles long through Columbia and about a quarter of a mile wide. Police in Columbia were stationed at all major intersections after traffic lights were either swept away or destroyed amid Tuesday's powerful storms. At least 20 people were injured, according to Mississippi Emergency Management Agency officials. Ravaged: A resident walks past a Ten Commandments display in Columbia, Mississippi, Wednesday.

She said she gathered employees and customers, about 15 people in all, into a vault in the building, and they rode out the storm there. ‘When we heard the sirens the second time, I started yelling, 'Get into the vault! Get into the vault! And I ran outside and started yelling,’ she said. Only one employee failed to make it into the vault in time and hid under a metal table. He sustained minor injuries. Although the business itself was heavily damaged, a sign outside bearing the Ten Commandments was left completely intact. In Alabama, authorities said thunderstorms left trees and power lines down across the state and flooded several roads. In the Great Lakes region, rain is expected to turn to snow later today, dropping several inches of slushy snow on parts of Illinois. 'I'd be nervous about the possibility of not being able to get out,' said meteorologist Charles Mott as Chicago airports geared up for more cancellations.

The American Airlines plane was taxiing with the help of two ground personnel, spokesperson Joshua Freed said in an email according to Fox News. No one was injured and the Southwest passengers were booked to other flights. Washington, DC, Baltimore and Boston experienced delays though cancellations were low. Thunderstorms disrupted flights in Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston and Charlotte had 10 cancellations Wednesday in addition to numerous delays. Snow in Wisconsin caused a three-vehicle crash that included a school bus, though no one was reported injured.

"After Ismaaiyl Brinsley shot his ex-girlfriend and posted an online death threat against police, investigators in Maryland used modern cellphone tracking technology to follow his journey to New York City in real time. But when it came to giving the New York Police Department specifics about Brinsley, the means were markedly low-tech: a phone call and a wanted flier sent by fax. That warning flier came too late, sent a mere two minutes before Brinsley walked up to a patrol car and shot officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu dead without warning. The official timeline in the Brinsley episode emerged this week, as New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said Tuesday that Brinsley was carrying hundreds of dollars at the time of the slayings.

According to the timeline, Baltimore County police began tracking Brinsley early Saturday with precision thanks to the GPS transmitter on a cellphone he had stolen from his ex-girlfriend. The transmissions, or 'pings,' showed he was traveling northbound on a bus on Interstate 95 that arrived in Manhattan at 10:49am. He then took the subway to Brooklyn, where he used the stolen phone to make posts to Instagram. One showed his bloodied green shoe. The other showed his pistol. 'I'm Putting Wings On Pigs Today They Take 1 Of Ours...... Let's Take 2 of Theirs (hash)ShootThePolice,' he wrote. At 12:07pm, Brinsley ditched the phone near the Barclays Center arena and disappeared. Baltimore County police say they became aware of the Instagram postings at about 1:30pm. They first tried calling a precinct in Coney Island but were told to call the precinct in the Flatbush neighborhood, and had a conversation with police there around 2:10pm. Police say the flier with Brinsley's photo was then faxed, at the NYPD's request, to a Brooklyn command at 2:46pm. It warned that he was in Brooklyn, armed with a semi-automatic handgun and was saying online that 'he will shoot a police officer today.' Two minutes later, Brinsley opened fire. Moments later, he committed suicide - likely around the same time the Teletype was sent to NYPD headquarters in Manhattan. Police on both ends say they took immediate and proper measures to try to alert officers about an armed and dangerous fugitive bent on violence against law enforcement. But the seemingly antiquated way they did it has raised questions about the potential for communication lapses to hamper urgent manhunts. Though refusing to fault how the warning was handled, Commissioner Bratton has called it 'an irony' the ambush occurred a time when the NYPD has launched a $160 million program to equip each member of the 35,000-officer force with a department-issued computer tablet or smartphone to improve information-sharing. Victims: Officers Rafael Ramos, left, and Wenjian Liu, right, were slain on Saturday by Brinsley . Remembered: Candles and other items left by visitors make up a growing makeshift memorial on Tuesday near the site where Ramos and Liu were murdered in Brooklyn . Brinsley killed himself likely around the same time the Teletype was sent to NYPD headquarters in Manhattan . Currently, police departments in New York, Los Angeles, Denver and elsewhere mostly rely on dispatchers to make radio transmissions giving descriptions of suspects or fliers - copied and faxed - with mug shots passed out at roll calls. Smaller forces have gone to blasting notifications to department-issued smartphones, but most larger ones say to do the same would be too expensive. With the new system, if the nation's largest police department were to receive a mug shot of a suspect, 'we could instantly send that picture and information to every cop on their post no matter where they were,' Bratton said this week. In the case of Brinsley, it's impossible to know whether an earlier warning would have made a difference. Even if that information had been received earlier, all an officer sitting in a radio car would have received, Bratton said, 'was an alert on the description of a black male, mid-20s, that basically is making threats against police officers.' Chief Robert Boyce, head of NYPD detectives, insisted at the same news conference, 'All things were done exactly the way they were supposed to do. ... There was no lapse on anybody's part.' A Baltimore County Police spokeswoman also said they 'followed our standard operating procedures.' Still, NYPD officials conceded that there also room for improvement in how police departments share information with each other - a lesson learned during the 10-day rampage across Southern California by former police Officer Christopher Dorner in February 2013. Loss: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and his wife, Chirlane McCray, visit the makeshift memorial on Tuesday in Brooklyn . Grief: NYPD officers and others stand for a moment of silence at approximately 2:47 p.m on Tuesday. Ismaaiyl Brinsley killed the two police officers at 2:48pm on Saturday . A report by the Washington, D.C.-based Police Foundation found communication and coordination problems between at least a half-dozen regional law enforcement agencies impeded efforts to stop Dorner. The nonprofit's report, for example, found that Riverside police officers were unaware Dorner had just opened fire on two LAPD officers in the neighboring city of Corona just minutes before they themselves were ambushed at a red light. The information was not relayed for 10 minutes, and the LAPD officers were relying on private cellphones to communicate because they were too far out of range for their police radio system to work, according to the report. Currently, if two agencies are in the same proximity, they frequently have the ability to communicate over an intercom system that connects dispatch centers, said Jim Bueermann, president of the Police Foundation. Agencies that are farther apart or across state lines typically communicate via phone, email and fax, depending on the urgency of the situation. 'If it's a critical incident, it all starts with a phone call,' Bueermann said. 'You just pick up the phone and you call someone.' The Police Foundation report called for regional agencies to immediately upgrade their communication systems so officers in different departments can talk to one another. On Tuesday, Bratton said police continue to look into Brinsley had so much money on his person. Speaking on 'CBS This Morning,' Bratton said of the investigation into Brisley 'Where did he get his money? Who does he hang out with? [Brinsley] doesn't seem to have been employed. 'He's a couch crasher, as they call it. He doesn't seem to have a residence, he just crashes on somebody’s couch. 'But he seems to have had money - cash in $100 bills. So we’re checking very closely all of his relationships. What was his world like? We're very adept at that. We have some of the best detectives in the world.'","A wanted flier for Ismaaiyl Brinsley was sent a mere two minutes before he walked up to a patrol car and shot two officers dead without warning .

"A young mother battling tongue cancer died just 12 hours after marrying the love of her life. Emma Gilhespy tied the knot with her sweetheart, RAF servicemen Michael, on November 20 in the chapel of St Johns Hospice in Lancaster at 11am. But sadly by 11pm that evening, Mrs Gilhespy had passed away, just a month from her 29th birthday. Scroll down for video . Emma Gilhespy with her husband Michael, and her five-year-old son, Callum, left. The couple married just 12 hours before she died after battling tongue cancer . In November, the couple were then given the sudden news that she may not survive more than 24 hours and brought her wedding to fiance Michael forward . Now her heartbroken family want to raise awareness of tongue cancer, which cruelly took her life and left her five-year-old son Callum without his mother this Christmas. Mrs Gilhespy first noticed something was wrong last December when she felt an ulcer on her tongue which would not go away. Her mother Debbie Grice, 56, explained: 'In the end she went to the doctor and was referred for a biopsy last December. The couple married at the chapel in St John's Hospice in Lancaster after Mrs Gilhespy's condition took a turn for the worse . 'On January 6, she went to get the results. She went on her own with Callum as we weren't expecting anything major but she was told it was tongue cancer.' The 28-year-old then underwent two operations in a bid to fight to disease including surgery to remove part of her tongue in February. But despite intensive radiotherapy, the family was given the devastating news in July that her cancer was incurable. Mrs Grice, a domestic supervisor for the NHS, who is married to Emma's father David, said: 'We were told the cancer had gone but that they would give her radiotherapy for six weeks to make sure none was left. 'Four weeks into the radiotherapy the skin on her neck started weeping and needed to be drained. 'They kept draining it and said it was clear, but in July they thought it might be infected. 'We were then old the cancer had spread to her liver, lungs, neck and pelvis.' The family were then stunned by just how quickly her illness progressed and just two sessions into a course of chemotherapy, consultants decided to stop the treatment as it was not working. In November, they were then given the sudden news that she may not survive more than 24 hours and brought her wedding to fiance Michael forward. Mrs Gilhespy, pictured after the wedding ceremony toasting her marriage to her sweetheart Michael, who is an RAF serviceman . Non-smoker Mrs Gilhespy, pictured,  wass among the very small number of people who are diagnosed with a form a mouth cancer . Mrs Grice said: 'When they said that we were gobsmacked. I don't think anyone wanted to believe what was happening. 'We had been going to hold the wedding in the hospice on November 28, but it was brought forward to the 20th. Emma didn't want to get married then, she wanted to hang on. Tongue cancer is a rare type of cancer that develops on either on the tongue or on its base. Symptoms of this type of cancer include a red or white patch on the tongue or an ulcer or soft spot, which will not go away, a sore throat, pain when swallowing and numbness in the mouth. It is not known what causes this type of cancer, but heavy drinking and smoking are said to be factors that put people at risk of developing the disease. Treatment of tongue cancer can include radiotherapy, chemotherapy or surgery or a combination of these treatments. Surgery can also include having all or part of the tongue removed. According to statistics from Cancer Research UK, 55 per cent of women and 44 per cent of men will live for five years or more after being diagnosed with the condition. 'I had bought a wedding dress for the day but she didn't want to wear it, she wanted to save it. Instead we dressed her in it in her coffin.' Non-smoker Mrs Gilhespy, who trained as a care worker, is among a very small number of people who suffer from a form of mouth cancer each year. Her mother added: 'I still don't believe it has happened sometimes. It's hard to believe because she was doing so well. It is very unusual because it's something that usually affects heavy smokers and drinkers, and she lived a healthy lifestyle. 'Emma always said she wanted people to be more aware of tongue cancer and how people should have regular dental checks.' Her husband Michael says that his wife never complained throughout her illness and remained positive until the end. He explained: 'Getting married was something we had talked about doing in the future. We had talked about buying a house and having children. 'We had planned it all for when she was better. She really wanted to go to Venice, and we were also planning to go to Lapland. 'We had our whole lives ahead of us. 'I was with her when she died, and I will never forget that.'","Emma Gilhespy went to the doctor after noticing an ulcer on her tongue .

"A California man who set out to see what a homeless person would so with a cash donation of $100 says that no one is more surprised than he at what eventually transpired. YouTube personality Josh Paler Lin — who has become somewhat known for his viral video pranks - uploaded a video on Monday that starts out with him handing a street beggar in Los Angeles the cash, then secretly following the man with a camera to see what he does. When the man, known only as Thomas walks straight into a nearby Liquor Mart, Paler Lin believes he got the result he had though. However Thomas actually went in to buy food, and then goes straight to a park where many other homeless people gather in order to hand out the offerings. Gesture ... with an agenda: YouTube star Josh Paler Lin (right) gives $100 cash to a homeless man in LA, with the intention of following the beggar afterwards . You're welcome: The man begrudgingly accepts the money and says he is 'tearing up' Next: The man, identified only as Thomas, then walks into a Liquor Mart . Shopping: Thomas emerges with at least two black grocery bags . 'I wasn’t expecting to get this kind of footage… to be honest, I thought this video would be more an exposing homeless people video at first,' Paler Lin wrote on his YouTube page. 'But I’m so glad that I could witness and capture such a beautiful moment. 'This has to be one of the most amazing experience so far on this channel. 'I did not only just help a homeless man, but I actually met an incredible human being and a friend. 'We were following him for a couple miles for almost an hour or so.' Thomas told Paler Lin he quit his job to look after his parents, but after both of them died, he couldn't afford to pay for their condo and found himself on the street. Kindess: Thomas then goes to hand out food he bought with the money to other homeless people . Giving: The camera following Thomas show him handing food to a family . So taken aback by what happen, Paler Lin says he took the man the man out for dinner and put him up in a hotel for the night. He also gave him an extra $100 cash. 'The more I talk to him, the more I sense how genuine he is…. I gave him my number and told him to call me when he needs help. 'Never judge a book by its cover. One love!' Candid camera: Josh Paler Lin then approaches Thomas to reveal he has been followed . Grateful: Paler Lin says he was shocked at how the experiment turned out . Paler Lin also set a fundraising page on Indiegogo for Thomas, hoping to raise $10,000 for him. It has already received over $35,000 in donations. Some have questioned whether the scene was staged. However Paler Lin has maintained it all developed naturally.","YouTube star Josh Paler Lin conducted experiment with secret cameras .

"The grieving family of a pizza delivery man murdered on the job in Alabama at the weekend say he was a hard-working and honorable who came to the US chasing the American Dream. Father-of-four Najeh Masaeid, 63, a Jordanian immigrant, was delivering a Dominos order to the District at the Summit apartment building in Birmingham on Sunday night, but when he got there the apartment was vacant. His body was found in a hallway, having died of blunt force trauma to the head, in what police believe was a premeditated robbery. However the owner of the Domino's shop where Masaeid had worked for over 15 years said Masaeid likely only had about $20 on him. Killed: Najeh Masaeid, 63, was found dead in Brimingham, Alabama, on Sunday while delivering a Dominos pizza, in what police believe was a set-up robbery . Family man: Tributes have been pouring in for Masaeid, a father-of-four who has been described as honorable, hard-working, energetic and funny. A GoFundMe page set up for his family has received over $65,000 . 'He came here for the American Dream and it was shattered by American greed,' Masaeid's daughter, Jordan Hosey, told AL.com. 'Where's the justice in that?' 'Nothing is free. You work. You pay for what you want. You don't get free.' 'He really valued an honorable dollar.' Police evacuated the surrounding apartments before going into the one that was on Masaeid's order, only to find it empty. No one in the building reported anything out of the ordinary. Mrs Hosey said her father and mother moved to the US almost 20 years ago. He took a job at Dominos and worked 80 hours a week to afford a modest apartment for his family in Shelby County. Favorite employee: Masaeid had worked at the same Dominos for 15 years and was loved by his colleagues . Jokester: Masaeid has been described as full of life and someone who could always make a person laugh . Mrs Hosey further explained the story of her father on a GoFundMe page set up to help her mother. The family hoped for $25,000, but have already received over $65,000. Most of the donations are believed to have come from locals who often had pizzas delivered by Masaeid. 'My dad didn't make much, and I often times paid their bills,' she wrote on the page. 'He never ONCE went to the government for money, although his legal status entitled for him for it. HE never believed in this. His words to me were always ""Nothing is free, you work, you pay for what you want, you don't get free"". 'My Father was simply trying to earn an honorable dollar. Scene: The 63-year-old's body was found in a hallway at The District at The Summit apartment building . Set-up: It appears the person who placed the pizza order did not live at the building and lured Masaeid there . 'He didn't feel entitled for it, he worked for it, and it makes me sick to my core how someone felt they were entitled to his money (and drivers never carry much, he always deposits it everytime he runs back to the store) or his life over what? $20? 'My dads life was ended for $20? 'I can't bear it. I just can't believe it.' Masaeid will be buried on Christmas Day. Police are hoping people will information will come forward. The death is being investigated as a homicide, according to WIAT.com. David Daewoud, the owner of the Domino’s where Masaeid worked, said the address of the order Masaeid was delivering was changed at the last minute, which was not unusual, as people often might go to a friend's house and ask the order be delivered there. However it now appears that the person who placed the order did not live in the building. 'They’re luxury apartments that you would never think something like that would happen,' Daewould told WIAT.com . 'Unfortunately, the caller was a fake order. 'He was waiting on our driver Najeh by the stairs. And we don’t know all the details yet. 'We’re waiting on the police report. And the investigator is trying to find out how he was hit.'","Najeh Masaeid, 63, killed by a blow to the head Sunday night in Birmingham, Alabama, while delivering a pizza .

"Top hotel chains including Hilton and Marriott have called on the FCC to allow them to block guests from using their own wifi hotspots. They claim the gadget devices interfere with wireless networks provided on-site - and even say  they could be a security risk. However, technology giants including Google have hit back, calling the plans 'inconsistent with the goals of promoting competition.' Hoteliers say that conventions where attendees use their own wifi hotspots can cause problems . In October the FCC fined the Marriott Gaylord Opryland hotel in Nashville, Tennessee, $600,000 for cutting off conventioneers from using their own Wi-Fi. It used scanners to spot networks, telling people to buy the service from the hotel for between $250 and $1,000 per stand. The American Hospitality & Lodging Association and Marriott International asked the FCC to declare that a hotel operator can use equipment to manage its network even if it 'may result in 'interference with or cause interference' to a [wireless device] being used by a guest on the operator's property.' 'Wi-Fi network operators should be able to manage their networks in order to provide a secure and reliable Wi-Fi service to guests on their premises,' they argued. 'As Wi-Fi becomes increasingly popular for connecting to the Internet, it is imperative that the Commission clarify the rules of the road for Wi-Fi network operators,' the hotels' petition to the FCC reads. It says that personal wifi hotspots could be used to launch attacks on guest's machines. 'Any access point can be used to launch an attack against's an operators network or threaten its guest's privacy (for example by attempting to obtain guest's credit card details or other personal information). 'Wi-Fi network operators should be able to manage their networks in order to provide a secure and reliable Wi-Fi service to guests on their premises.' In October the FCC fined the Marriott Gaylord Opryland hotel in Nashville, Tennessee, $600,000 for cutting off conventioneers from using their own Wi-Fi, rather than buying the service from the hotel for between $250 and $1,000 per stand. The Marriott-owned Gaylord Opryland Hotel and Convention Center tech staff was using a monitoring system that de-authenticated guests' personal Wi-Fi hot spots. Now, Google and Microsoft have filed objections in fairly strong terms. Technology giants including Google have hit back, calling the plans 'inconsistent with the goals of promoting competition.' 'Allowing property owners to block guests' access to unaffiliated networks would be inconsistent with the goals of promoting competition and development of technologies in the market for Internet access,' said Google. 'There is no need for further clarification: The Commission should dismiss Petitioners' request for a rulemaking as inconsistent with settled, and sound, law.' The wireless industry's trade group, CTIA, said 'The public is best served by increasing the potential for these networks, not allowing an individual Wi-Fi network manager unilaterally to shut them down,' CTIA told the FCC. The FCC is considering the petition, and should announce the results of its findings in the New Year .","Hotels have asked the FCC to allow them to block personal wifi networks .

"If this cliff was on Earth it'd be among the tallest in the world - but it's on a comet just two and a half miles wide. The towering, jagged edifice, half a mile high with 65ft boulders at its foot, was revealed by an amateur astronomer who studied an image beamed back by the Rosetta probe as it orbits comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. From his home in Kendal in the Lake District, Stuart Atkinson's creation has been picked by Nasa as its astronomy picture of the day - leading him to declare with delight: 'Christmas came early for me today!'. Scroll down for video . Breathtaking: This cliff half a mile high has been spotted on comet 67P by the Rosetta probe - despite the lump of ice and dust measuring just two and a half miles across. Amateur astronomer Stuart Atkinson wrote: 'Just imagine standing there, craning your neck back' The original image was one of many released from the £1.1billion Rosetta probe, which has been orbiting comet 67P since it caught up with it in August following a ten-year, four billion mile chase. Mr Atkinson relied on notes by the European Space Agency which said the picture - pieced together from four taken 12 miles from the comet on December 10 - measured 1.8 by 1.6 miles from end to end. He tilted and cropped the image so just the cliff remained, pointing vertically down to what appeared to be the duck-shaped comet's centre. 'As soon as I saw that image I could see one area was just crying out to be cropped and turned into a landscape view,' he wrote on his blog Cumbrian Sky. 'Isn't that something? 'I think that is a genuinely stunning view. Just imagine standing there, at the foot of those cliffs, with those huge boulders scattered all around you, craning your head back to look up at the wall looming in front of and above you.' Original: The image was taken from the right hand side of this image, a composite of four taken by the Rosetta probe on December 10 some 12 miles from the rubber-duck-shaped comet's surface and measuring 1.8 by 1.6 miles from end to end . Beauty: The comet is hurtling towards the sun at 83,900mph and will reach its nearest point in August of next year, scientists say . According to Nasa the boulders at the foot of the ice and rock face, which are on surprisingly smooth, sandy-looking terrain, could measure 65ft across on their own. But anyone who jumped off the enormous cliff would be likely to survive because of the comet's low surface gravity, which is several hundred thousand times weaker than that on Earth. Rosetta is still orbiting the comet despite scientists losing contact with its £172million robotic surface lander, Philae, which landed at an angle with its solar panels partially obscured last month. That mean the European Space Agency had just 60 hours to gather data about the comet's make-up before its batteries ran out. Rosetta itself will remain in orbit around the comet as it hurtles towards the sun at around 83,900mph, reaching its closest point in August 2015 before it sweeps around and back out of the solar system. Unseen world: Some parts of the comet appear remarkably smooth, but it is pockmarked with jagged cliffs and impact craters . A mountain to climb: The high-resolution images are a far cry from those sent back by Nasa's Voyager probes in the late 1980s . The project has already been hailed as one of the greatest scientific achievements of 2014 by the journal Science. Data from Rosetta recently showed that water on the comet had a strikingly different composition to that on Earth - suggesting the water on our world came from an asteroid, not a comet as previously thought. The half-mile cliff on 67P, about a fifth of the size of the entire comet, is the same size as the highest sea cliffs on Earth - which tower half a mile high over the North Pacific Ocean in Molokai, Hawaii. However, it is far from the most dramatic rock features found in the solar system. The highest cliffs ever seen were spotted by Nasa's Voyager 2 probe in 1982 as it photographed Miranda, one of the moons of Uranus. Despite the moon measuring just 300 miles across, it had a gigantic ice cliff with a sheer vertical relief of 12 miles - making it more than ten times higher than the walls of the Grand Canyon. Into the void: The half-mile cliff on 67P, about a fifth of the size of the entire comet, is the same size as the highest sea cliffs on Earth . Despite the impressive features of the comet (pictured), Uranus' moon Miranda has the tallest cliffs in the solar system at 12 miles .","Beautiful photograph from ESA's Rosetta probe was analysed by Stuart Atkinson at his home in the Lake District .

"The days of ordering delicacies such as moules marinières could be numbered, as climate change threatens to change the acidity of the oceans. Researchers at Glasgow University discovered mussel shells become increasingly brittle when they are formed in more acidic water, leaving the creatures more vulnerable to predators. And the news comes after reports found the changes in an ocean’s pH levels can make shrimps and prawns taste more sour. Researchers at Glasgow University discovered mussel shells become increasingly brittle when they are formed in acidic water, leaving the creatures more vulnerable to predators. The acidity of the world’s oceans is changing as they absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide, which contributes to climate change . The acidity of the world’s oceans is changing as they absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide, which contributes to climate change. The water reacts with the carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid, which is expected to drop levels from pH 8 today, to pH 7.7 by the end of the 21st century. Marine biologists recently found that shellfish take on a sour flavour if they are reared in slightly acidified sea water. They warn that as the acidity of the planet's oceans changes, due to rising carbon dioxide levels, many of our favourite seafoods could become less appetising. The researchers put hundreds of northern shrimp Pandalus borealis into two tanks of water for three weeks. They were either placed in sea water with a pH of 8, or in a more acidic tank with a pH of 7.5. Decreased pH reduced the score significantly for appearance and taste, but not for texture. Shrimp raised in the waters with the lower pH were 2.6 times more likely to be rated as the worst tasting, while those reared in the less acidic water were 3.4 times more likely to be judged the tastiest. Also the 63 per cent of the shrimp from the acidic water died during the three weeks. Mussels’ shells are made of calcium carbonate and organic material created by the shellfish through a process known as biomineralisation. They draw bicarbonate ions from seawater, and use proteins in their bodies to make crystals of calcium carbonate to form their two-layer shells. The shell’s outer later is composed of calcite, while the inner layer is made of aragonite. In acidic water, there are fewer bicarbonate ions available for the mussels to make these shells. The researchers, whose findings were published in the Royal Society’s journal Interface, altered temperature and pH levels for common blue mussels in lab tanks. This was designed to simulate four different levels of acidity predicted to occur in oceans over the coming decades. Study leader Doctor Susan Fitzer, of Glasgow University’s School of Geographical and Earth Sciences, said: ‘What we’ve found in the lab is that increased levels of acidification in their habitats have a negative impact on mussels’ ability to create their shells. ‘We worked with colleagues in our School of Engineering to examine the toughness of the shells of the mussels in the more acidic water against those in control conditions. ‘What we found was that the calcite outer shells of the mussels past a certain threshold of acidity was stiffer and harder, making it more brittle and prone to fracture under pressure, and the aragonite inner shell became softer. Mussels draw bicarbonate ions from seawater and use proteins in their bodies to make crystals of calcium carbonate to form their shells. In acidic water, there are fewer bicarbonate ions available for the mussels to make these shells. This effect, however, was reduced when temperatures increased by 2°C (35°F) ‘This could mean that mussels growing in the wild in the future could be more vulnerable to attack from predators, as well as from the effect of ocean forces.’ The researchers continued that because blue mussels are commonly eaten by humans, these changes could also have an effect on the yields of mussels available for the fishing industry. This effect, however, was reduced when the temperature of the water was increased by 2°C (35°F). This might suggest the mussels are reverting to ancestral evolutionary mechanisms to mitigate the effects of increased acidity, continued Dr Fitzer. She added: ‘We’re planning to continue our research in this area in the future and expand its scope to look at the effects of more acidic water on the shells of other marine organisms including oysters and abalone.’","Mussel shells are made of calcium carbonate and organic material .
They draw bicarbonate ions from seawater to build these shells .
Shellfish then use body proteins  to make crystals of calcium carbonate .
In more acidic water, there are fewer bicarbonate ions available for shells .

"At a factory in a small Javanese town, the bloody carcasses of thousands of dead snakes lie piled on the floor. It is here, in Indonesia's Kapetakan village, snakes are slaughtered to fuel the West's booming appetite for snake skin handbags and shoes. These incredible photos show the vast quantity of snakes that go through its doors, with lengths of skins totalling hundreds of metres sold to bag factories in the West and Central Java provinces on a monthly basis. There are a variety of ways for snakes to be killed and skinned, although one method has been cited by many as exceptionally cruel and outdated. The snake is stunned with a blow to the head from the back of a machete and a hose pipe expertly forced between its jaws. Next, the water is turned on and the reptile fills up - swelling like a balloon. It will be left like that for ten minutes or so, a leather cord tied around its neck to prevent the liquid escaping. Then its head is impaled on a meat hook, a couple of quick incisions follow, and the now-loosened skin peeled off with a series of brutal tugs - much like a rubber glove from a hand.

"Heading to Eton: Ishak Ayiris has won a scholarship to one of Britain's top public schools . A schoolboy from one of the poorest areas in Britain is set to follow in the footsteps of David Cameron and Boris Johnson after winning a scholarship to Eton worth £76,000. Ishak Ayiris, the son of Ethiopian immigrants who are dependent on benefits, will swap an East End council estate for the 15th-century school which has produced 19 Prime Ministers. The 15-year-old is set to arrive at Eton in September, entering in the sixth form to study A-levels in politics, philosophy and economics. He is currently a pupil at Forest Gate Community School in Newham, east London, where he is supported by the 'pupil premium' payment which gives extra support to disadvantaged children. When he starts at Eton, which is situated across the River Thames from Windsor in Berkshire, he will board in one of the school's 25 boarding houses. 'Leaving will be hard for my family - not so much for me,' Ishak said. 'Windsor is much quieter than Newham. Newham is loud, vibrant. 'It is a wonderful opportunity for me. It will be very different because the people I have grown up with in Newham and at Forest Gate Community School don't have the same background as the people I will mix with at Eton. 'When my dad found out he said he had two dreams in my life - coming to England, and for his son to go to the same school as the Prime Minister. Both of these dreams have come true.' The school, founded by Henry VI in 1440, . has produced a host of leading public figures, including the current . Prime Minister, Mayor of London and Archbishop of Canterbury. Old school: The 15-year-old is currently a pupil at Forest Gate Community School in Newham, east London . New school: Ishak will be doing his A-levels at Eton College, which was founded in 1440 . Other well-known Old Etonians include cultural figures such as Percy Bysshe Shelley, George Orwell, Hugh Laurie and Damian Lewis. Ishak hopes to study at Oxford after . his two years at Eton, and says he plans to enter politics in order to . help people in areas such as the one he comes from. 'Drugs . and crime have a big impact on our community here in Newham,' he said. 'I see Newham as my home and I want to live here for the rest of my . life. 'I want to go and . get the best education I can and come back and improve it. The people . who live here, who were born here, know this area, they know the . situation, they know the problems and they are the best people to solve . these problems.' Classmates: Alexis Marinoiu, left, is going to City of London School while Irfan Badshah, second left, is going to Winchester; the schoolboys attribute their success to head teacher Simon Elliott, second right . Old boys: Ishak is following in the footsteps of well-known Etonians such as David Cameron and Hugh Laurie . Beak: A teacher . Div: A lesson . Reader: A free period . Chambers: The mid-morning break . Tug: A scholar - traditionally a poor boy whose attends for free; examples include Boris Johnson and George Orwell . Oppidan: A non-scholar - traditionally from a wealthier background; examples include David Cameron and Ranulph Fiennes . Pop: The prefects who are allowed to wear colourful waistcoats . The talented schoolboy attributes his success to head teacher Simon Elliott, who gave him the confidence to apply to Eton. 'He talks to us not like we are pupils but as equals,' Ishak said. 'He is an unorthodox character in the sense that most head teachers are hard to access. 'He is out walking around the school every day. He wants us to discuss things with him and make us think about things.' Two of Ishak's classmates, Irfan Badshah and Alexis Marinoiu, also won prestigious scholarships to leading public schools. Irfan will study politics, history, English and philosophy at Winchester College, while Alexis will study maths, further maths and physics at City of London School. Mr Elliott credited the pupil premium for his school's impressive results, saying: 'There is a great deal of poverty in this area, extreme poverty. The pupil premium has given these boys the opportunities they might not have had.'","Ishak Ayiris, 15, is the son of Ethiopian immigrants who rely on benefits .

"A Philadelphia model has filed a lawsuit against an Uber driver claiming he punched her in the face and punctured her skin with an earring in a road rage incident over the summer. Lorraine Delp claims in her suit, filed last week in Philadelphia Civil Court, that at around 3pm on July 17 she was standing in traffic on Sansom Street when Djamel Khelife, a driver with the popular ride-sharing service, came up to her window and started banging on it to get her to move. Miss Delp states in her complaint that Khelife was hurling profanities at her and spat on her window after she mouthed the words, 'Do not touch my car.' Beauty: Model Lorraine Delp (left and right) has filed a civil lawsuit claiming an Uber driver punched her in July . Road rage brawl: According to the suit, Delp was in her car in Philadelphia July 17 when Uber driver Djamel Khelife came up to her and started banging on her window to get her to move . According to the fashion model, who also studies horticulture at Barnes Foundation Arboretum School, when she emerged from her vehicle the Uber driver hit her in the face, dislocating her nose. The blow also allegedly resulted in one of her earrings getting pushed through her skin, leaving a puncture wound on her neck. The statuesque brunette also claims she suffered bruising, a scratch on her arm and had her shirt ripped. According to court documents cited by NBC10, a pair of Good Samaritans came to Delp's aid and dragged the 53-year-old driver away from her. Police were called to the scene and Khelife was arrested on charges of simple assault, aggravated assault and reckless endangerment. Bruised: Delp, a college student, claims Khelife punched her in the face, damaging her nose, and pushed one of her earrings through the skin on her neck . Delp (center), pictured here in 2011 co-hosting a preview of Giorgio Armani Fall Collection at Saks Fifth Avenue, is seeking $500,000 from the ride-sharing company and the driver . He was released on $6,000 bail the following day and was not formally arraigned until late October. According to court documents, Khelife’s trial is expected to get under way January 22. Miss Delp's civil lawsuit names both the driver and Uber, and it seeks more than $500,000 in damages. Attorney Debra Rainey, who represents Djamel Khelife, has called Delp's claims into question saying that had her client -  6 feet tall and weighing 180lbs - actually attacked the slender model, her injuries would have been far more extensive. Rainey also pointed out that her client was off duty at the time of the alleged attack. In response to Daily Mail’s request for comment, an Uber spokesperson said the company cannot discuss active litigation but pointed out that ‘safety is Uber's top priority and we're committed to maintaining the highest level of safety and quality for riders and drivers.’ Khalife's attorney said hadher client  actually attacked the slender model (center), her injuries would have been far more extensive . Only last week, Uber's head of global safety unveiled plans to introduce new ways to screen would-be drivers. The ride-sharing company came under intense scrutiny after an Uber driver in Massachusetts was arraigned on charges including rape and kidnapping of a female passenger. 'We are finding solutions in many places that range from polygraph exams that fill gaps in available data to adding our own processes on top of existing screening for commercial licenses,' wrote company security chief Philip Cardenas in a blog post last Wednesday.","Lorraine Delp filed $500,000 civil lawsuit naming Uber and driver Djamel Khelife .

"Hundreds of protesters took to the streets of New York City on Tuesday evening to condemn police brutality, ignoring calls from New York's governor, the city's mayor and others calling for restraint. Protesters, carrying signs reading ‘Jail Killer Cops’ and 'Stop The War On Black America' marched en masse to demand justice for those who have died recently at the hands of police. The rallies began in Union Square and outside City Hall and protesters then marched through midtown Manhattan. Some protesters chanted 'Hey-hey, ho-ho. These racist cops have got to go' and 'How do you spell racist? N-Y-P-D.' as they marched along Fifth Avenue. Scroll down for videos . Hundreds of protesters defied Mayor de Blasio's request, carrying signs reading ‘Jail Killer Cops’ and 'Angry Pacifist' they marched demand justice for those who have died recently at the hands of police . An NYPD Officer on a motorbike keeps track of anti-NYPD protesters as they march through the Upper East Side of Manhattan on Monday . NYPD officers used motorbikes to create a cordon as protesters, demonstrating against decisions by grand juries in New York and Missouri not to indict white police officers in the killings of unarmed black men, held placards while marching down Fifth Avenue in Manhattan on Tuesday night . The demonstrations went on despite calls by Mayor Bill de Blasio on Monday for a hiatus on demonstrations until after the funerals of the two NYPD cops - Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu - murdered by Ismaaiyl Brinsley on Saturday. Organizers ignored de Blasio's call for the march to be cancelled and said there was no reason to 'give in to hysteria' and call off the event. At first, marchers stayed on the sidewalks as a large police presence, with officers - some wearing riot helmets and face shields - keeping protesters from impeding holiday traffic. ‘We object to some people painting us with an “anti-cop” brush,’ Robert Gangi, director of the Police Reform Organizing Project, told the Daily News. ‘The charge does not apply. We are anti-NYPD practices, such as the quota driven “broken windows” approach to policing which targets low-income people of color...’ The protesters were mostly peaceful as they made their way through the city's bustling shopping district although the demonstration eventually spilled into the streets. The protests started last month as a reaction to the police-involved killings of Eric Garner on Staten Island, New York, and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Mayor Bill de Blasio had called Monday for a pause in protests over police conduct. He faces a widening rift with those in a grieving police force who accuse him of creating a climate of mistrust that contributed to the killings of the officers. Police Commissioner William Bratton, speaking Tuesday in Rhode Island, said it was 'unfortunate' that some protests continued despite the mayor's plea. New York City landmarks including the Empire State Building and the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree dimmed their lights from 9 p.m. to 9:05 p.m. on Tuesday to honor the slain officers.

Unity: Cops embraced one another while members of the public gathered to express their feelings at the Saturday double murder . Guest: Mayor Bill de Blasio - who has faced criticism from some officers - came to the memorial with his wife Chirlane McCray. The pair laid flowers and later led a moment of silence . Earlier on Tuesday, uniformed cops had laid bouquets, lit candles and left toys around the street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of the city where a crazed gunman shot dead officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu. They were joined by mayor Bill de Blasio and his wife, who also laid flowers at the site in a show of unity with the police force, elements of which say the mayor had turned against them before the deaths. De Blasio later led city officials in a moment of silence at 2.47pm Monday - exactly three days after Ismaaiyl Brinsley opened fire on officers Ramos and Liu as they sat in their patrol car. Officers amassed at the memorial fell silent to honor their fallen comrades, as city leaders urged people around New York and the country to do the same. Mayor de Blasio told a press conference at City Hall: 'I want o ask everyone who is assembled here, and everyone who is watching to now bow our heads in memory of Officer Ramos and Officer Liu'. He then paused for around a minute and embraced his wife Chirlane McCray - then told others to do the same as a symbol of their communal grief. Today at the memorial, near the Myrtle/Willoughby subway stations on the G line, NYPD Lieutenant Tanisha Gurley was one of those mourning the two men. As she knelt in front of the memorial a single tear could be seen running down her cheek. Other officers were pictured embracing, while sobbing members of the public also paid their respects. Silence: Mayor Bill de Blasio bowed his head in City hall - and urged others to do the same - at 2.47pm, the time the officers were shot . Embrace: De Blasio and his wife Chirlane McCray embraced publicly after the silence and urged others to do likewise . Paying respects: At the memorial in Brooklyn, officers bowed their heads and paused as well . Grieving: The silence coincided with a message from NYPD commissioner Bill Bratton praising the two fallen officers . Details of a full funeral for officer Ramos - a regular church-goer who aspired to be a full-time minister - were announced, with a service in Queens set for December 27. Last night NYPD officials said arrangements for Liu's funeral would follow after relatives had been flown in from China. Earlier that day NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton posted a message honoring the fallen officers, and said the department will keep its flags at half-mast until after Christmas. He described Liu and Ramos as: 'loving fathers, husbands, and sons—points of great pride for their communities. 'They were also part of our NYPD family, bonded by the experiences, triumphs, and challenges we face so that others won’t have to. They dedicated their lives to the defense of others, and understood what that commitment could ultimately mean. 'They were people of faith, of conviction, and of principle. They answered the call to service, and did so each and every day they wore the uniform. They were devoted to the protection of this city and the safety of its people. 'They didn’t do this work to be thanked, congratulated, or admired. They did it because it must be done, because we all have the basic right to live free from fear. And with all of us, they stood tall to guard those who cannot guard themselves, to shield the frightened, the weak, and the vulnerable. 'We are their memory. We are their legacy. And we still stand.

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez has sounded a warning over Ross Barkley being expected to be England's match-winner at the World Cup. The 20-year-old's inclusion on Roy Hodgson's squad has excited many with former England striker Gary Lineker the latest in a long line to liken the midfielder to the mercurial Paul Gascoigne. However, Barkley's club manager believes putting too much pressure on the player, not matter how talented he is, will be detrimental to his development. England star: Roy Hodgson has selected Ross Barkley in his 23-man World Cup squad for this summer . He's only young: His Everton manager Roberto Martinez says the midfielder must be protected . 'You can never get an experience like playing in a World Cup too soon if you are ready and Ross is ready,' Martinez said. 'What is important is, as a nation, we have a responsibility to look after a young man who goes to the World Cup with the only intention of helping England be as good as they can. 'He is still young and we have to protect him. If we protect him well we are talking about a potential world-class talent. 'But it is down to us to allow him time and a little bit of a path to fulfil his potential with England. 'We shouldn't expect Ross Barkley, at the age of 20, to go into a World Cup and be someone who has to win games single-handedly. That would be very wrong.' Hodgson's squad has a significant youthful element to it with Barkley joined by Southampton left-back Luke Shaw, 18, Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling, 19, and 20-year-old Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Impressive: Barkley has taken the Premier League by storm this season . Their inclusion has added a vibrancy and unpredictability to the national side but Martinez stressed they should not bear the burden of unrealistic expectation. 'My message to every English fan and supporter in general is that we should embrace the younger generation - and it is phenomenal to have that - who have been called up by the England manager. 'But we have to understand we carry a responsibility of allowing the young players to have a positive experience, whatever that is. 'Then we can allow them to grow and put them in a position where they have (played) 300 to 400 games and can then be tested and pushed to see if they can win a World Cup. 'At the moment it is making sure they are protected in their environment, are allowed to enjoy their football and whatever they bring to the occasion is going to be a great learning curve for the future. 'Like any job in any line of work you are better by the experience you get and it is having the opportunity to make mistakes and grow and just become better out of that. High praise: He has been compared to Paul Gascoigne with his drive from midfield and dribbling . 'Whatever they bring to this World Cup is a bonus. We should be looking further ahead to see the results of these youngsters. 'Experience in a World Cup has to be a positive one whatever the results are. 'But it is something we do quite often - we build the expectations and then lose the opportunity of fulfilling that potential and having a special player for the future. 'We are not the only ones, there are many nations who build expectations so quickly and then put them on young shoulders and that is unfair. 'There is not a written rule of what you should do. You should allow them to enjoy the experience, whatever it is, and then set the next target for them and continually evaluate them and give them an area to improve and focus on.'","Ross Barkley must be looked after at the World Cup, says Roberto Martinez .

"Traditional missions to Mars involve large rockets for both blasting off and slowing down. However, researchers believe there may be a simpler, cheaper way. Rather than blasting to the red planet and using rockets to slow themselves down, future craft could simply use planetary gravity fields to 'drift' into the Martian atmosphere. Called ballistic capture, the new method could help open the Martian frontier for more robotic missions, future manned expeditions and even colonization efforts, researchers say - and even Nasa is interested. Traditional missions use rockets to shoot for the location Mars will be in its orbit where the spacecraft will meet it - known as a Hohmann transfer. The new method puts the spacecraft into a Mars-like orbit so that it flies ahead of the planet, slowing down until it is pulled to the surface by the gravitational force. While launch and cruise costs remain the same, the large, complex burn to slow down and hit the planet at the perfect speed is not needed. Once at the red planet, Mars' own gravitational field could catch hold and pull them down. Called ballistic capture, it could help open the Martian frontier for more robotic missions, future manned expeditions and even colonization efforts, researchers say - and even Nasa is interested. 'It's an eye-opener,' James Green, director of Nasa's Planetary Science Division, told Scientific American. 'It could be a pretty big step for us and really save us resources and capability, which is always what we're looking for.' Traditional missions use rockets to shoot for the location Mars will be in its orbit where the spacecraft will meet it - known as a Hohmann transfer. The new method, known as ballistic capture, puts the spacecraft into a Mars-like orbit so that it flies ahead of the planet, slowing down until it is pulled in by the gravitational force. While launch and cruise costs remain the same, the large, complex burn to slow down and hit the planet at the perfect speed is not needed. The new method puts the spacecraft into a Mars-like orbit so that it flies ahead of the planet, slowing down until it is pulled to the surface by the gravitational force. 'That's the magic of ballistic capture—it's like flying in formation,' says Edward Belbruno, a longtime Nasa employee and expert, and co-author, with Francesco Topputo of the Polytechnic University of Milan of the new paper, posted on arXiv, and submitted to the journal Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy. 'We construct a new type of transfer from the Earth to Mars, which ends in ballistic capture,' the pair wrote. In 1990 Belbruno applied his ideas for low energy transfer orbits to the Japanese lunar probe Hiten, which had been designed only for lunar swing-by and had suffered a failure of the Hagoromo lunar orbiter. The main Hiten probe lacked the fuel to enter lunar orbit using a conventional Hohmann transfer trajectory, but Belbruno was able to devise a ballistic capture trajectory that would put it in lunar orbit using only a negligible amount of fuel. The probe entered lunar orbit in 1991, the first time that Belbruno's ideas had been put to the test. 'This results in a substantial savings in capture from that of a classical Hohmann transfer under certain conditions. 'This transfer type may be of interest for Mars missions because of lower capture costs, moderate flight time, and flexibility of launch period from the Earth.' 'This new class of transfers to Mars offers new mission possibilities for Mars missions.' The method could one day be used for manned missions to Mars - although it would add several months to mission times. Belbruno worked out how to let the competing gravities of Earth, the sun and moon gently pull a spacecraft into a desired lunar orbit. All three bodies can be thought of as creating bowl-like depressions in spacetime. By lining up the trajectory of a spacecraft through those bowls, such that momentum slackens along the route, a spacecraft can just 'roll' down at the end into the moon's small bowl, easing into orbit fuel-free. 'It's a delicate dance,' Belbruno said.","Current missions use rocket to slow themselves as they approach planets .
New, slower mission would be gradually 'grabbed' by martian gravity .

The Rangers manager is under growing pressure after an indisciplined 2-0 loss to Hearts on Saturday left the Ibrox club nine points adrift in the SPFL Championship. Crippled by the loss of midfielder Steven Smith to a needless red card after 21 minutes at Tynecastle, a 1,000-strong travelling support turned on their manager vocally even before Jamie Walker’s decisive strike from the penalty spot. Jon Daly has demanded his Rangers team give more for manager Ally McCoist (above) Hearts beat Rangers 2-0 on Saturday to move nine points clear at the top of the Scottish Championship . Handed a start in place of the misfiring Kris Boyd, Daly admitted the players let their manager down and now have to answer key questions. ‘Once we go out on the park we need to provide performances and wins,’ said the Irishman. ‘The last couple of weeks we’ve not done that. We need to start doing that for the manager to start helping him out. ‘All the boys really like the manager and the coaching staff. You have to look close to home as players and ask ourselves are we doing enough to help him out when we go out there?’ A defiant McCoist says he has given no thought to his own position and insists Rangers can still reel in Hearts to win automatic promotion. Beaten in all three meetings with the Tynecastle side and Edinburgh rivals Hibernian, however, Saturday’s loss was a bitter blow which raised fresh questions over the managerial future of the club’s all time top scorer. Daly (left) receives a booking from referee Craig Thomson (centre) in the game against Hearts . Jason Holt (centre) celebrates scoring for Hearts against Rangers on Saturday . Unhappy with Smith for a reckless, dangerous sliding challenge on Callum Paterson, McCoist said the converted full-back had let his side down. ‘Obviously a decision, a red card, hasn’t helped him,’ added Daly. ‘That’s not me saying I think Smudger (Smith) has let us down, I don’t think he has, I think he’s unfortunate. ‘He’s gone to win the ball and he’s slightly late. In this day and age, you seem to get red cards for tackles like that.’ Referee Craig Thomson showed leniency towards Rangers in the second half when Kenny Miller and Kris Boyd were spared red cards for further late challenges.

Miller appeared to be unhappy with Paterson for his reaction to the Smith red card and a subsequent later challenge. Suggesting Hearts — who could be missing Kevin McHattie for up to three months after he was injured following a Miller challenge — contributed to the nine yellow and one red card shown by referee Thomson, Daly added: ‘For me, I don’t think their reaction helps the situation, but that seems to be the way football is. It’s changed an awful lot since I started playing. ‘That seems to be coming in a lot more into the game, players trying to get people booked and sent off. ‘I don’t think it’s the right thing to be doing but that is obviously the way football seems to be changing. ‘I think it’s a man’s game and when a player gets hit and he goes down screaming like he’s been shot by a sniper I don’t think it really helps the case. ‘Obviously, the referee hears a scream and sees the reaction of a player rolling on the floor and he thinks he has been seriously hurt. You have to cut the referee a bit of slack because if he sees that he thinks it’s a serious injury. ‘But you have to ask questions of the players if they are trying to con the ref or not.’","Ally McCoist took fans' fury Rangers lost 2-0 to Hearts at Tynecastle .

"A second video has emerged of the smiling Florida man believed to be the first American to carry out a suicide attack in Syria. In footage released by an al-Qaeda-linked group fighting in Syria, college dropout Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, smiles while talking about wanting to die and is also shown making his bomb before strapping it on. This is the second video to feature the American jihadi, and it contains a haunting soundtrack of Arabic music set against the images and words of a man hell-bent on dying for the cause. 'I want to rest in the afterlife, in heaven,' Abu-Slaha says. 'There is nothing here, my heart is not resting here in this life.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Jihadi good time: Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha (right) is shown joking around with a fellow terrorist in the chilling video . All smiles: Florida college dropout-turned-suicide bomber Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha was filmed smiling and talking about wanting to die . Blast: Abu-Salha is believed to have taken part in a mass suicide bombing that targeted the army in Syria in May . The 22-year-old, who once lived about . 130 miles from Miami, is believed to have been part of a mass suicide . bombing on May 25 which targeted several army positions. The Nusra Front, which released the video, claimed two of the other three suicide attackers in the assault in the government-held northwestern city of Idlib were from foreign countries, including one from the Maldives. 'Glorious is God, and thanks God, his is a grace from him,' Abu-Salha continues. 'When I came to Syria, I had nothing. 'I had no money to buy a gun and ammunition, now God granted me all of that and much more.' The grinning geurilla is then shown making the bomb believed to have been in the truck Abu-Salha  and others drove as they stormed their target. 'Heaven is better,' he said in a previously-released video. 'When people die they either go to heaven or hell. There is happiness beyond explanation.' The video was posted on jihadi websites. It corresponded with the Associated Press reporting about the attack and Abu-Salha. All-American: Abu-Salha grew up in Florida, where he played youth league basketball . Opposition forces previously identified the American who carried out the bombing as Abu Hurayra al-Amriki and said he was a U.S. citizen. The name al-Amriki means 'the American' in Arabic. It is unknown how many people were killed in the bombing. Opposition rebels with the Nusra Front said Abu-Salha's truck was laden with 16 tons of explosives to tear down the al-Fanar restaurant, a gathering site for Syrian troops. The other suicide attackers targeted nearby army positions. Abu-Salha grew up in Florida and attended several colleges before dropping out and moving abroad. He lived in various parts of the Sunshine State, where his parents ran several grocery stores. At one point, he shared an apartment with his brother about 130 miles from Miami. The 22-year-old had appeared to have had a regular American upbringing, playing on a basketball youth league, and enjoying sports. But recent trips to Syria had meant federal officials were already keeping an eye on him, the New York Times reported. Thousands of foreign fighters have come to Syria from around the world to fight against President Bashar Assad's forces after the uprising against his government began three years ago. The war, which began in 2011, has since taken on strong sectarian overtones, pitting a Sunni-led insurgency that includes al-Qaeda-inspired extremist groups against a government dominated by Assad's minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam. Roots: Abu-Salha grew up in Florida, where his parents run several grocery stores . New path: After dropping out of college, Abu-Salha moved abroad . Syria's . uprising began with peaceful protests in March 2011 but escalated into . an armed revolt when government forces launched a sweeping crackdown on . dissent. The . conflict has killed at least 170,000 people, nearly a third of them . civilians, according to activists. Nearly 3 million Syrians have fled . the country. On Saturday, a car bomb exploded in a northern Syrian town near the Turkish border, killing and wounding a number of people. The Aleppo Media Center said the car bomb exploded in a vegetable market in the town of Azaz. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the car blew up near a gas station in Azaz. The Observatory said the blast killed at least four people and wounded several others. The AMC said it killed and wounded a number of people, without offering specific figures. The Observatory and an Idlib-based activist who goes by the name of Asad Kanjo said another car blew up in the northern village of Atmeh near the Turkish border. The Observatory said the blast killed two people. Kanjo said the blast occurred near a market and close to a children's hospital, though it was not affected. The Observatory also said the Syrian troops recaptured the Shaer gas field in the central province of Homs a week after fighters from the Islamic State group captured it and killed dozens of soldiers. Syrian state television confirmed that troops recaptured the field, saying that 'large numbers of Islamic State terrorists were wiped out.' The Observatory said a missile shot down the helicopter Friday night over a neighborhood of Aleppo known as Camp Nairab. Camp Nairab is adjacent to the Nairab military airport southeast of the city, where government aircraft take off to carry out attacks in northern Syria. Attack: Abu-Salha, left, is believed to have driven a truck, top right, filled with explosives to a restaurant where troops gather before blowing it, and himself, up . Assad's forces use helicopters to drop barrel bombs - crude explosives that have killed thousands of people and caused widespread destruction, especially in Aleppo. The Observatory and an Aleppo-based activist who goes by the name Abu Saeed Izzedine said the helicopter crash killed four people, including a child. The Observatory said three of the dead were the helicopter's crew members. Aleppo, once Syria's commercial capital, has been the scene of heavy fighting since rebels seized part of the city in 2012. The Observatory also reported Saturday that the number of soldiers killed over the past few days in a northern military base in Raqqa that was overrun by the extremist Islamic State group has risen to 85. It said the fate of 200 others was still unknown. The monitoring group, which relies on a network of activists inside the country, said Islamic State fighters have executed and paraded the bodies of 'tens' of soldiers in Raqqa, the only provincial capital in rebel hands. Amateur videos posted online by activists showed more than a dozen beheaded bodies in a busy square said to be in Raqqa. Some of the heads were placed on a nearby fence, where at least two headless bodies were crucified. The video appeared genuine and corresponded to other AP reporting of the events.","Al-Qaeda-linked group released footage last week of attack preparation .

"United Airlines is facing a $5million lawsuit from a female passenger, who alleges she was 'dragged' off a plane by police, then was in a county jail for three days. Plaintiff Jean Mamakos twice attempted switching seats in Seattle on her way to Alaska for a ski trip and wanted to get some shut-eye, she told CBS New York. 'One of the stewardesses said ""Oh no you don’t."" Which stopped me in my tracks,' Mamakos told the affiliate station of her first start toward an empty row. Scroll down for video . Plaintiff: Jean Mamakos, pictured, alleges police 'dragged' her off the plane after she decided not to pay extra money for a seat switch and went back to her original seat .

Mamakos also alleged that 'So I went forward [in the plane] and then another stewardess came along and said ""Give me your credit card.""' CBS New York reported the empty emergency row seat came with a price tag of an extra $109. Mamakos chose not to fork over the money - and while in her original seat 'heard the captain say ""There is a lady that wants to get off the plane on this flight, so we have to wait,""' she told CBS New York. Mamakos also claimed that flight attendants 'said ""You have to get off this plane."" And I said ""No, I paid for this seat and I’m going to stay here.""'

The courts were closed over the weekend, meaning Mamakos was in jail for three days, her attorney told the news outlet. The affiliate station reported that '[United Airlines] won't comment on the case, but said federal law requires pre-flight briefing for anyone seated in emergency rows, and added that balance and weight safety regulations prevent onboard seat changes.'","Plaintiff Jean Mamakos claims she tried switching seats in Seattle on her way to Alaska for a ski trip .

"Romelu Lukaku is reluctant to sign a new contract at Chelsea and wants crunch talks with Jose Mourinho after the World Cup. The Belgium international has two years left on his current Blues deal, but the Stamford Bridge club are keen to safeguard his value by offering him a new deal this summer. However, Lukaku wants assurances over his first-team opportunities at Chelsea before considering extending his deal. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Romelu Lukaku's funny reaction to missed penalty . Planning for the future: Romelu Lukaku wants to talk with Jose Mourinho about his future . Despite his impact on loan at West Brom and Everton over the past two seasons, Lukaku fears Mourinho does not view him as a key member of his future plans. Lukaku knows his future will pose Chelsea a problem in the coming months, and is unwilling to relinquish his growing position of strength by penning fresh terms. With just two years left to run on his current deal, Lukaku knows Chelsea will have to cash in on him in the next two transfer windows before the prospect of losing the striker on a free transfer in 2016 becomes a real possibility. It's good to talk: Mourinho and Lukaku are planning on talking after the World Cup . Season to remember: Lukaku had an excellent season for Everton last season scoring 16 goals . Signing a new contract would eliminate any immediate rush for Chelsea to make a decision on Lukaku’s future. And the 21-year-old wants to meet with Mourinho to find out if signing a new deal would see him fully re-integrated in to the first-team set-up at Chelsea or simply be made available for loan again. As Sportsmail revealed earlier this week Lukaku is a target for Atletico Madrid as they look to replace Chelsea-bound Diego Costa. Part of the deal? Atletico Madrid are keen on Lukaku as part of the deal that could take Diego Costa to Chelsea . The prospect of including Lukaku in the deal for Costa has been explored, but third-party ownership issues in relation to the Spain international would provide a major obstacle in a deal structured that way. If Chelsea do decide to sell Lukaku this summer then they will want to recoup at least the £17million they paid for him three years ago. In addition to Atletico, there is interest from Tottenham while Everton manager Roberto Martinez is keen on signing Lukaku on a permanent basis following his successful loan spell.","Striker seeking assurances over his future at Stamford Bridge .

"A circus has had two dogs confiscated – after police said they were painted black and white to fool customers who expected to see pandas. Police in Brescia, Italy, seized the chow chows amid claims circus-goers were being tricked into handing over cash just to pose for photos with the animals. Officers were tipped off about the male and female animals, which were being put on display before the circus show started. Scroll down for video . A circus has had two dogs confiscated – after they were painted black and white to fool customers who expected to see pandas. One of the animals seized is pictured above . According to the website Thelocal.it, specialist police officers then swooped and confiscated the dogs which had been painted black and white. Children had been paying a fee to have their photo taken with the animals - believing them to be pandas, police said. The dogs were said to be in a healthy state when they were taken away but had ‘watery eyes’. Children had been paying a fee to have their photo taken with the animals - believing them to be actual pandas like the ones pictured above . The website quotes a police spokesman as saying that this was ‘probably aggravated by the continuous exposure to camera flashes’. Officers acted on animal cruelty grounds, and the local reports that the owners are facing charges over the dogs’ false passports.

"The president's job approval rating in a Gallup poll briefly crested at an unenviable 47 per cent December 18–21, after a jovial Barack Obama showed up Friday to answer largely softball questions from nine women in the White House press corps. That measure was a fluke, however: After two days at what was his highest rating of the year, he tumbled back down to 44 per cent. Even a much-discused December 8 appearance on The Colbert Report, where the president jostled, joked and showed his personable side, didn't help buoy Americans' view of him. Gallup and Rasmussen Reports, the other major poll that measures presidential job approval on a daily basis, both reported a job-approval decline – not a positive 'bounce' – beginning the day after the late-night broadcast. WHO'S GOT A PROBLEM? Obama's job approval ratings have never recovered since they began tanking in the scandal-filled spring of 2013 . WALKING DOWNHILL: President Obama (right) and his daughter Malia (2nd right) hiked alongside others Tuesday at the Makapu'u Point Lighthouse in East Oahu, Hawaii . NO BOUNCE: A December 8 appearance on 'The Colbert Report' bought Obama a public approval downturn, not the customary uptick politicians see after sitting down with late-night comedy hosts . ENDANGERED SPECIES: This woman displayed her customized shirt as Obama's motorcade passed by in Kailua, Hawaii on Tuesday, but fewer and fewer Americans see things her way . Rasmussen saw Obama's approval numbers drop from 49 per cent to 47 per cent in the two days following his Colbert appearance. Gallup's numbers told a similar tale, with that measurement slipping from 44 per cent to 42 per cent over the same period. Americans polled by Rasmussen were less generous about Obama's final press conference of the year, however, boosting his approval rating by just a single point. That, like his Gallup bounce, has now settled back to where it was. Despite a booming stock market and low gas prices, Obama's domestic and foreign policy troubles have kept his job approval rating low. Real Clear Politics averages the 13 published presidential approval polls, giving greater weight to the polls that record opinions of more Americans. Overall, that measure stands at 42.7 per cent approval and 52.5 per cent disapproval. The most dismal news in the bunch came from a Reuters/Ipsos poll last conducted Dec. 10–14, when just 37 percent of Americans said Obama was doing a good job in the Oval Office. That poll has the most robust sample size of all the U.S. presidential polls, sampling the opinions of more than 2,000 Americans. The president's public-perception crisis began in earnest in late May 2013 as a trio of damaging scandals dogged his White House. While accusations flew that the president's Justice Department was tapping reporters' phone lines and his IRS was targeting conservative nonprofits for especially intrusive screening, the National Security Agency was raked daily over hot coals for its phone call data-collection dragnet, exposed by leaker Edwad Snowden. That period marked the beginning of the end for Obama's net-positive presidency: By the 1st of June, more Americans gave him a failing grade than those who liked his job performance. OUT OF SIGHT ... Obama is vacationing in Hawaii as he did last year, getting in 18 holes of golf whenever rain doesn't get in the way . The gap between the yeas and nays grew for the rest of the year, according to the Real Clear Politics average, cresting at more than 16 per cent as the Obamacare website's woes became a daily front-page flogging in November. The administration has never recovered its once buoyant, glittering mystique. Shortly after his inauguration, Obama's polling average had him on the positive side of the ledger with more than 65 per cent of Americans giving him a hopeful nod. But now he is flirting with becoming the worst-performing two-term president in modern memory as he enters his final two years in office. In the middle of his sixth December in the Oval Office tenure, Bill Clinton's approval in the Gallup poll stood at 67 per cent – and that ringing endorsement came just a week before House Republicans voted to impeach him. Dwight D. Eisenhower's rating was 57 per cent in December 1958, during a year when he sent American military forces to occupy parts of Lebanon. About 48 per cent of Americans approved of Ronald Reagan in December 1986, despite the pall of the Iran-Contra scandal hanging over the White House. Gallup's poll numbers over the years show that President Obama could be one scandal away from dipping into George W. Bush's job-approval  territory . An average of Obama's poll numbers shows his approval ratings have been 'under water' since June 2013 . Only George W. Bush has fared worse than Obama, according to Gallup, rating just 37 per cent approval at the same point in his presidency where Obama finds himself now. Americans had a deep sense of Iraq War 'fatigue' in December 2006, and Democrats had just taken control of both houses of Congress in a decisive midterm election. Those circumstances mirror Obama's. The self-proclaimed Islamic State continues to threaten American interests in Iraq and Syria, and Republicans are preparing to take the reins on both ends of the U.S. Capitol for the first time since Bush faced the same lame-duck status eight years ago. Other presidents going back to the mid-1950s – John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush – served less than eight years in the White House.","Job approval rating in the Gallup survey went to 47 per cent for two days after Obama's pre-vacation Q&A on Friday, but quickly returned to 44 .
Gallup's data show that the president's much-discussed appearance on The Colbert Report COST him points with the public .

"More Americans are forsaking the hustle and bustle of New York for the wacky shore of the Sunshine State. Florida has overtaken New York as the third most populous state in the United States, the Census Bureau has revealed. Figures released Tuesday  show that Florida has at least 19.9 million residents. The number is likely higher because the Census uses the population as of July 1 to create its estimate. Hello, sunshine: The Census Bureau announced on Tuesday that Florida had overtaken New York as the third largest US state . New York had 19.7 million residents. Florida added almost 300,000 new residents from 2013 to 2014, or a little more than 800 new residents a day. By contrast, New York grew by only 51,000 over that time period. Florida likely reached the milestone sometime last spring, but it wasn't official until the Census said so. An Associated Press analysis earlier this year showed that ex-New Yorkers represented about 1 in 10 new Florida residents. Migrants from other countries made up about a quarter of Florida's new residents. Florida has a way to go before it catches up with California and Texas, the largest and second-largest states. California has 38.8 million residents; Texas has 27 million residents. The other states rounding out the 10 largest in the nation are: Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Georgia, North Carolina and Michigan. North Carolina slipped by Michigan for the ninth spot on the list. Six states saw population declines: Illinois, West Virginia, Connecticut, New Mexico, Alaska and Vermont. Fueled by an energy boom, North Dakota was the fastest-growing state in the nation, even though it is still the fourth least-populous state in the union. Its population increased 2.2 percent and now stands at 739,000. The other fastest-growing states from 2013 to 2014 were Nevada and Texas, which both had population increases of 1.7 percent.","Florida added nearly 300,000 new residents between 2013 and 2014 .

"More than half of Real Madrid's supporters would be happy for the club to accept a bid in excess of €150million (£118m) for Gareth Bale, a survey on AS.com has revealed. Reports on Tuesday suggested that Manchester United are lining up a world-record £120million bid for the former Tottenham winger, and in a survey of over 30,000 readers, 53.75 per cent admitted they would be happy to let him go. Bale has already won four trophies in his time at the Spanish club - the Champions League, Spanish Cup, Euro Super Cup and, this week, the Club World Cup - but his days at the Bernabeu could be numbered. Gareth Bale has tasted success in his time at Real Madrid, winning four trophies since September 2013 . Bale posted a picture on his Instagram on Tuesday night showing a late training session at Madrid . A move to Manchester United would see a spectacular return to the Premier League for Welshman Bale . Louis van Gaal refused to comment on the reports at his press conference on Tuesday, suggesting that the matter is something he will discuss with the Manchester United hierarchy and not the press. 'I cannot discuss that with you,' Van Gaal said. 'I discuss that with my CEO and not with anyone of the media.' Despite the poll, Bale is well-loved among the Madrid support, having scored 33 goals in his first 66 appearances for the club. In that time, he has provided 24 assists too.

"Romelu Lukaku can become the best player in the world, according to Roberto Martinez. The Belgian international completed a permanent switch to Everton for a club record £28million in the summer after a successful season on loan at the Goodison club.

Lukaku wheels away in celebration after opening the scoring during the match against West Ham on Saturday . Everton boss Roberto Martinez claims that Lukaku can become the best player in the world . Lukaku notched his fifth goal of the season during a 2-1 win against West Ham on Saturday and Everton boss Martinez is delighted with the striker's contribution to the team, claiming he has all the attributes to become the best player on the planet. 'He is someone that holds up the ball and brings a lot of fear to the opposition because they always get players around him which opens space at all times,' Martinez is quoted as saying in the Liverpool Echo. 'He's got power, he's got pace, he's a clinical footballer driving the ball – I've been delighted with Rom. 'I think he's doing exactly what the team needs. He's such a winner that he wants to become the best striker in the world and he's got the potential to do that.' Lukaku salutes towards the Everton faithful as they celebrate his goal against West Ham . Marinez said that the 21-year-old striker's talents are unique to the Everton squad . Former Wigan and Swansea manager Martinez believes Lukaku's qualities – that are unique to the Everton squad – make him value for money, despite the huge outlay that dwarfed the previous transfer record of £15m for Marouane Fellaini back in 2008. 'Remember that the assessment of Rom is what he brings to the side. Nobody else in our squad can give us what he gives us,' Martinez added. 'The fee is what he means to our squad and you don't get that sort of player easy.' 'The reality as well is that after the World Cup it's been difficult for him to get his best physical level and we need to help him towards that but I've been delighted with what he's done, although I still know he has loads to do because his potential is immense.","Romelu Lukaku joined Everton for a club record £28million this summer .

"The widow of a 7/7 London bombing victim is facing jail after stealing £50,000 compensation awarded to her son. Adam Gray, who was 11 when his father was killed, took his mother to court when she refused to repay the money she had blown on a spree that included four new cars, shopping at luxury stores and dining out at the Ritz. After the death of accountant Richard Gray, 41, in the 2005 terror attacks, Adam was awarded £50,000 by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority to secure his financial future. Scroll down for video . Louise Gray, 42, from Ipswich (left), has admitted squandering the money which was left to her son Adam (right), following the death of her husband Richard in the 7/7 London bombing terrorist attack in 2005 . Adam was 11-years-old when his father Richard was killed in the suicide bomb attack on a Tube train near Aldgate station in 2005 (pictured). He was left £50,000 compensation and it was put in a trust until he was 18 . It was placed in a trust fund and later entrusted to his mother Louise Gray, 42, to look after until he needed it. But when Mr Gray, from Ipswich, Suffolk, asked for his money to fund a move to London, she confessed it was all gone. When she refused to repay it, the police launched an investigation and eventually charged her with theft. She has now pleaded guilty and has been told it is likely she will be jailed. Mr Gray, 20, said: ‘I supported the police’s investigation. Justice needs to be served. ‘It’s been more than a year since I confronted Mum over stealing my compensation and she’s never shown any real remorse or made any attempts to pay me back. ‘That money was supposed to safeguard my future but she’s left me penniless. I’ve lost my dad and now I’ve lost my mum.’ Tax manager Richard was one of seven passengers killed by a suicide bomber on a Circle Line train near Aldgate station. The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority later awarded £250,000 to his wife, £50,000 to Mr Gray and £100,000 to his sister Ruby, now 16. The children’s money was put in trust funds until they were 18. But Mr Gray claimed the cash changed his mother and she quit her carer’s job before embarking on a life of indulgence, splashing out on cars, expensive shopping sprees, a Jacuzzi and seven chihuahua dogs. When he was given access to his £50,000 payout in July 2012, Mr Gray worried he would not be able to cope with such a large amount and asked his mother to look after it for him. He made her promise she would not spend it before entrusting her with the funds, but 18 months later, when he asked for the money to take up an apprenticeship in London, she admitted she did not have it any more. Louise Gray (pictured left on a family holiday in 2004) has admitted theft at Ipswich Crown Court after squandering the cash left to her son Adam (bottom right in the left picture) following Richard's (right) death . Mr Gray took his mother to the civil court, and in June was awarded £43,750. She appealed unsuccessfully against the ruling, and then refused to reimburse her son. She was charged with theft in September, which she admitted at Ipswich Crown Court on Friday. After the hearing, charity worker Mr Gray said he had no choice but to take legal action. He said: ‘The police started looking into the case as soon as I took my mother to the civil court. ‘They believed it was a criminal case because it was effectively theft. She had stolen from me. Louise spent the £50,000 on lavish shopping sprees, a fleet of new cars, dinner at the Ritz, seven dogs and a jacuzzi for the family home. She has now been warned she faces jail. Pictured: The Aldgate Tube bombing . ‘I felt confusion when the police told me she could face prison. But at the same time I wanted some justice for what she had done to me.’ He added: ‘She never showed me any remorse and she made me feel as if everything was my fault. Although it is hard to think of your own mother going to prison because of a crime she has committed against you, I believe that I deserve some form of justice. ‘Hopefully she will be forced to pay me the money now. But I should not have had to go to such extreme lengths. Sadly, she left me no choice.’ Gray will be sentenced next month.","Adam Gray was 11-years-old when father died in London bombings in 2005 .

"Mysterious: Sarah Harrison has hit the headlines this week as Assange's lover and Edward Snowden's travel companion . They are the kind of quietly decent, middle-class people universally recognised as the backbone of England. Now retired, Ian Harrison used to be an executive with clothes retailer Burtons, while his wife Jennifer has devoted her life to developing methods of helping children with learning difficulties to read. Not the kind of family to be involved with the story of an international spy fleeing from justice — unless they were watching a blockbuster film. But all this week at their cosy farmhouse in East Sussex, they have thought of little else. For their beautiful, privately schooled daughter Sarah, 31, is the ‘mystery’ long-haired girl who has been shepherding former CIA technician Edward Snowden in the glare of the world’s media as he makes a diplomatic dash to escape the wrath of the White House. Sarah, who has been the lover of charismatic WikiLeaks leader Julian Assange, 41, and has become a pivotal figure in his organisation, has been holed up most of this week with whistleblower Snowden in a hotel in the transit area of Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport. Russia says that, since Snowden has not passed through immigration, he has not technically entered the country. President Putin has refused him entry and declared him ‘free to go’ wherever he wishes, ‘the sooner the better’. His planned destination is Ecuador, to which he has applied for asylum, even though the U.S. has revoked his passport. Ecuador has given asylum as well as board and lodging to the supercilious Assange in its London embassy, where he is under siege after more than a year as he tries to avoid being despatched to Sweden to answer sex charges. Snowden, meanwhile, has been charged with espionage by the U.S. after his exposure in The Guardian of Prism, a covert security project run by U.S. intelligence that pries into Facebook accounts, emails and phone calls. He also revealed details of major electronic eavesdropping by Britain’s GCHQ called Operation Tempora, describing it as ‘the largest programme of suspicionless surveillance in human history’. The former analyst was in Hong Kong when the U.S. laid the spying charges that could put him in jail for the rest of his life, and America immediately sought extradition. But the authorities there refused to send him home because of a misspelt name on the extradition application form. (Snowden also claimed the U.S. hacked into millions of Chinese mobile phone messages, which hardly made the Chinese state sympathetic to Washington’s request.) Enter Sarah, who has become an expert on immigration and extradition matters through the plight of Assange, whose visitors at the Ecuadorian embassy, where he has a desk and a bed, are vetted by her. She is also said to do Assange’s washing at her London flat, and even though WikiLeaks had nothing to do with the latest whistleblowing revelations, Assange instructed her to fly to Snowden’s side in Hong Kong and help him in his request for asylum in Ecuador.

Former pupils include Princess Anne's husband, actor Daniel Day-Lewis and how Sir Jonathan Evans, former head of MI5 . One prominent supporter says: ‘WikiLeaks can’t afford not to be involved in such a major leak issue.’ So Snowden’s future freedom is largely in the hands of Sarah, whose friends describe as ‘very committed, very determined and a good organiser who loves being at the centre of things where there is some excitement’. ‘She knows what she’s doing — she’ll be fine,’ one says. Unsurprisingly, that’s not how Ian Harrison and his 60-year-old wife see it. They never expected to find their daughter at the eye of an international diplomatic storm. ‘We haven’t heard a thing from Sarah and I’m worried — though not nearly as worried as my wife,’ admits Mr Harrison, 74. ‘All I know is what I read in the newspapers. Sarah’s always been very conscientious, diligent, and I believe she’d like to see the world a better place. But heaven knows where this could end.’ It’s certainly not what they had in mind when they sent Sarah to Sevenoaks School (boarding fees currently £29,600 a year). Former pupils include Princess Anne’s husband, Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence, the triple-Oscar-winning actor Daniel Day-Lewis, as well as — and how juicily ironic — Sir Jonathan Evans, head of MI5 for six years until this April. Sarah was a good runner and swimmer and bright, too — ‘a good all-rounder who enjoyed her time at the school’, says her father proudly. From there, after doing well in the international baccalaureate and taking a skiing-and-travelling gap year, she read English at Queen Mary, University of London, and later, after more travel, decided she wanted to be a journalist. None of this can be found in standard internet searches or is included in a ‘biography’ of her put out by WikiLeaks. Like other figures in the organisation, she appears to have wiped her online profile off the net for privacy purposes — hardly what one expects from those dedicated to the exposure of information and the public’s right to know. On the run: Sarah Harrison was sent by Julian Assange to assist whistleblower Edward Snowden on his journey to Ecuador . Romantically linked: Sarah Harrison is known as Julian Assange's ex-girlfriend but some believe this is only because of he is incarcerated in Knightsbridge . These, after all, are the people who see themselves as the global defenders of free speech, valuing it so highly that they ignore fears that their disclosures threaten the national security of democratic nations and possibly even world peace. One American Congressman described them as ‘terrorists’. How different is their attitude to their own secrets and security — damningly illustrated by Assange cowering in an embassy instead of doing what most men protesting their innocence would surely do, flying to Sweden to clear his name. Sarah’s deep commitment to WikiLeaks is seen, in part at least, as being driven by her fascination with Assange. ‘All the girls are hypnotised by him to one extent or another,’ says one senior supporter. It started in 2009 when, having reached the age of 27 without becoming a journalist, she successfully applied to be an unpaid intern researcher for the charity-based Centre Of Investigative Journalism, which trains and helps journalists and is based at City University, London. She was positive, bright, enthusiastic, and, in 2010 was taken on as a junior researcher by the newly established Bureau Of Investigative Journalism, a professional operation also housed at the university — and whose reputation is now badly damaged since its misleading television report that led, wrongly, to Tory peer Lord McAlpine being identified as a paedophile. Sarah was involved in helping sort files for television documentaries on the Iraq war passed to them by Assange. He was newly arrived in London and spent days at the bureau office strutting around in jeans and a stab vest and, says one of Sarah’s friends, ‘trying to get all the women salivating’. Later that year, Sarah’s affair with Assange began. She stayed with him at his room at the Frontline Club in Paddington until he was arrested and held on remand in Wandsworth jail pending extradition proceedings over assault allegations involving two Swedish women. When he was granted bail and went to stay in the Suffolk manor house of former Guards officer and WikiLeaks supporter Vaughan Smith, Sarah went with him. And when he stayed at the home of another supporter, Tunbridge Wells businesswoman Sarah Saunders, Sarah was there, too. With these supporters, as well as Jemima Khan, film director Ken Loach and others, Sarah helped to cover Assange’s bail. It was £5,000 in her case, of which she lost £3,500 when he went into the protective arms of the Ecuadorian embassy in Knightsbridge more than a year ago. Silent: Sarah Harrison's parents say they haven't heard from her since she went on the run with Edward Snowden . WikiLeaks workers are known to be paid very little. So where did she find the money — from her father? ‘Oh, I can’t say,’ says Mr Harrison, who is charming but discreet. His educational consultant wife worked for Kent County Council until her department was closed two years ago. She now runs a company offering reading programmes for children with learning difficulties. Friends of Sarah say she took Assange to meet her parents at their farmhouse before he fled into his embassy refuge, but Ian Harrison declines to confirm or deny it — ‘I can’t comment,’ he says. But he does refer to Assange as ‘Julian’. As for WikiLeaks, he will only say: ‘My daughter is a great girl who has her own life these days.’ She and Snowden are seemingly stuck in limbo in the airport in Moscow, as Ecuador has now warned that it could take ‘months’ to process his asylum application. Some, of course, refer to Sarah as being Assange’s ‘ex’ girlfriend, but others believe this is only because he is incarcerated in Knightsbridge. ‘She was very enamoured of him, and he of her striking looks and positive thinking,’ says one close figure. ‘She really is a terrific girl with a great sense of fun, and she’s clever. It’s hardly surprising that he’s behind her growing power in the organisation. They’re closer than ever.’ So, how would Ian and Jennifer Harrison view the idea — just the idea — of Julian Assange becoming their son-in-law? ‘Well,’ says the former Burtons man, ‘strange things do happen in this world.’","Sarah Harrison, 31 has been shepherding former CIA technician Edward Snowden to Moscow .

"On Monday night, a witness says they saw a vehicle speeding out of the upscale Alabama neighborhood where NFL linebacker Rolando McClain lives. The Tuscaloosa County Sheriff's department says that car could be connected to a fire that consumed McClain's six-bedroom brick home home, and deputies are now considering arson. Lt Andy Norris said that investigators have yet to determine whether the fire was intentional, though detectives were on the scene searching for clues. Suspicious: The Tuscaloosa County Sheriff's department says a car speeding out of the neighborhood could be connected to a fire that consumed Rolando McClain's home . A K9 unit will be brought in to determine any signs of accelerants  after the fire that could point to arson, Norris said. 'Anytime you have a vacant house go up, particularly one of that value, you have to consider it suspicious,' he said. 'Every house in that neighborhood is probably over $1 million.' Located on four acres of land next to Lake Tuscaloosa, with a three-car garage and a boat house, the six-bedroom, five bathroom home was listed for sale in June for $1.5million with RE/MAX. After news of the fire, the linebacker tweeted, 'It can't be real! To (sic) much of my ""history"" in that house for it to be gone...' McClain grew up in Decatur and went on to play college football in Tuscaloosa at the University of Alabama.

"Ambulance bosses have been forced to recruit paramedics from Poland amid an estimated nationwide shortage of 3,000. South Central Ambulance Service, which covers Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire and Oxfordshire, said it was advertising abroad to hire 220 paramedics and technicians and 70 emergency care assistants. Details of the desperate shortage of 999 workers emerged as a leaked memo this week revealed plans to allow ambulance response times for some serious calls to double from eight to 19 minutes amid a severe strain on the nationwide service. Looking elsewhere: The South Central Ambulance Service (pictured), which covers Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire and Oxfordshire, is advertising abroad to hire 220 paramedics and technicians . South Central Ambulance confirmed it had been hiring overseas because its recruitment plans had been ‘challenged’ by the nationwide shortage of paramedics. A spokesman said: ‘We have been carrying out some international recruitment in Poland for paramedics where their qualifications, skills and experience are very similar to our own and meet our own high standards for staff.’ The Trust said it was also looking at other countries. Paramedic Gavin Bashford, who works for the service, said: ‘We can have big delays responding to 999 calls - three, four or five hours is not uncommon - and the pressure on staff is huge.’ The news came after the London Ambulance Service announced it had flown to the other side of the world to hire 175 Australian paramedics to start in January because of the small number of local applicants. Fleet: There is a nationwide shortage of around 3,000 paramedics according to industry groups (file photo) A team spent ten days Australia in September interviewing and assessing staff in Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne and Brisbane. It successfully recruited 175 staff after previously launched a campaign entitled ‘London, No Ordinary Challenge’ to encourage front line medics to leave Australia and work in London. Richard Webber from the College of Paramedics estimated that there was a nationwide shortage of between 2,500 and 3,000 paramedics. He said although ambulance services did have many foreign workers this was the first time he had heard of official recruitment drives abroad. He said: ‘One of the main problems is insufficient people being trained and recruited. ‘There are not enough university programmes to meet the demand. ‘It is a lack of workforce planning. A lot of trusts run their own courses, train their own people themselves. ‘There is also more competition for paramedics, who are now also employed by what used to be NHS 111 (formally NHS Direct), which previously mainly took nurses.’ Sarah O’Donoghue, from the union Unison, said enough staff should be trained in the UK to meet the NHS' needs. She said: ‘We should not need to recruit from overseas and deprive that country of its own trained staff. We have a situation now where there are not enough trained paramedics. ‘Rising demand is increasing pressure on existing staff, leading to overruns, where staff work longer than their shift, sometimes for hours, and an inability to take appropriate meal breaks. ‘This causes exhaustion and impacts on work-life balance, a situation so dire that many staff are leaving the service. ‘Investment in the training of ambulance staff is a priority. Recruiting abroad is a short-term fix. We need to be investing here to ensure we meet our paramedic needs. Despite the tough conditions for paramedics here, it would likely be an improvement on working life for most of their Polish counterparts. Pressure: In some regions the volume of calls is 15 per cent higher compared with last year (file photo) Paramedics in England and Wales work 37.5 hours a week, starting on a salary between £21,388 and £27,901 a year which can rise to £34,500. In Poland they earn between £4,872 and £6,600 a year for a 37-hour week, although many work twice as many hours and some even triple hours to boost their pay. The ambulance service in England and Wales is under severe strain and has consistently missed response time targets for the most serious cases since April. In some regions the volume of calls is 15 per cent higher compared with last year. Officials blame an increasing tendency of patients to dial 999 first instead of trying to arrange an appointment with a GP. South Central Ambulance Service said agency workers were currently filling gaps while they were recruiting new staff and there was no risk to patients. A spokesman for the Department of Health accepted that in some areas there was not enough staff to meet increased demand. But he said: ‘Ambulances are making nearly 2,000 more emergency journeys every day than 2010, which is why we’ve employed almost 2,000 extra paramedics and provided £50million additional funding just this year to keep the service sustainable.’","South Central Ambulance Service hiring 290 staff members from abroad .

"Those senior moments when you lose your glasses or forget someone’s name could one day be just a distant memory. A drug already used to treat motor neurone disease could prevent common memory lapses which can affect healthy people in their forties. Researchers found the drug Riluzole prevented connections between brain cells from weakening in experiments on older rats. Senior moment? You're not alone - but a drug could help prevent the brain's breakdown (posed by model) This is thought to prevent the cognitive deterioration that can occur in old age. Professor Bruce McEwen, of The Rockefeller University, New York, said: ‘By examining the neurological changes that occurred after Riluzole treatment, we discovered one way in which the brain’s ability to reorganise itself – its neuroplasticity – can be marshalled to protect it against some of the deterioration that can accompany old age, at least in rodents.’ Riluzole works by helping control a chemical called glutamate which helps neurons communicate. But too much glutamate causes damage at the point at which the cells connect – their synapses. The team started giving the drug to rats once they reached ten months old, the rodent equivalent of middle age, when their cognitive decline typically begins. After 17 weeks of treatment, the animals performed better in memory tests than the ones left untreated, and almost as well as young rats, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported. Frustration: The drug could prevent  cognitive deterioration which worsens in old age (posed by model) For instance, when placed in a maze they had already explored, the treated rats recognised an unfamiliar pathway as such and spent more time investigating it. When the researchers looked inside the brains of treated rats, they found changes to glutamate within the hippocampus, where memories are consolidated, suggesting communication between brain cells had improved. Prof John Morrison, of Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, said: 'We have found in many cases, ageing involves synaptic changes that decrease synaptic strength, the plasticity of synapses, or both. 'The fact Riluzole increased the clustering of only the thin, most plastic spines, suggests its enhancement of memory results from both an increase in synaptic strength and synaptic plasticity, which might explain its therapeutic effectiveness.' In this case, the clusters involved thin spines which are rapidly adaptable. The treated animals had more clustering than the young animals and their untreated peers, who had the least. This discovery led the researchers to speculate that, in general, the aged Riluzole appears to enhance this mechanism. Researcher Ana Pereira, an instructor in clinical investigation in Prof McEwen's lab, added: 'In our study, this phenomenon of clustering proved to be the core underlying mechanism that prevented age-related cognitive decline.'","Researchers found drug Riluzole stopped brain connections weakening .

"Protest: More than 300 consultants have written an open letter to NHS chief executive Simon Stevens . Hundreds of doctors have warned that patients with cancer and heart disease could suffer and die needlessly under new NHS funding plans. More than 300 consultants and experts have signed an open letter to NHS chief executive Simon Stevens. Under controversial proposals, hospitals that provide specialist care to more patients than expected will only be reimbursed for half of the cost of each extra case. Doctors claim the NHS England plan – aimed at diverting cash to long-term disease prevention and making specialist care more cost-effective – will be devastating as the number of cases rises with the UK’s ageing population. The letter, signed by 345 doctors from centres including Cambridge and London, states that there will ‘inevitably be avoidable deaths as patients die on waiting lists or find that their disease has progressed during the wait for treatment. ‘The clinical consequences of these longer waiting times and a lower quality service to patients with conditions such as heart disease, liver disease, leukaemia, complex cancers etc will be severe. ‘There will inevitably be a significant number of patients suffering unnecessarily, for example by needing more extensive surgery due to their cancer progressing during the wait.’ Scroll down for video . Lead author Dr David Rosser, medical director of University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, told The Daily Telegraph the ideas were ‘destructive’ and based on a failed strategy to shift services into the community. He said: ‘This will give hospitals two choices, to not offer treatment to these patients, or to treat them despite the financial loss. 'The negative consequences for the patients of not being offered treatment is obvious.’ Dr Rosser added that the proposal was ‘the latest in a long line of punitive measures aimed at hospitals’ and said a similar system in emergency care had left hospitals struggling to provide adequate care. Consultation on the proposal is due to end today. NHS England declined to comment on the letter last night.

"One shameful statistic, if that is the right word, lies behind the dawn queues outside the Sunbury Health Centre in Surrey. It is this: the surgery was originally designed for 6,000 patients, but now serves nearly 19,000. Had the building in which the practice is based been a block of flats, say – and not part of the beleaguered NHS – it would surely have been closed down by now on the grounds of overcrowding. Scroll down for video . And still they wait... 24 hours on, the dawn queue at the Sunbury Health Centre is back . Instead, the sick and the elderly find the phones at Sunbury continuously engaged (a fifth of those using the centre had to wait more than ten minutes for someone to answer their call, according to a patient survey) and, even if they do get through, it is impossible to book a same-day appointment, and face up two weeks to see a doctor. Hence the reason why nursery teaching assistant Talitha Taylor, 34, foster carer Georgina White, 58, and retired Ray Samphire, 68, were among those who, once again, were waiting in the cold and dark outside the centre from 6.18am yesterday; a scene repeated at GP surgeries up and down the country. ‘Crazy’, Mr Samphire called it. Nevertheless, the surgery passed a recent Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspection with ‘flying colours’, which perhaps tells us more about the CQC than the Sunbury Health Centre. So what has gone wrong, or rather who is to blame for the scandal? Not the doctors who run the centre, it seems, if a newsletter issued by the centre is taken at face value. The extra demand is a result of new housing developments springing up in the area, the doctors say, and the ‘very old and tired’ health centre simply cannot cope with the influx. They applied to NHS England for permission to redevelop the building, but ‘we still have no news’. They applied for a grant to improve the centre ‘but, again, we have not heard anything more!’ They have had meetings with the local council but ‘despite our concerns, the council continues to grant planning permission and allow “new builds’’ in the area with no consultation.’ The bottom line? Sunbury Health Centre is 84 per cent undersized (the surgery’s phrase.) All this is true and has undoubtedly contributed to the crisis. Almost 2,000 readers have commented in less than 24 hours on the Mail’s picture of dozens of patients queuing before dawn to see their GP. Here’s what some of them said: . ‘It shames the Government and local authorities who did not plan for such an increase in population. It does not shame Britain, it shames those whose job it is to plan for this!’ Tony, from Derbyshire . ‘I gave up going to my GP and hospitals in 2009 and my local is not as bad as this. Our country has become over-crowded – we do not have the amenities to cope...’ Nelly, from Croydon, south London . ‘We can’t get an appointment so we go to our local chemist and ask for advice. We have had to go to A&E a few times. If my children need to be seen within 24 hours due to ill health we go to A&E.’ Patient at Sunbury Health Centre, Surrey . ‘This happens here where I live. My husband, who is healthy, has to queue, before they open, for me to be able to see a doctor. They won’t even open the doors and allow people to wait inside, no matter what the weather is.’ A reader from St Helens, Merseyside . ‘I live in Cleethorpes and if you need to see a doctor that day you have to queue before 8am because you can’t get through on the phone. It’s engaged all the time. ‘Then, when you do get through, all the appointments have gone and you get told to come down the next day before 8am and you will get an appointment then. How Victorian is that?’ Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire . ‘My surgery is exactly the same. People who’ve just come out of hospital, first- time mums with two-week-old babies, all queuing up in the dark or redialling 100-plus times to be told “We’re full. Try again tomorrow”. ‘Really, if you’re not quite fit and determined, you have no chance of getting an appointment. So why are they STILL advertising for new patients to join?’ Dulwich, south-east London . ‘This seems to happen on every new housing development. There are no increased local amenities to match the increased demand. ‘It is down to local councillors to see that the development does not cause the problems seen here and there does appear to have been a massive failure when planning permission was granted. The local council should have an inquiry into that before the press do because it looks like a pretty serious breakdown in democracy.’ Southend, Essex . ‘Most of those [patients] probably don’t really need to be there – they should be visiting their local pharmacy. ‘But no, they don’t want to pay for a pack of Paracetamol or a bottle of Calpol when they can get it free in prescription. These are the people draining the NHS, not the elderly who would not want to waste the GP’s time.’ London . * Have you suffered early morning queues at your GP? Email your story to: doctor@dailymail.co.uk . Indeed, the surgery – now one of the biggest in Britain – occupies less than half the existing building (the other half is occupied by Virgin, a private health care provider, which is responsible for the district nursing team.) But is this the whole story? The fact remains that more patients equals more money – for GPs. As its patient roll has increased, so has the NHS money flowing in to the surgery, which, like other practices, is paid £73.56 per patient a year. Or, to put it another way, 6,000 patients means £441,360, for Sunbury, but 19,000 patients means £1,397,640. Nor is this the full extent of the financial incentives for GPs . Under the latest GP contracts, they are also paid £7.64 for vaccinations such as flu and MMR jabs and £55 for every patient diagnosed with dementia; GPs qualify for the payment if they diagnose the patients themselves (with no checks as to whether their assessment is right), or if they update their records when their patients receive diagnosis in hospital. Some GPs have condemned the scheme as an ‘ethical travesty’ which amounts to ‘cash for diagnosis’. Either way, it means that a practice such as Sunbury – where patients have to queue at dawn to see their doctor – is also extremely lucrative. This is the perverse irony at the heart of this scandal. Once upon of time, of course, the NHS – and, in particular, the service provided by GPs – was the envy of the world. But under the new system, introduced by the last Labour government in 2004, doctors were allowed to opt out of evening and weekend work – which nine out of ten practices, including Sunbury, did. This brought the average GP’s basic salary down to £55,000, but, at the same time, new rules on bonus pay contained in the deal pushed their average pre-tax pay above £100,000. The new rules stated that GPs would earn bonuses for meeting certain performance targets – from distributing anti-smoking information to diagnosing illnesses such as depression. No cap was placed on the amount they could earn from the new contracts. As for patients, well, the daily scene outside the Sunbury Health Centre speaks for itself. Behind those scenes are patients like pensioner Mr Samphire and other personal testimonies written, in black and white on the centre’s own website. ‘I called every ten minutes from 7am until 8.45am (when I finally spoke to someone to only be told that all the appointments had gone … looking to changing doctors. Wouldn’t wish this practice on my worst enemy,’ wrote one patient.Another added: ‘Tried for two hours to get past the engaged tone then waited in a queue of five to wait to be answered.’ A third revealed: ‘I have been on hold for 45 minutes, told I am caller number one for 35 minutes and still haven’t spoken to receptionist. When I tried the automated system yesterday, soonest appointment was a week’s time – even though the medical centre is next door to my house.’ The surgery was originally designed for 6,000 patients, but now serves nearly 19,000 (file picture) The surgery has 12 GPs, four of them recruited in the past two years to cope with increased demand, and hopes to recruit more. But two new housing developments are also in the pipeline which are likely to place further strain on the oversubscribed health centre. The first of these, at the famous Kempton Park race track, could see more than 1,000 homes being built. A second is an application to build 196 houses on the site of London Irish rugby club’s former training ground in Sunbury, which is currently going through the planning process at Spelthorne Borough Council. ‘The council would be very keen to support new or improved health facilities in Lower Sunbury,’ said head of planning John Brooks. ‘However, these need to be supported by the relevant health funding bodies. To date, they have not given us specific proposals and neither have they made specific funding requests.’ In fact, more GP practices than ever are reaching capacity and applying for permission to refuse new patients, with the number of requests to reject additional patients soaring by 160 per cent in three years, according to GP magazine Pulse. Has the Sunbury Health Centre made such an application? After all, the surgery has blamed the crisis on a dramatic increase in the number of patients (19,000, remember) now on its roll? A spokesman for the centre said no such request had been made ‘because closing the list would be detrimental to local people who may wish to register with us as patients.’ Additional reporting by Tania Steere .","More than 30 patients queued outside The Sunbury Health Centre in Surrey .

"ISIS is 'much stronger and much more dangerous' than anyone in the West realizes, a journalist who spent ten days embedded with the group in Iraq and Syria has warned. Jürgen Todenhöfer, 74,  said that the West has 'no concept of the threat it faces' from the Islamic State and has underestimated the risk posed by ISIS 'dramatically'. The German reporter spent most of his time in Mosul in northern Iraq, but he also traveled to the ISIS-controlled territories of Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor in Syria. A fighter of the Islamic State  on a street in the city of Mosul. German journalist Jürgen Todenhöfer, 74, spent several days with militants in the city and described them as an 'extremely brutal' group . Speaking to ABC News, the veteran journalist described ISIS as 'the strongest group I ever met. Very strong, very clever, very enthusiastic'. He added: 'They are extremely brutal. Not just head-cutting. I'm talking about the strategy of religious cleansing. That's their official philosophy. They are talking about 500 million people who have to die.' He went on to say that ISIS are 'completely sure they will win this fight'. In a stark warning issued in a detailed post on Facebook, the journalist wrote in German: 'The West underestimated the risk posed by IS dramatically. Peshmerga fighters  pass through  northern Iraq while shipping military ammunition to fight ISIS. Todenhöfer has warned that ISIS is 'much stronger and much more dangerous' than anyone in the West realizes . 'The IS fighters are much smarter and more dangerous than our leaders believe. In the Islamic State, there is an almost palpable enthusiasm and confidence of victory, which I have not seen in many war zones.' Todenhöfer went on to say that ISIS have plans for mass genocide, with the aim or eradicating all atheists and religions that are not 'people of the book' or who do not subscribe to their particular brand of Islam. German journalist and author Jürgen Todenhöfer, 74, spent ten days in ISIS-controlled territories . 'The IS want to kill... all non-believers and apostates and enslave their women and children. All Shiites, Yazidi, Hindus, atheists and polytheists should be killed,' he wrote. 'Hundreds of millions of people are to be eliminated in the course of this religious 'cleansing'. 'All moderate Muslims who promote democracy, should be killed. Because, from the IS perspective, they promote human laws over the laws of God. 'This also applies to - after a successful conquest - the democratically-minded Muslims in the Western world.' The reporter describes the Islamic State is currently operating as a functioning totalitarian state - one which, he claims, many Sunni residents in Mosul are unopposed to since it is preferable to the  oppression they suffered under the previous regime. ISIS currently controls parts of Iraq, including Mosul - the country's second-largest city - as well as large swathes of northern and eastern Syria. Recent coalition air strikes are believed to have begun to turn the tide over the last few months, with the jihadists losing ground in Iraq and only able to hold on to their positions in Syria. But ISIS strongholds in Mosul, Tikrit and Fallujah have been spared much of the U.S.-led onslaught. In his post, Todenhöfer rejected the idea that Western military intervention could help to defeat ISIS, particularly in the city of Mosul. ISIS parade American supplied military vehicles and weapons captured from the Iraqi army in Mosul. In his Facebook post, Todenhöfer rejected the idea that Western military intervention could help to defeat ISIS . He wrote: 'The city of Mosul [in Iraq], with a population of three million, for example, is controlled by IS with about 5,000 fighters. To crush them with bombs means reducing all of Mosul to rubble and killing tens of thousands of civilians.' Speaking on RTL's Nachtjournal program after his return to Germany last week, Todenhöfer said that  he constantly heard the view that ISIS want to 'conquer the world'. 'This is the largest religious cleansing strategy that has ever been planned in human history,' the journalist added. Displaced people from the minority Yazidi sect, flee violence from forces loyal to the Islamic State in Sinjar town. Todenhöfer warned that ISIS is planning 'religious cleansing' on a genocidal scale .","Jürgen Todenhöfer, 74, spent most time in Mosul, but also traveled  in Syria .

"Patients are facing a bleak end to the year as A&E units, GP surgeries and the ambulance service struggle to cope with unprecedented demand. A string of reports yesterday painted a picture of a system creaking at the seams due to the rising population. At one overcrowded inner city surgery, GPs are being forced to offer patients quickfire two-minute consultations just to ensure that they can be seen before Christmas. Scroll down for video . Patients are facing a bleak end to the year as A&E units, GP surgeries and the ambulance service struggle to cope with unprecedented demand (file picture) A leaked letter from NHS medical director Sir Bruce Keogh has revealed people are now routinely waiting more than 12 hours on trolleys even after doctors have decided they need a hospital bed. And only yesterday the Daily Mail revealed patients were resorting to queuing up outside another GP practice in Surrey at dawn just to get an appointment. Last night, as Labour said the NHS was in danger of being ‘overwhelmed’, it also emerged that: . ■ Elderly patients – so-called bed blockers – are being kept in hospital for up to a year after being declared fit for discharge; . ■ Sir Bruce has written to hospital managers demanding a ‘zero tolerance’ of long trolley waits; . ■ London Mayor Boris Johnson has urged the public to take a taxi to A&E rather than dialling 999 to help ease the pressure on the ambulance service. A&E units are facing unprecedented strain and last week recorded their worst waiting times on record. On Monday, Sir Bruce wrote to hospital managers warning of a ‘worrying increase’ in patients spending more than four hours on trolleys in casualty. Ambulance bosses have been forced to recruit paramedics from Poland amid an estimated nationwide shortage of 3,000. South Central Ambulance Service, which covers Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire and Oxfordshire, said it was advertising abroad to hire 220 paramedics and technicians and 70 emergency care assistants. Details of the desperate shortage of 999 workers emerged as a leaked memo this week revealed plans to allow ambulance response times for some serious calls to double from eight to 19 minutes amid a severe strain on the nationwide service. South Central Ambulance confirmed it had been hiring overseas because its recruitment plans had been ‘challenged’ by the nationwide shortage of paramedics. A spokesman said: ‘We have been carrying out some international recruitment in Poland for paramedics where their qualifications, skills and experience are very similar to our own and meet our own high standards for staff.’ The Trust said it was also looking at other countries. The news came after the London Ambulance Service announced it had flown to the other side of the world to hire 175 Australian paramedics to start in January because of the small number of local applicants. The letter, passed to the Daily Mail, told them to carry out a full investigation every time a patient ended up for waiting more than 12 hours. Dated 22 December and sent to medical directors at hospital trusts, it reads: ‘There should be a zero tolerance of over 12-hour waits for admission and such a wait should be classified as a serious incidence, and we would expect a root-cause analysis.’ The pressures are partly due to an ongoing crisis caused by bed-blocking, in which hospitals have to look after elderly patients even when they are well enough to be discharged due to a lack of care at home. The shortage of beds on wards prevents sick patients being moved out of A&E so they remain languishing on trolleys. Figures uncovered by Labour from Freedom of Information requests show that in 2013/14, a total of 26 bed-blocking patients were kept in hospital for least three months. This included one at United Lincolnshire Hospitals who was there for 365 days because of ‘patient or family choice’. The trust would not provide further details. But in some cases, relatives have demanded hospitals look after elderly patients while they go on holiday or simply because they don’t like a care home’s curtains. A&E units are facing unprecedented strain and last week recorded their worst waiting times on record (file picture) At York Teaching Hospital a patient was kept in for 329 days, also due to their own choice or that of their family, while at West Middlesex someone waited eight months because there was no space in a care home. Bed blockers cost the NHS an average of £264 for each day they are kept in hospital. Last month, more than 29,000 patients languished on trolleys for at least four hours – including 26 for more than 12 hours. Gordon Miles, chief executive of the College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&E doctors, said: ‘It’s very challenging at the moment. Last week was one of the worst weeks for a long, long time. ‘We’re expecting it to be very busy over Christmas. It doesn’t show any sign of a let-up. If a hospital is bunged up with people who can’t be discharged, patients will have to wait on trolleys or in ambulances outside.’ Dr Mark Porter, chair of the British Medical Association’s council, said: ‘GP services are under unsustainable pressure, hospitals are full and investment in adult social care has been slashed.’ Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘This Christmas there are record numbers of elderly people trapped in hospital who would rather be at home with their families. ‘It is a sad reflection on a system that is creaking at the seams and in danger of being overwhelmed.’ Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: ‘These figures are yet another serious warning sign of growing pressure on GP practices and district nurses and a social care system on the verge of collapse because funding has utterly failed to keep pace with demand.’ Yesterday Mr Johnson issued an urgent appeal to the public not to dial 999 over the festive period unless it was a genuine emergency. He urged patients to take a taxi to A&E if they suffer minor fractures after slipping on ice or when partying. The ambulance service is under considerable pressure. Earlier this week it emerged that the Government was considering relaxing waiting time targets for serious incidents. Last night it also emerged that ambulance and NHS staff are planning a two-day strike over New Year. The GMB union said paramedics would still respond to 999 calls. Similar protests were held over the Autumn. Meanwhile one unnamed GP surgery was yesterday offering patients two-minute appointments to ensure they were seen before Christmas. A photo was taken of the appointments chart by a whistleblowing doctor and circulated on Twitter. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘These figures give a misleading impression - while long waits to be discharged are unacceptable, there are actually fewer as a proportion of hospital admissions over the last few years. We know the NHS is busier than ever which is why we’ve given it an extra £700million for thousands more doctors, nurses and beds this winter. ‘The NHS has ensured there are plans in every area to manage extra demand.’","Reports paint picture of system creaking at seams amid rising population .

"Mark Clattenburg makes headlines on and off the field and this week is no different. However, following a tough match at Goodison Park, it was Ross Barkley and James Tomkins who should be highlighted after poor conduct during Everton's clash with West Ham on Saturday. Disappointingly, Barkley fooled Clattenburg with a clear dive when the Everton man  went down without contact from West Ham’s Kevin Nolan; the blame for this must lie with Barkley but Clattenburg will be cross with himself for being conned. Ross Barkley appeared to con referee Mark Clattenburg with a dive during Everton's victory over West Ham . The Everton star goes to ground under the challenge of West Ham captain Kevin Nolan at Goodison Park . Everton’s opening goal was clearly offside as Romelu Lukaku was in an offside position before Barkley’s shot was deflected to him. of course assistant referees are the judges of offside so again the Geordie referee should escape blame. The melee which followed after Clattenburg awarded a free kick for James McCarthy’s very strong challenge on Morgan Amalfitano seemed to be down to the referee’s uncharacteristic casual approach to the incident. It was clear that West Ham’s players were angry at the tackle and looked to get back at McCarthy. Usually, Clattenburg would have diffused the situation but instead allowed players to confront one another. One could argue whether a red card could have been shown but replays showed both players going in with raised boots and so a yellow card for each player looked appropriate. West Ham's James Collins is dragged away from James McCarthy by Everton defender Sylvain Distin (left) Fifteen minutes into a spiky second half, Clattenburg’s ‘laissez faire’ approach allowed the heat to rise again by failing to award Kevin Mirallas a free kick. The angry Everton man then chased back and chopped Amalfitano down – a clear caution. Before Clattenburg could issue a card,  Tomkins pushed Mirallas who responded by shoving him back. Both players clearly pushed each other in the chest but embarrassingly Tomkins went down holding his face, simulating where contact had occurred. Both men were fortunate to escape with yellow cards. At least Clattenburg ended the game with some credit as an excellent advantage led to the home team’s winning goal but this will not be a performance which he will list as one of his finest.

"A  researcher's accidental discovery could pave the way for a baldness cure by harnessing the power of white blood cells. The cancer expert was testing anti-inflammatory drugs on mice when she was surprised to discover they were growing extra fur, so investigated what was causing the phenomenon. She discovered it was due to macrophages, which are derived from white blood cells called monocytes and are produced by the immune system to fight infections and clear up dead tissue. Scroll down for video . Wait no more: Hopes for a baldness cure have been revived after a Spanish researcher accidentally discovered how cells from the immune system can activate those which are responsible for hair growth . According to Dr Mirna Perez-Moreno, who made the find at the Spanish National Cancer Research Centre in Madrid, the macrophages activated nearby stem cells which are responsible for hair growth. That means follicles could be encouraged to grow without the need for a hair transplant, which can cost upwards of £5,000. She and the study's other authors wrote in the journal PLOS Biology: 'One of the current challenges in the stem cell field is... to promote regeneration without the need of transplantation. 'Because of this study, it is now known that macrophages play a key role in the environment surrounding stem cells. 'Our study underlines the importance of macrophages as modulators in skin regenerative processes, going beyond their primary function as phagocytic immune cells.' Proud: Some men go to great lengths to disguise their baldness, but others including Samuel L Jackson (left) and Bruce Willis (right) are happy to show it off. So far, the researchers' theory has been tested only in mice . Previous research has identified signals from the skin that help prompt hair growth, but exactly how different types of cells do this continues to stir debate. The study's authors believe their findings could also influence approaches to tissue regeneration, ageing and cancer. Dr Perez-Moreno made the discovery by accident while she was working on another research project. She observed that the mice she was working with had started to regrow hair when they were given anti-inflammatory drugs. Curious as to whether  communication between stem cells and immune cells could be the cause, her lab tested several immune system cells to see if they had any influence. They found that some macrophage cells activated nearby stem cells and hair began to grow again. Widespread: Half of all British men suffer from baldness by the time they reach  50, including Sean Connery . They then tested the theory by treating the mice with a drug which suppressed the main signals sent out by macrophages - and found that the growth was delayed. Although the study was carried out in mice, the researchers believe their discovery may enable the development of new treatments for hair growth in humans. Their method of using tiny droplets called liposomes to carry the drug to specific cells could be repeated, they added. Half of all British men suffer from baldness by the time they reach the age of 50, with many going to great lengths to disguise the change. That is despite several 'bald pride' movements and no shortage of celebrities who proudly show off their bare heads - including Bruce Willis, Samuel L Jackson and Sean Connery.","Method discovered by accident at Spain's main cancer research centre .

"The actress said she stopped bleaching her teeth as it was too painful . Julie Walters has hit out against teeth whitening after being left in agony by the treatment when trying to remove green tea stains. The actress, who has previously condemned cosmetic surgery, said bleaching her teeth was so painful she halted the process after a few days. Speaking ahead of the release of a programme on her life, the 64-year-old said she was forced to consider teeth whitening after drinking green tea for 20 years. 'I drink green tea and quite honestly if you drink tea all your life, which I've drunk now for nearly 20 years, your teeth do begin to look a bit like wood,' Ms Walters said. 'The dentist gave me something that you put on. It did get rid of the coffee stains, but then I thought, I can't do this anymore - it's too painful.' The actress, whose career is being honoured in a BBC programme tonight, added while she has never seen the appeal of image-conscious Hollywood where women are increasingly trying to look younger. 'I'm not putting down anybody who has (cosmetic surgery), I just quite like to think I can grow old and it's fine. 'If people don't like me because I have wrinkles then I don't particularly want to be with them either,' the actress told the Times. Scroll down for video . Earlier this year Ms Walters, who received a CBE from the Prince of Wales in 2008, told another magazine she would not live in America because of its attitude to appearance. Speaking with Good Housekeeping, she said:'It's the facelifts and the whole attitude to women. Everyone who lives there says you have to have a facelift. And everyone has had them… Everyone. 'As people get older, they do this half-facelift stuff so they can pretend they haven't had them! I think: don't do it – be beautiful anyway.'

"Two in three gout sufferers are not receiving treatment to cure their condition, say researchers. They found that GPs are issuing prescriptions to just a third of the patients who could benefit. But the research shows nearly half of gout sufferers qualify for treatment at their first consultation. Scroll down for video . Researchers have found that GPs are issuing prescriptions to just a third of gout patients who could benefit from treatment (file picture) One in every 40 people in the UK has been diagnosed with the painful disorder that famously afflicted Henry VIII. It used to be rare among the young, but research suggests it is becoming more common – with the obese getting it a decade earlier than those of a healthy weight. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis that causes acute pain, redness and swelling in peripheral joints, most commonly in the big toe. The condition is caused by deposits of monosodium urate crystals, which are related to high levels of uric acid in the blood, and can be alleviated using urate-lowering treatment (ULT). The condition, which affects the joints, mainly the big toe, famously afflicted King Henry VIII, pictured . Researchers at Nottingham University investigated when patients on a large UK primary care database became eligible for ULT, and how many of them ended up being prescribed it. Of 52,164 patients with gout, the average time to the first treatment for complications such as multiple attacks and chronic kidney disease was five months. At the first consultation the likelihood of them being eligible for ULT was 44 per cent, with a 61 per cent likelihood after one year. After five years, the chances of gout patients being eligible for treatment rose to 87 per cent, then to 94 per cent at ten years following diagnosis. However, the average prescription rate for ULT among the practices studied was 32.5 per cent, says a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Research leader Dr Chang-Fu Kuo said: ‘Our study aimed to estimate the proportion of patients fulfilling eligibility criteria for urate-lowering treatment since the diagnosis of the disease. ‘The majority of patients are eligible at or shortly following diagnosis. 'However, only one third of eligible patients received such potentially curative treatment. 'This suboptimal treatment occurs for many reasons, including insufficient knowledge of the disease and its management, and misconceptions concerning its causes and its impact on patients’ quality of life and wellbeing. ‘Our recommendation is to give full information to patients early in their clinical course at the time that they are first being informed about gout, its causes and the treatments that are available.’","One in 40 people in the UK has been diagnosed with the painful disorder .

"Liverpool City Council has deferred a decision on its next course of action in relation to the kick-off time of February's Merseyside derby. The authority will take further legal advice and wait for a response from the Premier League after Merseyside Police initially raised objections to the 5.30pm start time on Saturday, February 7 at Goodison Park. After the fixture was moved in order to be televised by Sky Sports, the police elevated the match to a Category C fixture, with reference to there being a high risk of disorder. Everton and Liverpool are due to kick-off at 5.30pm at Goodison Park in February's Merseyside derby . Liverpool's Mario Balotelli (right) has an effort at goal during his side's 1-1 draw with Everton in September . They want the match to start earlier and although the council's licensing committee support that stance it wants further investigation of its options to be made before it makes a definitive decision. ""Merseyside Police do not support this fixture being played at 1730 on Saturday February 7 2015 and reiterate our position that this fixture should have a kick-off time of no later than 1.30pm on a weekend,"" said the police in a report to a special meeting of the ground safety advisory committee. Everton informed the Premier League on December 9 of the police's objections and the issue was discussed on Tuesday by the council's licensing committee, who initially said it would ""take legal advice on all appropriate options to enforce the position"" in the event of no change of kick-off time being determined. Phil Jagielka (right) runs off to celebrate his dramatic equaliser in the first Merseyside derby of the season . They have deferred any course of action until they reconvene again in the new year.

""I firmly believe that, the police, the clubs, and the city council have a responsibility to minimise the likelihood of those problems and their impact, not only on supporters within the footprint of the stadium, but also the wider community,"" said the report.

"The 10 most expensive signings of this year will cost their buying clubs a combined £1.2billion in fees and wages, with the staggering figures only going to get larger. But it’s not always the eye-catching numbers or stellar names which make interesting transfer business in January or the summer. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at 10 players who could conceivably move on in 2015 and some clubs who would do their utmost to land them. Cristiano Ronaldo – Real Madrid to Manchester United (£120m+) It’s been made patently obvious by Manchester United that they are willing to spend even more money than was splurged last summer in the wake of David Moyes’ disastrous spell in charge. Angel di Maria wasn’t exactly cheap, but luring Ronaldo back to Old Trafford would cost an astronomical fee, blowing the £86million Real Madrid paid for Gareth Bale’s out of the water. Ronaldo looks as if he’ll return to Manchester at some point – the two parties have been unashamedly making eyes at each other – and with the release of added funds by Ed Woodward, this isn’t beyond the realms of possibility, particularly if Real won everything this season. Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (centre) has publicly declared his love for Manchester United before . Alex Song – Barcelona to West Ham (£15m) Does he owe anything to West Ham? Maybe not, but there’s no doubting that a hugely impressive six months on loan has seen Song’s stock rise markedly. The central midfielder had looked spent at Barca – a spare part, even making a gaffe when the Catalans won La Liga by thinking he was being asked to lift the trophy with captain Carles Puyol, and not cancer survivor Eric Abidal, despite only appearing fleetingly. But the way in which he’s ran games since August suggests there is far more to come and it’d be encouraging if he signed a deal with the Hammers, especially given they are ready to move into the Olympic Stadium (and that Song has been consistently asked about that by the club’s in-house media team). West Ham midfielder Alex Song (right) has proved a hit at the club since joining on loan from Barcelona . Gareth Bale - Real Madrid to Manchester United (£118m) Could Bale imitate his childhood hero Ryan Giggs and become an Old Trafford favourite? The Wales international has set the world alight at Real Madrid having helped the Spanish giants to win the Champions League, Spanish Cup, UEFA Super Cup and, this month, the Club World Cup during his short time at the club already. The 24-year-old has scored a staggering 33 goals in 66 games for Carlo Ancelotti's side since his move to the Santiago Bernabeu in the summer of last year, providing 24 assists in that time too. However, despite his form 54 per cent of Real supporters revealed that they would be happy for the club to accept a bid in excess of £118m for their Galactico in a survey conducted by AS.com. Bale dazzled during his Tottenham career and his qualities would provide Manchester United with one of the most potent attacks in world football. Red Devils boss Louis van Gaal has refused to discuss reports of making a world record move for the Real star, but United aren't adverse from spending heavily as they look to return to the summit of English and European football. Gareth Bale (centre) has scored a staggering 33 goals and provided 24 assists during 66 games for Real . Fernando Torres – Chelsea to Atletico Madrid (£8m) Come back to what you know, Fernando. Atletico would surely embrace his return. Torres needs something to reignite a career that will – if he goes on at this rate – only be remembered for the barren years rather than the electrifying devastation he previously caused. His league record at Chelsea (after they paid £50million for him, let’s not forget) was a goal every five games. While on loan at AC Milan it’s one in 10. The weight of expectation appears to have become too much since leaving Liverpool almost four years ago, and Torres looks as if he needs familiar surroundings safe in the knowledge that he’s adored by thousands. Fernando Torres (left) is currently on a two-year loan at AC Milan after a nightmare stint at Chelsea . Sami Khedira – Real Madrid to Arsenal (£13m in January – free in July) There is a conundrum for Arsene Wenger here. Does he wait and see, try and organise a pre-contract agreement with the German, or go all guns blazing next month and lodge a bid? It’s clear Arsenal are keen – and that Khedira’s future at the Bernabeu is suspect at best. Couple that with their obvious need to bolster in the middle of the park and this is a no-brainer. Khedira is one of the best in the world in front of the back four and his capture would represent a show of ambition that has severely lacked at the Emirates for years. Tick him off and the Gunners are only a goalkeeper, two defenders and a striker short. It’d be a start, at least. Sami Khedira (right) has been linked with a move to Arsenal in the past and is available on a free in July . Charlie Austin – QPR to Tottenham (£12m) No other English striker has scored more goals in the Premier League than Austin up until now and he’s the sort of poacher many are crying out for. None more so than Spurs, who’ve struggled going forward since Bale upped sticks to Madrid in 2013. Roberto Soldado hasn’t kicked on as Andre Villas-Boas, Tim Sherwood or Mauricio Pochettino would’ve hoped and it’s time to offload. Austin wouldn’t come cheap – thanks in no small part to the fact he’s homegrown – but is a gamble worth taking. The old adage is that if a striker knows where the net is it doesn’t particularly matter what division he plays in is certainly relevant where the 25-year-old is concerned; his record has been exemplary for years. It’s worth noting that Austin’s earned QPR 10 points this campaign. QPR striker Charlie Austin scored a hat-trick as they came from behind to beat West Brom 3-2 on Saturday . Paul Pogba – Juventus to Manchester United (£30m) Sir Alex Ferguson’s biggest mistake was definitely allowing Pogba’s situation to escalate to such an extent that he decided it’d be best to leave Old Trafford. Not too many walk out of the exit door of their own accord – Pogba must be commended for that – but the lure of Manchester United under a new regime, from top to bottom, could be all the persuading the Frenchman needs to return. United themselves have missed the sort of driving force in midfield that Pogba brings and, now 21 but with a full two seasons under his belt at Juventus, they’d be signing a more refined product. Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba (left) has flourished at the club since leaving Manchester United . Petr Cech – Chelsea to Juventus (£7m) Does Cech, at 32, want to sit on a bench? No, and he’s said as much. Would Chelsea want to allow the Czech a move to another Premier League club? No, because he’s still too good. So it presents the goalkeeper – who has been the standout stopper in England since moving to Stamford Bridge in 2004 – with a decision to make. He has never played in any of the other major leagues in Europe and may want to try his hand elsewhere. The rejuvenated Juventus could offer him an attractive way out, but there’d be a fair few from Spain and Germany who wouldn’t mind a look as well. Chelsea stalwart Petr Cech has found first-team opportunities hard to come by this season at the club . Marco Reus – Dortmund to Manchester City (£30m) Manchester City are getting to grips with the rigours of Financial Fair Play nowadays and will look at Reus as the sort of major signing they need to make in order to supplement an attack which does at times lack in behind Sergio Aguero. They are probably one player short in that area in terms of consistently threatening the top teams home and away. The stumbling block, of course, is any interest from Spain but the opportunity to test himself in an infinitely more competitive league should sway Reus’ decision. Either way, it’d make a refreshing change if he didn’t move straight to Bayern Munich. Borussia Dortmund star Marco Reus would provide another dimension to Manchester City's potent attack . Ashley Cole – Roma to Crystal Palace (loan) The loan spell Cole enjoyed at Selhurst Park in 1999 kick-started the left back’s career at Arsenal and if Palace were able to pull this off it’d be quite the coup. Cole has made just 11 appearances for Roma – and none since the middle of November – while an immediate return to the Premier League could appeal, even if the noises are that he’s enjoying life in Italy. Going back to a club who’ve done so much for Cole’s career would be heart-warming, even if it were only until the end of the season. Ashley Cole enjoyed a successful loan spell at Crystal Palace during the formative years of his career .","Real Madrid Cristiano Ronaldo has been linked with a return to former club Manchester United in the past .

"As Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were announced as the new faces of Balmain's 'Army Of Lovers' it signified the end of a very important year for the couple. For the decision by the brand's creative director Olivier Rousteing (a close friend of the Kardashian family) to cast the reality TV star and her rapper husband was a controversial one. But it is symbolic of their meteoric rise to becoming the most powerful couple of 2014, a title previously bestowed on their close friends Beyonce, 33, and Jay Z, 45. Scroll down for video . This year Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have usurped Beyonce and Jay Z in terms of their popularity . For in a year that Bey and Jay have faced rumours of marriage trouble and controversy over everything from their song lyrics to photoshopping Instagram posts, Kim, 34, and 37-year-old Kanye's joint profile has been going from strength to strength. Especially since they've firmly cemented themselves within the fashion clique as one of the world's most stylish couples, counting Givenchy head honcho Ricardo Tisci as a close companion. Indeed, it was Vogue editor Anna Wintour who gave them the first seal of approval, putting a wedding dress-clad Kim and a suited Kanye  on the magazine's front cover in April. The edition featuring the power couple - nicknamed Kimye - sold an estimated 150,000 more copies than when Beyonce appeared on the cover the previous year. Hot topic: Ms Wintour explained that if Vogue didn't reflect modern culture - even the more provocative figures within it - 'nobody would talk about us. It's very important that people do talk about us' Anna Wintour said of the cover: 'Part of the pleasure of editing Vogue, one that lies in a long tradition of this magazine, is being able to feature those who define the culture at any given moment, who stir things up, whose presence in the world shapes the way it looks and influences the way we see it. 'I think we can all agree on the fact that that role is currently being played by Kim and Kanye to a T. (Or perhaps that should be to a K?) 'As for the cover, my opinion is that it is both charming and touching, and it was, I should add, entirely our idea to do it; you may have read that Kanye begged me to put his fiancée on Vogue's cover. 'He did nothing of the sort,' she explained. 'The gossip might make better reading, but the simple fact of the matter is that it isn't true.' Kim and Kanye's wedding photograph, which took four days of editing was the most liked Instagram post of all time . By May, when the couple married in a lavish ceremony at Forte di Belvedere in Florence, Italy, they were all anyone could talk about. The wedding photograph, which they posted on Instagram, took four days of editing - an image-managing endeavour that paid off when it became the most 'liked' post ever on the social networking site. Meanwhile Beyonce and Jay Z, who  missed Kim and Kanye's nuptials amid rumours of a falling out between the two women, were facing problems. Beyonce and Jay Z made headlines for all the wrong reasons when footage was leaked of Beyonce's sister Solange attacking Jay in a lift at the MET Gala in May . Shortly before the wedding the pair had been involved in an incident now known as 'liftgate'. Following the Met Gala in New York in May Beyonce's sister Solange was filmed by a CCTV camera – the footage from which was later leaked – attacking her sister's husband in a lift. Speculation whirled about the reason for the outburst and why Beyonce stood still in the corner of the lift, doing nothing to stop her sister. The following months were rife with reports that Beyonce and Jay Z had hit a rocky patch in their marriage and were heading for a divorce. The rumours continued to whirl until June when the pair began their joint On The Run tour. Kim said she wanted to 'Break The Internet' with her eye-popping, bum-baring paper magazine cover . Kim and Kanye caused headlines  when they took their adorable daughter North to Paris for fashion week . Meanwhile, Kimye  were happy and hugely successful. They celebrated their daughter North's first birthday in June with a theme park 'Kidchella'-themed party. And in the same month Kim released Kim Kardashian Hollywood, a downloadable game that has gone on to make $43million (£27.7million). Then in September the pair hit fashion week and, bringing North along for the ride, proceeded to make headlines around the world. Beyonce has faced internet debate that she has  photoshopped pictures of herself on her  Instagram feed . Beyonce watchers have speculated that an airbrushing tool was used to modify this image . And in November, as Beyonce faced more heated conjecture about whether her Instagram pictures had been altered, Kim released the most eye-catching image of her career. She posed half-naked, showing off her oiled bottom on the cover of Paper magazine and became one of the most talked-about women in the world in the process. In fact, Kim and Kanye have seemingly had a better year than Beyonce and Jay Z in every way -except for one. The singer and her rapper and mogul husband Jay still continue to earn more money than their younger counterparts, and are believed to have a joint net worth of more than $1billion (£644million) compared to Kimye's $105million (£68million).

"West Ham midfielder Alex Song has not been included in the Cameroon squad for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations. The news will come as a boost to West Ham boss Sam Allardyce as he looks to keep his inside the top four after a brilliant start to the season. Allardyce had been preparing to lose African trio Song (Cameroon), Diafra Sakho (Senegal) and Cheikhou Kouyate (Senegal) for the tournament which starts on January 17. Alex Song hasn't been selected in the Cameroon for the 2015 African Cup of Nations . Song returned to London on loan and he has been a breath of fresh of air at West Ham . All three players have played key roles in West Ham's season, which has seen the east London club pick up 31 points from 17 games. Song seems to have fallen out of favour with the Cameroon hierarchy following his sending off during the 4-0 defeat against Croatia during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The former Barcelona player was shown a straight red card in the Group A loss for striking Croatia forward Mario Mandzukic in the back with his elbow in an off-the-ball incident. Song, who issued a statement apologising for his conduct after the match, was forced to sit out Cameroon's final group match against Brazil as the Indomitable Lions had no chance of progressing. The 27-year-old was sent off during Cameroon's 4-0 World Cup defeat against Croatia . Sam Allardyce will be pleased to keep his star midfielder in the squad throughout January and February . 'We might have a little worrying spell during the Africa Cup of Nations in January,' said Allardyce in a press conference earlier this month. 'That's why I'm not prepared to do any more predictions until they come back. 'We don't want to get carried away. We just want to keep on playing the football we're playing at the moment.

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez admits the World Cup means he may have to wait until the last minute to complete his transfer business. The Spaniard can at least be more definitive with his summer spending after Hull's weekend FA Cup final defeat guaranteed the Toffees' direct progress into the group stage of the Europa League. However, he will also give some of the club's emerging young talent the chance to stake a claim for promotion to the first-team squad during pre-season. Tension: Everton boss Roberto Martinez admits the World Cup could hinder his transfer aspirations . Rewarding youth: Martinez will also give Everton's young guns a chance to shine like England's Ross Barkley and stand-by defender John Stones . The Toffees' under-18s won their league with victory over Manchester City on Saturday and that could pave the way for some players to follow the path trodden by the likes of Ross Barkley, who earned a World Cup call-up on the back of the pivotal role he was given by Martinez this year. 'Recruitment is going to be important,' Martinez told Press Association Sport. 'The right characters need to come to the club and we need to be large enough in terms of numbers to face every competition with a real desire to hit good performances. 'I do feel we have to be really clear in what we need, who we bring in, and it is going to take until the last day of the window to finalise the squad. 'It is a World Cup year and things will get delayed and certain situations will be worth us waiting until the last second to see if they happen or not and that is something we are well in control of. Uncertain: The future of Chelsea loan striker Romelu Lukaku (left with Barkley) is yet to be confirmed . 'We have our targets and we have highlighted the positions we need to bring players in. 'But I also have a few young players who will be given an opportunity in pre-season and depending on how they do they will fill some of those positions in the fist-team squad. 'I think our young players next season will have a massive say in how good we are going to be.

"A stunning display of the Northern Lights has been seen in Northumberland with the dancing colours visible to the naked eye. The beautiful spectacle was seen in the early hours of Christmas Eve, as colours of green and pink appeared in the sky. Known as the Aurora Borealis, the natural wonder is caused by charged particles colliding in the Earth’s atmosphere. Scroll down for video . Beautiful: A stunning display of the Northern Lights has been seen across parts of the UK with the dancing colours visible to the naked eye. In this image, an Aurora is seen on the horizon behind Bamburgh Lighthouse in Northumberland . Press Association photographers Owen Humphreys and Tom White braved the cold to capture the display, that could be seen near Bamburgh lighthouse, in Northumberland. It is believed the light show, which was also captured across Northumberland National Park, was caused by a strong solar storm which began on December 20th. Aurora are one effect of energetic particles which can speed out from the sun both in a steady stream called the solar wind and due to giant eruptions known as coronal mass ejections, or CMEs. After a trip toward Earth that can last two to three days, the solar particles and magnetic fields cause the release of particles already trapped near Earth. Breathtaking: At five minutes past midnight on Christmas Eve the lights of the Aurora Borealis created a beautiful display of colours in the night sky above Northumberland National Park . Festive glow: An Aurora is seen on the horizon in Northumberland. It is believed a solar storm on December 20th caused the light show . Clear skies: Aurora are one effect of energetic particles, which can speed out from the sun both in a steady stream called the solar wind and due to giant eruptions known as coronal mass ejections, or CMEs . It is believed the Christmas Eve light show was caused by a strong solar storm which began on December 20th. The solar flare registered as an X1.8-class event - one of the most powerful types of flares possible. The solar flare also caused a radio blackout for parts of Earth over the weekend, according to an alert from the U.S. Space Weather Prediction Center. Aurora are created when energetic particles from a solar flare trigger reactions in the upper atmosphere of Earth. This in turn trigger reactions in the upper atmosphere in which oxygen and nitrogen molecules are released a particles of light. The strong solar flare which created this aurora triggered a radio blackout for parts of Earth over the weekend, according to an alert from the U.S. Space Weather Prediction Center. Usually the best spots to see the lights are those places close to the North Pole, such as Iceland and Norway. In the southern hemisphere, they are known as the Aurora Australis and can often be mirror-like images that occur at the same time as in the north. Clear winter nights tend to be better for observing the sky due to less haze and water vapour in the air. The colour of the aurora depends on which gas - oxygen or nitrogen - is being generated by the electrons. It also depends on how fast the electrons are moving. As well as Earth, any planet with a magnetic eld and an atmosphere should have auroras, including Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus.

"On a day of drama at the Dubai Festival City Challenge Tour Grand Final hosted by Al Badia Golf Club, it was Benjamin Hebert who wrote his name into the record books, thanks to an emphatic third win of the 2014 European Challenge Tour season. The Frenchman finished five clear of compatriot Jérôme Lando Casanova on 12 under par thanks to a three under closing 69 on Saturday, a feat which ensured he became the first player in Challenge Tour history to win three titles in one season on two separate occasions. Few could question the serene way in which Hebert went about his business on the final day, as he built an unassailable lead thanks to five birdies and just two dropped shots, meaning attention soon turned to the battle for a place in an increasingly fluid top 15 on the Rankings. Benjamin Hebert (centre) is congratulated by his fellow players after his third Challenge Tour win of the season . Andrew Johnston (above) secured his place as Challenge Tour number one, earning his European Tour card . The Challenge Tour's closing event of the season was held at the picturesque Al Badia golf club in Dubai . While Andrew Johnston rubber-stamped his title as the 2014 Challenge Tour Number One with a top ten finish after a level par final round of 72, it was all happening further down the list as dreams were made and hearts were broken. For much of the day it had looked like Dane Lasse Jensen had done enough to earn his place amongst the graduating class, but five dropped shots in as many holes around the turn put paid to his chances and left the way clear for the charging Lando Casanova, who hit light speed on the final day in Dubai. The Frenchman started the week with a six over par 78 in the opening round, but a fantastic run over the closing three rounds culminated in a final round 69, which meant he climbed 25 places in the Rankings to 13th place. It was not all plain sailing for the 29 year old though, thanks to a bogey at the 17th which had seen him drop out of the reckoning for promotion, but a birdie at the last saw him vault back in. He would have to wait anxiously by as Oliver Farr played the last, but when the Welshman hit his tee shot in the water, Lando Casanova's graduation was all but secure. As for his compatriot Hebert, he was just pleased to sign off the season in such a positive manner, as he prepares for a second crack at the big time next year. Oliver Farr (centre) of Wales finished third in the tournament, also earning his European Tour playing rights . As The Challenge Tour drew to a close for 2014 in Dubai, here are the top 15 players who have earned a playing card and promotion to the illustrious European Tour: . 1st: Andrew Johnston (England) 2nd: Benjamin Hebert (France) 3rd: Byeong-hun An (South Korea) 4th: Moritz Lampert (Germany) 5th: Mark Tullo (Chile) 6th: Sam Hutsby (England) 7th: Jordi Garcia Pinto (Spain) 8th: Jason Palmer (England) 9th: Michael Lorenzo-Vera (France) 10th: Oliver Farr (Wales) 11th: Edouard Espana (France) 12th: Florian Fritsch (Germany) 13th: Jerome Lando Casanova (France) 14th: Jake Roos (South Africa) 15th: Jason Barnes (England) 'It is a perfect end to the season for sure,' said the 27 year old. 'I played very well the last three months, but this is a great feeling. I always practice hard and keep myself positive in the bad times, but now everything is OK, and we will have a lot of fun over the next week before I start practicing to improve my game for The European Tour. 'My game is much better than the last time I graduated, but sometimes I still feel so-so on the course, and I have a few bad stretches which I want to fix. If I can sort that out then I feel I can perform well next season. 'It was a hard day, with the wind getting up at the end of the round, but I stayed focused with my caddie and played it shot-by-shot. I had some good birdies on the 14th and 15th which gave me a good advantage, and over the last two holes I was just patient up until the end. 'My goal will be to keep my card next year. I have won six times on the Challenge Tour, but now I want to win on The European Tour. Winning three times in two different seasons has never been done before, which is a great achievement, but I would exchange all of those for one win on The European Tour. 'I'm going to keep it the same for next year, stay focused and play my game, and we'll see what happens. I had a good winter last year, and I want the same this time around, so if I can do that then it will be OK for next year.' Alessandro Tadini (centre) of Italy finished fifth in Dubai, but it was not enough to earn a European Tour card . Mortiz Lampert (centre) on his way to finishing fourth in the tournament and fifth in the overall rankings . Lando Casanova may sound like a fictional villain from a Disney movie, but the man with one of the best names in golf proved he is more than just an impressive moniker. His form over the final 54 holes was nothing short of miraculous, and in every way deserving of a starting berth in The Race to Dubai for 2015. 'It hasn't sunk in yet, but it is the first time in my career I am happy to be second,' said the Cannes resident. 'On the 18th, watching (Oliver) Farr was the longest time of my life, and really, I don't know what to say as I can't quite believe it. Maybe when I put my tee in the ground on the first hole on The European Tour, then I will believe it. 'It feels great, but we'll see how it goes next year. I'm so excited to get out there as soon as I can, and I can't wait to get home and rest with my family and friends and stop golf for a while. For the moment I don't care about the schedule for next year, I just want to rest.' Farr might not have realised the effect his play on the final hole would have had on so many players' careers, but regardless of his crucial bogey at the last to card a closing 73 and finish six adrift of Hebert, the Welshman will be elated with a third place finish that guarantees a maiden sojourn on The European Tour at the end of an impressive rookie season. In fourth was the ever-consistent Byeong-hun An (68) who has long been assured of a place on The Race to Dubai in 2015, while Hugues Joannes (70) and Alessandro Tadini (71) rounded out the top five. The players who earned their European Tour playing rights for 2015 celebrate at the end of the tournament . In the Rankings, Antonio Hortal was the unfortunate one to miss out in the dreaded 16th spot on the season-long list, after he fell to a 78 on Saturday. Ben Evans (72) had briefly climbed into the top 15 at the end of his round after Lando Casanova's bogey at the penultimate hole, but the Frenchman's crucial four at the last knocked the Englishman back down to 17th. There was also disappointment for Jensen (77), who had entered the final day inside the top 15 on the provisional list, but eventually missed out. As for top spot, Johnston always looked like he had it under control having entered the week with a substantial lead, and his tie for ninth at the end of 72 holes in Dubai ensured a return to The European Tour in 2015 thanks to earnings of €190,856 this season, the highest winning total since Edoardo Molinari in 2009.","Benjamin Hebert closes with a three-under 69 for emphatic five-shot victory .

"As rider requests go, Mariah Carey's rumoured demand to have yellow sweets removed from her M&M bowl is one of the most bizarre. But the singer's entourage can now rest easy with the creation of an iPhone-powered machine that rapidly sorts M&Ms into different colours. The DIY designs claims to be faster that most sorters, which work by registering a sweets' colour using a sensor before dropping them into rotating containers. Scroll down for video . A London-based blogger has created an iPhone-powered machine that sorts M&Ms into different colours. The new machine, created by London-based blogger ‘reviewmylife’, improves on this design by replacing the sensor with an iPhone 5s camera. Once the camera registers the M&M’s colour, a Bluetooth module attached to an Arduino-powered motor fires off the correct electromagnet gate to do the physical sorting. ‘I don't stop the M&M for colour recognition. Instead I use an iPhone to capture the colour of the M&M as it is in freefall,’ the anonymous blogger wrote on his site. ‘As it is still falling the iPhone talks to a Bluetooth module attached to an Arduino and that fires off the correct electro magnet controlled gate.’ Once the camera registers the M&M’s colour, a Bluetooth module attached to an Arduino-powered motor that fires off the correct electromagnet gate (pictured) to do the physical sorting . The M&M sorted uses an iPhone 5s camera to capture the colour of the M&M as it is in freefall. As it is still falling the iPhone talks to a Bluetooth module attached to an Arduino-powered motor. That fires off the correct electromagnet-controlled gate, which sends the M&M into the correct pot. 'Even though this is just a rough prototype it is reasonably fast because the colour recognition and path that the M&M takes down the chute is decided and determined whilst the M&M is moving under gravity,' said London-based blogger, reviewmylife. Reviewmylife added that his prototype is fast because the colour recognition and path that the M&M takes down the chute is decided while the M&M is moving under gravity. The blogger said that he'd now like to get the parts for the machine 3D printed. 'I also want to try to change the M&M sorting gates so instead of being in a line they are arranged in a circle - like a flower,' he told MailOnline. 'This would allow the height of the machine to be reduced, and also mean that the time between the M&M starting to fall and the gate firing would be constant. This should make it easier to increase the speed.' There is, however, a drawback for bands such as Van Halen who  reportedly requested a rider for M&Ms with the brown ones remove. The blogger claims that the chocolate's natural colour is hard to distinguish from orange and shadow. The invention could impress the likes of Mariah Carey, who  is rumoured to have asked for all yellow sweets removed from her M&M bowl is a rider request .

"David Cameron has insisted there is no way Abu Qatada will be allowed to return to Britain. His comments come after Jordan's state security court acquitted the 53-year-old radical Muslim cleric of a charge of conspiring . to commit acts of terrorism in the country. Speaking after the decision, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘He can’t come back and he won’t come back. He’s a Jordanian, he does not have a UK passport, he was deported on an indefinite deportation order, he would not be granted permission to enter the UK, end of story.' Qatada, who was extradited from . Britain after a lengthy legal process, will continue to be held in a Jordanian prison until at least September due to . separate charges in an adjourned trial, which relates to an alleged plot to attack tourists during Jordan's . Millennium celebrations. Radical: Abu Qatada (pictured in court today) has previously been described in courts as a senior al-Qaeda figure in Europe who had close ties to Osama bin Laden . Acquitted: Abu Qatada, real name Omar Mahmoud Mohammed Othman, has been on trial since last summer for allegedly plotting two attacks against Westerners in Jordan . Referring to concerns Abu Qatada may return to the UK if he is also acquitted of his second charge, the . Prime Minister's spokesman said: 'Mr Qatada was put on a plane to Jordan . and is not coming back. This is a man the British courts have deemed a . risk to national security. He is not coming back'. Abu Qatada, real name Omar Mahmoud . Mohammed Othman, has been on trial since last summer for allegedly plotting two attacks against Israelis, . Americans and other Westerners in the country. As he was living in Britain at the time, Jordan originally convicted Bethlehem-born Abu Qatada in his absence for the two plots and sentenced to life in prison. Following a near decade-long legal process, which cost British taxpayers millions of pounds,the father-of-five was finally extradited last July. On his arrival in Amman after being . deported, Jordanian prosecutors charged Abu Qatada with . conspiring to carry out two terror attacks in Jordan. One of these charges was for a foiled plot against the American school in the Jordanian capital in 1999, while the other was the alleged targetting of Israeli and American tourists and Western diplomats during Jordan's Millennium celebrations. Retrial: Although Jordan previously sentenced Abu Qatada to life in prison in his absence, the country's law required him to be retried once he returned . Not free: Abu Qatada will continue to be held at Mawaqqar 1 prison in Jordan (pictured) due to separate charges related to a plot to attack tourists during the country's Millennium celebrations . The conspiracy charge of which Abu . Qatada has now been acquitted by a panel of civilian judges at the State . Security Court in Amman relates to the alleged 1999 school plot. The trial for the 2000 charge has now been adjourned until September. Abu Qatada has been previously been described in courts as a senior al-Qaeda figure in Europe who had close ties to Osama bin Laden. Britain has . accused him of links with Zacarias Moussaoui - the only person charged . in the United States over the September 11 attacks - and with shoe bomber . Richard Reid. Today Nick Clegg said the Government would fight any attempt by Abu Qatada to return to Britain. The Deputy Prime Minister insisted the Government had been right to battle for his deportation and declared 'we don't want this man back'. He told radio station LBC: 'What is absolutely clear to me is this man needed to face justice and needed to do so out of the United Kingdom and that's what this government finally achieved.' Asked if Britain would do everything possible to stop Qatada's return, Mr Clegg replied: 'Of course. We don't want this man back.' On his way: Following a lengthy legal process, which cost British taxpayers millions of pounds, Abu Qatada was finally extradited last July . Long stay: Abu Qatada and his family moved to Britain in 1993 and were granted asylum the following year. While living in Britain, Qatada lived on benefits totalling an estimated £500,000. He was finally extradited in 2013 . Qatada was finally deported from Britain last July after a near-decade long battle to boot him out that cost nearly £2 million. Once dubbed Osama bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe, Abu Qatada repeatedly used human rights laws to avoid removal from the UK. He was finally flown to Jordan after the state gave formal assurances about how he would be treated. Immigration and Security Minister James Brokenshire said: 'Abu Qatada's re-trial in Jordan has been made possible thanks to this government's determination to successfully deport him from the UK.' 'While the courts in Jordan have acquitted Qatada of one of the two charges against him, it is right the due process of law is allowed to take place in his own country. We await a verdict on the remaining charge,' he added. 'The UK courts agreed that Qatada posed a threat to national security in the UK, so we are pleased that we were able to remove him. He is subject to a deportation order which means he will be unable to return to the UK,' he went on to say. Abu Qatada was born in the West Bank city of Bethlehem in 1960, which was under the control of Jordan at the time. At the age of 29 he moved to Peshawar in Pakistan to teach about Sharia law, before moving to Kuwait. In 1991 - after the Gulf War - he was kicked out the country along with other Palestinians and returned to Jordan. Influence: From his home in North London, Abu Qatada was considered the 'in-house' adviser to radical groups around the world, and the 'spritual leader' of al-Qaeda in Europe . Two years later Qatada and his family applied for asylum in the UK, claiming he had been tortured in Jordan. This application was granted in June 1994. In the late 1990s Qatada came to MI5's attention as his sermons became more extreme and his influence increased. From his home in North London, he was later described as the 'in-house' adviser to radical groups around the world. In 1999 and 2000 Qatada was convicted his absence and given a life sentence in Jordan for the two alleged terror plots for which he has been standing trial. Qatada was arrested in the UK for the first time following the September 11 attacks, but was not charged with any crime. He was repeatedly linked with extremist groups over the subsequent decade. Agreement: The European Court of Human Rights finally allowed Abu Qatada to be extradited after receiving assurances from King Abdullah II of Jordan (pictured with David Cameron) that he would not be tortured . Mr Justice Collins, then chairman of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission said he was 'heavily involved, indeed was at the centre' of al-Qaeda's UK activities, calling him 'a truly dangerous individual.' While living in Britain, Qatada lived on benefits totalling an estimated £500,000. The campaign to extradite Qatada to face the terror conspiracy Jordan began in 2007, but was continually delayed by claims he would be tortured on his return. After initially barring the UK deporting Qatada, the European Court of Human Rights finally denied him leave to appeal in 2012 after receiving assurances from Jordan that he would not be tortured. Qatada finally left the UK to face trial the following July.","Abu Qatada was extradited to Jordan on two terrorism conspiracy charges .

"Married father:  Peter Raynor, 35, worked at a home  for men with serious mental health problems . A trusted supervisor at a care home stole more than £20,000 from vulnerable residents to bankroll his gambling addiction. Church-going Peter Raynor, 35, worked at a residential home in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, for men with serious mental health problems and had access to their bank accounts. But the married father helped himself to thousands to fund his online gambling habit. He managed to keep the scam running for four years by juggling money between the accounts of the victims to cover his tracks, Newcastle Crown Court was told. However, Raynor eventually went to the police to confess. Now he has been jailed for eight months at the court after admitting six counts of theft. Recorder Keith Miller told him: ‘The sheer length of time and the fact you were in a position of trust and the amount of money taken means that I can see no good reason to suspend the sentence of imprisonment. ‘It would simply send out the wrong messages about those who commit offences like this in breach of trust. I’m sure your family will support you, as will the rector at the church.’ Raynor was working as a support worker with a supervisory role at the Park House Care Home when he started stealing. The facility, run by Aspire Healthcare, caters for men who are unable to look after their own finances due to their mental health problems. Prosecutor Mark Giuliani said: ‘The defendant had access to their bank cards, pin numbers and money in the safe which was kept there for each resident. Theft: Raynor was working at the Park House Care Home (pictured) in Gateshead when he started stealing . ‘What he did over this period was use that money to fund his gambling habit.’ Raynor was spending thousands on a mobile phone app which encouraged him to buy more items to play the game. Mr Giuliani said: ‘He spent £20,668 which was taken from the residents.’ An internal audit revealed the missing money and Raynor rang his boss and confessed he had stolen it. He then went to a police station and handed himself in, telling officers what he had done. Mr Giuliani said: ‘He accepted taking all of the cash and said he had stopped counting after about the first £6,000. ‘He said he made sure no resident was left without money and he would juggle money between accounts to make sure no-one was left short.’ Raynor, who lived in a £115,000 semi-detached three-bedroom house in Springwell, near Gateshead, pleaded guilty to six counts of theft. The court heard he had never been in trouble before, was a good worker and his offending was not motivated by hostility to the victims. The judge said Raynor was dedicated to helping the disadvantaged and had walked home from Newcastle on occasions having spent his last money on buying hot drinks for the homeless. Jailed: Newcastle Crown Court was told he juggled money between victims' accounts to cover his tracks . Brian Hegarty, defending, told the court that Raynor has paid back £4,500 and said it was the home who had been left out of pocket rather than the residents. Mr Hegarty added: ‘He has lived a hitherto blameless life and is of exemplary character. The beginnings of his problems were mental health problems suffered by him in his previous job and it appears he rushed himself back to work too soon. ‘He has stolen money over a number of years for reasons he finds difficult to explain. There was nothing sophisticated about it, he simply took the cash and didn’t make efforts to cover his tracks. ‘He made efforts to repay the money and he gave full assistance to the care home in establishing where and when the thefts occurred. 'There has not been any criticism of his ability to do his job. He says he left the home in a better place than when he started there and he has some pride in that regard. He is a diligent, hard-working family man who has worked hard to support others and his family.’ An Aspire Healthcare spokesman said: ‘The thefts were discovered during a detailed audit by the operator Aspire, who reported Pete to the police. ‘Unfortunately it was undetected for a period of time as Pete was ensuring the balances were correct at the point of audit by moving funds between service users and his own funds. ‘All monies from the residents have been repaid to the five service users by Aspire directly. Aspire will be pursuing Pete in a civil proceedings after the criminal proceedings have been completed . ‘Aspire are fully co-operating with the police and the local council safeguarding investigation.’","Church-going Peter Raynor, 35, worked at residential home in Gateshead .

"The earliest known piece of polyphonic music - a piece of choral music written for more than one part - has be uncovered at the British Library. It is thought that the simple score, that is is dedicated to Boniface, patron Saint of Germany, was written around the year 900. The piece was discovered by Giovanni Varelli, a PhD student from St John's College, University of Cambridge, while he was working on an internship. Scroll down to hear the music sung . Mystery dong: It is thought that the simple score, that is is dedicated to Boniface, patron Saint of Germany, was written around the year 900, although who wrote it remains unknown . The chant was written using an early form of notation that predates the invention of the stave and  was inked into the space at the end of a manuscript of the Life of Bishop Maternianus of Reims. Student Varelli specialises in early musical notation, and realised that it consisted of two vocal parts, each complementing the other. Polyphony defined most European music up until the 20th century, but it is not clear exactly when it emerged. Treatises which lay out the theoretical basis for music with two independent vocal parts survive from the early Middle Ages, but until now the earliest known examples of a practical piece written specifically for more than one voice came from a collection known as The Winchester Troper, which dates back to the year 1000. Polyphony defined most European music up until the 20th century, but it is not clear exactly when it emerged. Here the newly discovered song has been transcribed into modern music using a stave . As well as its age, the piece is also significant because it deviates from the convention laid out in treatises at the time. In music, polyphony is when two or more lines of independent melody is sung or played in harmony. This is opposed to music with just one voice, called monophony. Music with one dominant melodic voice accompanied by chords is called homophony. The term is usually used to refer to music of the late Middle Ages and Renaissance. Until now the Winchester Troper, dating back to the 11th century, was thought to be the oldest example of notated polyphony for chanting. This suggests that even at this early stage, composers were experimenting with form and breaking the rules of polyphony at the same time as they were being written. ‘What's interesting here is that we are looking at the birth of polyphonic music and we are not seeing what we expected,' Varelli said. ‘Typically, polyphonic music is seen as having developed from a set of fixed rules and almost mechanical practice. 'This changes how we understand that development precisely because whoever wrote it was breaking those rules. 'It shows that music at this time was in a state of flux and development, the conventions were less rules to be followed, than a starting point from which one might explore new compositional paths.'","The piece was discovered by Giovanni Varelli, a  student from St John's College, Cambridge, while he was working on an internship .

Gestures: The teenager was seen animatedly gesticulating as she talked with her father as they made their way along the scenic trail . Happy: The father and daughter appeared happy and relaxed during the festive stroll . Last year the Obama family went on two hikes, two beach trips, a snorkeling expedition and visited the Honolulu zoo during their 17-day trip. Their six previous trips have lasted between two and two and a half weeks and cost taxpayers roughly $4 million, government watchdogs have estimated, even with the Obamas paying for their own accommodations, which cost them $56,000 in 2013. Howeve, taxpayers picked up the tab for at least seven other homes in the area that Secret Service and White House staff stayed in. Vacation: The First family arrived arrived in Hawaii on December 19 and are not expected to return to Washington D.C until January .

"A last-minute deal was reached in Northern Ireland today, after a budget dispute which threatened the return of direct rule from London. David Cameron emerged from marathon talks in Belfast yesterday to say the fragile power-sharing agreement between the parties there had been stabilised. The province had been on the brink of political collapse after wrangling over the welfare budget - which will be propped up with £2 billion in aid and loans from the UK Government over ten years. Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson welcomed the agreement made between the Northern Ireland executive parties, and the British and Irish Governments . Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness and Sinn Fein Party President Gerry Adams spoke after the deal was struck at Stormont . The key parties in the Northern Irish administration, the Democratic Unionists and Sinn Fein, both welcomed the financial package and said they hoped to return to stability after months of uncertainty. But the negotiations, which have been going on for around eleven weeks between five parties, did not reach an agreement on the vexed issues of flags and parades, a long-running sore for nationalists. Not all parties are on board, and the deal, which involves a commitment to significant welfare and public sector reforms in Northern Ireland, is also likely to face challenges when implemented next year. But the Prime Minister said last night that the Stormont House Agreement signalled Northern Ireland was ‘finally…able to deal with its past’. ‘I am delighted that a workable agreement has been reached that can allow Northern Ireland to enjoy a brighter, more prosperous future, while at the same time finally being able to deal with its past’, he said. ‘This agreement means the UK Government has been able to offer a significant financial package that opens the way for more prosperity, stability and economic security for Northern Ireland’. The crisis threatened a return to Home Rule for the first time since 2007. It was, in large part, triggered by the financial pressures of a ballooning public sector and their inability to implement welfare reforms passed by Westminster in February 2013. A statue of 1920's Ulster Unionist politician Edward Carson overlooks the grounds of Stormont estate, near Belfast . Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, (left) and the Irish Minister For Foreign Affairs Charles Flanaghan, who helped broker an agreement between the Northern Ireland executive parties . The Belfast administration had faced paying a massive fine for over-spending on welfare - which was bitterly opposed by Sinn Fein and threatened to derail the government. A package of financial assistance will help cover the shortfall while the parties work on a programme of welfare and public sector reform next year to deal with their chronic budget problems. The deal also allows the Northern Ireland Government to boost its economy by reducing its rate of Corporation Tax from 21pc in the UK down to just 12.5pc, the rate in the Republic of Ireland. And £150million of the UK government cash will go into investigations into killings which took place during the Troubles – there have only been around 200 prosecutions for some 3,500 deaths. The First Minister, and DUP leader Peter Robinson said: ‘Of course every one of us would have liked to have had a more comprehensive and complete agreement but this is as much and more than we have ever been able to do on these issues in the past. So it is a very significant agreement.’ Sinn Fein Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the deal offered ‘a fresh start we need to seize with both hands’ and was a ‘remarkable achievement’ resolving issues of long-standing division.","Province was  on  brink of political collapse amid wrangling over budgets .

"These shocking photos show how a young woman's life has been ruined by snorting a powerful party drug as she escaped jail over a drunken knife attack. Mikaila Tyhurst, 28, had once been an attractive blonde with clear skin, good teeth and a career plan to become an air hostess at the age of 18. But after becoming hooked on the former legal high GBL in 2009, she suffered severe liver damage and ended up on life support 15 times, claiming she had been treated like a 'rag doll' by a string of men. Scroll down for video . A young Mikaila Tyhurst (left) before her addiction to GBL and now ravaged by the drug aged 28 (pictured right, leaving Burnley Crown Court) During her addiction, her skin became blotchy and covered in spots, her eyes grew puffy and her hair turned a mousey shade of brown. Meanwhile, her front teeth were knocked out when she fell over during one drug-fuelled night and  her 18-month-old daughter was taken away from her. Last March Tyhurst from Crumpsall, Manchester, went public about her addiction and claimed she had been off the drug for two years - and was determined to turn her life around and help others for the sake of her young daughter. She had been on a detox programme and was hoping to undergo a liver transplant. But on Monday she pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual body harm, possession of a knife and theft after she and two accomplices left a man seriously injured with three knife wounds during a feud at his home in Padiham,  Lancashire. Tyhurst claimed she had been treated like a 'rag doll' by a string of men who suffered the horrific injuries while high on GBL . Judge Andrew Woolman said Tyhurst had turned to drugs because of the 'sustained abuse' she had suffered at the hands of men . Tyhurst could have been jailed but Judge Andrew Woolman gave her an 18 month suspended jail term instead after hearing the appalling and sustained abuse of which she had been a victim. Judge Andrew Woolman told her: 'I have read the pre-sentence report but the bold print does not reveal the full horror of your own life. Your adult life can only be described by sustained abuse at the hands of men. 'You had an appalling time and it led you to drug abuse. These facts allow me to take an exceptional course for what you have done.' Tyhurst, a former pupil of Habergham High School in Burnley, had become hooked on GBL in 2009 before it was made illegal by the Government. The drug - a component of some paint strippers, nail varnish removers and superglue solvents - gives users a feeling of euphoria, but can also reduce their inhibitions. Over a four year period, Tyhurst was taken to hospital nearly 1,000 times - and was close to death on 15 occasions. She only stopped taking the drug after doctors warned her that, if she didn't, she was likely to die. Burnley Crown Court was told the stabbing occurred during a violent fracas with Anthony Hurst after she showed up to at his house drunk and armed with a kitchen knife stashed in her coat. She shouted at Hurst: 'you'd better open the f..king door now' and when he did so, she burst in with two accomplices and began to attack and punch him. Tyhurst had once been pretty with clear skin, good teeth and a career plan to become an air hostess at the age of 18 . As Mr Hurst was pinned down Tyhurst stabbed him three times before his flat screen TV, laptop, mobile phone and wallet were stolen. Mr Brian McKenna prosecuting said: 'Mr Hurst received several blows to the head, neck and back and felt a couple of puncture wounds on his back. He realised a knife was being used on him. He says he was terrified and so scared. He was then dragged up the stairs and pushed onto a settee where he was choked with an arm placed around his neck. 'He was terrified and began to lose consciousness and couldn't breathe. He honestly thought that he might be killed.' Tyhurst said she had borrowed a a friends's kitchen knife because she wanted to scare the complainant not stab him. She told officers, 'I jabbed him..' and said that she prodded him three times with the knife - twice in the back and one time in the chest. She had convictions going back to 2000 when a juvenile for common assault in June 2007 as well as theft, breach of court orders, and common assault and battery in May 2011. GBL - or gamma butyrolactone - is a component of some paint strippers, nail varnish removers and superglue solvents. It gives users a feeling of euphoria, but can also reduce their inhibitions and produce a sense of drowsiness. Once in the body, it turns into notorious drug GHB - known as 'liquid Ecstasy' - banned in 2003 because it was being used as a date rape drug. The former 'legal high' was made illegal by the Government in December 2009. Overdoses are common, with as little as one teaspoon enough to put the user in a coma. Deaths that have been linked with GBL include that of Lynette Nock, 28, died in 2012 after taking the drug. She was at a memorial party for her friend Carl Fearon, who had died after taking the drug the day before. In mitigation defence counsel Mr William Staunton said: 'It's clear she has gone there with the intent to frighten the victim. She didn't gain from the theft of the items, she accepted that at one stage she unplugged the television. 'She is a lady who bears the scars, she was the subjected of prolonged and brutal violence. 'She has gone from one addiction to another, GBL -obtained from squeezing fluid from nail varnish. She is also the victim of violence. 'She would not wish violence on her worst enemy. She has a puncture wound to her head where her former partner struck her with a screwdriver. She has lost teeth. 'She lived effectively as a rag doll at the hands of a man. 'Custody has caused her to reflect and reflect on her destructive ways. Her determination to be drug free I submit is impressive.' Tyhurst was also sentenced to a supervision requirement of 18 months and a 12 month drug rehabilitation programme. Because of her addiction, Tyhurst's life expectancy had been reduced by at least ten years - and she admitted she looked far older than other women in their twenties. She said her liver was currently operating at a level of just 11 per cent - meaning she will need a transplant in the future. After the case she said: 'I am trying to get my life back on track and I haven't been on that stuff for a year. I wish I didn't get into trouble, I'm embarrassed for myself. I see my daughter all the time time, she doesn't know about this.' An accomplice Shaun Andrews, 28, of Burnley, admitted burglary and was jailed for six years at an earlier hearing.","Mikaila Tyhurst has been on life support 15 times since her addition to GBL .

"The NSW magistrate who granted Man Horan Monis bail last year did so after determining the murder case against him and his co-accused was 'weak' and that neither posed a threat to others. Monis, 50, entered the echelons of Australian infamy last week after taking 18 hostages at a Sydney CBD cafe and mounting a 16-hour siege. It ended with his death, and those of hostages Katrina Dawson, 38, and Tori Johnson, 34. Scroll down for video .

The siege ended with the death of Monis, and those of hostages Katrina Dawson (left) and Tori Johnson (right) A view from above of thousands of floral tributes at Sydney's Martin Place for deceased hostages Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson in Martin Place . The deaths of Ms Dawson and Mr Johnson sparked public concern about the NSW bail process, with the state and federal governments publicly questioning how Monis got bail after being charged in relation to the death of his ex-wife. On Tuesday, court documents containing the transcript of Magistrate William Pierce's bail decision from December 2013 were released. Monis, and his then-partner Amirah Droudis (pictured) were granted bail by the court last year . In the documents, Justice Pierce sets out his reasoning for granting bail to Monis, and his then-partner Amirah Droudis. 'The case against them, the circumstantial case, I think is weak,' Justice Pierce said. 'I do not attach much significance to many of the matters to which the prosecutor referred and which he seeks to aggregate, to show proof of the offence, of the likelihood of a conviction.' Monis' former wife Noleen Hayson Pal, 30, was stabbed and set alight at a Werrington apartment block on April 21, 2013. Ms Droudis, who had her bail revoked on Monday, was charged with Ms Pal's murder while Mr Monis was alleged to be an accessory before and after the fact. 'Provided that there is a substantial surety it is necessary in my view, that each of them should have bail,' Justice Pierce said, according to the court documents. 'As much as anything else it is a simple matter of fairness. 'Are they a threat to other people? No they are not.' Droudis' case returns to court next year.

"It took Michelangelo four years and changed the tradition of Renaissance art forever. But one retired decorator, armed with a £2 book on painting from a car boot sale, has created his own version of the iconic Sistine Chapel ceiling and has one more room to go until he completes the entire building. Robert Burns has spent 10 years transforming his council house in Brighton to resemble the Pope's official residence in the Vatican city, which displays the efforts of Michelangelo and other Renaissance greats. And remarkably the 67-year-old has never seen the chapel which inspired his craft, or even visited Italy. Scroll down for video . Robert Burns has spent 10 years transforming his council home in Brighton room by room to decorate it in the style of the Sistine Chapel . He was inspired to create his own version of the ceiling painted by Italian artist Michelangelo after he got a book on Renaissance Art for £2 . 'I have done this all from books,' said father-of-three Mr Burns. 'I have never seen any of these paintings in situ. I never went to art classes, I just saw a guidebook to the Vatican and thought ""this is amazing, I will have a go at making this.""' 'The first few attempts were a bit iffy but I just painted over them. 'I am pretty quick now. I can paint a ceiling in a couple of weeks. 'I started painting my house this way 10 years ago when I bought a book about the Vatican City for £2 at a car boot sale. 'I loved the Renaissance artwork and was hooked start away - I didn't stop me that I've never been to Italy. Mr Burns said at first he did not like the Renaissance artwork in his home but he was encouraged by his wife and has decorated most rooms . The pensioner retired as an artist five years ago, giving him more time to focus on decorating his home and creating his own unique portraits . Mr Burns said he spends around six hours painting a day and can now complete a ceiling in just two weeks - a lot less than Michelangelo . The retired painter said his work is addictive and he keeps adding different pieces to his creations, such as his Renaissance-style ceiling . The Sistine Chapel ceiling, produced by Michelangelo, took four years and has seen around six million visitors a year flock to view it . 'When I first started I was working as a painter and decorator but I didn't like the Renaissance artwork in the house at first.' Mr Burns said he was encouraged to continue by his wife and has just one room left to complete at his three-bedroom home in East Sussex. It may have taken him longer than the four years Michelangelo spent painting the chapel's ceiling, but the decorator is hopeful his masterpiece will be completed by early next year. The ambitious painter has also added his own style to the transformation - with paintings of celebrities including chef Nigella Lawson and music mogul Simon Cowell. Mr Burns took his inspiration for the artwork in his home from a book he bought at a car boot sale (left) and has worked for the last 10 years . Mr Burns said he is proud of his efforts at his council home in Brighton and would now not consider moving home and leaving his works . His works throughout the 1960s terraced home in Brighton have transformed it and are in the style of Renaissance paintings . Mr Burns said he has been asked by friends, his three children and grandchildren when he will stop, but there is always something to add in . Every single room at the property in Brighton - even the bathroom has been meticulously decorated in the Renaissance style by the painter . Mr Burns said his last undecorated bedroom had been magnolia for the past five years and he had been hoping to finish it before Christmas for the arrival of three of his children and three grandchildren. He said: 'People have asked me what I will do when it is finished but Renaissance decoration was so over the top, I could just keep adding to them forever. 'I spend up to six hours a day painting in the house and I'm very proud to be living here. 'I hope to complete the whole house early next year and I don't plan on moving - unless I win the lottery.' Mr Burns' home includes his own unique twist on art, such as this portrait of celebrity chef Nigella hanging proudly in one of the rooms . Mr Burns has previously painted Russell Brand as Jesus (centre) and depicted Wayne Rooney in prayer (left), alongside his Nigella work (right) Signed paintings of Russell Brand as Jesus (left) and footballer Wayne Rooney praying (right) have earned Mr Burns his unique reputation . After news of his creations spread, Mr Burns revealed he was asked to redecorate a luxury mansion outside Horsham which took three months . Mr Burns has one remaining magnolia bedroom in his home which he plans to redecorate to complete the transformation of his entire house . Mr Burns retired as a painter and decorator five years ago, which has given him more time to focus on his own art. He has previously painted comedian Russell Brand as Jesus, football star Wayne Rooney in prayer and Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho as Leonardo da Vinci's Salvator Mundi. Mr Burns was also contacted by a Brighton millionaire in 2007 to redecorate the ballroom ceiling of his luxury mansion outside Horsham - which took three months to complete. The Sistine Chapel is in the Apostolic Palace, in the Vatican. Italian painter Michelangelo was commissioned by Pope Julius II to paint the ceiling, which he completed between 1508 and 1512. He was originally commissioned to paint 12 apostles but demanded a free rein in the design for the scheme. The completed ceiling features a series of 9 paintings showing God's Creation of the World, God's Relationship with Mankind, and Mankind's Fall from God's Grace . Michelangelo returned between 1535 and 1541 to paint The Last Judgement on the wall behind the altar, and his works have drawn thousands of visitors to the chapel. Around six million visitors flock to see the impressive artwork of the Sistine Chapel every year, and numbers of guests are now limited . The side walls of the chapel are divided into three main tiers. Centrally there are two paintings, The Life of Moses and The Life of Christ. They were commissioned in 1480 by Pope Sixtus IV and executed by Domenico Ghirlandaio, Sandro Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, Cosimo Roselli and their workshops. The upper tier is also divided into two and features The Gallery of Popes and Lives. In 1515, Raphael was commissioned to design a series of ten tapestries to hang around the lower tier of the wall to depict the life of St Peter and St Paul. The works took four years to complete and were looted during the Sack of Rome in 1527. In the late 20th century a second set was assembled from other similar copies that had been produced at the time and hung in the chapel from 1983. Earlier this year it was revealed that the number of visitors to the Sistine Chapel will be restricted to 6 million a year to protect the delicate frescos.","Retired decorator Robert Burns spent 10 years redesigning his council home in Brighton in Renaissance art style .

"Britain's about to gorge itself on turkey, sausages and cheese - but it seems our religious feasts carry a hefty price. People of faith are more likely to be obese than the godless, a study has found. And with all their hot cross buns and chocolate advent calendars, Christians are the worst offenders of all. A university researcher examined the body mass indexes (BMIs) of more than 7,000 people, and found those of  believers were almost a point higher than those of  atheists. Sitting comfortably? People of faith have a BMI a point higher than the godless, according to a new study . Feast: Experts believe the role food plays in religious ceremonies could be partly to blame . 'Evidence of this association was strongest among those affiliated to a Christian religion,' said Dr Deborah Lycett, a senior lecturer in dietetics at Coventry University. 'A significantly higher waist-to-hip ratio was also seen in Christian and Sikh men.' Although religious belief and health have been compared before in the U.S., the study is one of the first times the two have been examined together in Britain. Writing in the Journal of Religion and Health, Dr Lycett said she studied 7,414 adults over 16 who were quizzed for the 2012 Health Survey for England. She found the BMIs of those who described themselves as religious were on average 0.91kg per square metre higher. Only wafer thin: Communion may not add much to your waistline, but  religion and obesity appear linked . People with a BMI between 18.5kg and 25kg per square metre have a healthy weight, and people with a BMI over 30 are classed as obese. But the results were not universal across all religions. The most striking correlation was among Christians, she said, followed by Sikh men. And appropriately enough, Buddhists - who aim to cleanse their minds of desire, which presumably includes pasties and pies - were found to have a healthier weight than non-believers. 'The association between religion and obesity is unclear and unexplored in the general English population,' Dr Lycett wrote. 'Some of this was explained demographically, but it was not accounted for by smoking status, alcohol consumption or physical activity level. 'Religious communities may need greater healthy weight promotion or benefit from tailored interventions built on their beliefs.' Exercise: Christians were the most overweight, according to the study of more than 7,000 people . The link between religion and health has been studied extensively in the U.S., where researchers believe the country's obesity crisis could be tackled through religious means. One 2011 study of  5,500 people aged 45 to 84 found participants were more likely to be obese the more religiously active they were - from those who never worshipped to those who attended every week. Obesity is on the rise in Britain, and not just among people of faith. The proportion of obese men has risen from 13.2 to 24.4 per cent in the last 20 years, according to government statistics - with the proportion of men up from 16.4 to 25.1 per cent. The huge rise has increased the strain on the NHS and on the patients themselves, as studies say obesity can shorten life by eight years and blight up to two decades with ill-health.","Coventry University academic Deborah Lycett examined 7,400 people .

"Ukip general secretary Roger Bird has been cleared of improper conduct following an inquiry into allegations that he sexually harassed a would-be parliamentary candidate. The party said it accepted Mr Bird's statement that a relationship between him and Natasha Bolter was 'consensual'. It also agreed that his actions did not compromise the integrity of its candidate selection process. But Mr Bird and the party agreed that he will leave as general secretary because of the 'unfortunate publicity' surrounding Ms Bolter's complaint. Ukip candidate Natasha Bolter and Roger Bird have both given interviews making allegations about their relationship since he was suspended over allegations of impropriety as general secretary . Mr Bird said: 'I am very glad that the party has investigated and dismissed the allegations of sexual harassment and any impropriety regarding the selection of Ms Bolter as a candidate. 'I wish Ukip every success in the election campaign. I remain a member and keen supporter of the party and I will continue to make every effort to help our candidates to victory in May.' The row erupted when Ms Bolter accused Mr Bird of 'taking her down to the snooker room' at a club after a dinner in London and propositioning her on the day he interviewed her as a prospective candidate. But he responded by revealing a string of intimate text messages he claimed she had sent him – including one which read: 'I love you and miss you and think you are sort of perfect.' He insisted the messages proved that, far from sexually harassing her, the pair had actually been in a 'consensual' relationship. But Ms Bolter, 39, responded furiously to his claims, accusing him of lying and insisting: 'I did not sleep with Roger Bird – end of.'

November 11: Ms Bolter texts Mr Bird: 'To cover u we can't be together. Believe it is what u wanted, so the spin helped. Love or infatuation made me lose my brain for a while!

A firm was contacted that day . November 29: Mr Soutter texts Ms Bolter: 'I can sort this if you will make a formal complaint about what has happened to you including your treatment by Roger who has caused all this to happen' December 7: HR consultants produce a draft report. Mr Bird is suspended . December 8: Mr Bird's suspension becomes public. Ukip says: 'The party has acted swiftly and decisively and will not tolerate impropriety of any kind amongst its staff' But she admitted there were text messages. In an interview with BBC Two's Newsnight, recorded before Mr Bird released the content of texts, she said: 'There are texts between us.' Asked if they were of an 'intimate nature' she replied: 'No.' She added: 'Often I send a kiss after a text… you know like: see you later kiss kiss…I think that's a girl thing to do. But I don't think it is particularly intimate.' One text message, which Mr Bird claimed was sent by Ms Bolter on November 2, said: 'I love u bird and wish u let me look after u. Hope u feel better xx.' It has also emerged that she was still texting the party's general secretary her 'love or infatuation' a week after an investigation was launched. Ms Bolter claims she raised he concerns with the party on November 5. But it is understood that the investigation was triggered by another party member raising concerns about Mr Bird's handling of the candidate selection process on that date. Senior Ukip insiders were furious at the way the pair's alleged affair had been played out in public. A source told MailOnline: 'It would be better if they kept it private. Both of them now look like f***ing prats.' But friends of Mr Bird hit back at the party hierarchy, saying Ukip itself had made the issue public by releasing a press statement about the disciplinary process. 'It's a bit rich for senior people in the party to be attacking Roger over this,' said one. 'It was Ukip who put this in the public domain with a press release. 'This should have been a strictly confidential process, and if it had been left to Roger it would have been. 'But he was suddenly facing a very public allegation which he had to respond to.' Doubts were cast on Ms Bolter's account of events, particularly why she continued sending Mr Bird affectionate text messages after the date she claimed to have raised concerns about him. It also emerged she lied about studying politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford University in the 1990s. Ukip has repeatedly insisted it had tried to carry out a professional disciplinary investigation into Mr Bird's conduct. It stressed that the issue of whether or not the couple slept together is not central to the investigation. Mr Bird faced claims he 'marked up' Ms Bolter after her interviewing her about her suitability to be a candidate to ensure she made it on to the approved list.","Natasha Bolter said Ukip general secretary Roger Bird propositioned her .

"A woman took her own life after discovering her husband had sexually abused a nine-year-old girl. Details of the tragic incident emerged yesterday as 64-year-old David Mullinger was jailed for three years over the abuse, in what a judge called a 'desperately sad case'. His wife Jenny, 62, walked in front of a train in September after he confessed to touching the girl twice, including once under her clothes, Bristol Crown Court heard. Tragic case: A judge at Bristol Crown Court told David Mullinger, 64, that his wife's suicide was 'desperately sad'. She walked in front of a train after discovering he had sexually abused a nine-year-old girl . Mullinger was arrested  after the girl told her mother he had been 'fiddling' with her, prompting the girl's shocked parents to phone police. He initially denied the offences, but two days later rang officers in tears to confess he was responsible, the court heard. Following the confession, Mrs Mullinger walked in front of a train near the railway station in Yate, South Gloucestershire. She was pronounced dead at the scene at 8.03am on September 16. Judge Martin Picton told him: 'I'm sure you're only too aware of the awful harm you've done' Mullinger, of Rangeworthy, South Gloucestershire, pleaded guilty to two sexual assaults on a child aged under 13. Jailing him for three years, Judge Martin Picton told him: 'This is a desperately sad case. 'I'm sure you're only too aware of the awful harm you've done.' Mullinger was also handed an indefinite Sexual Offences Prevention Order banning him from unsupervised contact with children under 16. Virginia Cornwall, defending, told the court: 'He feels the impact daily. 'He suffers himself daily. He bears responsibility and knows the consequences such as the loss of his wife. 'She took her own life and that has impacted on everyone for the rest of their lives.' Kenneth Bell, prosecuting, read a victim impact statement from the mother of the girl who was abused. 'Prior to this abuse she was a happy, carefree and innocent child with no knowledge of anything sexual whatsoever,' the girl's mother wrote. 'Now this is no longer the case. The anger she feels about what happened to her is immense. 'My heart breaks at the thought of the long journey that lies ahead for her in order to recover from something like this.'","Tragic incident emerged as David Mullinger, 64, was jailed for three years .

"A Missouri family say a police officer shot dead their friendly golden retriever named Marley for no apparent reason in front of their horrified children just days before Christmas. Rhiannon Wilhite, of Camden, says the officer in question fired twice on the dog, took a long pause and then squeezed off another round in the family’s backyard last week. 'I watched my family member get murdered,' the woman tearfully recounted to Fox4. Scroll down for video . Gunned down: Marley the golden retriever was shot and killed by a police office in his owners' backyard in Camden, Missouri . Left for dead: This image shows Marley's bullet-ridden body lying in the yard before his burial . Scarred kids: Marley's young owners, Rhiannon Wilhite's son and daughter (top left and right), witnessed their pet's killing December 17 . According to the Camden resident, her three-and-a-half-year-old pooch was in the habit of meeting his young owners at the bus station on their way home from school. On December 17, Marley was seen barking at a little girl near the bus stop and following her down the street. Later that day, an officer claiming to be from the Camden Police Department pulled into the Wilhites' driveway in a Ray County Sheriff's patrol car. The law enforcement official informed Mrs Wilhite that her dog needed to be on a leash at the bus station. The woman says she was in the process of pulling Marley into the house when the pup took off running. In mourning: Mrs Wilhite (left) wept saying her kids want nothing else for Christmas except to have Marley back.

"It was supposed to be a festive cruise to sample the delights of Amsterdam’s Christmas markets. But after days at sea the closest passengers got to the Netherlands was a view from the ship’s deck. Holidaymakers were forced to return empty-handed to Southampton last night after spending four days doing circles in the English Channel because of bad weather. Around 2,100 passengers on board the Queen Elizabeth were furious at the decision to turn back and the decision sparked a ‘mutiny’ from frustrated travellers. All at sea: Bad weather kept the Queen Elizabeth back from docking in Amsterdam, causing the ship to circle the channel for four days . They stormed the reception desk and clapped and chanted: ‘We want the captain’, demanding to know what was going on. Matters were only made worse when Cunard, the company that runs the Queen Elizabeth, announced that passengers would only be compensated for their £400 tickets with $75 (around £48) in on-board spending credit. Passenger Charmaine Lynch, 50, from Aldershott, had been travelling with her family to celebrate her parents' 55th wedding anniversary. Passengers tweeted their discontent after four days at sea without docking due to bad weather . Groups of passengers staged a 'mutiny' over the strong smell of diesel and the ship's inability to dock in Amsterdam . She told MailOnline: 'It is my parents'  anniversary in January and my father hasn't been well, so I thought it would be perfect to do a pre-Christmas holiday with my daughter and her husband too. 'It was my parents' first trip with Cunard and I had been explaining exactly what it would be like. Don't I look stupid now.' After four days of sailing up and down the Channel, along with the strong smell of diesel in her cabin, Ms Lynch and her family were incredibly disappointed. She said: 'It was not Cunard's finest hour. I have done other cruises with the company and this wasn't their usual standard. 'I do appreciate that high winds could cause a problem but the Marco Polo cruise ship could make it into port. 'We just had one update each day from the captain, then silence for 24 hours. Only late yesterday did he tell us we would have $75 (£48) compensation to spend on board, but didn't tell us the shops would shut at 7pm. 'We don't drink, so we couldn't use it towards our bill, so our only chance to spend the money was in the shop.' Many passengers on board the ship were taking the cruise as a special celebration . Paul Rolfe claims the constant smell of diesel made his mother feel ill on board . Passengers grouped together on Twitter to discuss possible theories about why the ship had failed to dock . Steve Gordon, 42, from Stratford-upon-Avon was also disappointed after booking the trip with his wife and mother as a Christmas treat. A loyal customer of Cunard, he told MailOnline that perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the trip was the fact it didn't live up to the company's normally faultless reputation. He said: 'The ship smelt of diesel throughout the cruise. When we went for lunch, it was so crowded we just had to grab our food and go, and when we couldn't dock, we were being fed information by staff but not from the person it should be coming from - the captain. 'It just went from there. They didn't lay on any extra entertainment, so people were just walking around and morale really dropped. 'I demanded to speak to someone higher up and the hotel manager was apologetic, he admitted they had dropped the ball.' The ship was supposed to dock in Amsterdam so passengers could visit the Christmas market . Mr Gordon also claimed that staff he spoke to had been expecting traditional 'booze cruisers' rather than seasoned Cunard customers for the trip. He said: 'Staff said they just weren't anticipating Cunard customers, they were thinking it would just be booze cruisers hence why they didn't turn on the bells and whistles'. Upon embarking, Mr Gordon and his wife were given a gold badges to welcome them as frequent cruisers, but he said he would have preferred better customer service to a gold badge. 'We were sharing a stateroom with my mother and simple things were missing, like a robe and slippers for her, and even pillows for her bed. I would have preferred they sorted things like that out than offer us gold badges.' The family decided to leave the ship when it docked in Southampton last night, rather than remain on board until this morning. Fury: Angry tourists take to Twitter to express their disappointment with the cruise ship, including one woman who was on her honeymoon when the vessel was forced to turn back . Tension had been brewing on board the ship for several days as the ship repeatedly circled the Channel. Bored passengers were told they would be given an ‘upgraded entertainment’ package to make up for missing their time in the Dutch city but last night passengers claimed the only activity ‘worth doing’ was a pub quiz which was so oversubscribed people were forced to sit on the floor. Sophie Humphrey, 30, and her mother Eve, 64, both from Cambridgeshire paid £389 each to go on the cruise, which left Southampton on Friday. Miss Humphrey said it was ‘outrageous’ they were offered only £48 compensation after the cruise had failed to reach its destination and labelled the company ‘a complete shambles.’ She added: ‘For four days we’ve just been going around in circles. ‘There has been a small mutiny on board by the passengers, everyone was very angry. It’s terrible, there are two thousand of us and not a single person is happy. ‘It was supposed to be a Christmas treat for me and my mum but not only have we had our money wasted but our time as well.’ The ship had been due to return to Southampton early this morning but in fact arrived last night – ten hours ahead of schedule because of necessary engineering works. Even before the problem with the weather occurred, passengers were complaining of a strong smell of diesel at the front of the ship making it ‘disgusting’ to use the casinos and several shops. As they arrived at Southampton last night, many passengers tweeted their frustration at Cunard. Jenny Meadows called it the ‘worst cruise ever’, adding: ‘Thanks Cunard for wasting our time, money & wrecking our honeymoon.’ Claire Mills added: ‘Nothing but lies, poor service and a shambles of a response.’ Last night Cunard claimed guests had not lost out since all the facilities on the ship were open for them to ‘enjoy’ throughout their trip. A spokesman said that passengers were given a ‘gesture of goodwill’, adding: ‘The captain looked at two alternative ports of call which were both unsuitable due to similar weather conditions.’ f.infante@dailymail.co.uk .","More than 2,000 people were on board Cunard's Queen Elizabeth ship .

"A donor who gave £1million to Ukip is the alleged backer of an offensive website dedicated to attacking the three major parties. Arron Banks is understood to have registered the site LibLabCon – which accuses the parties of killing off Christmas. According to party sources, the entrepreneur is funding the endeavour – however he insists that he ‘doesn’t write stories’. Businessman Arron Banks who is alleged to be the backer of an offensive website dedicated to attacking the three major political parties . The site includes spoof news articles, one of which is entitled ‘Decembortion’ – in which a fictional Conservative spokesman says: ‘We don’t use the word “Christmas” at all these days. It might offend the Muslim and Jewish vote, I mean people.’ Another page refers to Labour frontbencher Chuka Umunna, who is half Nigerian, as the party’s ‘chief spokesman for tokenism’. It also quotes a ‘Labour chief of spin’ saying: ‘We allowed so many immigrants in that now unless we kiss their cultural a*** they could all vote for someone else.’ The home page features a picture of David Cameron with the message: ‘For too long now, the political elite have had their heads buried in the sand and take the people for granted. ‘We aren’t right-wing, left-wing or any-wing… We treat all politicians with equal contempt.’ Ukip claim the website is nothing to do with the party, but it appears to have the support of their top people. Last month, Nigel Farage’s policy chief Tim Aker linked to it on Twitter, remarking, ‘Now this is good’. The website claims Mr Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg are all ‘best friends’ and grew up in lavish country estates, adding that they stuck together as the economy went down the ‘s******’. It then urges readers to ‘vote for something different’. One of the posts defends comments made by Mr Farage earlier this month that women should not be ‘ostentatious’ when breastfeeding in public. Ukip sources told the Financial Times that Mr Banks – who is worth around £100million – is funding the website, the domain of which is registered to him at the address of his firm, GoSkippy, in Bristol. Earlier this year, he donated £1million to Ukip. Mr Banks is pictured shaking hands with Ukip leader Nigel Farage . The site is hosted in the US, however in late November it was re-registered in an apparent attempt to mask the identity of its backer, the newspaper claimed. Mr Banks told the paper in an email, ‘I don’t write stories’ – but declined to comment on the site’s funding. And one of the videos it shows – bizarrely set in Hitler’s bunker – does lightly ridicule Ukip. The clip features the murderous dictator talking about breastfeeding in public and migrants clogging up the roads – a reference to an apparent ‘joke’ Mr Farage made about why he took so long to get to an event in Wales this month. Mr Banks, who founded the Brightside insurance firm before his current venture, used to donate to the Conservatives. However he hit the headlines in September when he appeared at an event declaring that he planned to give Ukip £100,000. He then decided to raise his donation to £1million after William Hague, the former foreign secretary, claimed he had never heard of Mr Banks, who once gave the Tories £25,000. Mr Banks told journalists he had been Tory ‘all his life’ but believed the UK would be better off outside the EU, which he said is a ‘closed shop for bankrupt countries’.

Ukip’s general secretary was forced out of his job last night – despite the party clearing him of sexual harassment. Roger Bird, 41, was suspended earlier this month following allegations by former party candidate Natasha Bolter, 39, that he propositioned her over dinner. Mr Bird insisted that their relationship was consensual, and now an independent investigation has concluded the same. However Ukip said his departure was ‘by mutual agreement’ due to ‘unfortunate publicity’.

"The Obama administration began offering a $5 million reward in October for information leading to the capture of an al-Qaeda terrorist whom the George W. Bush administration had in custody but released from the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in 2006. Ibrahim al-Rubaish, who has emerged as a spiritual leader of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), was captured by American troops in 2001 and spent five years at 'Gitmo.' Less than two years after leaving the prison camp along with 16 other men, al-Rubaish rejoined al-Qaeda in Yemen, leaving his wife and three children to fend for themselves. By 2009 the Jamestown Foundation, a terror-tracking think tank, identified him as AQAP's 'Mufti,' or chief religious authority. Al-Rubaish has a college degree in Islamic shariah law. According to the Middle East Media Research Institute, Al-Rubaish called for open holy war against Americans in 2013, saying: 'It is my duty to spur the Muslims to kill the Americans, to get them out of the Muslims' land.' SCROLL DOWN TO READ A SECRET GOVERNMENT FILE ON AL-RUBAISH . Ibrahim al-Rubaish was let go from Gitmo in 2006 along with 16 other prisoners, and quickly returned to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula – becoming its Mufti, or spiritual leader . Former President George W. Bush was under pressure in 2006 to release prisoners from Guantanamo, and did so, but his spokesman doesn't want to weigh in about al-Rubaish . Pictured in 2002, the Guantanamo Bay military detention camp in Cuba became a repository for the worst terrorists captured after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 . Bush's Defense Department released him into a Saudi rehabilitation program designed to reintegrate jihadis into society. Sources describe the program's intent as similar to gang interventions in the U.S. penitentiaries – but taking place far outside prison walls. The Obama State Department issued a statement on Dec. 18 designating al-Rubaish as 'a senior leader of AQAP. 'He serves as a senior advisor for AQAP operational planning and is involved in the planning of attacks, an agency spokesperson said, noting that al-Rubaish 'has made public statements, including one in August 2014 where he called on Muslims to wage war against the United States.' The Saudi government, too, lists him among its 'most wanted' fugitive terrorists – a tacit admission that its rehab program's focus on religious re-education and social interaction with non-terrorists isn't always effective. Judicial Watch, a center-right research organization known for collecting documents via Freedom of Information Act requests, first publicized on Monday the disconnect between the terrorist's release and his resurgence as an al-Qaeda leader. Despite the return of several high-level former Guantanamo detainees to the terror battlefield, the administration has placed a premium on releasing more prisoners. Obama has pledged to close the detention camp. A spokesman for former President Bush told DailyMail.com that he 'respectfully decline[d]' to comment on his own administration's Gitmo releases. 'President Bush does not want to second-guess the President,' the spokesman said. In an interview on Tuesday, Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said al-Rubaish's post-Gitmo life as an al-Qaeda leader is 'a dramatic illustration of the danger of releasing these terrorists.' 'The recidivism rate is dangerously high, and to release terrorists in the middle of ongoing wars in Afghanistan, the Middle East, is reckless,' he said. Fitton blamed 'pressure from the media, from Congress and from allies abroad' in 2006 for the Bush administration's streak of prisoner 'repatriations.' 'George Bush did some good things in the war against terrorism. He did not adequately defend GITMO,' Fitton said. Al-Rubaish has a college degree in Islamist shariah law and called for Muslims to kill Americans just last year . The 2001 terror attacks on America spurred Bush to action but later generated pressure which ultimately led him to relent on promises that Gitmo detainees would stay put. He and former first lady Laura Bush are shown in 2006 laying a wreath on the fifth anniversary of the attacks, just months after Al-Rubaish's release . 'We know for a fact that the Saudi program that received a lot of transfers during the Bush years, had a recidivism rate of about 20 per cent.' He conceded that the Obama administration's latest numbers show that after 2009 just 6.8 per cent of Guantanamo alumni re-engaged in hostilities. 'But they now have a very narrow and not reassuring definition of what constitutes re-engagement,' he insisted. 'Now if you leave GITMO and call all your friends and tell them to start committing terrorism, that doesn't count.' Lt. Col. Myles Caggins, the Defense Department's spokesman for detainee policy, told Fox News that more than 90 percent of detainees transferred out of Guantanamo during the Obama administration 'have resumed quiet lives in various countries.' In recent years the federal government paid more than $125 million in reward money to approximately 85 individuals who provided useful information that either led to terrorist captures or prevented international terror attacks.

"An Atlanta airline baggage handler suspected of helping smuggle firearms onto passenger jets to New York City has been arrested by federal agents, authorities said on Monday. A FBI affidavit said there was enough evidence to charge Delta ramp agent Eugene Harvey, 31, with trafficking firearms, violating airport security and aiding others in the scheme. Former Delta employee Mark Quentin Henry, who was fired in 2010, was arrested in New York on December 10 in a weapons trafficking investigation after an undercover agent bought a gun from one of his accomplices, according to the affidavit filed on Dec. 19. Scroll down for video . Delta ramp agent Eugene Harvey, 31, has been charged with trafficking firearms, violating airport security and aiding others in the scheme recently busted by police . The investigation targeted firearms that were being sold in New York that had been purchased in the Atlanta area. Authorities looked at Henry's cellphone, airport surveillance footage and security records and determined that he conspired with Harvey to get the guns past security. Cellphone records showed the two had communicated via text message 12 times shortly before Harvey's flight departed Atlanta for New York City on Dec. 10. When Henry was arrested, authorities confiscated a backpack that contained a smaller bag with 18 handguns inside. Henry told investigators he traveled from Atlanta to New York with the guns and ammunition in his carry-on bag, which would not have made it past TSA screening. Investigators said Harvey was assigned to work in the baggage transfer room at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, which is within a designated secure area. Investigators said security records show Harvey used his employee access card to enter the secure area just before 7 a.m. the day of Henry's flight to New York. Investigators said Eugene Harvey was assigned to work in the baggage transfer room at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, above, which is within a designated secure area . Investigators said security footage showed Henry carrying a backpack and walking toward a gate in the B concourse around the same time he began texting Harvey. Harvey later entered a men's restroom across from the gate where Henry was waiting, and security footage recorded Henry walk into the same restroom soon after. A minute later, Henry walked back out carrying the backpack where the guns were later found. Henry later traveled to the A concourse and flight records show he departed from gate A1, investigators said in the affidavit. Federal authorities accuse Henry and Harvey of conspiring to smuggle guns through the airport several times. Between May and Dec. 10, Henry supplied 129 handguns and assault rifles to a co-conspirator who then made sales to an undercover officer, according to the affidavit. Henry, a former baggage handler and ramp agent, was fired from the airline for abusing its buddy pass system. He used pass benefits belonging to his mother, a retired Delta gate agent, to arrange for the flight between Atlanta and New York, according to the affidavit. 'Delta is cooperating with authorities in this investigation. We take seriously any activity that fails to uphold our strict commitment to the safety and security of our customers and employees,' airline spokesman Morgan Durrant said in an emailed statement.","Eugene Harvey, 31, is suspected of helping smuggle firearms onto Delta passenger jets bound for New York City from Atlanta .

"A computer gamer smashed a cup against a wall and a ripped up a photograph of his girlfriend's dead grandmother because she asked him to stop playing on his Xbox. Jonathan Todd, 26, of Boldon Colliery, Sunderland, became angry when he was asked to stop playing the game at 6.30 in the morning by his girlfriend because she had to get up early for work. A court heard he had been drinking in the evening and when he refused to stop playing an argument flared up, which is when he smashed the cup and ripped up the picture, which led to police being called. South Tyneside Magistrates' Court (pictured) heard Jonathan Todd became angry when he was asked to stop playing the game non-stop through the night by his girlfriend because she had to get up early for work . Speaking at South Tyneside Magistrates' Christopher Rose, prosecuting, said: 'The injured party in this case is the defendant's partner. 'She says that she had been in a relationship with the defendant for some time and they had been living together for about a year. 'They get along well until the defendant has a drink and then he becomes very abusive towards her. 'She says that from November 19 to the following day, the defendant had been continually playing on his Xbox in the bedroom and drinking beer and cider. The court heard Todd had been drinking when he refused to stop playing on theXbox, which caused an argument between the couple to flare up . 'He had been playing on the machine almost non-stop and keeping her awake. This resulted in an argument. 'She woke up and saw him playing on the Xbox and asked him to turn it off as she had to go to work early but he refused and an argument developed. 'She managed to get back to sleep again and then the following morning, at 6.30am, she awoke and he was still on the Xbox and she was annoyed at him and there was a further argument and altercation. 'The altercation continued and eventually the police were called. 'While she was waiting for the police there were texts from the defendant saying he was sorry for what he had done.' In a victim statement, the injured partner said: 'I am very upset that Jonathan ripped up a picture of my nan, who passed away last year.' Charles Carr, defending, said: 'He did smash a ceramic cup which had a picture of his girlfriend on it. Because his partner had smashed his glass he threw her cup against the wall, that's the level of it. 'There is no history of domestic violence between this young couple and this was an isolated incident. I understand they are now seeking a reconciliation.' Todd admitted criminal damage and was given a six-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay costs of £85 and a victim surcharge of £15.","Jonathan Todd, 26, became angry when girlfriend asked him to stop game .

"Dr Martin Weale said employees could be set for pay rises . Workers can look forward to bigger pay rises in the coming year as the squeeze on family finances eases, according to a top economist at the Bank of England. Dr Martin Weale said British companies are becoming more confident as the economy recovers – and this should lead to increased wages for millions of employees. Households are also benefiting from the lower oil price which has slashed the price of petrol and diesel and left families with more to spend this Christmas, he said. The comments came as the CBI said the UK’s jobs-rich recovery will strengthen next year with more than half of firms planning to increase pay by more than inflation. Dr Weale told the BBC: ‘When I go and visit businesses throughout the country, I find they are talking of pay increases in a way quite different from what I was hearing say even early in the year, certainly this time last year. ‘I’m getting a more general sense now that people are talking of pay increases which are materially higher than they’d offered in the past. Whereas a year ago I would come across quite a few firms saying they were going to have a pay-freeze, now I am coming across that much more rarely.’ He said the fall in the price of oil – from $115 a barrel in June to around $60 now – is ‘good news’ for the UK economy. ‘Everyone who is buying petrol is glad to see oil prices going down,’ said Dr Weale, who sits on the monetary policy committee, the panel at the Bank that sets interest rates. ‘It gives more spending power to people and that is good news at Christmas.’ Official figures last week showed average pay is now rising comfortably faster than the price of goods as the squeeze on family finances eases. The consumer prices index measure of inflation has fallen to a 12-year low of one per cent while wages are 1.6 per cent higher than they were a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics. The CBI said 55 per cent of firms in the UK are planning to increase staff salaries in 2015 in line with or above the retail prices measure of inflation, which currently stands at 2 per cent. Rain Newton-Smith, director of economics at the CBI, said: ‘The economy is plotting a solid course as we head into Christmas. Whilst growth has slowed somewhat, this reflects a return to a steadier, more sustainable pace as the recent boost from pent-up demand fades. A drop in the price of oil has meant more employees will have more money to spend around Christmas, experts added, as British companies look geared up to increase wages (file image) ‘But the global backdrop remains a concern for firms. The weak Eurozone, slowing emerging markets and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, Russia and Ukraine are headwinds to growth. ‘While lower oil and fuel prices will leave more money in the pockets of households and businesses, it is also making life difficult for major oil producers.’ TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said workers are still feeling the squeeze. ‘After seven years of falling wages and few decent pay rises on offer, Britain’s workers are set to wait years for their living standards to get back to where they were before the financial crisis,’ she said. ‘We need stronger growth and better labour market regulation, to ensure that the rewards of the recovery are fairly shared and to avoid getting stuck with a low value, cut-price economy.’","Dr Martin Weale said British companies are becoming more confident .

"A woman has been ordered by a judge to stop renting out rooms in her apartment on a popular rental website. Noelle Penraat has been renting out rooms in her swank Manhattan apartment, located right on Central Park, on Airbnb. As a result, the unemployed photographer has been able to make roughly $78,000-a-year and cover her monthly rent of $4,477, this in addition to other bills. Trouble: Noelle Penraat (above) is in hot water after renting out rooms in her apartment on Airbnb . Nice digs: Penraat made $78,000 last year by renting rooms in her Central Park apartment (above) According to the Daily News, Penraat 'charged $75-$150 a night or $450-$1,000 a week, depending on the size of the bedroom.' The problem however is that her fellow neighbors at 315 Central Park West were not happy with her arrangement, and it was not legal. It is illegal to rent out the rooms as that would turn a residential building into a hotel, and health and fire standards are far more strict in the hotel industry as opposed to residential. Furthermore, the building now wants to evict Penratt as her rent controlled apartment would go for much, much more than she is paying on the open market. 'She’s making more money by turning this apartment into a bed and breakfast than her landlord is getting in rent,' said Penratt's attorney, Arlene Boop. 'This is supposed to be her home, not a profit making entity.'

"Baby Gammy has had an eventful first 12 months. The Down syndrome baby, who was abandoned in Thailand by his Australian surrogate parents, found himself at the centre of a media storm earlier this year. But on Tuesday - his first birthday - Gammy is a happy, healthy little boy who lives in a new house with his loving family and likes playing with his older brother and sister. Scroll down for video . Gammy celebrates his first birthday on Tuesday, after being the centre of an international scandal this year . Gammy pictures with his Thai surrogate mother Pattaramon 'Goy' Chanbua during a trip to the beach . Gammy is a happy, healthy little boy who lives in a new house with his loving family . They live in a comfortable house paid for using part of the $250,000 raised for the family through public donations, which has new furniture, a television set, and plenty of kids' toys. And apart from a few minor hospital visits the family lives a normal life, even going on trips to the beach together. Peter Baines, founder of the charity handling Gammy's medical and living expenses, said the family had been doing well since moving into their new home in October. 'Gammy's had some health issues and that's not to be unexpected, but they're certainly in a better space then they would have been,' said Mr Baines, of Hands Across The Water. 'He had a repeat of a lung infection and spent a few days in hospital. 'Nothing as severe as what it was the first time and certainly it was treated a lot quicker and recovery was a lot better than what it was.' The charity handling Gammy's medical and living expenses said  Gammy loved playing with his siblings . And apart from a few minor hospital visits the family lives a normal life, going on trips to the beach together . Mr Baines added that Gammy loved playing with his siblings. 'He's just a healthy, happy boy who loves interacting with his brother and he's got a beautiful personality about him,' he said. 'It's not right he be defined by health issues, or what happened to him, or the fact that he's got Down syndrome. 'He's getting fat like a little one-year-old should, now he's over the worst of his health issues.' Earlier this year Gammy's Thai surrogate mother Pattaramon 'Goy' Chanbua and Gammy found themselves at the centre of an international row over the ethics and legality of surrogacy when it emerged Gammy's Australian parents David and Wendy Farnell abandoned him in Thailand but took home his healthy twin sister Pipah. Gammy has an ongoing lung condition which sees him need hospital treatment from time to time . Baby Gammy and his mother Pattharamon 'Goy' Janbua moved into a new house in October . Almost half of the $250,00 raised was spent on the three-bedroom house, where the pair will live with Goy's husband, grandparents and two other children, 100km south of Bangkok . Mr Baines said 21-year-old Goy – who has looked after Gammy since his Australian parents left him – was also coping well after an intense year. 'She's really good, she's in a good space, and I've always said when you look at her level of education and her life and you look at what she's had to deal with I think she's dealt with it remarkably well,' he said. Mr Baines said that of the $250,000 raised for Gammy, about half of the money was spent on the family's new three-bedroom house. There is $120,000 left over to cover the one-year-old's future medical and living expenses . Before moving into the new home Gammy was in hospital for six days due to a lung infection . Goy and Gammy pose with Nom Manochantr, general manager of Hands Across The Water in Thailand . The family needed a new home because their previous one-bedroom unit (pictured) was too run-down for Gammy, who still suffers from a lung condition . The family plans to do some alterations at the front of their new house to set up a noodle shop, similar to the one they used to run at Goy's grandparents nearby house (pictured) Child protection officials in Western Australia are still conducting an 'extensive and rigorous' assessment into the welfare of Gammy's twin sister Pipah, pictured with David and Wendy Farnell .

The house for Gammy's family was purchased and is being held under a trust in the name of Hands Across The Water, which is managing the family's money on behalf of Goy. Gammy, Goy, and Goy's husband, grandparents and two other children moved into the home earlier in the year. The house is in the same neighbourhood as the family's previous residence, in an industrial area about 100km south of Bangkok, where they also ran a small shop selling salads and noodles. Hands Across The Water founder Peter Baines visited the family earlier this month to assess their situation and needs. Pictured: Goy and her three children . Mr Baines described Gammy as: 'a strong little boy who certainly appears healthy and full of life' Mr Baines said: 'we anticipate the original donated funds being sufficient to see Gammy into early adulthood' Earlier in the year, Hands Across The Water administered $20,000 towards Gammy's medical costs, including moving him from a public to a private hospital, when he was suffering from a lung infection .","Thai surrogate baby Gammy celebrates his first birthday on Tuesday .

"A stray Tabby who was rescued last week has given birth to 11 kittens just days before Christmas. Donatella gave birth to the large brood yesterday, less than one week after arriving at her new home at the Cats Protection's adoption centre in Bridgend, South Wales. One of Donatella's kittens was stillborn but vets say the remaining ten newborns are in good health following their mother's five-hour labour. Tabby Donatella gave birth to 11 kittens at the Cats Protection's adoption centre in Bridgend, South Wales . The adorable kittens were born after Donatella went through a five-hour labour yesterday . Donatella, thought to be aged one, was handed into the charity last week after a householder who had been feeding the cat noticed she was heavily pregnant. Vets say it was lucky Donatella was handed in when she was, in time for the gruelling labour. Cats Protection's Clinical Veterinary Officer Beth Skillings said: 'The large litter is in itself unusual, but for so many to survive the birth is exceptional. 'Late pregnancy is very draining even for cats in good health, so for an underweight stray like Donatella it would have been particularly gruelling. 'First time mums usually have smaller litters, so it's possible Donatella may already have had a litter, despite being so young herself. 'It's hard not to find Donatella's story heart-warming, especially at this time of year. One of the kittens was stillborn but ten of the kittens are all in good health after the five-hour long labour . Donatella, believed to be aged one, was handed into the charity one week earlier, after a householder who had been feeding her noticed she was heavily pregnant . 'But it's important to remember this is not a fairytale - Donatella was a stray who has been through quite an ordeal to carry and give birth to so many kittens. 'She is lucky that someone noticed her and handed her into us as it is likely that many more of her kittens would have perished otherwise.' Cats usually give birth to an average of three to six kittens. Larger litters often result in high rates of stillbirth. According to Cats Protection, the world's largest litter was born in 1970 when a Burmese/Siamese cat gave birth to 19 kittens. Four were stillborn.","Kittens were born at adoption centre in Bridgend, South Wales, yesterday .

"A letter to Father Christmas dating back nearly a century has been found lodged in the chimney of a boarding school where it was sent by an enthusiastic young girl. The flame-singed note, written by a schoolgirl called Haly, asks Santa for a copy of a novel and a new dress, and was apparently sent in or shortly after 1922. It was found lodged inside a chimney at Haberdashers' Monmouth School for Girls, in South Wales, by a caretaker who was clearing out the fireplace after raven chicks had been nesting in it. Discovery: A century-old letter to Father Christmas has been found in a chimney at Haberdashers' Monmouth School for Girls by caretaker Andy Beddoes, pictured with a group of pupils . The letter was initially almost illegible because of the damage caused by exposure to years of smoke, but after it was restored it could be read once again. It was addressed to 'Daddy Xmas', and read in full: 'Dear Father Christmas, are you coming to see me again in two weeks' time I suppose? 'Tell Mummy I want a book, Tell England, and an evening dress. Love, Haly H XXX'. Tell England, a novel about the First World War by Ernest Raymond, was published in 1922 - leading school officials to assume that the letter is likely to have been written soon afterwards. Haly was probably around 10 or 11 years old at the time of the letter, because the bulding where it was found has always been a boarding house for girls of that age. Illegible: But the letter from a girl called Haly H could eventually be deciphered after it was restored . School caretaker Andy Beddoes found the note in October when he was vacuuming inside the chimney and realised there was something resting on a ledge. 'I pulled it out and saw it was a folded bit of paper and because I’m curious, I tried to read it,' he said. 'I could see ""Dear Father Christmas"" and the dress bit but that was all. It's a lot cleaner now but you still can't find a date on it. 'I was just surprised really that it hadn't been destroyed. I found it tucked up on the top ledge - it's quite a lucky find.' Delight: Pupils at the school have been trying to check up other chimneys to see if there's anything inside . Housemistress Liz Price said that the pupils had been trying to explore other chimneys in the school to see what treasures might be hidden inside. 'The girls were so excited about the letter,' she said. 'I think reading something like this makes them appreciate what they have more. 'You can tell them until you're blue in the face about how people in the old days didn't have as much as they do today, but actually reading this letter and seeing that all the girl asked for was a book and a dress made it more real.' Haberdashers' Monmouth School for Girls was founded in 1892, and moved to its present site in the town of Monmouth, near the border between England and Wales, five years later. The school accepts girls between the ages of seven and 18, with fees of nearly £26,000 a year for boarders.","The letter was written by a girl called Haly asking for a book and a dress .

"Widow Betty Williams, 86, spent more than £1,000 in a selfless act to host a Christmas dinner for 50 strangers and booked a pub in east Devon so they would not spend the festive season on their own . It was a selfless act to ensure people weren't lonely as Christmas approaches, and was an act that ended up earning her worldwide fame . Widow Betty Williams booked out every table in an east Devon pub today to treat 50 strangers to turkey and all the trimmings, as well as a glass or two of wine so they wouldn't have to eat their Christmas dinner alone. The 86-year-old had decided to invite anyone who may have been on their own over Christmas, and spent more than £1,000 on the lunch at the Lamb and Flag pub for her and her 50 guests. Mrs Williams was widowed 12 years ago and has found herself alone over the Christmas period in recent years due to a lack of close family and difficulty travelling. This year, determined not to eat by herself and moved by the growing number of food banks in Britain, she contacted  the mayor of Ottery St Mary Councillor Glyn Dobson, to organise the festive lunch. The result was a turkey dinner for 50 guests, many of whom would have ended up spending their whole Christmas alone had it not been for the selflessness of the pensioner. Mrs Williams said she had been looking forward to the day since she had planned it and was pleased the event had finally arrived this afternoon. She said: 'I don't have any close relatives at all. I was an only child, my husband was an only child, and we live miles away from other relatives. 'My nearest relatives at the moment are in Derbyshire or Kent - a long way away.' The pensioner said she was pleased with the turnout at the event, which saw 50 people raising their glasses to toast her for the Christmas dinner. She said: 'I wanted to give pleasure to some people and to get them out among friends. 'It's important people aren't alone at Christmas. It's great.' Mrs Williams also decided to hold the lunch as her own response to the growing number of food banks in Britain, being used by people who cannot afford to feed themselves and their families. She added: 'I've been watching programmes on television about food banks and people by themselves being in trouble. Mrs Williams enjoyed lunch with her 50 guests and said she hopes to hold a similar event next year . The festive gathering meant pensioners in east Devon were able to get together to enjoy Christmas dinner . Guests got into the Christmas spirit at the event, donning party hats and pulling crackers for Christmas . Mrs Williams and John Fisher, 86, (centre) pull a cracker as they prepare for the Christmas lunch in Devon . 'Every time my post comes there is a request for money, and I thought rather than send the money abroad, why not help local people. 'The people who came to the lunch, I don't know them. I didn't know who would be there. 'Some of them I recognise, but that's as far as it goes. It was a pure gesture of putting money into the local economy. 'Supporting the local economy is important to me, we have all these adverts on the television for charities, most of which are going abroad, a lot of which are going to the organisers.' Mrs Williams, a former Italian and French secondary school teacher, originally planned to keep her identity a secret but when news of her selfless gesture emerged her identity was revealed. She added: 'I know I am elderly, but I am not out of my mind. I am an Oxford graduate, I reason things out, and that's how I reasoned this out. 'I think the turnout is magnificent, I'm pleased to bits with it. I wanted to give pleasure to some people and to get them out among friends. It's important people aren't alone at Christmas. It's great.' A number of the guests at the event said they would have been eating their Christmas dinner alone this year were it not for the pensioner's kindness. Some recognised her while others had never met her before. The 50 guests enjoyed a three course Christmas dinner with wine at the Lamb and Flag pub in Ottery St Mary . John Fisher (left) said Mrs Williams was very generous in organising the Christmas dinner for 50 people . Mrs Williams spent more than £1,000 on the slap up Christmas dinner, complete with three courses and wine . Crackers were pulled and drinks toasted as 50 people, most strangers, enjoyed their Christmas dinner today . John Fisher, 86, a retired map maker, said: 'I have been very much looking forward to today. 'Most of my family have moved away, so it would be just me and my daughter for Christmas dinner otherwise. 'It's a wonderful gift to the people of Ottery from Betty, very generous of her indeed. 'A lot of people would be on their own for Christmas if it wasn't for Betty. Everyone has to do their bit, and its great to see Betty making a difference.' May Kennedy, 90, a retired nursery school assistant, said she would be alone for Christmas and the lunch had given her the chance to enjoy herself with others: 'I think it is very kind and very generous, and it is much appreciated. I have lived here for the past 33 years, and have never seen this sort of generosity before. 'I don't really know Betty. I know who she is by sight, but I don't really know her. It's very kind that she invited me. Mrs Williams, with guest John Fisher to her right, said it's  important people are not on their own at Christmas . A number of the guests expressed gratitude to Mrs Williams and said they would have been otherwise alone . Betty Williams (right) raises a toast at the lunch which she hopes to repeat next year for those on their own . 'If it wasn't for this meal I would be spending all over Christmas alone. It is so kind of Betty to have invited me. 'I think it's great when people can get together, especially at this time of year.' Win Amos, 87, a retired manager of a catering company, said: 'I had heard about it through the grapevine but had no idea we were included in the numbers. 'I think it is absolutely wonderful of Betty, she is a great person. 'I would be at home on my own for Christmas dinner if it wasn't for today. I'm so grateful to be able to share this joyous moment with members of my local community.' After he was approached for help by Mrs Williams, Coun Dobson, 72, decided to make a bit more of the event. He organised the guests, and for the town crier and the local choir to attend. Coun Dobson said he was really pleased with the large turnout at the event. The plan had at first been to host the festive gathering on Christmas day but everywhere was booked so they decided to book today. Toni Williams-Pugh, the town crier, announced the start of the festive lunch hosted by the former teacher . Councillor Dobson organised for the local choir to attend the event and a band launched the special dinner . He said: 'It's a very kind gesture. I think its because she has been on her own. 'I have lived in the town for 50 years so I know a lot of the people who attended. 'There was criteria when we invited people, there are some couples who probably wouldn't have bothered cooking themselves a dinner, some people who are on their own. It's mostly elderly people, of course. Betty was surprised at how the whole thing went viral. 'I think it's great to help local people, and bring them together.' At the dinner the guests were treated to a starter, main and desert, alongside red wine which was all provided by the host. Mrs Williams booked out the Lamb and Flag pub for the festive lunch, which gave an undisclosed discount . Pensioners and guests turned up to the Christmas dinner and said it was nice to part of the community . For starters they had the choice of winter vegetable soup or seafood cocktail.The mains were more traditional, with a choice of meats served with all the usual trimmings. For dessert the obvious choice was Christmas pudding, but there was also a poached pears option. The diners were seated to the tune of 'Oh Come All Ye Faithful' played by the towns brass band, who continued to play throughout the meal. Before the were served their food, the town crier welcomed them into the room, opting to use a smaller bell so that he didn't startle any of the elderly guests. After the town crier had welcomed the guests, Betty offered a short prayer thanking everyone for attending and reminding everyone that the true meaning of Christmas is to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ.","Betty Williams hosted Christmas dinner for 50 strangers in east Devon .

"David Miliband's suitability to run a human rights charity in America has been brought into question because of his record in hushing up torture . Concern was growing in America yesterday over David Miliband’s suitability to run a human rights charity given his track record in hushing up torture. His past involvement in covering up the dark practice threatens to tarnish the reputation of the International Rescue Committee, its supporters warned. Some donors to the highly regarded humanitarian charity are now openly questioning whether he is the right man to be its president. They are demanding he clear the air by returning to London to give evidence to a judge-led inquiry. Mr Miliband, who landed the £300,000-a-year job last year after quitting British politics, has always denied suppressing evidence of torture. In 2010, however, he spent £213,000 of taxpayers’ money in legal fees battling in the Court of Appeal to stop details emerging of the appalling treatment of Binyam Mohamed, the British resident and former Guantanamo inmate. Now his role in the cover-up is coming under renewed scrutiny following the appalling torture revelations by the US Senate committee. Dr Aaron Spital, a retired kidney specialist who, according to the charity’s website, donated between $5,000 (£3,100) and $10,000 to the IRC last year, said he would be ‘very surprised’ if, as foreign secretary, Mr Miliband had not known what was going on. The 63-year-old professor at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York said: ‘The question really comes down to: did David Miliband know there was, what I would consider, torture being used? If he knew about that, if he had anything to do with it, I think that’s an important issue. ‘Maybe somebody who knows something about that, and doesn’t say anything, should give some justification as to why they kept quiet. And if they can’t, it makes you wonder if they should be leading an organisation like the IRC.’ Jerrold Spady, another $5,000-$10,000 donor, said that it was an ‘ethical’ organisation and he did not want anything to tarnish that. David Miliband paid £213,000 of taxpayers' money in an attempt to stop details emerging of the appalling treatment of Binyam Mohamed, a British Guantanamo Bay inmate . The 78-year-old, from Ulysses in Kansas, said: ‘Being forthcoming is best. I certainly wouldn’t want anything to harm the IRC because they do good work helping some of the poorest people in the world.’ Asked if Mr Miliband should return to the UK to give evidence before Parliament, Eleanora Worth, 81, who lives in Virginia and has donated a similar amount, said: ‘Yes, I agree.’ The IRC, founded at the request of Albert Einstein in 1933, helps refugees from 40 countries including Syria, Afghanistan and Haiti. Its directors and ‘overseers’ include Henry Kissinger, former UN chief Kofi Annan and Princess Firyal of Jordan. Working from an office in Manhattan, Mr Miliband earns more than Barack Obama and counts former president Bill Clinton among his friends. David Miliband also secretly plotted to hand Shaker Aamer to the Saudi Arabian authorities while leading his family to believe he was seeking to bring him back to the UK . Last month, he was schmoozing with singer Sting and Star Trek actor Sir Patrick Stewart at a gala dinner at the Waldorf Astoria. In the US, he is called Mr Secretary, following the American custom of using his old title as foreign secretary, but he has spoken of enjoying being relatively ‘anonymous’ in New York compared with his high profile in the UK. The IRC’s funding comes mainly from taxpayers – including £110million of British aid money – in the form of grants to fund its international relief programmes. Speaking in advance of the Senate committee’s findings on the CIA, Mr Miliband said torture was ‘reprehensible’. He claims that he ‘wasn’t suppressing anything’, but he has also acknowledged for the first time the possibility that the US misled British ministers.","Human rights charity donors question suitability of David Miliband's role .

"Keurig is recalling more than 7 million of its single-serve coffee brewing machines after reports that a number of them had spewed hot liquids and injured dozens of users. The recall is for Keurig's Mini Plus brewers that were made between 2009 and 2014. Keurig received about 200 reports of hot liquid spraying from the brewer, including 90 reports of burn-related injuries. Customers who own the brewers can contact the company and have a repair kit sent for free. Recall: Keurig is recalling more than 7 million of its single-serve coffee brewing machines after reports that a number of them had spewed hot liquids and injured dozens of users . Keurig said the kit will fix the issue. The company warned customers waiting for the kit to keep an arm's length away from the brewers and not brew more than two cups in quick succession. About 6.6 million of the brewers are in the U.S., and 564,000 are in Canada. They were sold for about $100 online and at retailers across the country, including Kmart, Kohl's, Target and Walmart. The recalled brewers have model number K10 and have an identification number starting with '31' printed on the bottom.

"The apres-ski cocktails start early here in the fashionable French resort of Megeve. In fact, with no skiing whatsoever - and, believe me, I have tried - it's never too soon to order a gluwein. It's the same up the road in Morzine. There, the authorities have just reopened the adventure playground for children. Scroll down for video . Not much going on here: Robert Hardman looks for skiing in the chic resort of Megeve - and find only slush . This is actually a summer attraction. But with the Christmas holiday crowds arriving today, the council is frantically dreaming up new ways to entertain thousands of skiers in a ski resort which is still lacking one vital component: snow. Over in Chamonix, the famous mountain town at the foot of Mont Blanc, a handful of ski lifts will finally rumble into life from this morning. It will mean there is a limited amount of skiing on some higher slopes for the first time this winter, but everyone acknowledges that it is not enough to cater for the thousands of skiers on their way. Wherever I have been in the Alps this week, the locals tell me that it has been one of the most atrocious starts to a ski season anyone can recall. Many resorts - including some very famous ones - have had to delay opening by a week or two. Green and pleasant land: The slopes in Morzine are a haven of grass - and useless for skiing at the moment . Others remain closed to all skiers. And even in the higher ski areas (above 2,200 metres) which are blessed with a rudimentary layer of the white stuff and, in some cases, a glacier, staff are still worried. They know they can expect overcrowded slopes and long lift queues as snow-starved punters are bussed in from all those forlorn brown towns further down the valleys. Nor is there much chance of fleeing the crowds, leaving the beaten track and skiing off-piste. In these conditions, that could prove suicidal. If 'the big dump' does not come soon, the high resorts acknowledge they may have to limit numbers on their slopes — or lock out the poor relations. This should have been a bumper season for British skiers, too, with the pound considerably stronger than last year and a new winter Eurostar rail connection to Geneva four times a week. Instead, they are glued to the snow reports on the Ski Club Of Great Britain's website as they face the prospect of snow rations. Ask anyone in these nervous communities what they want, and they all have the same message: leave the presents behind, Santa, and just bring a Lapland-sized sack of snow, please. Even if there is a blizzard tonight, the damage has already been done to bookings for next December. Memories are short and people will base their plans for 2015 on what happened in 2014, not all those bumper years which preceded it. Where do we go from here? There are occasional patches of snow in Morzine - but nothing very useful . 'Bookings are up by 10 per cent on last year but we have had the worst start in 40 years,' sighs Julie Merie at the tourist office in Les Arcs. Over in the Austrian resort of Lech, much favoured by European royalty, just 13 out of 47 lifts are open. Spokeswoman Pia Herbst describes this as the worst start to a season since 1999. 'But then, when the snow finally came, it didn't stop and we were snowed in for two weeks!' she adds. So how bad is it really? Old hands can recall pretty miserable Decembers back in the Eighties and Nineties. But the main difference between then and now is that, today, most resorts also have expensive snowmaking cannons to take up the slack. Yet these are no use unless the temperature is below freezing, and the Alps have experienced a prolonged period of unseasonal warm weather. Other parts of Europe are fine. The snow is looking good in the Pyrenees, for example. But it is the French Alps which are feeling particularly neglected by the snow gods. Although there have been fresh falls during my stay this week, they have not been followed by a decent cold spell. Below 2,000 metres, most of this week's snow was followed by rain, which soon turned it to slush. Staying hopeful:Students Michaela Chapman (left) and Hannah McCoosh have been in Les Arcs for the week . My Alpine odyssey begins in the town of Les Gets, a family-friendly French town not far from the Swiss border. It is a relatively low-lying ski resort and would never expect a rich carpet of snow at this time of year. But when I pass through, I find rolling green fields with the occasional splurge of white where a snow cannon has done its best. It looks a bit like the Yorkshire Dales. A spokeswoman for the resort says that 'fingers are crossed' for snow and that, in the meantime, families can look forward to an exciting series of Father Christmas-themed events. Rain is falling by the time I get to Morzine, another relatively low ski town. The tourist office could not be more welcoming. Nadine Chevalier tells me that the town is doing everything it can, including laying on extra buses to get people up to the higher neighbouring resort of Avoriaz. 'We just don't want to think of Christmas without snow,' she says. But, for now, all of Morzine's pistes are closed. Up by the Pleney cable car station, however, I notice a small patch of snow, about the size of a tennis court. Seized by a spirit of solidarity - and so that I can claim to be Morzine's first skier of the season - I walk to the top, stick on some skis and 'bend ze knees'. I must be hitting at least five miles an hour as I grind to a halt in the mud a few seconds later. Morzine is at the heart of one of the world's largest ski areas, a chunk of Alp known as Les Portes du Soleil. Today, the only skiing in its entire 250-mile piste network is to be found half an hour away in Avoriaz. Visibility is poor, the snow is slushy at the bottom - but it is better than nothing. Not much to do here, really: Robert cuts a forlorn figure as he ponders his next move in Megeve . And the local lift company says it will have up to 40 per cent of Avoriaz open this weekend. Onwards to Megeve, the ultra-chi-chi resort built by the Rothschild family in the Twenties. The management had originally intended to start running lifts from December 6. Then they pushed the date back to December 13 - but still no snow. The first cable cars will finally start running today, but only for hill-walkers. For now, Megeve remains off-limits to skiers. From a distance, though, it does look as if there is a thin layer of white on the slopes. Surely, it's worth a try? I put on skis and trudge up the hill next to the Rochebrune cable car station. Grass is poking through the porridge veneer. In some places, the slush has given way to large puddles. I point my skis straight down the hill, squelch forward for a few yards and then stop in my tracks. As night falls, we reach the famous Olympic resort of Meribel, founded in the Thirties by a British Army officer. Set high in the vast Trois Vallees ski area, it is so popular with the British that we account for 40 per cent of its 1.6 million overnight stays each season. Snow is falling gently and the outlook appears promising. The following day, I sit down with the Meribel management. Resort director Jean-Louis Leger-Mattei points out that snow depths have always gone in cycles. 'Ten years ago we would get ten metres of snow during a season. In the last year or two, it has been five metres over the whole season.' Olivier Simonin, managing director of the Meribel Alpina ski lift company, stresses that this was one of the first resorts in the world to install a snow gun in 1985. 'People said we were crazy,' he says. But now Meribel has 700 guns covering half of its entire piste network. Deserted: The ski lifts in Morzine would ordinarily be abuzz with skiers at this time of the season . Although they cost £25 million, they are certainly paying dividends this winter: this morning, the resort expects to have 70 per cent of its runs open. An hour away, I come to Les Arcs, a high-rise resort built in the Seventies. Because of its altitude it has fine, if limited, skiing on the higher pistes. British voices are everywhere today. It turns out that more than a thousand British students are in town. 'It's been quite repetitive skiing the same runs all the time,' says Peter Roberts, 22, from Southampton University. 'It's nothing like previous years, but it's still good fun.' Spirits - British ones, at least - remain high. 'It's not ideal, but at least we have skied every day,' says Eric, 53, a British engineer based in Holland. 'There's no point coming all the way here and being miserable,' adds his wife, Joanna, with a big smile. Indeed not. But for the thousands of Brits heading to the Alps this weekend, there is one possibility even worse than a brown Christmas. And that is sitting in the rain out there and reading about a white one back in Blighty.","Ski resorts in the French Alps are suffering a terrible start to the season .

"The Islamic State has released a list of rules dictating how Christians living in the Syrian city of Raqqa should behave, including the instruction to never pray in public or within earshot of a Muslim. In the list of seven rules that Christians must obey, the terror group also warns that there should never be any 'treachery' against ISIS, nor any mockery directed towards Muslims or Islam. The new set of restrictions are applicable to those living in ISIS-controlled Raqqa, previously one of Syria's most liberal areas. Scroll down for video . The Islamic State has released a list of rules dictating how Christians living in the Syrian city of Raqqa should behave (file picture) They are said to be in return for Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi - the head of Islamic State and the most wanted man in the Middle East - granting safety to Christians in the war-torn city, according to the International Business Times. In the document, it says al-Baghdadi will safeguard 'their selves, children, money and churches', if Christians obey the stringent list of rules. It comes just months after the jihadists banned Christians in Raqqa from drinking alcohol in public or from trading pigs or alcohol in markets. The document opens with a lengthy quote from the Quran which describes how Christians are 'in a state of subjection'. No public worship . No treachery against ISIS . No church construction or repairs . Do not display crosses in Muslim areas or markets . Praying must be done quietly and should never be heard by Muslims . No mockery of Muslims or Islam . Do not prevent others from converting to Islam . It says: 'Fight those who do not believe in Allah, nor in the latter day, nor do they prohibit what Allah and His Apostle have prohibited, nor follow the religion of truth, out of those who have been given the Book, until they pay the tax in acknowledgement of superiority and they are in a state of subjection.' It goes on to explain that public worship and treachery against ISIS is forbidden. It adds that Christians in Raqqa are no longer allowed to construct churches or even repair any damaged churches in their villages. They are also banned from publicly showing their crosses in Muslim areas or in their own market places. The rules then describe how ISIS have forbidden Christians to 'raise their voices when praying or in other acts of worship'. In a statement which effectively bans Christians from openly reading from the Bible, the statement says that Muslims 'do not hear the recitation of their books out loud'. Likewise, the document prescribes that all acts of worship must be carried out inside a church and never in public. Raqqa has become increasingly conservative since being controlled by the terror group and has also been subject to frequent airstrikes by the U.S-led coalition . Christians have also been ordered not to prevent any of their fellow Christians from converting to Islam. ISIS have also declared that it is illegal for Christians to 'carry out any actions of enmity to the Islamic State such as helping air strikes locate their positions'. Defying these rules could result in death. Raqqa has become increasingly conservative after the terror group began imposing hardline Islamist law and handing out punishments to those who did not follow orders. The last of the government forces were driven out of the area in August. The terror group - which has seized wide expanses of territory in Iraq and Syria - subsequently seized an air base and executed score of Syrian soldiers.","Strict rules say there should never be any treachery against Islamic State .

"Kylie McKechnie with his pet cockerel Fudge who was found dead on Saturday following complaints from neighbours about its crowing . A schoolboy's beloved pet cockerel has been found dead in its pen following a dispute with neighbours over his early morning crowing. Kyle McKechnie nursed the bird named Fudge back to health after he found it wandering around injured. The two became so inseparable that the cockerel would watch TV on the 11-year-old's knee. Neighbours began complaining when Fudge crowed each morning at 5am when Kyle's courier driver father, Scott, 38, left for work. When he switched on the lights Fudge would cocka-doodle-do thinking that it was sunrise. The housing association who own the McKechnie's house in Thetford, Norfolk, told the family that Fudge had to go by January 2 as they were breaking their tenancy agreement. The family then set about finding a new home for the cockerel, as the RSPCA warned them they could be prosecuted for releasing Fudge back into the wild. But on Saturday, before Kyle had a chance to re-home his pet, he found Fudge dead. He had been set to give the cockerel to a new owner after Christmas. Mr McKechnie said someone had cut the chain on Fudge's pen and snapped its neck. The father-of-three said: 'It can't have been a fox as there was no blood and the other chicken we own was fine. 'The chain on the pen was broken and his neck had clearly been snapped so we think one of the neighbours who complained killed him.' The police have been informed, but Mr Scott said they had no evidence to suggest who killed Fudge. He added: 'Kyle was really really upset. I have been left with three absolutely devastated children who have been left without their pet just before Christmas. 'I really hope we find who did it.' A Norfolk Constabulary spokeswoman said police had not been able to establish exactly how Fudge had died and had told the McKechnie family to take their pet to find out. Kylie's father Scott, above, said his son and his two other children had been left 'absolutely devastated' following the death, just days before Christmas . Kylie had found a new home for his pet and was going to give Fudge to a new owner next week . Ms McKechnie said the family couldn't afford to do that, and he believed the cause of death was obvious. An RSPCA spokeswoman said: 'We are alarmed and concerned to hear reports that someone may have killed this cockerel because of the noise he made. 'If it is true, this sounds like a completely pointless and callous act. We can only hope that the cockerel was killed by someone experienced in a quick, effective and humane way.' The RSPCA said anyone with information about the death should contact them.","Kylie McKechnie took the cockerel in after finding it walking about injured .

"The Shadow Chancellor said Labour would attempt to introduce the tax as soon as they took power if elected . Labour is to seek to introduce its mansion tax on expensive homes from day one of regaining power, Ed Balls suggested last night. The shadow Chancellor said he hoped to hit better-off homeowners in the 2015-16 financial year, even though that starts a month before the May general election. It is unusual for a tax to be introduced in the course of a financial year, but Mr Balls said he wanted to start raising money from the rich in order to plough into the NHS as quickly as possible. The coalition sought to undermine Mr Balls’s pledge to £2.5bn for the NHS through a combination of the mansion tax, a a levy on tobacco firms and reducing tax avoidance by hedge funds by announcing its own £3bn boost at the autumn statement. Critics also pointed out that revenues from these measures were unlikely to start flowing in until the middle of the next Parliament. But Mr Balls, in an interview with the Independent, said: ‘Saving the NHS will be at the heart of our first Budget. I would like to see that revenue coming in in the first year of a Labour government, before the end of the financial year. We will have to see the practicalities.’ Mr Balls has asked the Treasury to start preparations for such a tax before the election. The Shadow Chancellor denied this would amount to retrospective legislation. ‘A charge is paid in that year on the valuation on a date in that year. We will be clear what we are going to do in our manifesto. No one will have any doubt about our intentions,’ he insisted. ‘I am sure that the Treasury will be gearing up to make sure we can deliver this.’ If unable to impose the tax that early, Mr Balls said Labour would will legislate for the mansion tax to start in the following financial year, 2016-17, ‘as a backstop’. Labour’s mansion tax will be about £3,000 a year for homes in the £2m to £3m bracket, with far higher annual charges running into tens of thousands of pounds for more expensive properties. The proposal has been criticised by most of the Labour MPs in the running to be the next Mayor of London, given the capital will bear the brunt of the tax. Critics warned Labour would not be able to see the revenues from such changes so quickly after the election . The Conservatives have branded it a ‘homes tax’ and predict it will quickly be extended to cover cheaper properties to raise the forecast revenues. Chancellor George Osborne dramatically increased stamp duty on properties worth more than £1m in the autumn statement, meaning those buying the most expensive homes face a double whammy if Labour wins power and applies an annual mansion tax on top. The timing of Mr Balls’ announcement is aimed at out-manoeuvring claims the revenue from a mansion tax would not start flowing soon enough - jeopardising Labour’s pledge to spend £2.5bn more on the NHS than the Conservatives. The rest of the increase in spending would come from a levy on tobacco firms and reducing tax avoidance by hedge funds.","Ed Balls said Labour wanted to introduce tax at start of next financial year .

"The relatives of a baby boy who was brutally killed by his parents today condemned their short nine-year jail term as a ‘kick in the face’. Levi-Blu Cassin, of Smith's Wood, Birmingham, died as a result of horrific abdominal injuries ‘consistent with being hit by a car or falling from a three-storey building’. But, following a five-week trial, his parents Danielle Cassin, 27, and Mark Piper, 31, were both cleared of murder and manslaughter after a jury was unable to pinpoint which one had dealt the fatal blows. Scroll down for video . Defendants: Following a five-week trial, parents Danielle Cassin (left), 27, and Mark Piper (right), 31, were both cleared of murder and manslaughter after a jury was unable to pinpoint which one had dealt the fatal blows . They were sentenced to just nine years in prison at Birmingham Crown Court yesterday for causing, or allowing, the 22-month-old’s death in February last year. Levi-Blu’s grandmother, Angela Cassin, told today how the boy’s family are ‘devastated and disgusted’ by the sentence and condemned social services for failing to prevent his death. She said: ‘No amount of justice will bring him back – but nine years is like a kick in the face. We’ve just lost so much. 'We don’t know the truth – and we’re never going to know the truth. We’re forever having different scenarios running through our heads.’ During the trial Cassin – a known drug addict - from Chelmsley Wood in Solihull, West Midlands, and Piper, of no fixed address, blamed each other for the death of their son. A year after his death, the pair remained together and refused to tell police of the drugs and violence that plagued their son’s life. Death: Levi-Blu Cassin (left), died as a result of  injuries 'consistent with being hit by a car or falling from a three-storey building'. Also pictured (right) is a memorial garden set up in his grandmother's back garden . To this day neither has revealed how he suffered his ‘major internal injuries’ - comparable to those seen after car crashes or falls from two or three storeys. Throughout the trial the court heard how Cassin would take her son to crack dens where she would take Class A drugs for hours at a time. And Piper was painted as a violent bully who regularly beat her. The drugs and violence at their flat prompted neighbours and friends to call Solihull Social Services and police. But Levi was never taken away from his parents. A Serious Case Review - to be published in the spring - is now investigating whether police and social services failed to protect the boy. In a statement issued yesterday, following the verdict, Levi-Blu’s family said: ‘We refuse to let Levi-Blu be another sad statistic that we only remember when another poor innocent child is murdered. ‘This was a tragedy that could have been prevented if the right steps had been taken by the various agencies responsible for the care and protection of our beautiful angel.’ On camera: A CCTV video of Cassin spotted trading goods at a second-hand store in Chelmsley Wood, West Midlands, while Levi was alone with Piper in their flat. The footage was shown to jurors in court . Family: (From left) Levi-Blu's uncle Tyler Cassin, aunt Kirsty Cassin, grandmother Angela Cassin and uncle Kurtis Cassin . Mrs Cassin, 47, who lives around the corner from where her daughter and grandson lived, said yesterday: ‘Danielle could have said anything to me and I would have helped her. ‘She could have just given me Levi, and said she was having problems - I would have taken him. I always believe life is about choices and this is what she chose to do. Levi had no choices.’ She added: ‘I just want the world to love him and know how much he was loved.’ Birmingham Crown Court heard how Cassin phoned for an ambulance after her son stopped breathing at around 4.30am on the morning of his death. Paramedics arrived at the couple’s flat to find him lying on the floor between the cot and his mother’s bed. Prosecutor Timothy Raggatt QC said the lifeless child’s eyes were open but his lips had turned blue and his heart was not beating. He was rushed to hospital on blue lights but was pronounced dead at around 5.30am on February 20 last year. Memorial garden:  The drugs and violence at the boy's flat prompted neighbours and friends to call Solihull Social Services and police. But Levi was never taken away from his parents . 'Devastated and disgusted': Levi-Blu's aunt Kirsty Cassin (left) and grandmother Angela Cassin (right) Mr Raggatt said: ‘The totality of the injuries was so severe that they could not have happened by accident, they are the result of at least one very substantial blow to the abdomen and maybe more. ‘The injury was sustained at least six hours, and maybe up to 12 hours, before the 999 call was put in asking for assistance. ‘The defendants are charged jointly with murder because this has to have occurred as a result of cooperation between the two of them. ‘It was a joint enterprise. One person can do the damage, but if the other supports or connives then they are guilty too.’ Following yesterday's verdict, Edwina Grant, chair of the Solihull Local Safeguarding Children Board, said a review was underway. ‘We would like to offer our sincere condolences to the family of Levi-Blu,’ she said. ‘I can confirm Solihull Local Safeguarding Children Board is carrying out a serious case review, the final results of which will be published in the spring.’","Levi-Blu Cassin, 22 months, died as result of horrific abdominal injuries .

"Marion Badea has been jailed for five years after he was found trying to smuggle eight Afghan nationals  on an inflatable boat on the English Channel . A Romanian man who made a 'brazen attempt' to smuggle a group of Afghan nationals into the UK on a small inflatable boat has been jailed. Seven men, aged between 20 and 35, and a 16-year-old boy, from Afghanistan, were discovered on the boat with Marion Badea when a lifeboat was sent out to rescue them because the vessel's engine had failed. The group were found in the English Channel, just five miles from Dover, and had been trying to enter the UK illegally. Badea, 30, was convicted of assisting unlawful entry into the UK and was jailed for five years. He had previously served nine months in a French prison last year for a similar offence. Crew aboard a passing P&O ferry alerted the Coastguard after spotting the small craft in difficulty in June this year and the RNLI and Border Force officials went to the scene. The 50hp engine on board the boat had failed and the boat was drifting dangerously close to shipping lanes. Crews from the RNLI  set up a tow to the  boat and then a Border Force cutter vessel took over and brought the boat and its nine occupants to Dover lifeboat station, with the RNLI crew providing an escort. Badea was arrested and charged with assisting unlawful entry into the UK. He was convicted after a two day trial at Canterbury Crown Court. All those found on board the boat were removed from the UK apart from the teenager who was transferred into the care of social services, according to the Home Office. David Fairclough, assistant director of the Home Office immigration enforcement criminal investigations team, said: 'This was an unsophisticated and brazen attempt to smuggle illegal immigrants into the UK. 'Thanks to the excellent interception made by the cutter patrol boat, and the subsequent investigation by our specialist criminal investigations team, Badea is now behind bars. 'Anyone thinking of doing the same should be warned that our specialist teams have the capability and resources to catch you and bring you to justice.' The small boat was seen drifting dangerously close to shipping lanes in the Channel, five miles from Dover . The group of nine were towed to the shore after a boat passing the inflatable craft radioed the Coastguard . It was towed to the shore by crews from the RNLI and Border Force who then arrested Badea on the shore . The Home Office's immigration enforcement criminal investigations team is a specialist unit of seconded police officers working alongside warranted Home Office immigration enforcement officers to investigate organised immigration crime. A ship worker, who witnessed the drama, said at the time: 'They could easily have been run over by a large tanker and they must have set off during darkness so it was incredibly risky.' None of the group needed medical attention after the incident.","Marion Badea tried to smuggle Afghan nationals into UK in inflatable boat .

"Missed chance: Joe Lewis, 59, walked into a police station after apparently receiving death threats . Detectives missed a chance to arrest a currency trader wanted over an alleged £130million fraud, it has emerged. Joe Lewis, 59, walked into a police station earlier this month after apparently receiving death threats in the wake of telling clients his business had gone bust. But he has since vanished, leaving scores of angry investors – rumoured to include professional footballers and golfers – fearful they have lost all their money. The British businessman sent them an email on December 3 warning they would not receive any more payments because his company had stopped operating. He admitted his company stopped trading foreign currency in 2009 after suffering 'substantial losses' – but he continued taking investors' cash for the next five years. It is thought he may have used the new money to pay 'profits' to existing clients in a form of Ponzi scheme. Three days after sending the email, Mr Lewis walked into a Humberside police station. He told officers he had received death threats over the collapse of his investment business, according to one investor. But he was allowed to walk away because police were still deciding whether it was 'suitable' to make any arrests in the alleged fraud case. Mr Lewis is rumoured to have fled to Thailand, where he has business interests. Hull-born father-of-two Mr Lewis started his company JL Trading about a decade ago. The businessman's JL Trading website had a message yesterday saying it is 'no longer trading' (above) At its peak he employed about 30 staff in Istanbul. More than 800 people, most of them British, are thought to have invested money in his schemes. Many investors, some of whom are in their 70s and 80s, are facing financial ruin after handing over their life savings. One 57-year-old man who invested £570,000 in November 2012 fears he may only get £10,000 of the money back. The investor, who did not want to be named, said: ‘It’s all my retirement savings, every penny of it. I‘ve lost nearly half my net worth. I’m not bankrupt but I’m desperate. ‘Obviously my life is completely changed in view of what’s happened. The whereabouts of Joe Lewis, who traded from a luxury apartment overlooking the Bosphorus in Istanbul (pictured), is currently unknown after he apparently fled the Turkish city. He has not been heard from since . ‘There are other people who are in their mid-70s, and they have been left with literally nothing.’ A Humberside Police spokesman said: ‘On Saturday December 6, 2014, a 59-year-old East Yorkshire man voluntarily assisted the police with an investigation into alleged fraud offences. ‘When he left the police station the case was still being assessed for suitability of arrest. ‘Humberside Police are currently working with City of London Police Serious Fraud Office in connection with the alleged offences.’","Joe Lewis, 59, left scores of angry investors fearful they lost life savings .

"David Miliband secretly plotted to hand Shaker Aamer to the Saudi Arabian authorities while leading his family to believe he was seeking to bring him back to the UK . David Miliband secretly plotted to hand Shaker Aamer to the hardline Saudi Arabian authorities while leading his British family to believe he was seeking to bring him back to the UK. Documents obtained by the Daily Mail show the Labour government was involved in negotiations to transfer the father of four from Guantanamo to the Arab kingdom in spite of serious concerns he would face torture. This was despite assurances that then foreign secretary Mr Miliband – the brother of current Labour leader Ed – was lobbying for his return to Britain. Mr Aamer’s lawyers claim the intention was to silence their client – who claims to have witnessed torture in the presence of a British security official. He has been held without charge at the controversial naval facility in Cuba since 2002 on suspicion of being a terrorist with close links to Osama bin Laden, which he vehemently denies. Although he has twice been cleared for release by the US, his detention has been extended as American officials insist he must go back to Saudi Arabia where he was born, rather than re-join his family in Britain. Mr Aamer, who is legally resident in the UK, has repeatedly refused to be dumped in the Middle Eastern emirate. He fears he will be incarcerated in its brutal prison system, where ill-treatment is routine. As a terror suspect who had committed the criminal offence of marrying a foreign woman without permission, he would almost certainly be imprisoned there, his supporters say. Mr Aamer, 46, from Wandsworth in South London, claims he was abused in Afghanistan by having his head smashed against a wall in the presence of a British MI6 officer known as ‘John’. He also says he has been beaten and deprived of sleep. In public, the Foreign Office and Home Office assured the detainee’s 39-year-old British wife, Zinneera, that Mr Miliband and then home secretary Jacqui Smith were lobbying to have him returned to the UK. In a letter dated August 2007, she was told the Cabinet ministers had requested the return to the UK of five terror suspects held at Guantanamo Bay, including her husband. By November that year, however, the FO informed her that talks with the US had broken down amid concerns Mr Aamer was a security risk. Scroll down for video . Shaker Aamer has been held without charge at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility since 2002 . It stated: ‘In light of the US position, we are no longer in active negotiations with regards to your husband’s transfer to the UK.’ But behind the scenes, government departments – including the FO, Cabinet Office, Home Office and intelligence and security services – were plotting with the US and the Saudis to have him handed to the authoritarian regime in Riyadh. One heavily redacted note, summarising a visit by officials to the US in October 2007, drummed home the need to ‘arrange for a member of the London delegation to stay on in Washington to attend a trilateral discussion with Saudi colleagues on Aamer’. It added: ‘It would be helpful to have confirmation from the US of what had been agreed with the Saudis with respect to Aamer’s potential treatment on his return.’ Then a note from March 2008 revealed the Home Office had agreed to ‘draft a form of words for the Saudis to give assurance that the UK will not to seek to extradite Aamer if he goes to Saudi Arabia.’ It is the first time details have been revealed that show Britain was actively embroiled in plans to transfer Mr Aamer to Saudi, a country that regularly tortures prisoners. But it is not the first time that Mr Miliband has been in the spotlight over torture allegations. He was forced to apologise to Parliament over the use of the British overseas territory of Diego Garcia for US extraordinary rendition flights and tried to suppress alleged MI6 collusion in the torture of another Guantanamo inmate, Binyam Mohamed. The detainee's British wife was told the Cabinet ministers had requested the return to the UK of five terror suspects held at Guantanamo Bay (file picture of Guantanamo Bay) But behind the scenes, government departments were plotting to have Aamer sent to Saudi Arabia . Last night Clive Stafford Smith, of human rights charity Reprieve, who represents Mr Aamer, said: ‘It is shocking to hear that Britain was stabbing Shaker Aamer in the back seven years ago and explains why the Americans made this unique effort to send him to Saudi Arabia. ‘The people who really did not want to see him back in Britain were the Blairites, including Mr Miliband, because they sanctioned the transfers to Guantanamo Bay where detainees were tortured.’ Andy Worthington, the co-ordinator of the We Stand With Shaker pressure group, said: ‘It is convenient for the US and UK to have Shaker somewhere he can’t talk – in Saudi Arabia.’ Saudi-born Mr Aamer moved to London almost 20 years ago and married, securing leave to remain in Britain. In 2001 he was detained in Kabul after, his representatives claim, going to Afghanistan to carry out peaceful voluntary work for an Islamic charity. His supporters say he was captured by bounty hunters, handed to the US military for $5,000 and then tortured at a secret ‘black site’ prison – effectively a dungeon – at Bagram air force base. He was then sent to Guantanamo Bay in February 2002, where he remains. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘Mr Aamer’s case is high priority for the UK Government and we continue to make clear to the US that we want him released and returned to the UK as a matter of urgency. ‘Any decision regarding Mr Aamer’s release ultimately remains in the hands of the US Government.’","David Miliband secretly plotted to hand Shaker Aamer to Saudi Arabia .

"With dishes including brown rice salad,  chipotle pulled pork and balsamic strawberry soda you may expect to be sitting in a hipster cafe in the inner-city. But this trendy lunch spot in  Sydney's Camperdown is actually a McDonald's, the first McCafe in the world to re-brand as 'The Corner'. The global fast food giant - best known for Big Macs, cheeseburgers and Happy Meals - is using the restaurant as a testing ground to trial different gourmet menu items as it undergoes a $1 billion remodelling. Scroll down for video . McDonald's has re-branded its McCafe in Camperdown, Sydney to be called 'The Corner' McDonald's says it is a 'learning lab' where the fast food giant will test out never before seen menu items . The Corner is a world first for McDonald's, and could pave the way for a drastic rebranding of McCafe stores . Menu items include salads featuring Moroccan chicken breast, chipotle pulled pork, brown rice and lentils . The cafe has a menu board that changes daily, but is built around a base of salads and brown rice. These can be customised with ingredients like Morroccan roast chicken breast and a range of sauces including chutneys and chimichurri. Field service manager Cameron Newlands said the café also serves smoothies and craft sodas, along with the more traditional McCafe menu items such as coffees, desserts and pastries. 'We also do the breakfast bacon egg roll, avocado and feta on sourdough, we are trying to be a lot more in line with the café trend,' he said. The new McCafe is just 600 metres away from King St, Newtown, where McDonald's famously shut its doors in 1998 because locals wanted more organic and natural food. The cafe also serves up coffee made by baristas, as well as cakes and pastries . Pictured is the new 'The Corner' cafe, on Missenden Road in Camperdown in Sydney's inner west . Pictured is the same restaurant when it was a McCafe.  The fast food giant is undergoing a $1 billion overhaul . The re-branded McCafe comes after McDonald's announced a new gourmet menu in October, which it hopes will take the fast food chain upmarket. Customers will be able to build their own burger from scratch from a range of ingredients, while some restaurants will offer table service. To hold it all together, the burgers will even come with toothpicks holding them together, just like they do in more trendy eateries. This new menu will be rolled out to McDonald's customers in Australia over the next six months after the fancy new range was launched in Sydney. The Create Your Taste gourmet burgers  will be rolled out in all restaurants over the next six to nine months . Customers will also treated to table service, allowing them to sit down and enjoy a drink while they wait for their creation to be made and brought to their table . McDonald's Australia boss Andrew Gregory told Daily Mail Australia that customers have driven the overhaul. The company is in the throes of a $1billion remodelling, which will introduce more of its Australian fast-food restaurants over the next five years. The 'create your own gourmet burger' offers 19 different fillings served on wooden platters with a side of fries in a basket, complete with table service. Customers can order their customised burgers on a digital touch-screen menu which also offers up never seen before choices at McDonald's such as guacamole, tortilla chips and a range of other sauces. The new create your own gourmet burgers will offer 19 different fillings served on wooden platters with a side of fries in a basket . Mr Gregory revealed there are plans for three more so-called 'Customer Learning Labs' will open this year, with a further ten planned in early 2015 before a full roll out. The first at McDonald's to trial the revamped menu and service will be Castle Hill in Sydney's north-west. 'We will build another three of these before the end of the year and test and learn and listen to our customers,' he said. 'We plan to do it over the next 12 months in every restaurant around Australia.' Aside from the gourmet burgers, digital self-service kiosks and menu boards, McDonald's will also include home delivery as part of the service. 'McDonald's is innovating and changing again to meet the needs of our customers,' Mr Gregory said. The 'create your own burgers' range will be offered across Australia in the next six to nine months . 'All of our innovations have been led by Australians. What we're really doing here is just what our customers have asked us to do. 'An important part of our new learning lab restaurants is that we take customers along the journey with us and get their feedback - we want to make sure Maccas restaurants of the future are what Aussies ordered.' Mr Gregory said there will also be a change in the working culture and how staff interact with customers. Australia's love of McDonald's began when the first fast-food restaurant opened in Yagoona is Sydney's south-west in 1971. There are about 930 McDonald's restaurants across Australia which serves more than 1.7 million customers a day and employ up to 90,000 people. There will also be table service for customers and home deliveries for 'create your own burgers' customers .","McDonald's has re-branded its McCafe in Camperdown as 'The Corner'

"A Boxing Day 'weather bomb' is set to batter Britain bringing rain and winds to much of the UK,as people traditionally set off to see family and friends on the day after Christmas. Forecasters said there is still a lot of uncertainty about the weather for the festive period, with hopes of a white Christmas dashed for much of the country. The UK is likely to see a crisp, cold but dry Christmas morning and a frosty start to Boxing Day before rain and wind arrives in the afternoon as a strong weather front sweeps across from the west to east of the country. Scroll down for video . Strong winds and rain were seen on the coast of Cleveleys, Lancashire, as forecasters warned of a Boxing Day weather bomb on the way . An area of low pressure, coming in from across the Atlantic, is expected to sweep across western and eastern Britain bringing heavy rain . Temperatures are expected to dip below freezing and heavy downpours could case travel problems, particularly in the north which has already been drenched by rain this week. Met Office forecasters said they expect a 'rapid cyclogenesis' - or weather bomb - on Boxing Day, defined as a rapid drop in pressure over a 24 hour period. Leon Brown, forecaster for The Weather Channel UK, said the falling pressure is likely to create unsettled conditions for December 26. He said: 'We will see some explosive cyclogenesis in the North Atlantic and a rapidly deepening area of low pressure approaching north Scotland. 'Pressure actually falling by nearly 50mb from Friday to Saturday so we can call the system the Boxing Day Bomb.' Met Office forecasters said it was too early to calculate the actual expected dip in pressure, but confirmed they did expect it to decrease over Boxing Day. A 'weather bomb', or cyclogenesis, is defined as an incident when the air pressure drops by 24millibars in 24 hours. Parts of Britain were battered by wind and rain when a similar 'weather bomb' hit earlier this month, . 'There will be a spell of wet and windy weather for most of the UK on Boxing Day,' said Helen Roberts, a forecaster at the Met Office. Christmas Eve and Christmas Day are likely to be bright and crisp, according to forecasters, before rain hits the country on Boxing Day . A graphic by the Met Office shows rain is forecast to hit Northern Ireland and North East England today, with drivers urged to be cautious . 'Generally there will be a bright cold start in most areas before an area of low pressure, which could be more prominent than we are used to, is expected to move across the north part of the UK.' The low pressure will come in from the Atlantic, bringing wind and rain to the West on Friday afternoon and overnight and into Saturday morning for much of the East. And while the low pressure will bring a cold start to Christmas and Boxing Day mornings, the mercury is expected to dip further next week when it is likely to plunge to -6C for New Year's Eve. Warnings for rain have been issued for North England, Northern Ireland, North Wales and Scotland today after the north of the country was drenched by downpours in the last 24 hours. The warnings come as roads were twice as busy this lunchtime as the Christmas getaway began. There were 1238 miles of tailbacks on the roads, with 2265 congestion hotspots causing 154 hours of delays. The normal jam length at 1pm on a Tuesday at this time of year is 544 miles – so the roads were twice as busy as usual. In the Greater London area alone, the number of traffic hotspots was 690, whilst in Birmingham and surrounding areas there were 199 separate congestion hotspots. In Greater Manchester, however, there were just 32 hotspots. The nation was hit by strong winds and flash floods on Monday, with planes buffeted from side to side at Leeds Bradford Airport. Customers at an ASDA supermarket in Scotland had to be rescued after they became stranded by rising flood waters when the River Irvine burst its banks. Dozens of trains had to be cancelled, with severe disruptions to train services between Glasgow Central and Newcastle via Carlisle. In Lancashire heavy winds have been hammering the coast today, as Mimi the dog was blown along the path where more rain is forecast . Up to three inches of rain are forecast to fall in areas of the north of the UK today as temperatures are set to plummet on Christmas Day . Yellow weather warnings have been issued as up to two inches (50mm) of rain is expected to fall today, with up to three inches (80mm) expected in areas of Cumbria and the Pennines. Christmas Eve is expected to be a much drier but colder day, with crisp sunshine in the South East. In Scotland and parts of Northern Ireland there are likely to be showers, which could turn thundery as the day goes on. The mercury is expected to reach around 8C in the south and 4C in the north. Temperatures are expected to plummet to 2C or just below freezing over night, making for a cold and crisp Christmas morning. Ms Roberts added: 'It will be really quite a cold day with widespread frost, and temperatures could drop to -6C in the North overnight. 'There will be a decent start to Boxing Day. Most people won't start to see rain and strong winds until the afternoon, and in Eastern areas not until after dark. There is likely to be a lot of heavy and persistent rain. A graphic produced by magicseaweed shows the winds currently swirling across the UK which will pick up as Christmas week continues . A map shows the forecast of the forecast of wind over Britain at 3pm on Boxing Day (left) and will pick up by midnight on Boxing Day (right) 'It is being caused by a low pressure system coming in from the Atlantic. Cyclogenesis will happen over the Atlantic and this will spread to the UK. The jetstream directs this low pressure over the country.' Downpours are expected to spread across the width of the country, starting in the West on Friday afternoon and well into the evening. However forecasters said the rain is unlikely to be as heavy or as persistent as last year, when dozens of trains were cancelled and swathes of the Somerset Levels were plunged under water for months. By Saturday the low pressure will move across the East of the country and it is set to be windy for most of the day. By Sunday the drier and brighter weather is expected to return . A man dressed as Father Christmas is caught up in heavy spray while walking along the sea wall at Southsea in Hampshire on Monday . The emergency services had to send boats to help people who were stranded at a Kilmarnock branch of Asda on Monday . Bookmakers are offering odds of 12/1 against snow on Christmas Day in London, while the Met Office says the most that can be expected is 'sleety snow on higher ground', which is unlikely to settle. Some higher areas of Scotland and the north of England may see a light dusting of snow on Christmas morning as temperatures fall.

"More than 200 letters written by mass murderer Anders Breivik have been seized to stop him setting up a far-right  organisation from within his prison cell. Prison authorities have revealed they seized 220 of his letters because the correspondence showed he was attempting to establish himself as the 'frontman' of an organization prepared to use extreme violence. Breivik was responsible for the massacre of 77 people in 2011 after detonating a bomb in downtown Oslo and carrying out a mass shooting on Utoya Island. In 2011, Anders Breivik (pictured) carried out one of the worst atrocities ever seen in Norway when he massacred 77 people, many of whom were teenagers . Breivik makes a fascist salute during a court appearance in Norway. The far-right extremist has been attempting to build a political party from his prison cell . A written ruling stated: 'Breivik's intention is to consolidate his position as front man and leader figure for a movement that involves using extreme violence and terror as an instrument,' The Local reported. Yling Faeste, a spokesman for Norway's prison system, added: 'We have refused to send some letters from Breivik for reasons of security. We're talking about roughly 220 letters.' The right-wing, anti-muslim extremist was sentenced to 21 years' imprisonment with preventive detention in 2012. It the harshest possible prison sentence available under the Norwegian justice system and it is likely he will remain in prison for the rest of his life. Since his incarceration, Breivik has made increasingly desperate attempts to receive publicity, as well as issuing a number of bizarre demands. In February, he threatened to go on hunger strike unless prison authorities cave in to a list of demands for better conditions - including giving him a PlayStation 3. Emergency services work at the scene of the mass shooting on the island of Utoya, Norway . Breivik detonated a car bomb in downtown Oslo before shooting dozens on the island of Utoya. Pictured is the damage caused by the explosion . It emerged that he had issued a typed list of 12 demands to authorities at the high-security unit in Skien in southeast Norway where he is serving out his sentence. The demands - outlined in a letter sent to the the French national newsagency AFP  - included better conditions for his daily walk and the right to communicate more freely with the outside world, which he argues are in line with European rights legislation. He also demanded that his PlayStation 2 games console be upgraded to a Playstation 3 'with access to more adult games that I get to choose myself'. Held apart from other prisoners since 2011 for security reasons, Breivik argued in the letter sent in November, last year, that he has the right to a wider 'selection of activities' than other inmates to compensate for his strict isolation.","Mass murderer is trying to establish extremist uprising from his prison cell .

Teacher Dave Bulloch told the news channel how earlier this month Octavio had been walking around the school track aided by his walker when he looked up and saw a plane. 'And he asked me, is that a shooting star? And I said no buddy that's a plane, why do you ask? And he goes oh, cause I wanted to make a wish,' Mr Bulloch said.

"The designer behind Cathy Freeman's iconic white 2000 Sydney Olympic Games bodysuit has revealed a crucial identifying feature on her creation which could ultimately clarify if a recently found garment is the original. Jennifer Irwin has admitted that she had sewn the Olympic rings onto Freeman's suit upside down while rushing its completion the night before it was meant to be worn. 'I sewed the suit up around midnight when I was told who would be wearing it,' Ms Irwin told News.com.au . Scroll down for video . Cathy Freeman's bodysuit went missing in September 2000 from her dressing room at Stadium Australia . 'On the original one I sewed the Olympic rings upside down.' After the suit disappeared from Freeman's dressing room at Stadium Australia in September 2000, where the former athlete lit the Olympic torch in the white garment, Ms Irwin created a replica for display purposes. However, the minute detail could be crucial in identifying whether the item that was anonymously handed in to the Melbourne Cricket Club this week is the historical suit that mysteriously went missing over a decade ago. 'It has been a great mystery since 2000 and it is a suit that we all want to see again,' Australian Olympic Committee secretary-general Fiona de Jong told News.com.au. 'This is a pretty unique item of clothing. If it can be validated, we would like to see it celebrated and allow all Australians to see it.' The sporting champion wore it while she lit the Olympic torch at the games, where she later won a gold medal . A Victoria police spokesman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia an item had been handed over to them by a representative of the Melbourne Cricket Club at the Melbourne East station. 'The article was alleged to have been stolen in NSW in the year 2000,' he said. 'Police are attempting to confirm the authenticity of the item and are liaising with the NSW Police.' The Australian Olympic Committee have released a statement about the find. They said the MCC staff member had 'received it anonymously' and it would hopefully settle a lot of unanswered questions. 'On that night, Cathy was soaked while standing under a waterfall after a mechanical fault delayed the lighting of the cauldron,' the statement said. 'She removed the suit after the ceremony and it has not been seen since. 'What happened to the suit has been the subject of much debate over the years as it is a major part of Australia's Olympic history.

"An entire village will be  resettled in a bid to escape starving jungle tribesmen who keep raiding their homes for food and clothes. The Peruvian government has been forced to act after 200 members of the Mashco Piro tribe staged several raids on a local village in Peru stealing food and tools. Ministers said the attacks are  a sign that the indigenous people are feeling the effects of the modern world impacting on their food supply as loggers decimate their homeland. Scroll down for video . Attack: In the latest attack  homes were damaged by the men who also  stole cooking utensils, ropes and machetes as well as clothing . Relocation: Peru is planning to resettle an entire village after it was frequently raided by starving tribesmen, seen here, who have seen their rainforest habitat decimated by loggers . According to the Peruvian Interculture Ministry the tribesmen chose to steal from their village neighbours because they realised it would be easier than searching for food. The Ministry said it has become increasingly hard for the tribesmen to forage for food, leading to thefts and conflict between the two communities. In the latest attack, village homes were damaged by the men who also sacrificed domestic animals which they found. Meanwhile the tribesmen also stole cooking utensils, ropes, machetes, clothes, blankets and even mosquito nets from the villagers. The thefts forced the villagers from Monte Salvado in south-eastern Peru's Madre de Dios region to flee to the local police station for safety. Location: This map shows where the tribesmen live in Manu Park in the Madre de Dios Region in Peru . Theft: The attacks are seen as a sign that the indigenous people are feeling the effects of the modern world impacting on the food supply, as it has become harder to forage, leading them to steal from their neighbours . However, the ministry warned that there were likely to be further raids on the isolated region and confirmed they are now planning to move the villagers to a new location to avoid further conflicts. The Mashco-Piro are an indigenous tribe of nomadic hunter-gatherers who inhabit the remote regions of the Amazon rainforest. They live in Manu Park in the Madre de Dios Region in Peru. They have, in the past, actively avoided contact with non-native people. Choosing instead to live in voluntary isolation in Peru's south-eastern Amazon. But last year, they sparked concern by  making contact with the outside world for the second time since 2011, on the river hamlet. Patricia Balbuena, the Minister for Interculture,  said: 'We have in the meantime provided emergency assistance and compensation for the villagers although at this time of year and given the remote location it is difficult to get there.' However, it is not the first time an indigenous tribe has been involved in violent conflict with the modern world. The most violent raid was in 2010, when a local was brought to hospital in a critical state after being shot with an arrow in the belly by a tribe member. The Mashco Piro are a hunter-gatherer tribe who live in the Amazon forest. They were one of several tribes designated by the government as 'uncontacted people'. The government forbids direct contact with them because the tribes' immune systems are not thought to be able to cope with the type of germs carried by other Peruvians. They live a largely isolated life, but sporadically make contact with some of their modern neighbours such as the villagers of Monte Salvado.","At least 200 members of the Mashco Piro tribe carried out the raid for food .

"Albert Hickman was convicted of raping the girl in the 1970s, while his wife Carolee (pictured together outside an earlier court hearing) was found guilty of indecent assault and aiding and abetting rape . A couple who used 'black magic' to force an 11-year-old schoolgirl to take part in sex sessions have been found guilty of historical sex offences. Albert John Hickman, 65, of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, was convicted of raping the girl between 1972 and 1975 at the couple's former home in Athan near Cardiff. His wife, Carolee, 64, was found guilty of indecently assaulting the schoolgirl and aiding and abetting rape. Cardiff Crown Court heard how she held the schoolgirl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, down by the arms while her husband repeatedly raped her. She also told the victim that she was part of a powerful witches' coven and had a special 'bejewelled knife' which she used to cut her victim's thumb before sucking her blood, the court heard. The pair also talked to the girl about black magic and did tarot card readings, the jury was told. The couple were found guilty by a majority verdict yesterday after the jury deliberated for five hours. As Judge Daniel Williams remanded the pair in custody, Carolee sobbed into her hand and shouted 'No!' from across the courtroom. Her husband loudly protested as he was taken down to the cells. Both Carolee and former RAF man Albert, who were previously jailed for five years for sex abuse, had denied the charges. The victim, now in her 50s, said she had blocked out memories of the abuse for almost four decades until they came back during counselling for bereavement and depression in 2011. She earlier told the court that she went to the couple's home, aged 11, but was soon being terrified into submission. She said: 'Carolee said she was a witch and would come and get me and would make my mother ill. 'She even said she could kill my mother if she wanted to. 'She had a knife with a jewelled handle kept in a wooden box with carvings on the top. 'She cut my hand and sucked the blood out of it. 'There were tarot cards, she used to tell our fortunes and she even had a black cape.' The victim said she and friends visited Carolee because she would allow them to smoke and even drink while her husband was away working. 'I was on the bed when she held my arms while he [Albert Hickman] raped me,' she said. Cardiff Crown Court (above) heard how Carolee, 64, used 'black magic' to force the girl into submission while her husband repeatedly raped her. The pair were found guilty by jury and will be sentenced in January . The court was told how Carolee laughed out loud when police asked if she was a witch. 'I've got books on spells but I wouldn't know how to do them - I wouldn't know where to start', she told police officers conducting interviews with her. A large number of books on spells and the occult were found when officers arrested the pair at their home in Shropshire. Carolee said she had no idea of the identity of the woman now making the complaint and did not recognise her when shown photographs taken when the victim was young. Her husband, who described his abuse of other girls in a way that prosecuting counsel Michael Jones described as 'chilling', had denied the rape charge. The couple, who divorced in 1985 but have since remarried, were remanded in custody ahead of a sentencing hearing in January.","Albert John Hickman, 65, found guilty of raping 11-year-old schoolgirl .

"Boris Johnson has urged people to take a taxi to hospital - instead of calling an ambulance. The London Mayor said those with minor fractures or sprains should take themselves to A&E to keep ambulances for emergencies. Mr Johnson’s remarks come amid growing pressure on accident and emergency wards even before the expected surge of alcohol-fuelled injuries over Christmas and New Year. London Mayor Boris Johnson said people with minor fractures or sprains should take themselves to A&E to keep ambulances for emergencies . The London mayor told the Evening Standard: ‘The message is simple - celebrate responsibly and only call an ambulance in a genuine emergency.’ Emergency call-outs in the capital are already 16 per cent higher this month than in December 2013. Some ambulances are being held up waiting to offload sick patients at overstretched A&Es, which are struggling to cope with the increasing number of people dialling 999 for help rather than waiting to see their family doctor. Mr Johnson said: ‘The London Ambulance Service is doing an incredible job responding to Londoners at an increasingly busy time of year. ‘That demand puts huge pressure on the men and women in the front line, emergency service operators, paramedics, ambulance technicians, police officers, firefighters and staff on our public transport network. ‘Over the festive period and across the winter I know the public will heed the emergency services calls for restraint when it comes to calling an ambulance.’ Labour said Mr Johnson’s call reflected an underlying crisis in the NHS. Labour said Mr Johnson’s call reflected an underlying crisis in the NHS . Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘People should be responsible but London’s ambulance service needs more help than this from senior Tories. ‘This is a crisis of their making and it is no good trying to blame the public. ‘All year, ambulances in the capital have failed to get to the most critical calls in time and the service is struggling without enough paramedics.’ Mr Burnham's remarks come amid warnings A&E departments face being overwhelmed at Christmas by lonely, elderly people, Britain’s most senior casualty doctor said last night. The warning from Professor Keith Willett came as Care Minister Norman Lamb urged Britons to care for isolated neighbours to prevent the UK becoming a ‘neglectful society’. Professor Willett, the director for acute care for NHS England, said the impact of loneliness on older people could cause a major spike in admissions to A&E. Studies show sick people left alone over the festive period are more likely to go to casualty with worse problems. He urged any who are ill to call their pharmacist, GP or the NHS 111 helpline for advice, adding: ‘Don’t end up in A&E please.’ A&E departments are in crisis. Fewer than 90 per cent of patients were seen within four hours at casualty in the week up to December 14 – the worst week on record. Last night, the charity Age UK warned that nearly 400,000 people aged at least 65 were worried about being lonely this Christmas. In England, 51 per cent of all people over 75 live alone and 5million older people say the television is their main companion. Recent town hall cuts mean more councils are only sending carers round for 15-minute visits, even though this is often a pensioner’s only contact in a week. Research shows loneliness and social isolation are harmful to physical health. Studies indicate that lack of social connections is as likely to cause early death as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.","The London Mayor said people with minor fractures  should call a cab .

They also added that most of all their other items had been cut to the wrong measurements, meaning the new kitchen would not fit. Their cooker is due to arrive tomorrow but there are no fitters around to install the kitchen for at least five weeks - well into the new year. Without an oven or a hob, Miss Sutton is now unable to cook Christmas dinner for the 12 people her and her fiance Alfie Johnson had invited to their new home . Miss Sutton, a beautician said: 'The kitchen was fitted and plans were drawn up so we couldn’t believe it when they said it wouldn’t fit. 'We found out cupboards were much bigger than they were supposed to be and the Homebase worker had not taken into account the size of the pipes. 'We’ve been having takeaway and ready meals everyday. Homebase said they would pay for that but we don’t have money to pay for them in the first place. 'I’ve rung the man who I drew up the plans and who came to measure the kitchen 46 times but he still hasn’t called me back. 'I took it further and we had a meeting with Homebase and I’ve called them every day but they have haven’t apologised. 'They’re quick enough to sell a kitchen but act completely evasive when it all goes wrong. I’m devastated. 'At any other time than Christmas I’d be a bit understanding but we’ve just bought a house and want our friends and family to enjoy Christmas with us. 'I wanted to cook for them in my new kitchen but now I don’t know what to do. 'At the moment it just looks like Christmas is cancelled.' The couple had invited both of their parents, Mr Johnson's two sisters and their partners and three children as well as one family friend to spend Christmas Day with them. The group had all wanted to be together and none of the other family homes are big enough. Miss Sutton has already bought most of her family's Christmas dinner, which is being kept in a freezer - but it cannot be cooked without an oven and now looks set to go to waste. Though Homebase have admitted fault, the couple say they have been 'arrogant' and 'unapologetic' and have ruined their Christmas. A Homebase spokeswoman said: 'Homebase would like to sincerely apologise to Miss Sutton and Mr Johnson for the issues they have experienced with the delivery of their new kitchen. 'We have spoken to the customer and are working with them and the third party delivery firm to ensure the problem is resolved as soon as possible.'","Katie Sutton and Alfie Johnson paid £6,000 for new Homebase kitchen .

"A decade on from the 2004 tsunami, this collection of personal possessions offers a tragic reminder of the 230,000 people killed when 30m-high waves barreled through Indian Ocean coastal communities. As the tenth anniversary of a disaster which devastated large parts of Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka and India approaches, Thai police have allowed the contents of hundreds of individual bags of possessions to be photographed. Each picture, representing the possessions found on a single victim of the tragedy, provides a poignant snapshot of the lives of the 5,300 people killed on Thai beaches. Scroll down for video . Pictured is a cellphone and SIM card that were found alongside keys and a bracelet on the body of one of the tsunami victims . Another person died carrying this bumbag, inside which there were keys, a watch, jewellery, a pen and some documents . Since 2011, hundreds of these bags have been kept in a 12m by 3m shipping container by police in Phang Nga, Thailand. Included are the common and everyday items - such as watches, jewellery and cellphones - victims were carrying when the disaster struck. And as the anniversary approaches, seismologists are reflecting on the lessons learnt and improvements made, and look to obstacles ahead. On December 26, 2004, the region lacked a co-ordinated Indian Ocean tsunami warning system, and awareness of tsunamis among the general public was low. Now, education, communication and infrastructure have improved to better deal with such a disaster. An earthquake is 'an emerging rupture of crust', says Daniel Jaksa, co-director of the Joint Australian Tsunami Warning Centre. 'In this case, it started south of Banda Aceh and finished just near the area of Myanmar,' he says. About 230,000 people were killed by the tsunami, with coastlines in 12 countries devastated, including Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Maldives, Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, Somalia, Tanzania, Seychelles, Bangladesh and Kenya. The extensive rupture produced the equivalent of two million atomic blasts of energy being released over 10 minutes across 1200km of the tectonic plate boundary, Mr Jaksa said. This Nokia cellphone was found alongside a watch, earrings and a headband on the body of a victim in Thailand . Many of those killed in the devastating tsunami were carrying very little when the waves hit. This person had only a bracelet and rings . This victim was carrying a red coin purse when the waves hit. They were also wearing a watch, several items of jewellery, and a religious trinket . A watch and a light-green bracelet were found with a piece of paper and necklace on the body of this person killed by the 2004 tsunami . Such a consequence does not bode well for people living on coasts near where one tectonic plate slides under another, which is the typical point where tsunamis are generated. 'If an earthquake occurs under your feet and you're on the coast, then a tsunami's upon you in very short time frames - 10 to 15 minutes,' Mr Jaksa, of Geoscience Australia, says. 'That's how long it takes for us to analyse an earthquake and issue a tsunami warning.' Although earthquakes are unpredictable, he says people away from the epicentre have time to receive a warning and act. 'People who feel an earthquake on the coast shouldn't be hanging around on the coast. They should be going inland and uphill ... as quickly as possible. That means run. Don't drive a car,' he said. Pictured are several necklaces featuring Buddhist symbols. More than 5,300 people in Thailand died when the earthquake and tsunami struck .

"The devastated 11-year-old girl who was forced to shut down her lemonade stand by a local council got up at 4am to cook fresh goods for the stall and lay out furniture to make it look like a cafe. Chelsea Ruderforth, whipped up a delicious range of treats to sell on a quiet country road near her house to make some money before Christmas but someone reported her to the red-tape enforcers at Bunbury City Council, in Western Australia. The council complained the food she was selling was 'high risk' and that she 'set up a marquee with a couch, chairs and tables in a location where it was unsafe for passing vehicles to pull over safely'. 'It is such a sad day when a kid can't make a bit of extra cash just selling a few cupcakes and lemonade,' Chelsea's mother Marissa told 720 ABC Perth. Scroll down for video . Chelsea Ruderforth's lemonade stall was shut down by Bunbury City Council in WA . Lemon meringue pie, lemon butter cupcakes and fresh organic lemonade were all on offer from ‘11am until sold out’ on 19 December, said the girl in a handwritten poster which was shared on social media to drum up business. But someone reported her entrepreneurial plans to the council before the sale had even begun and before she'd even served her first customer. Her outraged mother posted on Facebook that her daughter had her pop-up stall shut down by the council. 'We had our four-wheel-drive with a fridge, we had ice - everyone is aware what you need to do with food,' Ms Ruderforth told the ABC. An entrepreneurial 11-year-old girl made this poster to advertise her goods before her stall was shutdown . Environmental health manager at Bunbury City Council, Sarah Upton, told The West Australian the girl’s stall was ‘high risk’. ‘Unfortunately the stall was selling food without a permit and the young girl in charge was preparing food without approval,’ Ms Upton explained. The council worker also complained that the girl had no ‘temperature control’ and her location was posing a problem for cars to pull over safely on the side of Brittain Road. On Tuesday, Ms Upton told the ABC that Chelsea would have to look at making her food in a commercial kitchen if she wanted to try again.

"The temporary installation of new outdoor urinals along a party street has been met with revolt. For more than 10 years, Gold Coast City Council has been trying to manage public urination in Surfers Paradise's busy nightclub strip and hope these portable toilets will be the answer. The loos are aimed at longtime perpetrators - believed to be drunken men - who have been relieving themselves in front of businesses and alleyways, one councillor told Daily Mail Australia. But when two blocks of portable urinals were put up on Friday night, locals were 'disgusted' and 'offended' by what they could see. Three blocks of portable urinals were put up in Surfers Paradise on Friday night as part of a one week trial by Gold Coast City Council . Council says they are trying to find ways to deter drunken men from urinating in front of shops and alleyways . Councillor Lex Bell says public urination along Cavill Mall and Orchid Avenue in Surfers Paradise, southeastern Queensland, has been an issue for 10 to 12 years. 'We've had drunk people urinating in shop fronts, on windows and all over footpaths for a long time now,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I don't like the urinals either but they're are less offensive than the alternative. 'These urinals are just a way for us to manage the problem as council simply doesn't have the power to arrest people who urinate in public.' To deter drunken men from having a tinkle in inappropriate places, council put up two blocks of portable loos on Friday night. The podiums are designed so up to three men are able to use them at the same time. But since they were installed, council have been receiving public backlash from Gold Coast locals. Among them include Richard Holliday who took to social media to express his detestation for the public conveniences. 'Merry Christmas from Surfers Paradise. Disgusting public loos greet millions of visitors and residents,' he tweeted on Tuesday. 'At every level they are grossly wrong.' Cr Bell says many are also concerned about the design of the loos. 'They have modesty panels but I don't think they're big enough so tomorrow we're installing bigger shields which will approach the full body length,' he said. 'The urinals will only be operating between midnight and dawn so during other times they will be locked so people can't use them.' The toilets are on a one week trial and will be reviewed by council after December 26. Cr Bell says it's too early to judge whether the urinals have been successful. 'It's a seasonal issue for us, obviously becoming worse during this time of year,' he said. 'So Boxing Day will be the big test.'","Gold Coast City Council put up temporary outdoor urinals along its busy party street .

"A Honduran immigrant has taken refuge in a Philadelphia church to avoid deportation while her supporters work to gain legal status for her. Angela Navarro has lived in fear of being sent back to her native country for 10 years. Tired of running scared, Navarro sought sanctuary and moved into a spare room at West Kensington Ministry on November 18 with her family. Nine-year-old Mariana Mendoza had to give up her pink bedroom and bike when her family moved from a two-story rowhouse into the cramped church annex. Avoiding deportation: Angela Navarro has lived in fear of being sent back to her native country for 10 years so she sought sanctuary and moved into a spare room at West Kensington Ministry  with her family . Safe house: The West Kensington Ministry church in Philadelphia where Angela Navarro is seeking refuge with her family to avoid being deported back to Honduras . But that's OK with her — as long as her mom is safe. 'Because if she didn't move, maybe they could deport her,' Mariana said. Navarro, 28, speaking through an interpreter, said, 'The hardest part has been leaving my life behind — leaving my house, my job, the inability to do normal family things, like going out for a walk or going shopping.' Navarro is one of about a dozen U.S. immigrants who have recently taken shelter in churches, where authorities generally won't pursue enforcement actions. The cases are unfolding as President Barack Obama seeks to curb deportations starting next year, an effort many Republicans oppose. Immigration officials issued Navarro's final deportation order when she was 17. She had been picked up in 2003 while illegally trying to enter the United States to join her parents, who had received permission to live in the U.S. after Hurricane Mitch devastated Honduras. New Home: Angela Navarro who has been living in the U.S. with her American-born children despite a deportation order issued 10 years ago prepares dinner at the West Kensington Ministry church in Philadelphia . Sacrifice: Angela Navarro took sanctuary with her children and husband, a U.S. citizen, in the Philadelphia church to help her avoid being deported to her native Honduras . Navarro defied the order and began living in the shadows to stay with her family and then-newborn son. Yet the stress eventually became too much, and on November 18 she moved with her two children and husband, all U.S. citizens, into a renovated multipurpose room at West Kensington Ministry. The church, led by Adan Mairena, belongs to the nationwide Sanctuary 2014 coalition of about two dozen congregations willing to protect immigrants in danger of being deported. 'It's a way for us to act out our faith,' Mairena said. Since last summer, three immigrants in sanctuary have won government reprieves and two have left their churches because they felt safe, coalition spokesman Sidney Traynham said. Four besides Navarro remain in refuge in churches in Denver, Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona. Attorney Patricia Camuzzi Luber recently filed paperwork asking officials to suspend Navarro's deportation order and review her case in light of her marriage and Obama's executive actions, which could grant legal status to those who arrived in the U.S. as minors or who have American children. Because Navarro's case remains unsettled, she stayed at the church last week while supporters rallied outside Philadelphia's office for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Fighting to stay: Angela Navarro, right, who has been living in the U.S. with her American-born children despite a deportation order issued 10 years ago looks over a letter with New Sanctuary Movement community organizer . Her mother made a tearful plea, and Mariana presented officials with a stack of petitions supporting her mom's request to stay, including a letter from U.S. Rep. Bob Brady, a Democrat who represents part of the city. ICE officials wouldn't meet with the group but released a statement saying their agency 'remains focused on smart and effective immigration enforcement that prioritizes the removal of convicted criminals and recent border entrants.' Navarro doesn't fall under either category. Navarro's kids continue to attend school, and her husband still works as a truck driver, but Navarro won't leave the West Kensington property as she continues to organize her campaign with the help of the local New Sanctuary Movement. Her makeshift bedroom looks more like a glorified closet. A portable wall in the main area separates the kids' sleeping area from the crowded living room. Meals are prepared in the church's kitchen. Volunteers built a full bathroom before the family moved in. Mariana and her older brother Arturo, 11, aren't thrilled about sharing a room, but she sees the bright side. At their old house, Mariana saw her mom only in the morning because she worked late hours as a restaurant cook. 'I'm happy here,' Mariana said. 'Now, every day I can always see her.'

"NFL bid for Olympic Stadium ruled out . West Ham now frontrunners for anchor tenancy . Mayor confirms stadium unlikely to be ready until 2016 . UK Athletics chairman labels process a farce . West Ham have received a boost in their bid to move into the Olympic Stadium after the NFL's proposal to become anchor tenants was thrown out. The American gridiron franchise were willing to share the stadium with other sports and events but were told that they could not have the exclusive access to the venue each year from September to January which they felt they required to prepare and host consecutive games. In a further twist, Mayor Boris Johnson - the chairman of the London Legacy Development Corporation who operate the stadium - confirmed rumours that the stadium will not be re-opened until 2016 to be true. Up in the air: The future of the Olympic Stadium remains unclear . The Mayor said on Wednesday that it . was 'highly unlikely' that the stadium would be converted and ready for . use again before the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio - meaning, incredibly, . that it will take longer to convert the stadium than it did to build it. The delay in re-opening of the stadium has been branded 'a farce' by UK Athletics chairman Ed Warner. Warner said: 'My biggest concern is . that we have some major events planned for that stadium and we thought . they were going to be from the summer of 2014 onwards. 'All of the legacy use was scheduled . to start in two years' time and now it might be four years' time which . strikes me as ludicrous and to be a paralysis of decision-making which I . hope the mayor [Boris Johnson] is going to cut through. Close call: Upton Park is in the same borough as the Olympic Stadium but the NFL franchises are more than a short hop away . 'I wouldn't say this is a Whitehall farce but this is fast becoming a Stratford farce. 'We want to lock into the legacy of . the Games while people still remember the Mobot, Greg Rutherford, Jonnie . Peacock and David Weir. 'Let's have a bit of imagination here . and let's have a decision - we want one, West Ham want one and we all . want it open as soon as possible.' Johnson had opened talks with the NFL last month when four of their teams were in London playing regular-season games at Wembley. The Treasury's refusal to hand over the £337 . million Olympic-contingency underspend to help install retractable . seating is hampering West Ham's bid. The retractable seating is expected . to cost in the region of £200 million and the Mayor will be expecting . any anchor tenant to make a significant contribution. Boris takes to the microphone with opera singer Katherine Jenkins at Wembley before meeting New England Patriots and St Louis Rams . It is understood West Ham are willing . to offer more than £8million a year in rent and related payments in . addition to a reported multimillion lump sum. The club are unable to reveal the true nature of their financial package due to confidentiality issues. West Ham also believe that as several . other events will be taking place at the Olympic Stadium throughout the . next few years - such as the 2017 World . Athletics Championships - they should not be the sole party asked to . foot the bill. A decision on the future of the . stadium was expected to be announced by the end of October but . negotiations are ongoing. Other contenders for the stadium tenancy are . Leyton Orient, a football business college and a group wanting to host a . Formula One race at the Olympic Park.","NFL bid for Olympic Stadium ruled out .

Adventurers Tom Randall and Pete Whittaker battled a series of brutal ascents throughout the Peak District almost entirely without ropes. The pair overcame tiredness, hunger and pain during the day and into the night - and even lost 3.5kg of weight during the 22 hour and 36 minute marathon. Scroll down for video . Gruelling: Adventurers Tom Randall and Pete Whittaker (pictured) battled a series of steep ascents throughout the Peak District almost entirely without ropes . Mr Randall (pictured in action left) and Mr Whittaker (right) have become the first to complete Britain's toughest climb . They needed head torches to navigate some of the most technical routes in the UK which involved steep climbs and awkward slopes. Their  climb even included almost 24 miles of running between each route - as well as having to eat enough food to provide 6000 calories. In doing so, they smashed a series of climbing records across the Eastern and Western Peak District areas set by climbers Joe Brown and Don Whillans. Mr Randall, from Sheffield, said: 'On the surface the climbing appears relatively straight forward with only approximately 6,000ft of ascent. 'But it's the style of the route that really kills you - Brown and Whillans routes seek out the burliest, steepest and most awkward routes on the gritstone edges.

"ISIS terrorists convicted of car bombings in Baghdad have been forced to face their victims' families in an Iraqi reality television show. Shackled and flanked by armed military officers, the men are returned to the scene of the bombings carried out across the ravaged city last month. There, they must face the wrath of their victims' families as camera crews film the heartbreaking exchange for the programme, In the Grip of the Law. Scroll down for video .

In one scene, convicted bomber Haider Ali Motar wails as a man in a wheelchair spits verbal abuse towards him. Others tell the 21-year-old they will 'tear him to pieces' from behind a barbed wire fence. The show's presenter said it had been designed to demonstrate those responsible for terrorism offences are brought to justice, while others working on the programme hoped it would deter criminals from re-offending. 'We wanted to produce a program that offers clear and conclusive evidence, with the complete story, presented and shown to Iraqi audiences,' Ahmed Hassan said. 'Through surveillance videos, we show how the accused parked the car, how he blew it up, how he carries out an assassination. 'We show our audiences the pictures, along with hard evidence, to leave no doubts that this person is a criminal and paying for his crimes.' A senior intelligence officer overseeing the filming added: 'Many of these terrorists feel a lot of remorse when they see the victims. 'When people see that, it makes them think twice about crossing the law.' Among clips shown in the programme are those of prisoners confessions to their crimes on camera and police examining DNA and ballistics evidence from the scene.

"At least 15 migrants have been killed around the French port of Calais this year, it emerged last night. Men and women are taking huge risks in their desperate attempts to reach the UK, often trying to leap on to moving lorries bound for Britain. Four migrants died in just one week in the port town earlier this year. Three men try to jump on to the back of a moving lorry bound for Britain in the French port town of Calais . The death toll was branded ‘shameful’ by campaigners, who warned more would perish due to ‘unacceptable’ conditions in their makeshift camps as temperatures plummet over the winter. The grim figures, calculated by local charities and the UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), seemed to support Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart’s warning to MPs in Westminster last year that foreigners were ‘prepared to die’ to get to the UK. She said they believed Britain was like the mythical lost city of gold, El Dorado. Earlier this month, an Eritrean man was knocked down and killed as he searched for a lorry to board. Last month, one man died attempting to jump from a motorway bridge on to a moving lorry, and two more were killed in nearby Dunkirk when the wagon in which they were hiding caught fire. And in October, a 16-year-old Ethiopian girl was killed as she crossed the road leading to the Channel Tunnel. More than 2,500 migrants, some with children as young as three, have flocked to Calais and are living in shanty towns, without sanitation or running water, yards from the perimeter fence of the port. Ruthless trafficking gangs are openly operating in the town and are offering to smuggle people into the UK for between £800 and £2,500, an investigation found. A group of men break into a lorry and attempt to climb into it as it fills of with fuel at a diesel station on a road close to the port of Calais . And some said smugglers were coercing vulnerable young girls into having sex in return for a passage to the UK. Last night Vincent Cochetel, the European director of UNHCR, said the situation was ‘shameful’ and warned that more people would freeze to death in the makeshift camps over the winter. ‘The conditions are totally unacceptable and are not consistent with the kind of values that a democratic society should have,’ he added. ‘This is a shameful situation to witness in the heart of the European Union. ‘We are seeing more and more people taking crazy risks because they feel they have nothing to lose so they take whatever chance they can to get to a place where they feel their life is going to be better or to where they think they will be protected.’ He claimed the conditions in Calais were so dreadful that they were now worse than those at refugee camps in Turkey, where hundreds of thousands of people have fled the bloodshed in Syria. Juliette Delaplace, who works for Secours Catholique, a charity that has been helping migrants in Calais for ten years, said: ‘No other year has seen as many migrants die. ‘They are jumping on lorries and taking more risks.’ Last week, a Freedom of Information request revealed how a record 3,000 immigrants a month are being caught trying to sneak into the country illegally. It is now said that lorry drivers are no being told not to stop in the vicinity of the French town to prevent migrants from clambering abroad . Lorry drivers are now told not to stop within miles of the French town to prevent migrants clambering abroad. The same warnings have been issued to motorists heading for the ferries and the Eurotunnel. Most – but not all – of the deaths happened as migrants attempted to make the perilous journey to the UK. But the fatalities and failed attempts do nothing to weaken the remaining migrants’ resolve to reach Britain. Earlier this year hundreds of migrants tried to force their way on to cross-Channel ships, forcing the boats to lock their doors, raise their ramps and even use fire hoses to push the migrants back. Riot police had to use tear gas on 400 people who tried to storm lorries heading for Britain. There have been increasing levels of violence in Calais, with bloody clashes between different groups of migrants and the police.

"In the last couple of years the selfie has seen a meteoric rise to fame and was even given the Royal Seal of approval during the Commonwealth Games when some opportunistic youngsters managed to take one with her Majesty in the background. But now there is a new way to document your day – the dronie, where all of your photos are taken by a drone. French drone manufacturer Parrot say the increasingly popular method of using a remote controlled miniature aircraft is down to 'narcissism' - as people are buying them ready fitted with cameras in order to film themselves. Forget selfies - people are now using drones to take photos and videos, like this couple in Portugal . Up to 30,000 of the remote-controlled devices are predicted to have been sold by the end of this year . Drones are also increasingly being used at weddings, giving the bride and groom high-quality footage of their big day from an aerial perspective. Henri Seydoux, Parrot’s chief executive, told the Financial Times that the drones of the future will be able to pilot themselves, automatically following their subject around. He told the paper: ‘It would be like having a full TV crew with you when you went snowboarding or mountain climbing.’ He said that sales of drones jumped by 130 per cent in the third quarter of the year, taking the company by surprise. A woman gets her photo taken by a remote controlled flying dronie in a snow covered New Zealand . A group of brave adventurers had this picture taken by a dronie in Costa Rica as they crossed a rope bridge . Mr Seydoux added: ‘It turned out that in reality people bought the drones because of narcissism. ‘People want to put pictures on YouTube of them looking strong and talented, and that is why people want the cameras.’ However, last month it was revealed a passenger plane had a near miss with a drone as it landed at Heathrow, in the first such incident recorded at Britain’s biggest airport. The incident involved an Airbus A320, which can carry up to 180 passengers, and was rated by investigators as among the most serious near-collisions. The aircraft was at just 700ft at 2.16pm on July 22 when the pilot saw the drone, which had not shown up on air traffic control radar. He reported the sighting and an inquiry was launched by the UK Airprox Board, which investigates all reported near-misses. Investigators, however, were unable to identify it. It comes amid concern over the threat to aircraft from domestic drones flown by amateurs - especially as they are expected to be a must have Christmas present this year. Drones cost from as little as £35 - and sales have jumped thanks to extra demand. It is estimated that more than 30,000 drones will have been bought by British consumers by the end of the year — a high proportion of them as Christmas presents. The electronics chain Maplin says that sales within its stores are up 300 per cent on 2013. Last month, a conference on unmanned aerial systems in London heard that police were worried about injuries and other problems on Boxing Day when amateur ‘pilots’ try out their new drones. This group of friends and their dogs shot a video on a dronie of their walk up Bernal Hill in San Francisco .","People are increasingly turning to drones to take pictures and shoot video .

"A family seeking compensation for a cancelled easyJet flight were outraged after the airline sent their solicitor a foul-mouthed email. An employee wrote the note to lawyers acting for father and daughter Chris and Megan Dickson, who were claiming a payout. Sent from the company’s head office, it explained that the family’s request had been rejected. Chris and Megan Dickson were left outraged after easyJet sent their solicitor a foul-mouthed email when they attempted to claim compensation for a cancelled flight . But astonishingly it concluded: ‘Based on the aforesaid, we decline your client’s claim for compensation and that is our final statement regarding this case mother*******.’ Mr Dickson, 52, from Falkirk, Stirlingshire, said he was ‘astounded’ when his lawyer informed him of the response. He made the claim after a flight he intended to take with 16-year-old Megan was cancelled at the last minute. The pair had planned to travel home via Edinburgh after a visit to London in June. But they were forced to spend an additional night in the capital after the flight was cancelled – apparently because of air traffic control strikes in France. Mr Dickson, a health and fitness development manager, managed to claim expenses for the unplanned overnight stay from easyJet, but consulted lawyers about claiming compensation as well. He enlisted the help of Nick Parkinson, a solicitor at Flight Delays, who contacted easyJet in a bid to claim compensation and ask why the flight was cancelled. The email sent to Mr Dickson's solicitor concluded with abusive language. Pictured: How it may have looked . However when lawyer Nick Parkinson contacted easyJet to ask why air traffic control strikes in France would affect an Edinburgh-bound journey, he received the abusive reply. Mr Parkinson said: ‘They said they will not pay out because the reason it was cancelled was because of an air traffic control strike in France. But we thought, what has that got to do with the flight from London to Scotland? ‘We told them their response was vague, and asked them to explain it properly. It was a standard letter asking simple questions. They didn’t answer any of the questions. The response was dismissive, very evasive.’ He added: ‘Airlines can be difficult to deal with, but we’ve certainly never had a response like that before. Mr Dickson was shocked and appalled that they wouldn’t give a straight answer, let alone the abuse.’ EasyJet has now been forced to apologise after an employee made the remark in an official email to a lawyer (file picture) Mr Parkinson said the firm was now considering issuing court proceedings. He said he had received a call from easyJet this morning in which the airline confirmed it was now going to respond to the letter properly. Mr Parkinson added: ‘They said they’ve done a full investigation and want to resolve it. We were right to ask the questions.’ EasyJet has apologised for the email and revealed that the member of staff who sent it has been sacked. A spokesman said: ‘EasyJet is shocked by how anyone could represent the company in this way. The airline confirmed the employee who sent the email to Mr Dickson's lawyers had been dismissed (file picture) 'The individual was immediately dismissed as soon as we had investigated the matter. We can only apologise to the recipient and assure them that this isn’t how we treat customers.’ The news comes as easyJet passengers face fresh disruption, with the company’s French cabin attendants planning to walk out over the Christmas period in a dispute over their pay and schedules. EasyJet spokesman Francois Bacchetta confirmed that the airline was expecting to cancel less than half its flights from French airports between 12:01am on Christmas Day and 11:59pm on Boxing Day. EasyJet apologised to passengers and said it will issue a final cancellation list on Christmas Eve once it has final details from the SNPNC and UNAC cabin crew unions. Passengers on the affected flights will be contacted and offered a full refund or the opportunity to rebook at no cost, the airline added.","Email sent to lawyers acting on behalf of passengers contained swear word .

"A devoted dog has proved its unfailing love for its master after it raced after an ambulance which was taking him to hospital. Desperate not to lose sight of the vehicle, the pet was  filmed bounding along in the middle of the road in the driver's wing mirror by an astounded paramedic in Goiana, Brazil. The recording, released on the weekend, then switches to the passenger's side and captures the adorable creature bounding beside the vehicle for several minutes in its determination to keep up. Scroll down for video . Man's best friend: Astounded paramedics filmed this devoted dog keeping up with its owner - as he was taken to hospital at high speed in an ambulance. Eventually the crew in Goiana, Brazil, let him aboard . Exhausted: At one stage the dog crossed  to the pavement, beginning to fall behind as it ran out of breath . At one stage the dog starts to fall behind as it begins to run out of breath, but keeping close to the side of the ambulance, the pet looks up appealingly at the crew as if pleading for help. Realising the long journey to the general hospital will be too much for the animal, the ambulance crew eventually decide to stop the vehicle and let the 'man's best friend' climb on board. Paramedic Celiomar Ferreira do Couto, 42, who made the video, said the whole service team was touched by the love shown by the dog for its owner, a homeless man. 'I've been doing this job for 19 years and I've never seen anything like it,' said Mr Couto. 'Sometimes we arrive at the scene of an emergency and there are pets around but they are too shy for us to get close to and they often run way. I have never seen this reaction in all my career.' Reinvigorated: The dog ran alongside the ambulance between it and the pavement, to the crew's amazement . Catch-up: The dog drawing level with the ambulance in a feat which prompted pity by the crew . Commenting in the video, Mr Couto says to his colleague as he watches the dog chase the ambulance – 'doesn't he get tired?' Then to the dog he shouts – 'Go home. Go and have a rest, give up.' On board, the faithful companion won praise for its good behaviour. The crew allowed it to sit next to the owner in the ambulance all the way to the hospital. 'We couldn't believe how well-behaved the dog was,' he added. 'It just sat quietly and patiently beside its owner. It didn't even bark. 'The man was in and out of consciousness but he could see his companion was right there with him on the way'. Once at the hospital, the owner, who had suffered an epileptic seizure, was placed on a stretcher. Let me on board! The pet looks imploringly up at the ambulance's crew, one of whom filmed the scene . Paramedic Celiomar Ferreira do Couto said: 'In 19 years and I've never seen anything like it' Faithful: The dog next to its owner on a stretcher in hospital. The outcome of his treatment is unknown . The affectionate pet was again filmed hovering close by, eventually settling down patiently to stay beside the bedside. The hospital has not been able to comment on the outcome of the man's hospital stay and whether he recovered to leave with his pet. 'Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find out what happened to the pet and its owner, but it has certainly given me faith in the loyalty and love that exists between owners and their dogs,' said Mr Couto.","Homeless owner taken to hospital after seizure in Goiana, Brazil .

"Rating: . Many years ago, Nicholas Dickinson sold his Luxury Family Hotels group to Von Essen, of which Congham Hall hotel, near King's Lynn (not far from Sandringham), was a part. Then, two years ago, Von Essen went bust and Dickinson headed a team of investors to buy the hotel back from Von Essen's receivers. That wasn't all. The team went on to double the number of rooms and added a new spa (including indoor pool) and dining room. Going back in time: Congham Hall is delightfully old-fashioned - and mostly in a good way . We opt for a room in the main house, reached via a narrow, airless, fusty corridor that becomes more and more dreary the longer it goes on. There are windows half-way along this passage, hidden behind net curtains. But no light seems to come through. We take a peep - and discover that the windows are all bricked up. Our room is spacious with two large sash windows and a proper antique chest of drawers. Best bit is the huge, comfy bed with no shortage of pillows. This is old-fashioned country house hotel territory. The bathroom is up a few stairs (handrail provided) and it's some time since we've come across a shower curtain. Downstairs is more contemporary, more airy. The new dining room feels like a conservatory, with lots of space and floor to ceiling doors leading into the garden. The garden is a big deal here, especially the area given over to herbs — more than 400 varieties, including 50 types of mint. We're on a dinner, bed and breakfast rate of £199 for two people. That's good value. Staff are attentive and, astonishingly, all seem to be British. We get the impression locals enjoy working at Congham Hall. While we peruse the menu, a waitress leaves an iPad on the table, which, she explains, is the wine list. I pick it up and start flicking through the electronic pages, but find the whole process unbearable. 'I'm so sorry, but I spend almost every moment of every day staring at a screen and would love not to do so on a Friday evening. Do you have a printed version?' I ask. 'We don't I'm afraid,' she says. No iPads or tablets are deployed at breakfast. Instead, there are lots of newspapers, a buffet and a proper a la carte menu. My wife thinks electronic menus will be perfectly normal in a few years. I hope she's wrong. They certainly don't belong at Congham Hall. Congham Hall . Grimston . King's Lynn . Norfolk .

"These are the amazing photographs when a giant crocodile eats an entire goose with one swift bite. The Egyptian goose was taking a drink at a watering hole inside the Kruger National Park in South Africa, completely unaware of the danger lurking beneath the water. Photographer Gideon Jordaan from Pretoria was following some hippos when the unexpected attack happened. In a fraction of a second, the crocodile pounced, capturing the goose between its powerful jaws, crushing the helpless bird. The crocodile approached the Egyptian goose silently from beneath the water inside the Kruger National Park in South Africa before pouncing . The powerful crocodile began eating the goose head-first, chomping down on its body, crushing the unfortunate bird to death . The crocodile continues to chomp down on the bird with its powerful jaws as photographer Gideon Jordaan captured the amazing scenes . Commenting on his good fortune, Mr Jordaan said: 'I didn't see the croc before the strike but once he had caught the goose there was plenty of time to snap away. 'As with most wildlife photography, your time is spent sitting and waiting at waterholes waiting for something to come down to the water to drink, and this day was no different. 'On this hot afternoon there was only a few Impala drinking and two Egyptian Geese feeding at the side of the water. 'I was photographing a pod of hippos in the middle of the dam when I heard a commotion closeby. 'I looked up from my camera's viewfinder only to see a massive crocodile with one of the Egyptian Geese in its jaws. 'After the croc had the geese in its massive jaws it started swallowing the bird and this gave me the opportunity to get some pictures.' After goose stops struggling, the photographs clearly show blood trickling down the side of the crocodile's jaw and into the water .

"Inventor Greg Sancoff's sleek and futuristic Ghost warship is all revved up with no place to go. The angular vessel looks like a waterborne stealth X-Wing fighter from Star Wars. It rides atop underwater torpedo-shaped tubes powered by a pair of 2,000-horsepower gas turbine engines. Gyroscopes keep the ride smooth. Despite all of its cutting-edge bells and whistles, Ghost might never be a familiar household name like Humvee, Apache and Abrams -- even if it works as advertised -- because its creator built a warship the military is not convinced it needs. Scroll down for video . Ahead of its time: The newly designed warship vessel named Ghost sits in an old warehouse on the grounds of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine . Labor of love: Inventor and entrepreneur Greg Sancoff put up some of his own money to build the $15million warship prototype. Now he just need to find a buyer . ‘It's a revolutionary program,’ said Sancoff, founder and CEO of Juliet Marine Systems. ‘Nothing like this has ever been built by anybody, not even the Navy.’ The Ghost rides on 12-foot-tall struts connected to engine assemblies Sancoff says take advantage of ‘supercavitation,’ traveling underwater inside a bubble of gas. It is a new application of technology that the inventor insists will make Ghost fast -- it's so far hit about 35mph but its creator believes it can approach 60mph -- while staying stable even in rough seas. But Sancoff has taken the usual step of spending $15million on a prototype that he hopes to sell to the Navy, turning upside down a process in which normally the military identifies a need before soliciting proposals and seeking funding. ‘The Navy is pretty skeptical of what we've been working on but they're starting to take us more seriously,’ said Sancoff, whose company operates out of a leased warehouse at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. Sancoff, who as a young man raced hydroplanes, came up with the design for the 60-foot-long vessel after terrorists using a small boat full of explosives nearly sank the USS Cole in 2000. Sleek: The angular vessel looks like a waterborne stealth X-Wing fighter from Star Wars riding atop underwater torpedo-shaped tubes powered by a pair of 2,000-horsepower gas turbine engines . Cutting edge: The Ghost's inventor says the vessel's smooth ride makes it an ideal platform for weapon systems -- and for transporting Navy SEALs, but the Navy is skeptical . Inspired idea: Sancoff came up with the innovative design for the 60-foot-long vessel after terrorists using a small boat full of explosives nearly sank the USS Cole in 2000 . He thinks the Navy needs a fast patrol boat to protect larger and more costly warships when they're most vulnerable, like when they're passing through the Strait of Hormuz at the southern end of the Persian Gulf. The Ghost's smooth ride makes it an ideal platform for weapon systems -- and for transporting Navy SEALs, Sancoff said. The 38-foot long main cabin rests on top of a pair of 12-foot tall struts which, when moving at speed, prop the cabin above the water like a hydrofoil. The struts swivel at their base, allowing them to be raised and lowered depending on the water depth. While parked, or traveling through shallow waters, they can be extended to the side. In deeper waters, at speeds of eight knots or higher, they can rotate downward to lift the hull into the air, eliminating the jarring impact of waves. They're sharpened along the leading edge as well to slice through submerged debris. At the other end of each strut, a 62-foot long tube houses a 2,000HP gas turbine engine spinning two front-mounted propellers. These tubes also eject a pocket of air from the front to generate a supercavitation effect that reduces the ship's drag coefficient by a factor of 900. Supercavitation has been used to produce high-speed torpedoes but Sancoff said he is adapted it for the first time to propel a surface warship. As part of his design, dual propellers were moved to the front instead of the rear and underwater ailerons control the vessel, which banks like an airplane when it's turning. Sadly for Sancoff, the Navy currently does not have a requirement for such a patrol boat, said Chris Johnson, spokesman for the Naval Sea Systems Command. But the innovative design is at least worth a look, even if it turns out to be unfit for military use, according to retired Vice Adm. Pete Daly, CEO of the US Naval Institute, an independent, nonpartisan organization in Annapolis, Maryland. ‘The high ground for the US Navy is to take this and evaluate it and learn from it,’ Daly said. ‘The propulsion system could be valuable in other applications. You've got to keep that door open to innovation,’ he said. Sancoff insists the military has expressed at least some interest in his company, which counts retired Navy admirals and one former US senator, John Sununu of New Hampshire, as board members. ‘Any time you're building something so different, you're going to find people that just don't understand it. You've really got to spend some time understanding what's going on here,’ Sancoff said. Even in the best of times, the Navy tends to buy larger, multi-missions ships instead of smaller niche vessels. And the Navy's current budget struggles pose perhaps the biggest obstacle. Look's familiar? Sancoff's Ghost bears an uncanny resemblance to the X-Wing fighter from Star Wars . Sancoff is also proposing marketing his vessel to other navies and wants to build a new version that'll be a bit bigger. He believes it will be flexible enough for other tasks, like anti-submarine and mine warfare operations. Loren Thompson, a defense analyst at the Lexington Institute, said the small company faces an uphill battle. The Navy's speedy new littoral combat ships are designed to fulfill the Ghost's proposed mission, and Thompson is skeptical that the Navy would be willing to go out on a limb for all-new design for a ship that's too small and light to accommodate heavy armor and bigger weapon systems. Juliet Marine needs plenty of money, and perhaps a friend or two in Congress, he said, to circumvent an acquisition process that poses obstacles for small startups like Juliet, which has 15 employees.","Greg Sancoff, founder and CEO of Juliet Marine Systems, built angular vessel resembling a waterborne stealth fighter he dubbed 'Ghost .

"Aristocratic bad boy Lord Brocket has failed in his latest attempt to seize £2million worth of antiques and artworks from his family home. The controversial peer sent a fleet of removal vans to Brocket Hall in Hertfordshire, claiming he has a legal right to remove the valuables from the building. However, the lorries were unable to gain entry to the stately home, and were sent away again empty-handed. Removal vans: Lord Brocket yesterday sent a fleet of lorries to Brocket Hall, his family home in Hertfordshire . Denied: Security guards sent the vans away claiming they had no right to access the antiques up for dispute . Lord Brocket, 62, who was jailed for insurance fraud during the 1990s, has leased out Brocket Hall as a conference centre and golf course for nearly 20 years. The home's antiques are leased to a company owned by German hotelier Dieter Klostermann - but Lord Brocket claims the businessman has failed to keep up payments, and is demanding the objects be returned to the family trust which owns them. Among the valuable items at stake in the dispute are a painting by Van Dyck, the table from the home's ballroom and other items of furniture. Earlier this year, a convoy of removal vans was stopped on the motorway after trying to take what Lord Brocket claims he is owed. In yesterday's incident, a fleet of four vans turned up outside the hall demanding to gain entry, but the removal men were ordered to leave by security after a half-hour stand-off - as officials at the hall said they needed the items for a Christmas party attended by the Arsenal football team. Controversial: Lord Brocket, pictured with his wife Harriet, is locked in a legal battle with the company that runs Brocket Hall . Home: But Lord Brocket has leased out Brocket Hall as a conference centre and golf course since 1996 . Lord Brocket, who was not present at the scene of the dispute, said: 'The problem is that this is theft, this is not their furniture. It is mine and they are using it to run a business. They agreed we could go in at 8.30 but yet again they changed their mind.' He added: 'The trustees of the Brocket Estate are criminally liable if they fail to maintain the listed buildings and contents. 'Buildings have collapsed, original fixtures ripped out of buildings and original candelabras made for the ballroom destroyed. In 2012 the tenant was served with a £7.2million bill due to dilapidations. 'On November 20, 2013 the licence to the tenant of Brocket Hall to use the contents of the hall ended following numerous failures to pay rent and damage to various contents. 'The contents are owned by the trustees of Brocket Hall. Since that day the tenant has unlawfully withheld the contents in order to rent out Brocket Hall as a furnished venue and this is regarded as theft.' Fight: The vans were supposed to be picking up £2million worth of art including a painting by Van Dyck . Mix-up: A representative for Lord Brocket said he thought the estate had agreed to allow entry . The company running Brocket Hall has said that some of the objects may legally have to remain in the home because of its status as a grade I listed building. A spokesman said: 'Brocket Hall International have been working closely with Welwyn Hatfield Council and English Heritage with reference to the artwork located in the Hall. 'Both the council and English Heritage are in the process of deciding whether various items benefit from the property’s grade one listing, in relation to their annexation or historical significance. Tycoon: The hall is currently leased to a company owned by hotelier Dieter Klostermann, pictured . 'We have contacted the estate's trustees with regards to the procedure for collection of any items that do not benefit from the listing, however BHI never gave permission for any items to be removed yesterday. 'Lord Brocket wants to operate outside of the law - we are not prepared to do this.' Property manager Stuart Gray, who has been representing the peer in the dispute, told the Evening Standard that he thought there had been an 'understanding' that the removal vans would be given access to Brocket Hall. But Jim Moore, the property's financial director, told the paper: 'We don't owe the trust a penny.' Lord Brocket first had to lease out his ancestral home in 1996, shortly after he was jailed for scamming insurers out of £4.5million over a fleet of classic cars. The property is rented by Brocket Hall International, part of Mr Klostermann's company CCA International, while the contents are leased out under a separate contract. The company did not respond for a request for comment on the legal dispute with Lord Brocket. Brocket Hall was built in 1760, and has previously been home to prime ministers and members of the royal family. Lord Brocket's ancestors bought the home around a century ago, and the current lord took possession when he inherited his title in 1971. The Old Etonian served as an Army officer before gaining a reputation as a playboy and car enthusiast, but was ruined by his five-year prison sentence. In the past decade he has reinvented himself as a television personality, appearing on I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! and other reality programmes.","Controversial peer, 62, claims property firm is illegally holding antiques .

But Raggle the terrier knows — as many of us do — that there are some festive traditions which simply have to be carried out.

Sadly, Paddy died in 2002 at the grand old age of 17. But Mr Thorpe and his wife Julie, also 52, adopted Raggle, who has been the star of the cards since 2006. First she was a camel, then — with a little help from a pair of modified bunny ears and a tennis ball nose — a donkey. What Mr Thorpe calls the ‘dog roast’ came next. ‘I made the oval platter from MDF, cut a hole in the middle and filled it with towelling so it was comfortable for Raggle to lie on, then placed the turkey on top of her,’ explained Mr Thorpe, who spends around a fortnight planning and making each set, and takes all the photos in his studio in Bristol. ‘I thought this may be impossible but Raggle is a true star. She is a very sweet and gentle dog, and is very happy to be dressed briefly for the photos. ‘We don’t make her do anything she doesn’t like. And she always gets a treat afterwards.’ Since then, Raggle has been a lamb perched on ‘shepherd’ Mr Thorpe’s shoulders, a penguin on an iceberg, and even posed as Ebenezer Scrooge. Mrs Thorpe helps set up the shots, and the couple’s children — twins Joe and Callum, 21, and Toby, 18 — have also featured on cards over the years. For her latest — and last — shoot, Raggle, who is thought to be 15, became a mouse sitting beside a giant mousetrap and gazing at the Christmas pudding bait. Mr Thorpe said: ‘This will be her final performance before her retirement due to old age. She still responds very well to tasty food so we lifted her on to the set for just a few minutes.'

Eight people were injured and six died after the lorry lost control in a crowded square before crashing into the side of a hotel. The accident happened in George Square, which was packed with Christmas shoppers and families enjoying the annual winter carnival. Witnesses believe the lorry driver became ill behind the wheel and lost control of the council vehicle . A fleet of private ambulances with police outriders left the crash site early this morning. A large cordon remains in place and dozens of floral tributes have been placed at the scene. One witness yesterday described the lorry as knocking people down 'like pinballs' in the crash which happened at around 2.30pm. It is thought the driver may have fallen ill at the wheel as he travelled up Queen Street and his vehicle struck a pedestrian outside the Gallery of Modern Art. The Reverend Alastair Duncan will lead a service at the nearby St George's Tron at 11.30am.","Fury erupts on social network as user accused of posting joke about crash .

"Stand-in: Aaron Mast's friends and family took a cardboard cutout of him to all big events while he was serving in Afghanistan . Soldier Aaron Mast thought he had missed out on nine months of weddings, birthday parties and even Christmas while serving in Afghanistan. But when the 29-year-old returned he discovered he had been on a simultaneous tour of duty at home after his friends took a cardboard stand-in of him to every big event. Mr Mast had made the cutout for a friend's wedding that he couldn't make, but he was shocked to learn it became a project for his friends and family. ''It really sucked being away from my friends and family for such a long time and I hated missing out on big events like weddings and birthdays,' said the solider from  Dover, Delaware, said. 'But I had no idea that it would turn into such an amazing project for all my friends and family to keep me in their thoughts while I was away.' After enlisting in 2003, Mr Mast served two tours in Iraq, the first in 2005 and the second in 2008. Last March he was due to go overseas for his third tour as a sergeant in a communications unit when he realised he would be away for the marriage of his good friends Christina and JJ. Fed up of missing out on wedding photos, Mr Mast decided to have cardboard cut-out of himself made and left it in the care of his friends so he could still feature in the snaps on their big day. His lifesize cutout, dressed in a smart black tie, made it into all the photos and was even pictured swigging whisky at the bar and dancing with bridesmaids. Mr Mast had the cardboard cutout made for the wedding of his friends Christina and JJ. He was unable to end their big day because he was serving in Afghanistan . During his nine month tour his cardboard model attended a friend's hen-do . The cutout made it to his mum's birthday in his home town of Dover, Delaware . But his enthusiastic friends didn't stop there, and started taking him to parties, bars and family events. As the real Mr Mast trekked around Afghanistan dismantling US army bases in preparation for the allied forces exit from the country, his alter-ego was celebrating Christmas and Halloween back in Delaware. The model was snapped at a New Year's Eve party, on stage with a local band and even at Christina's hen party but he only realised when he started being tagged on Facebook at events he hadn't been able to attend. His devoted friend Paula DePrima took the cut-out everywhere with her, looking after it at the first wedding and making sure he always got in on the action.

When he got back to the United States in February 2014 the pair got together as a couple and they're now looking forward to spending Christmas together for real. 'All of my friends got involved and took me to my family's house for big holidays,' said Mr Mast. 'I think it was great for my mum that she felt like I could be there in part for her birthday. 'They always say that I am the life and soul of the party and that having my semi-attendance made a big difference. 'It was even bigger than I could have imagined. 'I only got access to the internet once a week so every time I logged on I could see what my friends had been up to and where my cut-out had been. 'The cardboard me got lots of attention. 'It was really encouraging knowing that my friends were thinking of me while I was away serving my country and humbling to know that they were lugging a giant cardboard model around to all these parties. 'Paula took the cut-out under her wing at the wedding and after that she carried me everywhere - I think she realised how attached she was to me while I was away. 'Having the cut-out fill in for me while I was abroad was great but I'm glad to be in attendance for real this year.'","US soldier sergeant Aaron Mast, 29, spent nine months in Afghanistan .

"High street retailers were today braced for their most frantic day in the run-up to Christmas as shoppers make a last  dash for gifts - with this lunchtime said to be the busiest hour. Visa Europe expected some £1.3billion to be spent using its cards today, making it the busiest day on the UK high street in the run-up to Christmas. Some £916,667 was predicted to be spent every minute, or £15,278 every second, on Visa cards, according to the company. The peak time was in the lunch hour break from 1pm to 2pm. Meanwhile, it has been forecast that Boxing Day sales at some retailers including Next and Currys PC World will start on Christmas Eve. Scroll down for video . Getting ready: Shoppers buy last-minute Christmas presents at the Bullring Shopping Centre in Birmingham . Last-minute gifts: Christmas shoppers out in force in the centre of a drizzly Newcastle-upon-Tyne today . Wish list: Some £916,667 will be spent every minute, or £15,278 every second, on Visa cards, the firm predicts . Plenty of presents: Shoppers hit Oxford Street for last-minute presents before Christmas Day . Packed: Christmas shoppers on Oxford Street today. Visa Europe expects some £1.3billion to be spent using its cards today . Bosses at the Manchester Arndale shopping centre said they expected about 220,000 visitors today on the back of a similar number coming through its doors yesterday, and customers were spending more money this Christmas. Centre director David Allinson said: ‘The feedback we are getting from the retailers is that people are spending more this Christmas. The average transaction value is up. ‘Technology is always a key seller with the Playstation 4 one of the best sellers, and jewellery has again sold strongly. Now the winter weather is a bit cooler we have seen a big increase in people buying coats and capes. ‘On a lighter note the success of the Frozen film has been unbelievable with more than 5,000 Elsa and Anna dolls sold at the Disney Store.’ He continued: ‘Today is extremely busy. Yesterday we had 220,000 people visit us and we are expecting at least the same today if not better. It has been a busy week. We had 400,000 people come through this weekend. ‘Today is the day we see lots of men with anguished faces, with some taking advantage of our gift-wrapping service in which we ask for donations to our chosen charities. ‘In general terms the numbers overall have been comparable to last year. We had a very successful December last year as over five and a half million came through the doors and we are hitting those numbers again.’ Happy experience for some: Shoppers hit Oxford Street for last-minute presents before Christmas Day . Steven Madeley, director of the St David's shopping centre in Cardiff, said an estimated 200,000 people had passed through the doors today, looking for a last minute bargain. 'After a record-breaking week, we had another very busy day at St David's and lots of shoppers taking advantage of early retailer sales to snap up a bargain,' he said. 'Local schools have also finished for Christmas and we saw lots of families at St David's today.' The New West End Company, which represents shops in London's Oxford, Bond and Regent Streets said it had been a bumper Christmas for the area's retailers. 'In the five day countdown to Christmas we projected £300 million would go through the tills across the West End, and with just one day to go we're hearing confidence from retailers that we're going to exceed this mark,' a spokesman said. 'The West End welcome for shoppers has never been better,with great promotions on offer, and our welcome ambassadors were on hand during the ""golden hour"" rush today to help shoppers make their last minute shopping dash go without a hitch.' The new retail ombudsman, who takes up his role on January 2, urged shoppers to be ‘savvy’ to avoid issues such as faulty goods, unwanted presents and delivery issues. A man pushes a trolley past a sale sign (left) on Oxford Street, while another stands on the same road (right) Half price: A man runs past a sale sign on Oxford Street in central London. Many shops in the area are having pre-Christmas sales this year . The ombudsman, consumer barrister Dean Dunham, said: ‘Before you complete your purchase ask the retailer what their returns policy is with Christmas presents, always ask for a gift receipt and if you are ordering online ask the retailer to confirm in writing when the goods will arrive.’ Kevin Jenkins, managing director at Visa Europe, said: ‘Black Friday kick-started Christmas on the high street and online this year but the busiest bricks and mortar day will likely remain in its traditional slot close to Christmas. ‘Retailers’ multi-channel approach should cause a surge in footfall from click-and-collect sales too, with the opportunity for further shopping in-store when consumers arrive.' He added: 'We're seeing huge numbers of purchases on the high street as people make their last minute dash for gifts, key grocery items and other supplies with Christmas Day approaching,' he said. 'Today we are processing the highest volume of transactions per second we've ever seen on Visa debit and credit cards in the UK, peaking at around 1.30pm, and we fully expect to hit our prediction of £1.3 billion spent on the day.' ‘We are likely to see £1.3billion spent in total today. Lunch hour should prove the most popular time for a shopping trip, either for last-minute gifts or final ingredients for Christmas dinner.’ Some 34million transactions are expected to take place which is 7 per cent higher than in 2013, while spending is predicted to rise 6 per cent. Superdrug buying director Simon Comins said: ‘It’s an old cliche that still rings true, many men are utterly disorganised when it comes to gift buying. We see more men in our stores in the run up to Christmas than any other time of the year. ‘What we like to call “last minute men” often leave their shopping to the very last minute. On Christmas Eve alone we expect to sell 200,000 bottles of perfume and fragrance gifts.’ This weekend saw over 800,000 people visit Westfield centres in London and shopping hours have been extended until midnight tonight to allow more last-minute shoppers the chance to purchase presents. Retail analysts Springboard say today should be the busiest shopping day of the year, but they expect an overall drop in footfall year-on-year on Christmas Eve. Spending: Two women walk along Oxford Street in central London with their pre-Christmas purchases . Meanwhile, experts have forecast traditional Boxing Day sales could become extinct after a rise in pre-Christmas discounts, with Next and Currys PC World sales expected to start on Christmas Eve. Three-quarters of the top 100 high street shops have already started their sales in a bid to attract customers, with discounts averaging 45 per cent, PricewaterhouseCoopers said. Marks & Spencer is already offering 30 per cent off knitwear, 20 per cent off bags and 20 per cent off hats, scarves and gloves, while Debenhams is offering up to half price off everything from boots and coats to dinnerware and watches. John Lewis, Ted Baker and Next appeared to be some of the few stores holding their nerve until after Christmas. The rise in online shopping also means that many people spend their Christmas money and gift vouchers on December 25 itself, using their phones and computer tablets to do so. Amazon is expecting Christmas Day to be its busiest day ever for sales of digital books, music, television, films and video games – and said its Boxing Day sales will start at 4pm on December 25. More than 1,600 offers will be available, with an average of 35 per cent off current Amazon UK prices. Offers will include £37 off a £170 Sony smart-watch and £15 off a £40 Philips blender. Meanwhile, Mark Kelly, marketing manager at online retailer Appliances Direct, said: ‘TVs are a popular Boxing Day buy due to the strong deals available. ‘We also think health and fitness products such as juicers, fitness bands, smart weighing scales and food dehydrators will fly of the shelves ahead of people kick-starting their New Year diets.’","Visa Europe predicted that £1.3billion would be spent using its cards today .

"Philip Gamble, a father of three, was given a suspended sentence after he cut up all his wife's clothes and placed them back in drawers and on hangers after she ended their 44 year relationship . A spurned husband slashed his wife's tops, cut out the crotches of her bikinis and removed the zip from her boots before carefully placing them back into wardrobes and cupboards. Philip Gamble, a father of three, decided to take his revenge after his wife of 38 years left him for another man and moved out of the Cirencester home they shared. The disabled 59-year-old also poured bleach on the curtains, damaged the mattress and turned off the fridge freezer. He admitted charges of burglary with intent to cause criminal damage and doing criminal damage to her clothing and was given a suspended sentence as the judge branded him a fool 'not a villain.' Gloucester Crown Court heard that Gamble slashed his wife's clothes after she told him last year that she wanted a divorce and had found a new partner, . The pair met when Gamble was 15 and his wife 11 and married in 1976. At the time of the offences Mrs Gamble was warden of sheltered accommodation in Berkeley Court, Cirencester, and her husband lived there with her. The former labourer left the property in January and the locks were changed. But when Mrs Gamble returned and started taking her clothes out of the wardrobe she noticed they had been cut up, with her trousers slashed and the back of every one of her tops slashed from bottom to top down the back. He caused £5,000 worth of damage to her clothing and £637 to the flat. Judge Jamie Tabor QC sentenced him to three months in prison, suspended for a year. He said: 'You are a man who had never been in trouble and then when your very long marriage came to an end you couldn't cope, for whatever reason, and you acted very sillily. 'But you are not a villain. You were a fool at the time.' Judge Tabor had deferred sentence after Gamble pleaded guilty at a hearing six months ago to see if he could stay out of further trouble. Gamble said he had not offended again or been arrested or questioned. Joe Maloney, defending, said 'She went off with another man, leaving him with £15,000 of mutual debts to settle. He is at a very low ebb. But he certainly accepts that his 38 year marriage is now at an end.' Gamble was sentenced to three months in prison, suspended for a year, for cutting up his wife's clothes . Gamble is still in touch with his children aged 31, 33, and 38. Because of his health problems he is unable to work and receives disability living allowance, the court heard. He was also ordered to pay costs and a victim surcharge of £180. With the aid of Turning Point, Gamble had tackled his drink problem and had not touched a drop since March 22nd this year, he added.","Philip Gamble was married to his childhood sweetheart Jean for 38 years .

"Michael Grimm, a Republican who has represented New Yorkers in Congress since 2011, entered a guilty plea on Tuesday in federal court, admitting that he helped prepare a fraudulent tax return for a restaurant he partially owned. Prosecutors have suggested he spend 24 to 30 months in prison and Grimm's lawyer suggested 12 to 18 to a judge today, but a person who is familiar with the congressman's negotiations told DailyMail.com on Monday that the Republican lawmaker doesn't expect to go to jail at all. Today Grimm told reporters chasing him down outside the court house that he doesn't plan to resign. 'I'm going to get back to work and work as hard as I can,' he said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS AND THE CRIMINAL INDICTMENT . ON HIS WAY OUT? Not if he can help it. New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm  pleaded guilty on Tuesday to a federal tax felony but said he would not resign his congressional seat . Grimm maintained his innocence throughout the 2014 congressional campaign season but has copped to a crime now that he's won re-election . Grimm, 44, is a former FBI agent and is a rare Republican in the Democrat-friendly Big Apple. His fate will be up to Federal Judge Pamela Chen when she hears the terms of a plea agreement. Grimm was originally charged with 20 separate federal crimes and has been serving his constituents while under the terms of a $400,000 bond granted in the spring. Grimm today entered a guilty plea on a single count of 'aiding and assisting in the preparation and filing of a false or fraudulent tax return.' Sentencing has been set for June 8, according to the Associated Press. Loretta Lynch, the sitting U.S. Attorney in Brooklyn, N.Y., brought the indictment against Grimm this year making him the first federal lawmaker to face criminal charges since 2008. Lynch later became President Barack Obama choice to succeed Eric Holder as U.S. attorney general. By pleading guilty to a single tax charge, Grimm will avoid a trial that was scheduled to convene in February. Jurors would heave heard details of Grimm's alleged scheme to hide more than $1 million of his restaurant's sales and wages in order to dodge taxes between 2008 and 2010. He was also accused of hiring illegal immigrants to work for him. Neither prosecutors nor Grimm's attorney has commented for the record. Upon leaving the court today Grimm acknowledged his wrongdoing and apologized for his actions. 'I should not have done it and I am truly sorry for it,' he said, per AP. The confession was a far cry from Grimm's claims when he was first charged that prosecutors were on 'a political witch hunt.' 'I'm a moral man, a man of integrity,' he said at the time. The Staten Island Republican easily won re-election to a third term in November despite campaigning under a cloud of suspicion for nearly five months. He beat Democrat Domenic Recchia by a 55-42 percent margin to win a third term in office. If Grimm avoids a prison sentence, the shoulder-chipped GOPer is expected to argue that he should remain in office during a period of probation. That decision, however, will depend on the leanings of his fellow House Republicans, who hold a sizable majority and could vote to expel him. The House Ethics Committee has let its own investigation idle while the wheels of justice turn. But given today's admission, the committee could quickly move to throw him out of Congress. House Speaker John Boehner's office kept mum on Monday, declining to speculate to DailyMail.com about the New York lawmakers prospects to keep his job. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said on Tuesday that 'Boehner has let this go on long enough,' however, and 'it’s past time' that he leave federal office. 'Speaker Boehner and Republican leaders’ continued complicity in letting Michael Grimm stay in Congress despite his guilt of felony tax evasion is a disservice to the people of Staten Island and Brooklyn and a stain on the institution of the United States House of Representatives,' the statement said. Boehner 'owes it to the constituents and the Congress to make sure Michael Grimm doesn’t serve in this next Congress,' House Democrats' campaign arm said. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has also called on Boehner to step in. According to the Associated Press, Grimm told reporters today that he had spoken GOP leadership in the House but did not offer any additional details and again said he would continue to serve as long as he is able to. Asked a similar question during his re-election campaign in October, the two-term congressman said, 'Certainly, if I was not able to serve, then of course I would step aside.' Grimm owned a 45-percent interest in 'Granny Sayz,' a company that did business as Healthalicious, a Manhattan health food restaurant. Lynch's indictment accused him of helping the company avoid paying taxes on more than $1 million in income, and using cash to underpay workers under the table. Some of those employees were allegedly illegal immigrants and earned less than the minimum wage. The government alleged that Grimm kept two separate payroll ledgers, one of which was fictitious, allowing him to skirt income taxes, payroll taxes and workers' compensation costs. When some of the employees sued the company for back wages, Grimm was deposed under oath. Prosecutors claim he testified, falsely, that he had never paid the restaurant's workers in cash. In January, Grimm became a household name when a New York City journalist caught him on video threatening to throw him off a U.S. Capitol balcony for asking him a tough question about an unrelated federal probe into his 2010 campaign finances. Grimm posted a $400,000 bond to remain free while tax fraud charges pended against him in a case revolving around alleged illegal cash payments he made to illegal-immigrant restaurant employees in order to avoid paying taxes . Grimm went ballistic when NY1 reporter Michael Scotto strayed away from the approved interview topics after President Barack Obama's State of the union Speech on January 28. The congressman waled out of range of the camera suddenly when the topic came up, saying he didn't want to speak 'off-topic.' Michael Scotto, a video journalist for the NY1 television station, was on the receiving end of a Grimm threat in January at the US Capitol . Grimm 'does not want to talk about some of the allegations concerning his campaign finances,' Scotto said, closing his televised segment. But the camera kept rolling as the congressman barked. 'Let me be clear to you,' he said. 'You ever do that to me again I’ll throw you off this f***ing balcony.' 'Why? It’s a valid question,' Scotto responded. 'No, no, you’re not man enough, you’re not man enough,' Grimm sniped back. 'I’ll break you in half. Like a boy.' Grimm apologized the following day. His long-time girlfriend, Diana Durand, pleaded guilty in September to illegally funneling money to his campaign by paying 'straw donors' to make the contributions. In some cases she reimbursed them after the fact. The scheme obscured where the donated money originally came from and allowed Grimm to reap more of Durand's campaign cash than the law allowed. Conservative filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza pleaded guilty to the same crime in May. He paid his friends back for their donations to college friend Wendy Long's failed U.S. Senate campaign.

"Former teacher: Charles Napier, 67, conducted a ‘campaign of abuse’ at the school where he worked . The half-brother of a senior Conservative MP was today jailed for 13 years for carrying out hundreds of sexual assaults on young boys. Former teacher Charles Napier, 67, who is related to Maldon MP John Whittingdale, conducted a ‘campaign of abuse’ at the school where he worked in the late 1960s and early 1970s, grooming and assaulting 21 victims aged as young as eight on scores of occasions. Last month he pleaded guilty to 28 counts of indecent assault - including many covering ‘multiple incidents’ - and one indecency charge in relation to those crimes. Today he admitted a further two separate historic allegations of indecent assault against two 13-year-old boys after he left the school, the first in 1979 and the second in 1983. Napier stared straight ahead and betrayed no emotion as Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith sentenced him at Southwark Crown Court in London. Napier joined the school, which cannot be named, after leaving university and when he was arrested last year he told police he already knew he was a paedophile at that time. The judge said: ‘I have no doubt that ... you sought that post because of the proximity you would have to boys. ‘Within a very short time you were grooming those you had chosen, using the techniques of charm, flattery and the abuse of your power. The number of indecent assaults must be into the hundreds.’ The judge said some of the victims' lives had been ‘dramatically damaged’. He added: ‘These offences...were committed by someone who had a special duty of care and who gravely abused that duty by grooming them for his own purposes.’ Scroll down for video . Half-brother: Napier is related to John Whittingdale (pictured), Conservative MP for Maldon in Essex . The court heard Napier's offending at the school was ‘prolific’, with him targeting 21 different pupils aged between eight and 13 over a period of around two-and-a-half years. He was said to have earned the nickname ‘rapier Napier’ at school. Peter Clement, prosecuting, said: ‘The offences are characterised by a campaign of sexual abuse involving significant planning, grooming and abuse of many pupils. ‘It was sexual abuse of particularly vulnerable victims. The defendant ensured each child's compliance and silence through grooming to the extent that he abused several of the victims many, many times. ‘The defendant abused the high degree of trust placed in him by his colleagues, the children's parents and the children themselves and exploited his role for his own sexual gratification.’ The court heard Napier would give his victims treats including fizzy drinks and chocolate, often abusing them in a carpentry workshop, which, Mr Clement said, ‘became something of his den’. One victim was told by Napier ‘don't be a baby’ while another suffered ‘profound effects’ from being repeatedly abused and attempted suicide later in life, the court heard. Some pupils were targeted as often as once a week, with one boy said to have been abused up to 100 times. No emotion: Napier stared straight ahead  as he was sentenced at Southwark Crown Court (above) in London . Napier abused some victims in the presence of other children, the court heard. On two occasions he made a boy perform a sex act on him, telling the child: ‘That's what grown-ups do.’ If those two offences occurred today Napier would have been charged with rape, the court heard. It was revealed today that Napier, of Sherborne, Dorset, has twice previously been convicted of abuse against boys. One boy made a complaint that resulted in Napier pleading guilty to indecent assaults on a total of five pupils who are not involved in this case, in 1972. He was sentenced to a three-year probation order. In another separate case he was jailed for nine months in 1995 after he was convicted of assaulting two children. The two victims in the further charges Napier admitted today, which did not take place at the school, contacted police after reading news coverage about their abuser's arrest earlier this year. Napier told police he underwent electric shock treatment but it had no impact on his attraction to children. The court heard that after he was dismissed from the school he went on to join the Paedophile Information Exchange as treasurer. He said when interviewed that he felt ‘ghastly’ and ‘desperately sorry’, telling officers: ‘I was a very young man, I was completely out of control and completely out of order, putting it about everywhere.’ Benjamin Hargreaves, for Napier, said in mitigation that the defendant is ‘genuinely remorseful’ and ‘realises how appalling his actions were’. He added: ‘He knows that he is responsible for a most serious and grave period (of offending) but he is no threat now.’ Peter Watt, of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), said: ‘Napier has a shadowy past and used positions of trust to carry out a string of appalling sexual assaults on children. ‘Hiding behind a veneer of respectability, Napier was a man who was a former senior member of a prominent paedophile group.’ Napier was arrested last year under Operation Cayacos, a strand of a wider investigation called Operation Fairbank which was launched following claims by MP Tom Watson. Napier is the first person convicted under Fairbank, Scotland Yard said. Acting Detective Chief Inspector Keith Braithwaite said: ‘Napier is an arrogant, controlling and manipulative individual who has shown no remorse for the serious sexual offences he committed against young and vulnerable victims. ‘He has offended throughout most of his adult life; exploiting opportunities to continue his criminality against children through his employment and standing within society. ‘I'd like to thank those who found the courage after all these years to come forward and provide evidence against this man, especially those who were subject to his serious sexual assaults. ‘I hope today's sentence demonstrates how seriously the courts view such offending and brings a degree of closure to the individuals who had their childhoods destroyed by the selfish actions of Napier. ‘I would like to assure all who have suffered in a similar manner that they will be treated by the MPS with compassion and professionalism and offenders will be brought to justice.’ A spokesman for Mr Whittingdale told MailOnline he had no immediate comment on the sentencing. Journalist Francis Wheen says he was a victim of paedophile teacher - and so were a 'quarter' of the boys in his school . Relief and sadness: Journalist Francis Wheen (above) was in court to see his former master be sent down some 45 years after he was abused . Among the victims who spoke of their relief but also their sadness following the sentencing were journalist and broadcaster Francis Wheen. Mr Wheen, 57, from Essex, who waived his right to life-long anonymity, was in court to see his former master be sent down some 45 years after he was abused. He claimed that Napier abused a ‘quarter’ of the boys in the school where he taught, adding that he was aged only 11 when the teacher put his hands down his gym shorts at his school. The journalist said that when he protested, Napier shouted: ‘Don’t be a baby’. Mr Wheen described the sentence as ‘a signal the judge was giving - these things will be pursued now, even if it's 46 years later don't think you've got away with it’. He told reporters outside court: ‘I am glad that it's been done, I'm glad that it's happened after all these years. I'm sorry that it's taken so long but glad that justice has been done. ‘I occasionally thought in the last year or two, well, he's getting quite old, maybe it wasn't that serious, feeling a tiny bit of pity occasionally. ‘But I don't feel that now, hearing as we've heard today about the sheer extent of what he was doing right under our noses while I was at school with all these other boys. ‘We just had no idea of the scale of what he was doing and how frankly damaged some of them were by what he did. Any element of pity disappeared fairly quickly.’ He also blasted what he described as Napier's attempts to blame his abuse on ‘youthful folly’. ‘His record shows otherwise, that he carried on like this for a long time, abusing boys and exploiting his position of authority,’ Mr Wheen said. Maybe he is now remorseful and wouldn't do it again but certainly he carried on long after he left our school. He didn't feel that ashamed of it at the time.’ Another victim in the case, who wished to remain anonymous, said that he was ‘sad it has come to this’ and described Napier as a ‘great teacher’. ‘The most sordid aspect for me was to write my statement and remember what happened 40 years ago,’ the survivor said. ‘I don't feel that this really affected me that badly, I don't consider myself a victim, but others were affected really badly. ‘I can forgive him but if he had done something to my son at eight or nine I would have been hard pushed to control myself and my anger. At the time I didn't understand the gravity of what he had done, that it was unconscionable behaviour.’","Charles Napier conducted 'abuse campaign' at school where he worked .

"A daughter who was left £2,000 by her dying father and a note which said 'do something good' has used the money to set up a charity which has helped 10,000 African entrepreneurs. Vashti Seth, from St Werburghs, Bristol, was devastated when her father John Richards bequeathed personal gifts to each one of her six siblings, but left her out. But the 37-year-old was later handed an envelope filled with cash and a handwritten note which simply read: 'Do something good with it'. Scroll down for video . Vashti Seth, 37 (left), from St Werburghs, Bristol, used the £2,000 left by her father John Richards (right) to start a charity called Deki, which was inspired by a trip to India and has helped 10,000 African entrepreneurs . The mother used the money to set up a charity called Deki, which has helped more than 10,000 people from the world's poorest countries set up their own business. Pictured: Visiting Nepal . The mother of two was initially confused by its meaning, but after visiting a Tibetan orphan called Deki Dolkha - who her father had sponsored for many years in India - an idea struck her. Inspired by the hardships faced by Deki, she created a charity that allowed people to financially help budding entrepreneurs in the world's poorest countries. The organisation, named Deki, has now helped more than 10,000 people set up their own businesses and secure their future earnings with the crowd-funding website. Generous lenders give small loans - of any amount - to those in need, who - after beginning their business and turning a profit - hand back the original loan money to investors. Ms Seth said: 'My dad passed away and when he did he left everyone something personal apart from me. There are seven of us in total. 'I was quite upset but then I realised he had left me £2,000 with a note saying ""do something good with it"". 'It took me a while to work out what he meant. 'The website helps people who want to set up a business, but who have no opportunity to do it. It's for hard working people who want the opportunity. Esther, from South Sudan (pictured with her children) has been able to send all four of her children to school since taking out a Deki loan and increasing the profits of her business. She said 'I smile everyday now' Mother-of-four Colline, 32, lost her home and possessions in the civil war in South Sudan. She used the loan from Deki to set up a small shop in her local village and now buys groceries and toiletries to sell on at a profit . Children in South Sudan have also benefited from loans, with parents able to feed them thanks to Deki money (left). Grace, 24, (right), from northern Uganda used the loan to help her grow and sell vegetable products . 'You can lend money to people who want to help themselves, it's for things like buying a cow to a car to an irrigation system. 'We've estimated that every person we loan to makes a positive impact on five people for their children and family. 'In the end, this money that came from my dad has really helped to change lives.' Ms Seth launched the charity in 2008 shortly after attending her father's funeral. Vashti Seth, 37, (centre) from Bristol, with four-year-old daughter Isla and her 14-month-old son Jago . She was living and working in Australia in the film industry at the time but decided to move back to the UK and stopped off in India on her way home. After discovering Deki wanted to start her own business, but had no means to do it, she decided to help her out - and her idea quickly flowed into a business. 'As I was going home to England from Australia I went to visit Deki,' Ms Seth added. 'I realised what she needed was the help to get her out of poverty, not just hand-outs as they're just short term help. 'That really got me thinking and I loved the idea of micro loans or small loans that could help people in need start their own business. 'With this in mind I thought that was a really, really good solution.' The charity has now gone from strength-to-strength and in just six years it has loaned more than £350,000 to those in need. Ms Seth said: 'We regularly have people writing in telling us how they are doing and it's so lovely to read, it makes the whole thing worthwhile. 'We recently gave £120 to one guy who was selling vegetables on the side of the road. 'With the money, he invested in a little stall and began selling things they didn't have in that area. 'He started selling toiletries and things and paid back the loan really quickly. 'He then took out another loan and opened a little hairdressers. 'In the two years since his first loan he has really had an impact on the community and his life. 'We get stories that people have been able to put tin on their roofs now and you think that's something so small to us, but it means so much to them.' The loans have helped a range of people in African countries, including Esther, from South Sudan who has been able to send all four of her children to school since taking out a Deki loan and increasing the profits of her business. She said: 'I smile everyday now.' Mother-of-four Colline, 32, who lost her home and possessions in the civil war in South Sudan, has also benefited from a Deki loan. Halima Namutosi, a South Sudanese refugee living in exile in northern Uganda, has turned her life around thanks to a £240 Deki loan. She is  is now able to pay for school fees and moved her family to a better house . Rose, from Nepal, (pictured with her family) has transformed her quality of live with a loan from the charity . She used the money sent to her to set up a small shop in her local village and now buys groceries and toiletries to sell on at a profit. Halima Namutosi, a South Sudanese refugee living in exile in northern Uganda, has also turned her life around thanks to a £240 Deki loan. She is is now able to pay for school fees and has moved her family to a better house. And Grace, 24, from northern Uganda, used an £80 loan to help her grow and sell vegetable products, which has helped support her livelihood. The charity has now become so successful that Ms Seth has had to employ four people on a full-time basis at her office in the Stokes Croft area of Bristol and has an army of volunteers and trustees ready to help.

"Taxpayers will have to fork out a staggering half a million pounds to fix four panes of glass in the building housing MP’s offices. Private discussions have been held about how to cope with the latest - and most expensive - setback at Portcullis House, the modernist glass ‘atrium’ adjoining Parliament which opened in 2001. It has emerged that MPs have approved £488,000 for temporary repairs to the damage, almost half of which will be spent on a ‘feasibility study’. Taxpayers will have to fork out a staggering half a million pounds to fix four panes of glass in Portcullis House, the modernist glass ‘atrium’ adjoining Parliament which opened in 2001 . A permanent solution in the coming years could take the bill way past £1million. The glass structure houses the offices of some 200 MPs and their staff, modern committee rooms and a vast seating area with a canteen, restaurant and meeting area. Its’ construction ran to £235million after massive over-spending, and the building has been plagued by scandals from persistent cracks in the glass to the £400,000 cost of renting 12 decorative fig trees. But the most expensive repair to date has been approved this year, after one of the damaged panels of glass crashed to the floor nine months ago, fortunately not injuring anyone. It is understood from House of Commons sources that around £38,000 was spent on making the pane safe. Another £210,000 is being spent on a temporary replacement for it and three other cracked panes. Finally, £240,000 has been approved for a ‘feasibility study’ by construction experts to work out how much a permanent solution to the roof problems will cost. The glass structure houses the offices of some 200 MPs and their staff, modern committee rooms and a vast seating area with a canteen, restaurant and meeting area . During rainy weather last week, large red buckets had to be placed on the floor outside the staff canteen where the panels fell in March. Tory MP Chris Heaton-Harris, who sits on the Public Accounts Committee said: ‘It is astonishing to find that this problem is going to cost so much to fix. ‘A very unwelcome Christmas present for both the Parliamentary authorities and the taxpayer’. Jonathan Isaby, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Portcullis House increasingly looks like a black hole for hard-pressed taxpayers’ cash. ‘At a time when we’re trying to find savings everywhere else across government, spending a quarter of a million on a ‘feasibility study’ seems like a waste of money, especially on top of the cash already frittered away on forestry and fig trees in the building. ‘The Parliamentary Estate employs an army of maintenance officials and engineers and it shouldn’t require extra administration or bureaucracy to work out a permanent solution. ‘Politicians talk a lot about fixing the roof when it comes to the economy, but when it comes to taxpayers’ cash it needs to be done as cheaply as possible.’ Its’ construction ran to £235million after massive over-spending, and the building has been plagued by scandals from persistent cracks in the glass to the £400,000 cost of renting 12 decorative fig trees . Portcullis House was designed by award-winning architects Michael Hopkins and Partners and was opened by The Queen 13 years ago. Officials were criticised after some £13million was lost to one of the contractors which sued Parliament over a deal to supply wall and window units. Then cracks appeared almost immediately and a section had to be replaced in 2005 for £100,000. More damage was discovered in 2008 and again in 2012, apparently due to hot summer weather, and anti-shatter film had to be applied to parts of the glass to stop shards falling on staff. A report from the Parliamentary Director of Estates just after the pane crashed in March and released under Freedom of Information rules, recommended repair work straightaway. It said: ‘A design team is being assembled to fully investigate the unique structure and design of the Atrium roof and propose any necessary long term remedial measures. ‘This is likely to be a major undertaking.’ MPs on the Commons Administration committee have - after meetings with Parliament officials - been asked to approve the costly work and feasibility study. A House of Commons spokesman said: ‘In order to identify and mitigate the risk of future damage to the Portcullis House roof, a professional specialist team is currently undertaking a detailed examination of all glazed units…and will determine the nature and potential costs of any remedial measures that may be required. ‘As we are always committed to achieving value for money for the taxpayer, the investigation will also identify the most cost-effective means to maintain the roof in future. Any implementation of remedial work will follow the normal ‘business case’ process.’","Almost half of the £488k sum has been spent on a 'feasibility study'

"Statement: Abu Abdel Malik's death was announced on social media by Algerian fighter  Abu Musab (pictured left, alongside another ISIS militant) A British jihadi who joined ISIS has been killed in Syria, his fellow militants have said - taking the total of number of Britons killed fighting for the terror group this year to at least 35. The extremist calling himself Abu Abdel Malik al-Britani is understood to have been killed alongside two Canadian jihadis during fierce clashes in the Syrian desert town of Dabiq. He is just the latest in a steady flow of British militants to be killed fighting for ISIS in the Middle East - a figure that has grown dramatically towards the end of the year as American-led airstrikes target the group's strongholds and Kurdish YPG and Peshmerga forces retake land from the terrorists. Today it was revealed that US-led air strikes in Syria and Iraq have killed more than 1,000 jihadis in the past three months, nearly all of them from the Islamic State. 'At least 1,171 have been killed in the Arab and international air strikes [since September 23], including 1,119 jihadists of the Islamic State group and Al-Nusra Front,' said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of activists and medics across the war-ravaged country for its information. Among the dead were 1,046 members of IS, which has seized large chunks of Iraq and Syria and is the main target of the air campaign. Seventy-two of those killed were members of Al-Qaeda's branch in Syria, the Al-Nusra Front, while another was a jihadist prisoner whose affiliation was unknown, an Observatory statement said. The remaining 52 were civilians. Abu Abdel Malik's death was announced on social media by a fighter of Algerian origin who goes by the nom de guerre Abu Musab and who claims to have trained alongside the militant in Syria. He said the Briton was killed in Dabiq alongside two militants of Canadian origin named Abu Ibrahim Al-Canadi & Abu Abdullah Al-Canadi. ISIS supporters on social media raised the possibility that the pair could be Calgary-raised brothers Collin and Greg Gordon, who joined ISIS in August having only recently converted to Islam. Details of Abu Abdel Malik's true identity are not known and reports of his death could not be independently verified. The Foreign Office said it was aware of reports of the death of a British national, but could not confirm their legitimacy due to the lack of consular presence in Syria. He is just the latest in a long line of British killed fighting for ISIS in Syria and Iraq in recent months - many of them having travelled to join the group after its declaration of a so-called caliphate in the vast swaths of territory it controls, and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's self-appointment as a caliph. Claim: Abu Abdel Malik's death was announced on social media by Abu Musab, who said the Brit was killed alongside two Canadian jihadis during fierce clashes in the Syrian town of Dabiq . Reunion: Abu Musab claims to have trained alongside the dead British militant in Syria . Abdel Malik al-Britani was killed in Dabiq alongside two militants of Canadian origin named Abu Ibrahim Al-Canadi & Abu Abdullah Al-Canadi. ISIS supporters on social media raised the possibility that the pair could be Calgary-raised brothers Collin (left) and Greg (right) Gordon, who joined ISIS earlier this year . Canada's Gordon bothers (Collin pictured) joined ISIS in August having only recently converted to Islam . The number of British deaths has risen dramatically towards the end of the year, as the fighter's naive expectations of Call of Duty-style warfare are replaced by the brutal reality of fierce battles with the group's enemies: Al Qaeda-affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra, the Free Syrian Army, Syrian and Iraqi regime armies, Sunni tribes, Shia militias, and a number of other rebel groups in the area. Their fight is made even harder by near constant airstrikes from warplanes sent by the U.S. and its Arab allies in Syria; and from America, Belgium, Canada, France, Netherlands, Australia and of course Britain itself in neighbouring Iraq. The greatest number of Britons killed fighting for ISIS, however, have been killed in street battles with Kurdish YPG and Peshmerga troops, who have been making huge gains in northern Syria and western Iraq since September, having lost vast swaths of territory to ISIS earlier in the year. In recent weeks there have been a number of reports of British militants expressing their desire to return to Britain having grown disillusioned with the reality of fighting for ISIS. Professor Peter Neumann from King's College London's International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation says he was contacted by a man representing a group of up to 30 British militants, all of whom wanted to return to the UK but were worried about being arrested on their return. He believes as many as a fifth of British fighters in the country could be trying to find a way out of their current situation and claimed less-hardened jihadists could be used to show would-be recruits that the reality of battle may not match the image presented by ISIS propaganda. Militants: Coventry teenagers Ali Kalantar, 19, (left) known as Ali al-Farsi, and Rashid Amani (pictured right as a schoolboy) were killed in Iraq and Syria respectively while fighting for the Islamic State . Jihadi: Rashid Amani, 19, had been fighting for Islamic State in the besieged Syrian town of Kobane when he suffered serious wounds from a US air strike . Sick: Former supervisor at Primark, 25-year-old Muhammad Hamidur Rahman (left), was one of four Portsmouth jihadis killed fighting in Syria. In November Kabir Ahmed (right), a 30-year-old father of three from Derby, blew himself up in Iraq killing eight people and injuring 15 others . As many as 35 British nationals are believed to have died fighting for Islamist groups over the last 12 months - although the number is likely to be far higher as reports of deaths largely centre on those who maintain contact with the West through social media accounts on Facebook or Twitter. The Home Office says over 550 individuals of interest to the security services have travelled to the region from the UK since the start of the conflict. It is estimated around half of these have returned. The first known death came over a year ago when Ifthekar Jaman - a 23-year-old from Portsmouth who described his life in the Middle East as 'five star jihad' was killed fighting for Jabhat al-Nusra. In September four British men  were killed in a single U.S. airstrike in the Syrian city of Aleppo. Among then was 19-year-old Ibrahim Kamara who was born and raised in Brighton. Other British fighters who have been killed in the fighting include teen-aged brothers Abdullah and Jaffar Deghayes from Brighton, East Sussex. Jaffar, 17, is believed to have died in October trying to overthrow dictator Assad's government. His brother, Abdullah, 18, died in Latakia province in April after leaving the UK in January to reportedly take up arms with al-Nusra. Their older brother Amer Deghayes, 20, is believed to still be in Syria fighting for Jabhat al-Nusra. Dead: Left is one of the last images of Ifthekar Jaman, a British national who died fighting  in Syria last year . Relaxed: Briton Abdul Waheed Majeed (white shirt) was seen pointing up the sky while posing for photos moments before driving a truck full of explosives into a prison killing himself and many others in February . In October it emerged that a fourth man from Portsmouth, Hampshire - Muhammad Mehdi Hassan, 19 - had died fighting in Kobane, the scene of fierce fighting between Kurds and ISIS. Three others from the same city - Iftekar Jaman, 23, Mamunur Roshid, 24, and Muhammad Hamidur Rahman, 25 - have also been killed after travelling there in October 2013. Another city that has produced a number of jihadis is Coventry. So far two young Britons - Ali Kalantar, 18, and Rashid Amani, 19, have been killed in US airstrikes on Kobane. Their 19-year-old friend Mohammed Hadi, also known as Abu Yahya al-Kurdi, is the only living member of the trio that travelled to Syria from the Midlands city in March of this year. Anger: In recent weeks three British men of African descent are known to have died fighting for ISIS. They include Abu Abdullah al-Habashi (left) who previously featured in a chilling ISIS propaganda video filmed in Dabiq, and Abu Dharda as-Somali (right) Names of other British nationals known to have died in Syria include Abdul Waheed Majeed - a 41-year-old suicide bomber from Crawley; Kabir Ahmed - a 30-year-old father of three from Derby who blew himself up in July; and Abu Abdullah al-Britani and Abu Abdullah al-Hajar, whose names are known but whose life and death details remain clouded in speculation. In recent weeks three British men of African descent are known to have died fighting for ISIS - Abu Abdullah al-Habashi, Abu Dharda as-Somali, and Abu Musa as-Somali. All three are understood to have been killed fighting in Syria, with Abu Abdullah al-Habashi having previously featured in a chilling ISIS propaganda video filmed in Dabiq. While the escalation in deaths of British nationals fighting for ISIS may way put off some would-be jihadis joining the terror group, it may not have quite the impact many would expect. Fingers raised: The third British man of African descent killed fighting for ISIS is Abu Musa as-Somali (pictured left alongside the aforementioned Abu Abdullah al-Habashi . The fear is that the deaths may actually attract more would-be jihadis to join ISIS, as young Westerners are sucked into the warped romance of martyrdom in the name of religion. Those killed are referred to my their jihadist friends as 'green birds' in reference to passages in the Koran that talks about martyrs living in the hearts of green birds in paradise. In fact references to green birds are so prevalent among Islamic extremists that the easily influenced claim to pray for death to come quickly to hasten their arrival in the afterlife. A Home Office spokesperson said: 'The UK advises against all travel to Syria and parts of Iraq. Anyone who does travel to these areas, even for humanitarian reasons, is putting themselves in considerable danger of harm.' 'The best way for the public to help is to donate to or otherwise support UK-registered charities that have ongoing relief operations.'","Briton Abu Abdel Malik al-Britani was killed fighting for ISIS in Syria .

"A mystery donor responsible for thousands of rubber ducks found with cash strapped to them across the world has been revealed - as a charity started by a British mum. More than 2,300 of the yellow bath toys have popped across the globe in 56 countries including Nigeria, Australia, Peru, Japan and India. Bewildered people have been picking up the ducks and finding up to £50 attached to them along with a message asking them to spread on the goodwill when they can. Ann Rowcliffe began the project after she lost her daughter Clare (pictured), who loved the little yellow ducks, to Cystic Fibrosis in April last year . Hundreds of people who have found the ducks have then left them elsewhere with the same message attached - and the craze spread globally. Now Ann Rowcliffe, founder of Little Yellow Duck Project, has now stepped forward to unravel the mystery. The mother began the project after she lost her daughter Clare to Cystic Fibrosis in April last year. She, along with the rest of Clare's family and friends, started handing out ducks to strangers around her hometown in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. Each one had a message asking the finders to visit thelittleyellowduckproject.org where they can find out information about organ donation and register their duck as found. People have been picking up the ducks and finding cash attached to them (pictured) along with a message asking them to spread on the goodwill . But the craze has since spiralled out of control and people have been carrying on the act of kindness by leaving the ducks in public places with gifts or money attached to them as well as inspirational messages. Incredibly, more than 2,300 ducks have been registered on the website's interactive map but thousands more are expected to be unregistered after they were passed on without the website address. Ann said: 'My daughter Clare was crazy about little yellow ducks. She had a duck umbrella, duck scarf, duck toys and even duck slippers. 'Clare suffered with cystic fibrosis. She was waiting for a double lung transplant, but sadly we didn't find a donor in time and aged 26, she passed away. 'Her corneas were donated to a young man and woman so that they could see again. It was an incredible gift and it made me think about other ways I could honour Clare's memory. More than 2,300 of the yellow bath toys have popped across the globe in 56 countries including Nigeria, Australia, Peru, Japan and India which have been registered online with the charity (pictured) 'On the anniversary of her death I handed out rubber ducks to strangers in our town centre. Each one had a label with information about organ donation attached. 'Afterwards one of Clare's friends Emma set up the Little Yellow Duck Project.' The latest duck to be found was discovered outside a Turkish restaurant in Tonbridge, Kent, last week with a £50 note strapped to it. A message attached to it read: 'I'm a duck and I have a present for you. Why not buy a friend a coffee, or treat yourself - you can do whatever you want. 'But keep me in your pocket, and when you can, put something else under me and hide me in town for someone else to find and benefit from your kindness. Let's be nice. Go be nice.' Office worker Neil Mitchell, 44, said he found one next to a pub with a letter and a £10 note in the same town. The charity encourages people to make a little yellow duck, such as this knitted one (pictured) and leave them for strangers . One creative 'duck' was even crafted out of an orange and some cardboard as part of the Little Yellow Duck Project . He said: 'I picked it up and looked at the duck and thought 'oh that's a really nice thing to do. I hope people carry it on and spread the goodwill.' Neil said he bought five lottery tickets with the surprise windfall and left them with the duck at a secret spot for someone else to find. The charity is also asking volunteers to knit or craft ducks out of whatever materials they can get their hands on and attach labels supporting the project. Ann said: 'The idea was for people to hand craft little yellow ducks and leave them in public places. The finder can then register where they found their duck on the project's website and get information on organ donation. 'I wish I could tell Clare that her collection and brave example have gone global. I know she'd be chuffed.' Many of the ducks have been found with differing amounts of money and a message attached to it which read: 'I'm a duck and I have a present for you. Why not buy a friend a coffee, or treat yourself - you can do whatever you want. But keep me in your pocket, and when you can, put something else under me and hide me in town for someone else to find and benefit from your kindness. Let's be nice. Go be nice.' Abi found her duck on a tour of the Warner Studio in Watford. She wrote: 'Thank you to the maker of this lovely little yellow duck. He was found today at Warner Brothers Studio Tour in Watford, England. 'I have called him Ian after my dad who died 4 years ago whilst waiting for a liver transplant. 'Had he received his transplant, I'm certain he'd have been on the Harry Potter Tour with us, but this lovely little yellow duck made me feel that he was with us all day! 'My mom, husband, daughter, son and myself are all registered organ donors - keep up the good work.' Craig in Colorado, USA, added: 'My pre-schoolers found this on our playground when we went out for recess. 'They were like, what is this, were did it come from? I saw what was on the tag and here I am checking it out. 'I am going to take Sneech back to school and explain who he is. Thanks it made them smile.' Angela Joss who found her duck in a shopping centre in Aberdeen wrote: 'What a lovely project for a lovely girl. So delighted to have found a duck today. 'We donated my Dad's organs, including his corneas, after his untimely death. I have always meant to donate blood but been too scared but am really going to do it this time. 'Thinking of Clare tonight xxx.' Lorraine Cairnes in Sydney, Australia, wrote: 'Left behind after a visit from New Zealand artist Val Griffith Jones.

"The damage wrought by a extremely powerful tornado that touched down in Illinois last year - as well as the steps toward recovery in the following twelve months - are unveiled in these remarkable photos. The images were captured by photographers Fred Zwicky, Matt Dayhoff, Ron Johnson and David Zalaznik, who work for The Journal Star. They show the towns of Washington and Pekin, which are both located in Tazewell County. They reveal stark changes, including newly-completed homes, as well as those still under construction, that were erected where residences were flattened and decimated last November. Three people were killed by an EF4 tornado and over 1,100 homes were either completely ruined or were severely impacted, according to the newspaper. Scroll down for video . Changes: Photos taken for The Journal Star show a ruined neighborhood in Washington, Illinois, in November 2013 and newly-built homes one year later at the same spot . Natural disaster: A EF-4 tornado touched down in Washington last November, though signs of recovery are clear . Destroyed: Wreckage is observed at a Washington, Illinois Devonshire development . Signs of life: The same development looks completely different twelve months on, with new homes and shrubbery . Havoc: A  Devonshire development home was one of many left in tatters after the EF4 tornado . Shiny and new: The development home is completely made over just twelve months later . The photographers' images show that many yards are still largely dust where grass once grew. The four photographers captured Washington both in the air and on the ground, as well as Pekin on the ground. In regards to several before-and-after aerial shots over Washington, Illinois, Zwicky wrote 'These image pairs are only separated by time – in this case, about one year. 'Emotionally, time is expressed differently. It is heartache, hard work and togetherness. 'These images only show a view of brick and mortar, but each house contains a family that has their own story.' Transformation: A man is seen at a ruined Pekin home in November 2013 (left). The next year, a new home is being erected at the same site . Shock: Deanna and Ray Baughman are seen in front of their ruined Pekin home with debris everywhere . New look: The Baughmans, along with their daughter Nikki, are seen together this year . Earlier this year, the photographers for The Journal Star also posted six-month photo comparisons. Speaking to Fstoppers, Zalaznik said 'In the weeks and months following the tornado… I think we all began to encounter difficulty in comprehending specific locations. On the first day, you are standing surrounded by rubble in what had been a neighborhood of houses. You are disoriented. 'Then after weeks and months spent in rubble, houses begin to go up and the disorientation begins again because you had just learned how to find your way through the rubble.' Dayhoff also told the website 'Some of the images were impossible to reproduce because of all the progress made in the ensuing year. In some cases, entire buildings were in the way.' Dayhoff also stated 'Returning to the tornado scene a year later was the polar opposite of the day it hit. It was lighthearted and hopeful, as opposed to shocking and oppressive.' Comparison: Dozens of homes were decimated last November when the deadly tornado struck. New homes are seen one year later on the right . Barren: One plot of land in Pekin was not redeveloped after its owner died six months after the tornado, according to The Journal Star . Makeover: Chuck Phillips (seen left in November 2013) was able to stand outside with his dog just six months later. Phillips is seen outside on the right in a May 2014 snap . Zwicky told Fstoppers 'One thing you always worry about as a photographer is the impact on your subjects when you show their grief and suffering. I photographed the emotionally devastated Baughman family shortly after their home was destroyed by the tornado. It wasn’t until a year later that I met them again. They warmly took me inside their newly rebuilt home, wanting to show me something.

"Irish judges will decide on Friday  whether they will order a maternity hospital to turn off the life support machine of a clinically dead woman who is almost 18 weeks pregnant. The woman's parents and her partner, who is the father of the unborn child, all want the woman to be allowed to die. However, the eight amendment of the Irish Constitution guarantees the equal status of the right to life of unborn with that of the woman. As a result, the hospital has ignored the next-of-kin's requests and has sought a ruling from the High Court. Scroll down for video . The case which is being heard in the High Court in Dublin, pictured, involves a 17-week pregnant clincally dead woman, whose  parents and partner want to end life support, but this is being opposed by the hospital . High Court president Nicholas Kearns, pictured, said he will deliver his verdict on the case on Friday . Five groups of lawyers appeared in the High Court in Dublin today, representing the woman, her baby, her parents, her partner and finally the hospital. The High Court heard today from lawyers representing the hospital that there was no chance that the foetus was viable and would be born alive. The court will hear from all five parties tomorrow morning and deliver their decision on Friday. High Court president Justice Nicholas Kearns said: 'Time is of the essence.' Three judges of the High Court will issue a ruling on Friday, however it is possible that this decision could be appealed to the nation's Supreme Court. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is in her 20s and is being kept in a hospital outside Dublin, which also cannot named. The woman's father was told in November 29 that his daughter had died although the hospital was obliged to keep her on life support as there was a foetal heartbeat. In the past, Irish hospitals have kept pregnant women on life support even after brain death in order to attempt to save the life of the unborn child. In the most recent documented cases, in 2001 and 2003, the foetus died in the womb after one or two weeks. In this case, the woman's parents and her partner have filed lawsuits asking the High Court to order the hospital to switch off the life support machine. If ordered, the hospital may keep the woman on life support for a further 17 weeks. The mother, who is in her 20s has been declared clinically dead following a brain trauma. The court case has reopened Ireland's fractious debate on abortion and the rights of the unborn . Judge Kearns said: ‘If we could have that evidence, it would enable the court to have sufficient information to be able to make a quick and timely decision.’ He said: ‘Time is of the essence. ‘The longer time passes, it might seem incorrectly to some to foreclose some options. That’s the last thing the court wants. The court is treating this as a matter of some urgency. But at the same time, I am hoping the levels of representation will bring home to people that all four corners are to be consulted and their views are being taken into consideration.’ He added: ‘This is a very sensitive case, and a source of great distress to the family. The court will take it very seriously.’ John Rogers Senior Counsel, for the woman’s father, said an application for her to be taken into wardship, which was raised last Monday, will be dealt with at a later date. He said that the main focus at trial today will be a full hearing of the father’s wish for certain court orders and declarations concerning the future care of the pregnant woman. The court has not yet been told what those orders and declarations will be. Mr Rogers said he would be relying on affidavits, including one from the woman’s father, and that he could be calling up to two members of her family to give witness evidence. He said he will be calling one or perhaps two medical witnesses. Conor Dignam SC said he would be representing the interests of the unborn. Barrister Donal Ó Muircheartaigh said he was representing the interests of the mother. Gerard Durcan SC, for the Health Service Executive, said it was an urgent and delicate matter. He said the HSE had been ‘scrambling’ to assemble all the required witnesses and evidence for today’s hearing, and to arrange two independent firms of solicitors to instruct counsel for the unborn child and its mother. Mr Durcan said the HSE hoped to be in a position to have medical reports from a consultant obstetrician, a consultant in intensive care medicine and a consultant neurologist. He said there would also be a report ‘from the treating doctors on the ground’ in the hospital where the woman, who cannot be identified, is currently. And he said her full medical notes would be made available. The court also heard that the consultant neurosurgeon who treated the woman at a Dublin hospital prior to her return to the hospital outside the capital, had provided his report and could give further evidence if necessary. Judge Kearns said he would hear the case, along with Ms Justice Marie Baker and Ms Justice Caroline Costello.","The High Court in Dublin heard the pregnant woman is clinically dead .

"A woman was secretly filmed carrying buckets and bags of hay while she pocketed more than £3,000 in disability benefits having claimed she could barely walk. Carmen Smith, 46, was caught during a survillance operation on the moors last year lugging the objects in heavy snow and freezing temperatures before sorting horse feed. Smith had initially claimed a disability living allowance legitimately as she said she was virtually unable to walk. She had told authorities she needed help with her personal care and could not move around without help . Scroll down for video . Carmen Smith was caught on camera carrying buckets and bags of hay while over-claiming more than £3,000 in disability allowances . Smith was caught during a survillance operation lugging the items in heavy snow and freezing conditions . But the Teesside Crown Court heard Smith never told authorities when her health improved, meaning she was payed £3,227 in benefits she wasn't entitled to. Prosecutor Jonathan Walker said: 'When her mobility and ability to function improved, she was under a legal duty to inform the department. 'There had been a significant improvement.' Smith told investigators she did not think her condition had improved that much and that she was suffering terribly from depression and could not do anything without painkillers. Smith, of Moorsholm, East Cleveland, admitted one charge of failing to promptly notify the Department for Work and Pensions of a change in her circumstances. Peter Sabiston, defending, said Smith's 'improvement was somewhat transitory'. He said: 'There was a period of improvement. It was relatively gradual. It was assisted by drugs. Smith's lawyer said his client's health had improved gradually and she was 'assisted by drugs', but on reflection she realised she should of alerted authorities to her change in circumstances . 'When confronted with the CCTV she realised upon reflection she should have reported it to the Department for Work and Pensions. 'She's lost her good character, something she'll never get back.' Mr Sabiston said Smith's financial and personal circumstances weighed heavily on her, and she now had to deal with her mother's diagnosis with cancer. Judge Peter Bowers told Smith: 'I accept that this claim started off completely genuine. 'Over time with treatment your health did improve, but you continued to claim disability living allowance. 'The amount that you were overpaid will be eventually recovered by the department.' Bearing in mind her personal circumstances, the judge gave Smith a one-year supervision order, saying she needed the Probation Service's help and guidance.","Carmen Smith initially claimed a disability allowance legitimately .

"Survivors of the Sydney siege crisis have shared an emotional moment in Martin Place, paying tribute to their lost friends Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson, whose lives were celebrated at separate memorial services today. Former hostages Selina Win Pe, Joel Herat, Harriette Denny, Elly Chen, Fiona Ma and Bae Jie-un comforted each other as they visited a new floral memorial, covered by a marquee, located just metres from the Lindt café where they were held hostage by crazed gunman Man Haron Monis last week. Supported by the Reverend Bill Crews and friends, a visibly emotional Ms Win Pe trembled with emotion as she placed a bouquet among a sea of flowers and stroked a photograph of Mr Johnson. The hostages had just spent more than an hour listening to tributes to cafe manager Mr Johnson at St Stephen's Uniting Church, around the corner from the floral memorial. During the emotional but joyous service, mourners sung Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life and heard amusing stories about Mr Johnson's upbringing. A packed service was this afternoon being held for fellow victim, barrister and mother-of-three Katrina Dawson, at the University of Sydney, whose parents delivered heartfelt speeches. Her mother, Jane Dawson, told assembled mourners: 'She [Katrina] was all the wonderful things people have said about her and more. Please don't forget her.' Her father, Sandy, added: 'She gave our family 38 years of joy... If only she could give her children 38 years of the same.' Ms Dawson's friend, pregnant fellow siege hostage Julie Taylor, said: 'She made me want to be a mother'. Scroll down for video .

In this picture, siege survivors Joel Herat and Elly Chen are seen leaving flowers for Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson . Return: Accompanied by the Reverend Bill Crews, siege victims Joel herat, Elly Chen and Fiona Ma today paid their respects . In his eulogy on Tuesday morning, Tori's father Ken Johnson recounted several hilarious moments from his son's childhood - such as when a five-year-old Tori bit a fellow infant at a birthday party, and was bitten by the girl in return the next year. 'He came into the world wearing bare feet and he never wore shoes - but always had a smile on his face,' relatives quoted Mr Johnson saying at the invitation-only service. While Mr Johnson had a person on stage to support him, he did not need assistance. Relative Debra Clarke said she was 'blown away' when Tori's partner, Thomas Zinn, addressed the service. She said she was left in hysterics by some of the stories told by Mr Zinn and Mr Johnson's sister, Radha, who recalled 'mucking around' with Tori when they were young and going on adventures. As they left the church, mourners were each given a sunflower. As the congregation filtered out from the church, they placed the flowers on the top of Mr Johnson's coffin. Buddhist monks chanted as this took place, in a kind of 'dirge', relative Debra Clarke, from Newcastle, told Daily Mail Australia. 'I've never seen anything like it,' Mrs Clarke said. Mr Johnson's coffin was placed in the back of a white hearse and taken to a site in Sydney's eastern suburbs. He was cremated this afternoon, surrounded by family and friends. A second hearse was filled with flowers. Funeral attendants carried dozens of bouquets to the new Martin Place memorial, as the former hostages watched on.

Several dignitaries attended Mr Johnson's service, including Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione, NSW Premier Mike Baird, Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore and Federal government minister Malcolm Turnbull. Guests were welcomed inside the stately building to a performance of Ava Maria and heard speeches from family and friends celebrating Mr Johnson's 'love, generosity and life'. The funeral site was just a few hundred metres from where Mr Johnson died in Martin Place. Tens of thousands of people have placed posies and condolence messages at the site in the last week, creating a field of flowers. Last Friday, Thomas Zinn, Mr Johnson's partner of 14 years, said nothing would have delighted him more than the extraordinary floral tribute. ‘When I was down there yesterday, I could smell the flowers through Sydney, and I think it’s just amazing he has been able to make our city smell like flowers,’ Mr Zinn told the Nine Network. ‘I think there is no more beautiful thing that he could imagined.’ That message was played at the beginning of today's church service. The immense floral tribute to Johnson and his fellow victim, barrister Katrina Dawson, was cleared by volunteer workers this morning. However, a new marquee flower tribute has been set up in Martin Place this afternoon. Written notes and presents placed with the old flowers will be kept for the families. The old flowers will be mulched. New South Wales Premier Mike Baird has said the government will discuss a permanent memorial with the Johnson and Dawson families when they are ready. A memorial service will be held for Ms Dawson at Sydney University at 3pm AEDT. Her three children have each selected songs to be played in tribute to their mother. They include Somewhere Over The Rainbow, The Gambler and - perhaps most heartbreaking - Santa Claus is Coming To Town. Members of the public hoping to sign condolence books for the pair will still be able to leave their messages at the Sydney Opera House. Tributes can also be left online here.

"A salon owner has been fined £3,600 after six teenage girls were left with puss-filled pimples all over their body following a visit to a bacteria-infested spa pool for a birthday party. Lisa Matthews was found to have been negligent after the girls contracted a 'horrendous' infection caused by harmful bacteria which had festered around the tiles of her poorly-maintained spa. The teenagers, who had visited the Kensington Salon and Spa in Swadlincote, Derbyshire for the special occasion, ended up contracting folliculitis - an infection which causes hair follicles to swell into pus-filled pimples. The girls were also left with painful, itchy rashes, while four of the victims complained of severe earache following the visit. Environmental health officers found the spa was 'significantly contaminated' with pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacteria often related to spa pools. In some area, they found the bacteria was at 24,000 times the acceptable level. Inspectors from South Derbyshire District Council revealed how testing records had not been updated for more than a year and that there was a 'lack of maintenance' at the spa. Environmental health officers found the spa was 'significantly contaminated' with pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacteria often related to spa pools . Inspectors from South Derbyshire District Council revealed how testing records had not been updated for more than a year and that there was a 'lack of maintenance' at the spa . Following the court case, investigators revealed how there was limescale on shower heads, as well as bacteria breeding around missing tiles on the spa . Ms Matthews pleaded guilty at Derby Magistrates' Court to six charges of failing to ensure the safety of her customers and employees. She had previously been served with a notice to address these issues before continuing to trade. Following the court case, investigators revealed how there was limescale on shower heads, as well as bacteria breeding around missing tiles on the spa. A report also found the tap to the foot spa was broken and that more than 100 mosaic tiles were missing from in and around the spa. Today, Lyndsey Watson told how her daughter Jemma came out in a 'huge rash' after the part in May 2013. The teenage girls had been enjoying a birthday outing when they fell ill from the bacteria . Magistrates said they were satisfied Ms Matthews had not done anything deliberately in breach of the health and safety legislation but that she had been negligent. Pictured: The salon and spa . Most of the skin is covered with tiny hairs which grow out of hair follicles. Folliculitis means an inflammation or infection of the hair follicles. The affected hair follicles swell into pus-filled pimples, known as pustules. Each individual pimple looks like a small, rounded, yellow-red spot. Mild cases often resolve without treatment but sometimes, antibiotic creams or tablets are needed. The condition - sometimes referred to as 'Hot Tub Folliculitis' can affect people who use hot tubs frequently. The hot water encourages germs bacteria to grow, particularly if there is not enough chlorine in the water to keep it clean. Bathing in this 'soup' of bacteria can increase your risk of folliculitis. The most common site affected is the beard area of men. Other common sites for folliculitis are the arms, legs, armpits and buttocks. She said: 'The rash which this caused was horrendous and it was all over her body. It was a total nightmare to see it like that, you never want to see your children go through that.' Matt Holford, environmental health manager, said it was 'crucial' for spas to carry out water tests regularly. He said: 'A variety of infectious agents are associated with the recreational use of water and these can affect the skin, ears, eyes, gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. 'Thankfully in this case the council's prompt action prevented other people from falling ill with what can be a potentially very serious condition.' Magistrates said they were satisfied Ms Matthews had not done anything deliberately in breach of the health and safety legislation but that she had been negligent. They added that her duty of care to her employees and customers and had fallen well below the expected standard. She was fined £2,500 and told to pay a further £1,000 in costs and £120 to her victims. Nobody from the spa was available for comment.","Lisa Matthews pleaded guilty to  failing to ensuring her customers' safety .

The 1986 Ferrari Testarossa driven by detective James 'Sonny' Crockett in the Eighties crime series Miami Vice is up for sale on eBay, with all the documentation to prove its authenticity. It was one of the fastest and most powerful rides of its day, boasting a top speed of 180mph and rallying from zero to 60mph in 5.2 seconds. Scroll down for video . Driving in style: The 1986 Ferrari Testarossa driven by detective James 'Sonny' Crockett in the Eighties crime series Miami Vice is up for sale on eBay for $1.75 million . Television history: Don Johnson as detective James 'Sonny' Crockett and Philip Michael Thomas as detective Ricardo 'Rico' Tubbs stand by the prized vehicle . Bidding will close for the sought-after Testarossa on January 7 and currently there are more than 600 people 'watching' the lot item. There is a 'Buy It Now' option; otherwise the motor will go to the top-paying customer. The car's current owner, Danny Lima, from Florida, told Fox News he purchased the motor around three years ago after discovering  it had been left stagnant in a Miami garage for many years. Before he snapped it up, it was last sold in 1991. Real deal: The Testarossa was one of the fastest and most powerful rides of its day, boasting a top speed of 180mph and rallying from zero to 60 mph in 5.2 seconds . Stamps to prove it: The vehicle comes with all of its service records, plus documentation back to the day it was delivered to Universal Studios . The white ride with tan leather seats was one of two Ferraris used for  filming in Miami Vice and it is listed with 16,000 miles on the clock. It comes with all of its service records, plus paper work back to the day it was delivered to Universal Studios. The MIAMI VICE VIN plate is also included. The show first filmed with a replica Ferrari to save costs, but when the car manufacturer found out, it donated two authentic cars. Ultimate Christmas gift: Bidding will close for the sought-after Testarossa on January 7 and currently there are more than 600 people 'watching' the lot item . Apparently, Ferrari had one stipulation to the donation; the offending replica  car had to be destroyed during an episode. Other well-known Testarossa owners include Elton John and Austrian Formula One racing driver, Gerhard Berger. According to the classic car insurance company Hagerty, a perfect 1986 Testarossa without a TV affiliation is worth approximately $89,000. That's about the same price they sold for new in the Eighties.","The car was one of the fastest and most powerful rides of its day, boasting a top speed of 180mph .

"The cost of petrol is set to fall again after a leading figure in OPEC contemplated the oil price dropping to as low as $20 a barrel. The RAC said unleaded petrol and diesel could fall by 7p a litre to 107p and 114p respectively over the festive period. Unleaded is currently averaging 114.07p and diesel 120.59p a litre. But it warned that cuts at the pump will be limited, however low the oil price goes, by the fact that tax makes up so much of the cost of petrol. Fuel duty and VAT comprise nearly 70p in every £1 spent at the pumps. Scroll down for video . Saudi Arabia's Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Ali Ibrahim Naimi has said oil production will not be cut to restrict demand . And the AA says motorists are still cutting back on their driving after being victims of ‘cripplingly-high pump prices’ over recent years. Oil has already slumped by nearly 50 per cent to under $60 a barrel since mid-June but could drop further following astonishing remarks by Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi. He is arguably the most powerful figure in the Arab-dominated oil cartel OPEC – the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. He has insisted that production will not be cut back to restrict demand and push the price back up. ‘It is not in the interest of OPEC producers to cut their production, whatever the price,’ he told the Middle East Economic Survey. ‘Whether it goes down to $20, $40, $50, $60, it is irrelevant.’ He added that the world may never again see oil at $100 a barrel. The Saudis want to keep their large market share of the oil market by keeping down the price. Mr al-Naimi said that if Saudi Arabia cut production ‘the price will go up and the Russians, the Brazilians, US shale oil producers, will take my share’. Oil analyst Jamie Webster, at IHS Energy, said the remarks represent a ‘fundamental change’ in OPEC policy. He said: ’We have entered a scary time for the oil market and for the next several years we are going to be dealing with a lot of volatility. Just about everything will be touched by this. The RAC said unleaded petrol and diesel could fall by 7p a litre to 107p and 114p respectively over the festive period. Unleaded is currently averaging 114.07p and diesel 120.59p a litre . ‘We have entered a scary time for the oil market.’ The drop in the price of oil spells good news for economic growth by putting more cash into motorists’ pockets. The International Monetary Fund says a prolonged oil price drop could boost global growth by up to 0.7 per cent next year and 0.8per cent in 2016. But it is infuriating green groups which fear cheaper fuel will put more cars on the road. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ‘The current reductions in the wholesale price of petrol mean we’re looking at 107p in the next two weeks and diesel 114p. Retailers should still be reducing their current prices over the festive period. ‘We think the oil price is likely to stabilise a little over Christmas as traders consolidate their positions for the break. The fall is expected to resume in earnest in the New Year.’ He added: ‘Even if OPEC keeps pumping oil far exceeding global demand, and the price of a barrel falls to $20, the tax paid to the Treasury on every litre of fuel fundamentally limits how low pump prices can go. Oil prices are continuing to plummet around the globe and dropped to less than $60 a barrel in mid-June . ‘This is, however, another strong indicator that we could be on the way to seeing petrol at £1 a litre if the oil price continues to drop towards the $40 a barrel mark in the new year.’ UK petrol consumption is still falling despite plunging prices at the pumps, according to Government figures highlighted by the AA. They show that in November 2014 UK drivers used just under 1.5billion litres of petrol at a time when pump prices fell to an average of 122p a litre. Yet in November 2013, consumption was more than 1.52billion litres at a time when pump prices averaged 130.4p a litre. However, diesel sales in November 2014 reached a record 2.50billion litres, up 6.1per cent on the October 2014 figure and 64 million litres higher than the November 2013 total of just under 2.44billion litres. AA president Edmund King said: ‘Once again, the official statistics illustrate the trauma of cripplingly-high pump prices over recent years. ‘In 2012, you could see the petrol consumption rise and fall in line with prices. Now consumption is struggling to get out of the rut created by drivers and families being forced long-term to adopt fuel-saving travel patterns to make ends meet.’ Mr King added: ‘It suggests that the savings from lower pump prices are being used to balance the books of family expenditure rather than increasing mileages. This points to the likelihood that much of the spare cash will find its way back to the high street.’","Petrol and diesel could fall to 107p and 114p respectively over Christmas .

"A husband has admitted stalking and trying to blackmail £2million from his estranged wife – the daughter of an American billionaire. James Casbolt appeared in court yesterday to face claims that he targeted heiress Haley Meijer, whose father is US hypermarket tycoon Hank Meijer. The 37-year-old was accused of sending threatening texts and emails containing pictures of his ex to her family and friends as well as posting images of her on the internet. Casbolt, attempted to blackmail Haley Meijer, left, whose father is Hank Meijer, co-chairman of US hypermarket chain Meijers. He was also charged with harassing professional surfer Tassy Swallow, right, by sending offensive and threatening Facebook messages . He also admitted charges of harassing two other women with offensive Facebook messages – one of whom is former Great Britain junior surfer Anastassia Swallow. Casbolt, who describes himself online as a ‘vastly unique individual’ entered the pleas at Truro Crown Court yesterday despite his legal team raising concerns about his mental ability. A judge heard him admit making unwarranted demands for £2million with menaces from Miss Meijer and causing her serious alarm or distress between October 1, 2013 and July 9, this year. Prosecutors claimed he sent threatening and offensive texts and emails as well as messages and images on social websites. James Casbolt, pictured arriving at Truro Crown Court, has admitted blackmailing his wife Haley Meijer . He also admitted two charges of putting a person in fear of violence by harassment on September 20, which relate to surfer Miss Swallow and another woman, Simone Everett. Both were said to have feared for their safety following threatening and offensive Facebook messages. Casbolt, from St Ives, also approached Miss Swallow in the street on the same day. Miss Swallow, 20, is a professional surfer from St Ives who represented her country four times as member of the junior British surf team. In 2012 she was chosen as an Olympic torchbearer and took over the flame from sailor Ben Ainslie at Land’s End. Earlier in the hearing, Jason Beal, representing Casbolt, asked for the case to be adjourned for the preparation of a psychiatric report, saying there were concerns about his fitness to plead. Judge Simon Carr warned that if the case was adjourned, Casbolt would lose credit for an early guilty plea and there would have to be ‘something quite exceptional’ in the psychiatric report to convince him otherwise. After a short adjournment, Casbolt pleaded guilty to all four counts on the indictment. Casbolt, who has also admitted possessing cannabis, will be sentenced on February 3 and was remanded in custody while psychiatric reports are prepared. An internet blog apparently written by Casbolt emerged yesterday in which he describes his past as ‘multidimensionally diverse and unmatched in terms of experience’. Haley is the daughter of Hank Meijer (pictured) co-chairman of Michigan-based supermarket chain Meijer . Introducing himself as ‘Michael Prince, A.K.A. James Casbolt, he boasts of himself as ‘an extremely knowledgeable and vastly unique individual’ who has ‘lived an extraordinary life, with a past that reaches back far beyond birth into another time’. It adds: ‘His unparalleled position, which comes from both bloodline and natural ability, gives him the opportunity to see more than the average researched intellectual, and connect more dots than even the most schooled historian.’ His wife’s father Hank Meijer is the chief executive and co-chairman of hypermarket chain Meijer and is said to be worth around £1.5billion. The retailer, founded in 1934, boasts 204 stores across five states in the US and has made Hank and his brother Doug some of the richest in Michigan, where the company is based. According to Forbes, the pair are worth an estimated £5.5billion. The family-owned chain was also 13th on Forbes’ 2011 list of America’s Largest Private Companies, and is now estimated to generate revenues of £9.7billion.

"Judge Jeremy Lea (pictured) said both parents, in their determination to fight each other,  had failed to protect their children from emotional damage . Four children became their parents' 'weapons of choice' when a marriage broke down and a 'war' broke out, a family court judge has said. Judge Jeremy Lea said both the couple were 'intelligent, well-educated and well-heeled'. But he said that in their bitter determination to destroy each other during the  breakdown of their 16 year relationship, they  failed to protect their children from emotional damage. The judge said on one occasion, the husband had forced his wife to drive after she had been drinking alcohol while their 5-year-old daughter was in the car. While the wife had threatened their 12-year-old with foster care. Judge Lea criticised the couple in a written ruling following a family court hearing in Nottingham. He said anyone who had heard the evidence would be 'rightly appalled'. The judge said the man admitted behaviour towards the children - 'in his efforts to hurt the mother' - which was some of the 'most damagingly abusive I have encountered'. The family were not identified but the father was said to be around 50-years-old, the mother in her early 40s, and the children were aged between five and 12. Nottinghamshire County Council started care proceedings after social workers became concerned about the children's welfare. Social services bosses asked the judge to make 'findings of fact' about the parents' behaviour to help them make decisions about the children's futures. 'Put bluntly, the parents were at war following the breakdown of their relationship and the children had become the weapons of choice for the parents,' said Judge Lea. 'The court heard evidence over five days ... Anyone who heard that evidence would be rightly appalled at how two intelligent, well-educated and well-heeled parents, in their determination to fight each other, have failed to protect their children from the damaging emotional consequences that can beset them as the children of separated parents. 'Moreover, the father has admitted behaviour towards his children in his efforts to hurt the mother which has been amongst some of the most damagingly abusive that I have encountered.' The judge said the father was a 'deeply manipulative man' who was 'prepared to sacrifice his children's happiness and emotional well-being in order to defeat their mother'. The couple had married in 1998 and shortly afterwards the father had a relationship with a 'long-standing girlfriend', and then a relationship with a 17-year-old girl. Judge Lea said the father had told their 12-year-old daughter about her mother having an affair 'in order to turn her against her mother'. And he had broken a court order forbidding him from discussing legal proceedings with the children 'on numerous occasions'. Judge Lea said at one point the father had asked his wife to drive to fetch a takeaway, and insisted she take their five-year-old daughter with her, after she had been drinking lager. Judge Jeremy Lea at Nottingham Family Court said both parents were 'intelligent, well-educated and well-heeled' He then called police to say he thought his wife was drink-driving. The woman was stopped and breathalysed but was not over the drink-drive limit. 'He was prepared to endanger his wife and child in order to advance his case to be the primary carer of his children,' added the judge. 'The father seems to have been quite proud of his actions.' The judge indicated that the father had written an 'allegorical' story about a 'Little Black Dog' and then claimed the story had been written by their 12-year-old daughter. In the story the 'mummy' character was described as 'colder and harder and meaner than ever'. Judge Lea said the father's behaviour was 'emotional harm at its highest'. The judge said the father had paid himself the 'compliment' of describing the story as 'brilliant' and added: 'The father's intellectual arrogance has no limits.' He said the father had sought to 'dupe' and 'corrupt the whole process'. Judge Lea said the mother had recorded conversations between the children and their father - then told the youngsters that she knew what they had said. And he said she had threatened the 12-year-old girl with being 'placed in foster care'. She had also accused her of being 'emotionally damaging' to two of the other children. The judge said both parents had shared details of proceedings with family friends and discussed proceedings with the children. And he said the children had witnessed domestic disputes between their parents. 'The children have suffered emotional abuse as a result of the disputes between their parents,' said Judge Lea. 'The father has encouraged the children to behave in such a way as to undermine the mother's care of the children and thus promote his own case.'","Judge said the behaviour was 'most damagingly abusive' he had ever seen .

"A volunteer football coach whose Ohio house was the scene of a party that preceded the rape of a girl by two high school football players received a two-month sentence Monday for violating his probation in that case. Matt Belardine, 27,  was one of six people charged last year by a grand jury investigating whether other laws were broken in the case of a 16-year-old West Virginia girl raped after an alcohol-fueled August 2012 house party attended by Steubenville High School football players. In that case, Belardine pleaded no contest to one count of making a false statement and one count of enabling underage drinking. Two Months: Matt Belardine, 27, received a two-month sentence Monday for violating his probation in the 2012 rape case of a 16-year-old girl by two high school football players . Violation: Last week, Belardine (on left) admitted leaving the state without permission and going to a bar, consuming alcohol, and being arrested on a charge of disorderly conduct in Arizona, in violation of his probation . He received a suspended six-month sentence and was ordered to serve 10 days in jail and one year of supervision. Last week, Belardine admitted leaving the state without permission and going to a bar, consuming alcohol, and being arrested on a charge of disorderly conduct in Arizona, in violation of his probation. On Monday, Special Judge Patricia Ann Cosgrove gave Belardine credit for 12 days already served, meaning he will spend the next 48 days in jail, said Dan Tierney, a spokesman for the Ohio Attorney General's Office. A message was left for Belardine's attorney. Sentence: On Monday, a judge gave Belardine credit for 12 days already served, meaning Belardine's two-month sentence was decreased to 48 days . Rape: Ma 'Lik Richmond (left) and Trent Mays (right) were found delinquent in the rape case of a 16-year-old girl . Cosgrove also ordered Belardine to undergo a drug and alcohol assessment and said he will be subject to random substance abuse tests until his new probation period of six months ends, according to Tierney. Belardine was arrested last month in Arizona at a protest over the grand jury decision in the Ferguson, Missouri, police shooting, according to media reports. Scottsdale authorities said Belardine was fighting with protesters. Belardine 'did not conduct himself as a 'responsible law abiding citizen' while in Scottsdale, Arizona,' contrary to conditions of his probation, according to a filing in Jefferson County court this month by the attorney general's office. Instagram: In the 2012 rape case, an Instagram photo surfaced (above) of two boys carrying the 16-year-old by her ankles and wrists, comments on the photo included 'rape' and 'drunk girl' Two football players were found delinquent in the rape case:  Ma'Lik Richmond and Trent Mays. Mays was sentenced to two years and Richmond was released after a one-year sentence and rejoined the football team this fall. Belardine was not charged with supplying alcohol at the party that preceded the rape, and the Belardine house was not where the rape occurred, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.","Matt Belardine will spend 48 days in jail for violating his probation by leaving the state without permission to drink and fighting with Ferguson protesters .

"A New York City man imprisoned for nearly 20 years for murder before a judge declared he was innocent is getting $4.75 million from the state. Fernando Bermudez told the New York Post   that 'the settlement will never erase the injustice.' The settlement was reached last month. The settlement is the highest figure for a wrongful conviction  the state has seen, Michael Lamonsoff, Bermudez's attorney, told the Post. Settlement: Fernando Bermudez was imprisoned for nearly 20 years for murder before a judge declared he was innocent and now he's getting $4.75 million from the state . Bermudez' conviction was thrown out in 2009, with a judge saying he had 'demonstrated his actual innocence.' The judge not only overturned the conviction, but dismissed the charges althogether. He'd been convicted in 1992 of shooting 16-year-old Raymond Blount outside a Manhattan nightspot the year before. The teen was gunned down near Union Square following a dispute with another teen inside the club. Several eyewitnesses identified him Bermudez as the gunman but later recanted. Injustice: Fernando said that the settlement will never erase the injustice he endured . Five witnesses who identified Bermudez later said in sworn affidavits that police and prosecutors had coerced or manipulated them into the false claims, The New York Times reports. Friends of his testified he was miles away at the time of the crime. In 2009, though Bermudez was declared innocent, he remained in jail for another 27 months because he pleaded guilty to a drug distribution charge. State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office says he's 'committed to ensuring that those who are wrongfully convicted are compensated.'","Fernando Bermudez won a record $4.75 million settlement from the state after being wrongfully-imprisoned .

"A ‘dead’ grandfather came ‘back to life’ moments before his family set fire to him on  a funeral pyre in India. Deepak Singh, 72, collapsed at his home in the city of Bhilwada in India's north-western state of Rajasthan in front of his horrified relatives after he went to feed his cows. Soon after his family received confirmation that he was dead they prepared his burial pyre and began a traditional chant which caused the O.A.P to stir, then wake up. Scroll down for video . Preparation: Relatives of the man who was believed to be dead saved him when he woke up after hearing the sound of them wailing while he lay on a funeral pyre . Doctor: Earlier a local doctor was called to the family's home where he told them their grandfather was dead . Sleeping? Deepak Singh, 72, seen here, was believed to be dead and was prepared for burial according to Hindu customs . His doting grandson, Banda Nalwa, 26, explained how the family believed he had died earlier that day. He said: 'He seemed fine when he woke up in the morning and said he was off to do his chores. 'But as he started walking over to where the cows are he suddenly fell to the ground. I rushed over and couldn't see any signs of life. I couldn't feel a pulse and his heart seemed to have stopped. 'I called the rest of the family and they agreed. We thought he was dead.' A local doctor was called to the house and he too confirmed Singh was dead. In accordance with the Hindu religion, the family began preparing the pyre  which dates back thousands of years. After laying him out on the pieces of wood and cloth, Singh's relatives gathered around him and began their death wail, the customary practice of saying farewell to a loved one. Nalwa added: 'As the volume of the wailing increased I suddenly saw my grandfather's body move. At first I thought it was my imagination, but then he opened his eyes and sat up.' Mistake: Deepak Singh is helped from the death pyre after his family mistakenly belived he had died earlier in the day while feeding his cows . Miracle: Relatives of the man who was believed to be dead stand around as they take in the fact that he was actually just in a deep sleep all along . Realising their mistake, Nalwa and his uncle Gulshan, 56, quickly helped the pensioner off the pyre. Nalwa said: 'Thank God we didn't set the pyre alight as it seems he had just fainted. We were very lucky.' Stunned Singh said: 'I know I can be a bit of a pain at times, but I hope they wait till I am actually dead before trying to set me on fire again.'","Deepak Singh, 72, collapsed at his home in the city of Bhilwada in India .

"Chris Christie has attacked President Obama for not doing more to stop Sony cancelling the release of The Interview after it was struck by hackers. He said the President ought to have called Sony and pulled strings with movie distributors to ensure the running of the controversial film - despite threats of 9/11-style attacks at theaters showing it. The New Jersey governor, a Republican, also attacked the President's recently-announced deal with Cuba, saying that America gets too little out of it and railing against the communist regime there for harboring criminals. Slam: New Jersey governor Chris Christie, right, attacked President Barack Obama, left, for decisions on the Sony hack and opening relations with Cuba . Controversy: The Interview outraged North Korea and prompted the cyber attack. The film includes a scene where Kim Jon Un is blown up, above . Christie, speaking on local station NJTV, said Obama 'made a mistake by not being assertive' when the crisis hit. The President said shortly after the movie was pulled that he wished Sony had called him first - but by then then all screenings had been cancelled. Christie told host Steve Adubato: 'It seems to me that it's the obligation of the President of the United States to call them. 'Sony made a mistake by backing off, and I think, quite frankly the President made a mistake by not being assertive'. He said Obama ought to have gathered executives from Sony, movie theater chains, and his spies, and asked them: 'O.K., what's the nature of the threat and what can we do to stop it. Is there a safe way to show this movie?' 'That's what a leader does', Christie said. Sony pulled in film after weeks of embarrassing revelations about the company, prompted by caches of emails and other information dumped online by hacking cell Guardians of Peace. The group - which the White House later said was a front for the North Korean government - demanded that the studio cancel the film, which ridicules Kim Jong Un, the country's Supreme Leader. One scene the hackers deemed particularly offensive showed Kim being blown up by a missile in slow motion. Material leaked online also implied it featured him taking part in a gay orgy. Christie also rounded on the President's decision to re-open diplomatic relations with Cuba. Asylum: Joanna Chesimard, left, was imprisoned for killing New Jersey state trooper Werner Foerster, right, but escaped jail and fled to Cuba . He said the deal should not have been made while officials continue to grant asylum to a woman who killed a New Jersey state trooper in the 1970s - and was a poor deal for the United States to begin with. He told the show that the move was 'unacceptable' while Joanne Chesimard, a former Black Panther member, continues to live free in the country. He said: 'These thugs in Cuba have given her political asylum for 30 years. 'It's unacceptable to have a reopening of diplomatic relations with Cuba, and unacceptable to even consider taking them off the terrorist watch list if they are harboring a convicted cop killer. 'She murdered, in cold blood, a New Jersey state trooper on the side of the road who was just doing his job.' Christie, who sent an outraged letter to the White House on the same subject this weekend, added that Cuba will benefit far more from the new situation than the United States will.","New Jersey governor said President should have been more 'assertive'

"British families are still poorer than they were six years ago - and the economy is not growing as fast as first thought, official figures revealed this morning. The Office for National Statistics this morning revised down its economic growth estimates for five of the last six quarters. It means the economy is just 2.6 per cent bigger than at the same time last year, down from a previous estimate of 3 per cent. But the ONS said despite the economic growth people are still poorer than they were at the time of the economic crash. People's disposable income has remained 'flat' since 2012 'and remains 5.6 per cent below pre-economic downturn levels', the ONS said . People's disposable income has remained 'flat' since 2012 'and remains 5.6 per cent below pre-economic downturn levels', the ONS said. It also revealed that GDP per head – measuring the nation's wealth divided by the number of people in the country – was 1.8 per cent below 2008. Shabana Mahmood, Labour's Shadow Treasury Minister, said the new figures were 'concerning'. She said: 'Growth has been revised down for five of the last six quarters, exports continue to disappoint and business investment fell in the last quarter. 'The Chancellor has totally failed to rebalance the economy as he promised. And working people are still not feeling the recovery with wages sluggish and average earnings in real terms down £1600 a year since 2010.' She added: 'Labour's economic plan will ensure we earn our way to rising living standards for all, not just a few. Alongside sensible spending cuts and ensuring those with the broadest shoulders make a greater contribution, that's the way to get the deficit down in a tough but balanced way.' The Office for National Statistics said the economy grew 0.6 per cent in the first three months of the year - and for the second quarter it was 0.8 per cent, down from 0.9 per cent. Third-quarter growth was unchanged at 0.7% though it saw the best growth in household spending for four years. But business investment narrowed at its sharpest rate in five years. The changes mean the recovery is not as far advanced as previously thought. The latest figures took into account new information covering trade data, government spending and other parts of the economy. The recovery is not as far advanced as previously thought, with the economy now 2.9 per cent bigger than it was before the recession, rather than 3.4 per cent . The latest figures, while disappointing, show that Britain is outperforming the rest of Europe - but still lagging behind the US . Household spending in the third quarter grew by 0.9 per cent, its strongest rate since the second quarter of 2010. But business investment fell by 1.4 per cent, revised down from a previous estimate that it shrunk by 0.7 per cent. The new figure was the worst performance since the second quarter of 2009. Meanwhile, the UK current account deficit widened to £27 billion in the third quarter, equal to a record 6 per cent of GDP.","Office for National Statistics revises down economic growth estimates .

"Forget prawns, this year it's mussels that could be all the go this Christmas. It’s an Australian tradition to have seafood for Christmas lunch or dinner. But never mind prawns; freshly shucked oysters, salmon canapés, and crab salad are also all passé - it's blue mussels that were the connoisseurs’ choice at the 19th annual 36-Hour Seafood Marathon in Sydney Fish Market. The event saw the first of the Christmas catch sold at 5am on Tuesday, with trade continuing non-stop until 5pm on Wednesday, Christmas Eve. Current sales indicate that produce sold will be up on last year's figures, and blue oysters will be a popular choice. Fishmongers throw ice cubes onto prawns to keep them fresh before selling them at Sydney Fish Market . A seafood vendor at Sydney Fish Market smiles as he takes a delivery of a particularly large fish . Fishmongers bid competitively for fresh festive seafood supplies at Sydney Fish Market . As usual at the fish market prawns are very popular with local customers in Sydney . 'If you're looking for something a little different and a litter cheaper, but still very, very nice, then the blue mussels are a good buy at the moment,' said Brian Skepper, seafood expert and general manager of Sydney Fish Market. 'There's been good supplies around for them. Having them in a simple white wine sauce is as good a meal as you'll get anywhere this Christmas. 'Our climate lends itself to have seafood for lunch. It just makes sense. Christmas is by far the busiest time of the year for us now as far as seafood sales. 'The next is Easter followed by Chinese New Year. It has become a tradition in Sydney at Christmas to come down to the seafood marathon and do your Christmas food shopping. ‘Even at midnight the place is really buzzing. You’ll often see a family down shopping together for seafood for their Christmas lunch.' Apart from the blue mussels that sell for between $7-$11 a kilo, the selection is huge. The favourites tend to be prawns and oysters. Over the 36-hour period about 120 tonnes of prawns – about 55 kilograms every minute – will be sold. 70,000 dozen oysters will also be sold – almost 390 Oysters per minute. Based on prior years organisers are expecting to have over 100,000 people visit the market during the 36-hour period. Approximately 600 tonnes of fresh seafood will be sold through the wholesale market and retailers during this time. the prices and tyoes of fish are put on display at Sydney Fish Market .

Christmas is Sydney's Fish Market's busiest time . Some fish look more like they have just landed from an alien planet rather than being caught in the sea . It's a Smörgåsbord of seafood. Depending on whether you buy a king prawn or a farm prawn they’ll range between $18-$40 a kilo. Pacific oysters sell at between $12-$18 a dozen. Sydney rock oysters between $14-$18 a dozen. In terms of fish, snapper, barramundi and Atlantic salmon are all the most popular. But winter species such as filleted fish are not worth considering during the festive season. For the big spenders, Eastern rock lobster is right at the top end of the market and range from $99-$100 a kilo. It is one thing buying the fish and another thing trying to pick the freshest ones though. ‘Look for product that’s in tact and has good colour. Fish should have firm flesh and bright eyes. They should have pink-red gills and should have a fresh seafood smell to it,' Mr Skepper explained. A large Mahi Mahi is shown off by two Sydney Fish Market vendors . All the fish on view have to be weighed first before going on sale at the market . ‘Then when you purchase your seafood it's critical to keep it cold. Bring an Esky, get the fishmonger to put a bit of ice in it, take it home and get it into the coolest part of the fridge. 'Providing you keep it below four degrees it’ll keep for well up to two or three days.’ He also advised people to come to the market sooner rather than later as people usually leave coming to the last minute. 'Generally there’s a peak at 11pm tonight (Tuesday). People go out for dinner then call in here on their way home. Early in the morning on Wednesday, which is Christmas Eve, is another good time to come. After that it can get very busy as most of us like to leave our shopping to the last minute.'

They . can then walk around different terrains, including mountains, forests . and caves and are . given blocks and tools to build towns and cities. The game was initially made for the PC but there are now Xbox 360 and mobile versions available. It is the top online game on Xbox Live, with more than two billion hours played on Xbox 360 in the last two years - and almost 17 million copies sold in total. In September, Microsoft snapped up Persson's company, Mojang - and the game - for an estimated £1.5billion. There is an annual Minecraft convention, Minecon, which is set to continue. But according to TMZ,  Persson - who previously sold his company Mojang to Microsoft for $2.5 billion - won the bidding war and bought the impressive home completely furnished, with each of the 15 bathrooms equipped with Toto Neorest toilets at a price of $5,600 each. Also included in the sale was an 18-foot onyx dining room table for 24 guests with place settings by Roberto Cavalli at a staggering $3,700 each. TMZ reported that the 33-year-old pop diva and the 45-year-old rap mogul had been 'the frontrunners in a bidding war'. There were four offers in total on the mansion and real estate agent Branden Williams was previously expected to close the $70 million deal with Bey and Jay 'by Christmas.' It is unknown what lead to the turn of events, which found Markus closing the deal 'in a lightning-fast six days,' according to real estate brokers John Aaroe Group. The impressive residence sits on 23,000 square feet and includes an attached 16-car garage and backyard patio with panoramic views of Malibu and downtown LA. Even when inside,  views of the the city's landscape are visible from one of the many floor-to-ceiling windows, and fold-able doors off the living room. The master bedroom features his and hers walk-in closets with plenty of mirrors and storage space for A-List-worthy wardrobes. Home movies take on a new meaning in a private theatre with seating for 24, while snacking on treats is right at your fingertips with a sweet shop stocked with cascading candy dispensers. And the grown-ups can store a substantial amount of bottles in the house's large wine cellar, which would have come in handy if the stars ever hosted a party for their famous mates.

"A pair of jets at New York's LaGuardia Airport got a little too close for comfort Tuesday morning, with one ripping the wingtip off the other. American Airlines Flight 1104 from Dallas was taxiing to its gate just before 11am as Southwest Airlines Flight 449 to Denver was departing. The left winglet — a vertical fin at the tip of a wing designed to improve airflow and fuel efficiency — was sheared off the Southwest plane after it made contact with the American jet's left horizontal stabilizer, part of the tail.

"One in three people agree with Nigel Farage that using the words ‘chinky’ and ‘poofter’ is normal, a new polls has revealed. But the Ukip leader is still in a minority – with just under half of voters insisting the terms are racist and homophobic. It comes after Mr Farage last week defended former Ukip candidate Kerry Smith as a ‘council house boy’ who ‘talks in a way a lot of people from that background do’ after he was caught on tape making a series of derogatory remarks. Mr Farage said Mr Smith (right) was not suitable to be a Ukip candidate, but was only speaking like people outside 'snobbish' London . But a YouGov poll for the Sun showed 49 per cent found ‘chinky’ offensive – while 36 per cent did not. Six out of 10 found ‘poofter’ offensive – compared to just over a quarter who did not. The councillor made a string of comments, including a reference to a ‘chinky bird’, mocking ‘poofters’ and making jokes about shooting peasants. Mr Farage initially refused to fire Mr Smith, who had been chosen to stand for the party in South Basildon and East Thurrock, but the candidate stood down by mutual consent on Monday. When asked about Mr Smith’s behaviour last week, the Ukip leader claimed he had meant no ‘malice’ with the remarks. He said: ‘I’m a bit sad because Kerry Smith is a rough diamond, a council house boy from the East End of London, left school early, and talks and speaks in a way that a lot of people from that background do.’ Mr Farage added: ‘If you and your mates are going out for a Chinese what do you say you are going for?’ Ukip leader said he felt sorry for ‘loutish’ Kerry Smith, who was a ‘rough diamond’ and meant no ‘malice’ with the comments . Sex education policy confusion . Dec 3: Nigel Farge: 'I think that people need to have a rounded education and sex education is part of that.'  The party's website stated:  'Scrap sex and relationship education for children under the age of 11.' Ostentatious breastfeeding . Dec 5: Nigel Farage: 'It isn't too difficult to breastfeed a baby in a way that isn't ostentatious.' Immigrants causing traffic jams . Dec 6: Nigel Farage: 'It took me six hours and 15 minutes in the car to get here. It should have taken three-and-half to four. 'That has nothing to do with professionalism. What is does have to do with is a country in which the population is going through the roof, chiefly because of open door immigration.' General secretary sex scandal . Dec 8: Ukip general secretary Roger Bird suspended over allegations of impropriety with candidate Natasha Bolter. He claims they slept together, she denies it. Rate an immigrant game . Dec 13: A Ukip game asks supporters to rate 'blacks, Muslims and Eastern Europeans' in a game. Candidate quits over 'poofter' comments . Dec 15: Kerry Smith forced to quit as Ukip candidate in South Basildon and East Thurrock after being taped mocking gay party members as 'poofters'' and referring to someone as a 'Chinky bird'. When challenged about whether he would use the word ‘chinky’, he said: ‘No. A lot of people would ... I don’t think I’ve ever used that word. 'The point is this – I feel a bit sorry for Kerry Smith because he’s a genuine fella. ‘I think even the “pooftah” comment ... the next sentence he was saying how good the candidate was and the fact he was gay would be an asset to the party.’ Mr Smith, a Ukip councillor on both Essex County Council and Basildon District Council, received a storm of criticism claiming he was racist and homophobic over the comments in a leaked phone call. But Mr Farage insisted he had endured a ‘tough time’. ‘I think we are very snobbish in London about condemning people, perhaps for the colloquial language they use, particularly if it’s not meant with really unpleasant intent,’ he told LBC Radio. He said Mr Smith had ‘used language that Del Boy used to use on Only Fools and Horses and nobody objected then’. ‘However, he is not suitable to be a parliamentary candidate,’ Mr Farage added. But Labour MP Madeleine Moon, vice-chairman of the All Party Group on China, said the Ukip leader ‘doesn’t get it’. She added: ‘Chinese people in this country will be deeply offended ... it’s not OK for a leading figure to say people can call Chinese people in their communities this offensive word. How dare he?’ The comments emerged during a torrid few weeks for Ukip after Mark Reckless, its latest MP, suggested on television that the party would like to see migrants who have been settled in Britain for years repatriated. Then the party’s general secretary, Roger Bird, was suspended over claims he had behaved inappropriately towards candidate Natasha Bolter, who also stood down. Days later, recorded phone calls emerged in which Mr Smith called members of a Ukip-linked Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender group ‘f****** disgusting’ and ‘old pooftahs’. He then referred to a woman with a Chinese name as a ‘chinky bird’. The latest IpsosMori survey reveals a dramatic fall in net satisfaction with Nigel Farage as Ukip leader . He also mocked Ukip’s Chigwell candidate Lucy Bostick for her leaflets, saying she should ask residents of the upmarket area if they wanted to ‘hunt peasants’ with shotguns. Mr Smith suggested he had been taking strong painkillers for a back injury at the time of the phone calls. But Mr Farage tried to laugh off this excuse, saying: ‘I haven’t found sedatives have had that effect on me.’","Ukip leader said words used by 'a lot of people' from ordinary backgrounds .

"A social worker who falsely accused an innocent father of abusing his six-year-old daughter was allowed to continue working with vulnerable children, it has emerged. Suzi Smith alleged during a custody battle that she had seen Jonathan Coupland, 53, attack his child. The accusation – made while she was ‘really, really angry’ – led to him being handcuffed in front of neighbours, thrown into a cell and banned from seeing his daughter. The Daily Mail revealed the case in April, and since then a disciplinary hearing has found Mrs Smith guilty of misconduct and ruled that her fitness to practise is impaired. Jonathan Coupland was falsely accused of abusing his daughter, Jessica, by a social worker Suzi Smith was allowed to continue working with vulnerable children . But she was not struck off or suspended. Instead, she was given a three-year caution order, which means she can continue to work with the most vulnerable children. It has also emerged that she was allowed to continue working as a social worker after making the false accusation. Last night, Mr Coupland told of his anger that Mrs Smith was permitted to carry on working with children. ‘I am shaking with rage,’ he said. ‘I feel disgusted. It is unbelievable. I was arrested for sexually assaulting the most precious thing in my life. Once you are tarred with that brush, that is it. People where I live think I am a paedophile. ‘But she was working with children again – the one place I would never want her to work again. She even got a promotion. What has she got now? Just a slap on the wrist. No parent or child should go through what my family has gone through. No sanction will ever be strong enough for her.’ Mrs Smith, 53, admitted making the ‘horrific mistake’ and was sacked early last year from her job with Cafcass, the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, which represents children in the family courts. She was jobless between February and June 2013, but from July 2013 until January 2014, was employed by an agency to work with children for Southampton City Council, where she dealt with issues of child protection and adoption. Mrs Smith, 53, admitted making the ‘horrific mistake’ and was sacked early last year from her job with Cafcass, the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, which represents children in the family courts; but from July 2013 until January 2014, she was employed by an agency to work with children for Southampton City Council, where she dealt with issues of child protection and adoption . The disciplinary hearing at the Health and Care Professions Council, in Kennington, South London, was told she was even given a promotion and did three other stints of agency work as a social worker for local councils until January, when she had to stop working in the run-up to her disciplinary case. Mr Coupland, from Spalding, Lincolnshire, raised his daughter alone after splitting from her mother. The former painter and decorator has fought a lengthy custody battle. In January 2012, Mrs Smith made a home visit and apparently clashed with Mr Coupland. Subsequently, she wrote the damning case note while she was ‘really, really angry’. She claimed she had witnessed Mr Coupland stroking his daughter inappropriately – which he has always denied and she now admits did not happen. Later, Mr Coupland was arrested at home on suspicion of sexual assault and questioned for about ten hours. He claims officers threatened to put his daughter in temporary care before he begged them to place her with his mother. The following day, Mr Coupland was told there would be no further action. Mrs Smith had been interviewed by officers and retracted what she had previously claimed. Cafcass, which is funded by the Department of Justice, sacked Mrs Smith and paid Mr Coupland £86,000 in damages. Mrs Smith’s husband Tim, who represented her at the hearing, said she was overworked when she made her initial record about Mr Coupland touching his daughter. ‘She immediately retracted that with the police,’ he said. ‘At the time of making that record Mrs Smith was in a mood. She was working 14 hours a day and had something like 40 cases on the go. There is no other explanation apart from it was just a horrific mistake.’ Mrs Smith said she had learned from what happened. ‘I have tried to establish a better work-life balance to make sure I am not overworked and that each of my cases get the attention they deserve,’ she told the hearing. She said she was ‘taking time to do less work but more accurate work’. Mrs Smith has previously apologised to Mr Coupland and said she was put under pressure by police to stick to what she initially wrote that he had done. Panel chairman Stephen Fash said Mrs Smith had ‘overstated’ what she thought she had observed. The panel found she made the false allegation, but did not do so dishonestly. Lincolnshire Police said officers were ‘duty bound to investigate’ Mrs Smith’s allegation, adding: ‘It transpired that the allegation was not as originally reported to us. The male was released without charge.’","Suzi Smith alleged that she saw Jonathan Coupland abuse his daughter .

"The Christmas Day revelations of life for German prisoners of war in 1917 were contained in the diary of German Army officer Johannes Rienau . It was a Christmas Day to savour. A festive feast including game and lobster, a sing song amongst friends relaxing in front of a cosy fire and of course the giving of gifts. Astonishingly, this was how German prisoners of war spent Christmas in 1917 at a luxurious camp in the Yorkshire Dales. While their comrades were being slaughtered in the trenches, the captured soldiers enjoyed snow ball fights, tobogganing and even ‘yodelling.’ For the 500 or so men held at Breary Banks camp at Colsterdale, the terrors of the Western Front were quickly forgotten. Fascinating details of life in the cushy camp have emerged througha long lost journal kept by German Army officer Johannes Rienau. He joined up in 1915, aged 19, and was taken prisoner in April 1917. Rienau soon discovered life as a prisoner was far better. Instead of fighting, prisoners indulged in a variety of leisure activities. As well as music, art classes and a library of 800 books, there were football, hockey and volleyball matches on the prison sports field. The camp was for officers – along with some orderlies to tend to their needs – and they weren’t put to work at all. Christmas was a magical time. Rienau wrote: ‘Outside there still lies deep and gleaming snow. This morning on the way to breakfast all stood spellbound at the splendid scene. It was a snowscape more glittering, brilliant and stirring than I have ever seen. ‘Snow ball fights carry on. In the south of the camp, tobogganing is taking place with much yodeling with primitive sleds or benches or tables. The snow balling has so far cost us a number of window panes.’ Christmas Day began in the early hours when a ‘quartet of orderlies gave a serenade to the whole camp.’ The soldier recorded how the camp commandant greeted prisoners at morning roll call with: ‘I wish you all a merry Christmas.’ On Boxing Day he wrote how they had spent Christmas in front of coal fires in their huts. ‘Having a rest – doing nothing,’ he recorded. ‘On Christmas Eve, one of my comrades finally received his guitar from his aunt in London. So yesterday morning we played in time together from the new guitar book.’ Lunch for the inmates comprised of ‘game with red cabbage and other fine things.’ These included Stollen – a traditional German fruit cake – and coffee. There was more to come. Rienau wrote: ‘On Christmas Day evening, we dined once more to excess – lobster in mayonnaise, spinach and scrambled egg, bread, cheese, and dripping and a cup of coffee. Then presentation of gifts to the orderlies.’ Regular food parcels from home also kept the prisoners supplied with chocolate cake, cocoa, honey, sweets, stock cubes, sugar and flour to supplement their generous prisoner rations. The officers even had their own camp bakery and vegetable plots on site. There were plenty of activities to exercise both body and mind. Rienau continued: ‘My body has been put back to rights. Volleyball in the morning, football in the afternoon.’ He also wrote: ‘After morning parade, I fought out a match of the long running chess tournament. The first game was lost the second was won with checkmate. ‘Outside hockey is being played. I have only taken part one so far, as goalkeeper.’ Dr Jonathan Finch, of York University, who has been piecing together the history of the Breary Banks camp at Colsterdale, said it was the best camp in the country in terms of lifestyle and conditions . Set on grassy slopes in picturesque countryside, the camp was originally set up in 1903 for 700 workers constructing local reservoirs. The Leeds Pals Regiment was posted there early in World War One before it became a POW camp. Dr Jonathan Finch, of York University, who has been piecing together the history of the site, said it was the best camp in the country in terms of lifestyle and conditions. He said: ‘It had piped water, electric lights and it was like a mini town or village, with all the mod cons of the time.’ When the first German prisoners arrived in January 1917 ‘they were virtually starving,’ he said. ‘There were two distinct types of officer. There were those who were very eager to find out how the war was going. But there was another group, including artists and musicians, who were glad to be out of the fray.’ A Red Cross report in 1917 stated ‘a certain chivalrous attitude is maintained between the British officers and the prisoners’ and named it as the ‘best camp’ for officer POWs in the country. After the Armistice, Rienau became a tutor and then took up ecclesiastical work back in Germany. His diary was inherited by Chris Taylor, from York, the grandson of one of the prison guards. He had the hand-written diary translated into English and later returned it to Rienau’s three children back in Germany - where the former soldier had died in 1971.","The revelations were in a long lost journal kept by a German Army officer .

"The makers of a documentary about Edward Snowden (pictured) have been sued in the US by  retired naval officer Horace Edwards . The makers of a documentary about Edward Snowden have been sued in the US by a retired naval officer who is demanding that they give up the £1.4m box office earnings. Horace Edwards says that those behind 'Citizenfour' should hand over the cash to the American government because the movie profited from stolen information. Mr Edwards says that Mr Snowden breached his duty of confidentiality on matters of national security and his lawsuit seeks restitution on behalf of the American people. The papers, filed at the US District Court in Kansas, seek to address what they call the 'unjust enrichment' of filmmaker Laura Poitras, who produced 'Citizenfour'. The documentary tells the story of how Mr Snowden leaked vast amounts of data about the National Security Agency whilst working as a government IT contractor in the biggest intelligence security breach in US history. Miss Poitras followed him in Hong Kong and Russia as he met with reporters from The Guardian newspaper to tell them his story. The Guardian is not named in the lawsuit but Mr Snowden is along with the Weinstein Company, the film company owned by movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. It says Mr Snowden's behaviour was 'morally wrongful' and 'dishonourable and indefensible and not the acts of a legitimate whistleblower'. Miss Poitras is criticised for 'hiding (Snowden) in her hotel room while he changes into light disguise, accepting all of the purloined information to use for her personal benefit financially and professionally'. The lawsuit lambasts all concerned for 'aiding and abetting the theft and misuse of stolen government documents'. In addition to the £1.4 million earned at the cinema since its release in October, Citizenfour has also been sold to HBO in the US and Channel 4 in the UK.

"Labour has asked the Treasury to start drawing up plans to levy its mansion tax on 100,000 expensive homes from day one of regaining power. Despite a revolt from some Labour MPs over the new annual levy, shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said he aimed to hit better-off homeowners in the next financial year. It is unusual for a tax to be introduced in the course of a financial year, but Mr Balls said he wanted to start raising money from the rich in order to plough into the NHS as quickly as possible. Ed Miliband and the shadow chancellor Ed Balls have vowed to introduce a mansion tax on 'day one' of a Labour Government . The shadow Chancellor said Treasury officials were already working on the proposals, in line with the civil service’s practice of making plans to implement the policies of parties that could win a forthcoming election. Labour and Liberal Democrat plans for a mansion tax had been in doubt after George Osborne’s dramatic reform of stamp duty at the autumn statement, which have made buying a home worth £1 million or more far more expensive. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said his party would stick with its policy of an annual levy – but suggested it might have to be amended following the Chancellor’s changes. Labour opponents of its version of a mansion tax has also stepped up their campaign to persuade Mr Balls to shift his position. But the shadow Chancellor, in an interview with the Independent, insisted: 'Saving the NHS will be at the heart of our first Budget. I would like to see that revenue coming in in the first year of a Labour government, before the end of the financial year. We will have to see the practicalities.' Chancellor George Osborne has called the mansion tax a levy on family homes . The Shadow Chancellor denied this would amount to retrospective legislation. 'A charge is paid in that year on the valuation on a date in that year. We will be clear what we are going to do in our manifesto. No one will have any doubt about our intentions,' he insisted. 'I am sure that the Treasury will be gearing up to make sure we can deliver this.' The coalition has sought to undermine Mr Balls's pledge to raise £2.5bn for the NHS through a combination of the mansion tax, a a levy on tobacco firms and reducing tax avoidance by hedge funds by announcing its own £3bn boost at the autumn statement. Critics also pointed out that revenues from these measures were unlikely to start flowing in until the middle of the next Parliament. If unable to impose the tax that early, Mr Balls said Labour would will legislate for the mansion tax to start in the following financial year, 2016-17, 'as a backstop'. Labour’s mansion tax will be about £3,000 a year for homes in the £2m to £3m bracket, with far higher annual charges running into tens of thousands of pounds for more expensive properties. To raise the £1.2bn a year Labour predicts, experts say an average charge of £11,000 a year will need to be levied. The proposal has been criticised by most of the Labour MPs in the running to be the next Mayor of London, given the capital will bear the brunt of the tax. The Conservatives have branded it a 'homes tax' and predict it will quickly be extended to cover cheaper properties to raise the forecast revenues.","Ed Balls says he aims to hit better-off homeowners in next financial year .

"If you received a Starbucks card for Christmas last year, you're not alone. It's apparently the last-minute gift of choice across the U.S. and Canada. The coffee giant sold over two million gift cards on Christmas Eve alone last year. According to the company, that equates to about 1,500 cards sold every minute. 'One in every eight American adults received a Starbucks Card last holiday season,' Ryan Records, vice president of cards at Starbucks, told the Chicago Tribune. Giving the gift of coffee: One in eight Americans received a Starbucks card for Christmas last year . 'We're well on track for another record performance in Starbucks card sales.' Starbucks launched its gift card in 2001, and the past 13 years have seen it soar in popularity. This year alone, $4 billion was loaded onto the cards. The company has even enjoyed success with pricey limited-edition cards. Last year, 1,000 rose gold metal gift cards sold in just six seconds. The $450 cards were loaded with $400 credit and granted the holder with 'gold level' membership which allows free refills on coffee and tea and numerous other freebies and discounts. This year, Starbucks is selling a $200 sterling silver keychain card, which comes loaded with $50 credit. They appear to be in more plentiful supply as they are still available for sale on the company website. And Starbucks is not alone in cashing in on gift cards. In a November report, the National Retail Federation predicted that eight in ten of us would resort to a gift card this year. Spending is up too, from an average spend per card of $45.16 last year to $47.87 this year. 'No longer impersonal or only about convenience, gift cards have become the perfect, practical gift item for millions of holiday shoppers,' said NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay. 'And, as the most requested gift item for eight years in a row, we're sure there will be plenty of happy individuals this holiday season who can look forward to treating themselves to something shiny and new come January when retailers start to offer promotions on fresh new merchandise.' And it seems they will be well-received too. An October NRF survey revealed that 62 per cent of shoppers would like to receive a gift card for Christmas, making them the most requested gift item eight years in a row.","Starbucks says 1,500 cards were sold every minute in the U.S. and Canada .

"A self-confessed sprout lover  forked out £19.99 for the privilege of chowing down a serving of Brussels sprouts measuring more than 10 inches tall and weighing a whopping 11lb. Lauren Jackson attempted to polish the plate of greens at Smokeys restaurant in Walsall, West Midlands, . But Ms Jackson fell foul of the festive food challenge. Scroll down for video . Diner Lauren Jackson digs in to the giant serving of Brussels Sprouts at Smokeys in Walsall, West Midlands . Brussels sprouts contain the compound sulforaphane, a product of the glucosinolates. While research is ongoing, studies suggest that sulforaphanes may protect against degenerative brain diseases and even cancer. This compound is also responsible for the bitterness of overcooked vegetables and is being investigated for antioxidant properties. Lauren's attempt at eating the sprout mountain was captured on film. She started off the challenge on fine form, but it is soon evident in the video that she struggled to cope with the tower of vegetables. In the end the Brussels beat her and despite generously dousing them in gravy, she was unable to finish her meal. 'I give up, the sprouts have defeated me,' she said as she chucked the leftover vegetables in the bin. Dean Key, who runs Smokeys with his brother, Dale, believes this is a unique food challenge. He said: 'We don't normally do something like this but we wanted to get into the festive spirit. Restaurant owner Dean Kay prepares the mammoth Brussels sprouts challenge . Dale Kay (left)  bringing out the giant serving of sprouts to customer Lauren Jackson (right) 'I don't mind the odd sprout with my Christmas dinner but I certainly won't be trying this challenge.' The restaurant - which recently celebrated its second anniversary - also has a mad dog burrito and spicy chilli challenges. They also previously ran a monster burger challenge where diners were expected to consume three pounds of minced beef, 12 rashers of bacon, a dozen slices of cheese and 12 onion rings in an hour.
