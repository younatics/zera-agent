Amanda Knox’s former boyfriend said today he will testify in the murder retrial if he is called and revealed his life has been put on hold because of the 'nightmare'. Knox's retrial over the murder of Meredith Kercher opened in Florence today - but neither the American student nor her Italian ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito was there to see the start of proceedings. Speaking from his home in Switzerland, Raffaele told the Today show he believes the authorities are going to destroy his life. 'It seems to be a never-ending saga of a nightmare,' he said. 'My life is still . on hold and I can't move on or make plans for my future. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Nightmare: Raffaele Sollecito told the Today show he doesn't see a future and he has had to put his life on hold because of the ongoing saga of the trial . Raffaele Sollecito told Savannah Guthrie: 'It is a big huge mistake against two human beings, we are innocent and we are fighting for our innocence' Refusal: Speaking on the Today show last week, Amanda Knox . said it was 'common sense' that she will not return to Italy for the . re-trial in the murder of her British roommate in 2007 . 'Actually I don't . see any real future for me...They . destroyed my life once, they are still going to destroy my life in this . period as well.' Speaking about his former girlfriend - who he had only been seeing for one week when Meredtih Kercher was murdered - Raffaele said he understands why Knox did not return to Italy for the trial and said he has no regrets. 'It's her decision [to come back], she is an adult and can make whatever decision she wants,' he said. 'As I said before, I never regret it, it is not her fault what is happening. It is a big huge mistake against two human beings. 'We are innocent and we are fighting for our innocence. I do not regret meeting her because she has nothing to do with this tragedy.' Sollecito had been dating Amanda Knox in Italy for just one week when the couple came under investigation for the murder of British university student Kercher back in 2007 . Knox was spotted taking a walk in the rain in her hometown of Seattle yesterday seemingly without a care in the world. She . said repeatedly in the run-up to the retrial that she will not return . to Italy where she is accused of murdering her British roommate in 2007. The 26-year-old and Raffaele served . four years in jail for the murder of Meredith Kercher, who was found . semi-naked with her throat slit in the flat she shared with Knox in . Perugia, Italy. Both were freed on appeal in 2011 but in March this year Italy’s highest court sensationally ordered them to face retrial. In . June, judges published the reasons for that decision, saying the ruling . by the appeal court that freed them was full of ‘deficiencies . contradictions and illogical conclusions’. Knox has said that her decision not to attend the re-trial was ‘common sense’. ‘I was imprisoned as an innocent person and I just can’t re-live that,’ said told the Today show last week. In . a memoir released earlier this year, Knox sought to portray herself as a . naive young woman railroaded by a foreign justice system and not a . callous sexual deviant as she was painted in many reports after her . initial conviction. Knox is not obliged to attend the retrial and can be represented by her lawyers. If found guilty, she would be able to appeal again, but Italy could apply for her extradition if that failed. On trial: Knox claims that Italian prosecutors made up the fact that she was a sexual deviant to bolster their case against her . Account: Knox has written about her experiences . in her book, left, which was released on April 30. In it she says she . details her friendship with Meredith Kercher, right, who was killed in . their apartment in 2007 . On November 1, 2007, the Kercher's . bloody body was found in the Perugia home she shared with Knox, . sustaining 47 wounds including a fatal slash across her . throat. Knox's seemingly bizarre behavior - joking around and kissing her Italian boyfriend Raffaele . Sollecito, who was also convicted of the murder before he was acquitted - made her prime suspect. Knox says she was never at home when it happened but was at the apartment of her boyfriend of just one week, Sollecito. Following Knox's and Sollecito's release from prison last year, .

A brass bell dedicated to the memory of the Sandy Hook shooting victims has been stolen just hours after it was erected in a playground. The 8-inch bell was stolen from the newly-built Masone Beach playground in Island Park village, New York between 9pm on Saturday and 1pm on Sunday, Nassau County Police said. The bell was inscribed with the number 26 representing the 20 children and six adults who were killed in the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut last December. Memorial stolen: The 8-inch brass bell to commemorate the victims of the Sandy Hook shootings was stolen from the newly-built playground only hours after it was built (pictured) An inscription on the bell reads: ‘Every time a bell rings, an angel gets its wings.’ Many playgrounds are being built across the region in memory of the victims. The two-day community project to build the playground was completed on Saturday, the same day the crime was committed. Police are now calling for information about the missing bell. On the morning of Friday December 14 last year, Adam Lanza, 20, shot his mother, Nancy Lanza, at the family home before he travelled to the small school in rural New England, armed with an assault rifle. Inscription: The bell, stolen from this playground, was inscribed with the number 26 to represent the number of children and adults who were killed in the massacre . Community project: The local community had spent two days building the playground (pictured) and opened it just hours before the bell was taken. Police are now calling for any information . There he killed 20 children and six educators at the school as he shot his way into the building. After firing off 154 rifle shots within five minutes, Lanza killed himself with a handgun as police arrived. The shooter: Adam Lanza, 20, went to the small school armed with an assault rifle and killed 26 before killing himself with a handgun . Recently the families of the 12 surviving children who witnessed the shootings each received $20,000 from the largest Newtown charity fund. The families of the 26 people who were killed each received $281,000. In a letter to the foundation in charge of distributing the donations, Newtown First Selectman Patricia Llodra said $20,000 is not nearly adequate for the families of the survivors, who are likely to need counseling for years. An investigative panel recently requested the school records of Lanza after revealing that he was a deeply isolated individual who bounced between several schools. A panel convened by Connecticut's child advocate office is seeking new information on Lanza, it was revealed today including the release of his school records. Lanza attended various middle schools, was homeschooled and appears to have spent a limited amount of time enrolled in high school. The Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting sparked new legislation in Connecticut and beyond on issues including gun control and school safety.

Mystery: Kidnap victim Carrie Lawson, who was abducted 22 years ago from her home, was never found . Carrie Smith Lawson has been missing since someone abducted her from her home 22 years ago. Relatives paid a $300,000 ransom, but the prime suspect killed himself as police closed in and no one ever found a trace of the woman. Lawson's family are now opposing parole for the suspect's cousin, who received a life sentence after pleading guilty to kidnapping but never provided any clues to lead authorities to the victim. Margaret Kubiszyn, sister of the missing woman, and father David Smith are rallying friends and supporters to flood the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles with letters opposing the early release of Karen McPherson, 52. The state attorney general's office also has written a letter opposing parole for McPherson. Board executive director Cynthia Dillard said a hearing for McPherson is scheduled for Tuesday in Montgomery. Members refused to approve an early release for McPherson during two previous hearings. Kubiszyn said McPherson is likely the 'last link' to finding out what happened to her sister, who was declared legally dead two decades ago. 'I don't think she knows where Carrie is. I think she might know of other people who were involved who could lead us to that,' said Kubiszyn. McPherson pleaded guilty in 1991 to charges that she helped with the abduction of Lawson from her home in Jasper, about 40 miles northwest of Birmingham. McPherson's cousin, Jerry Bland, was considered the main suspect in the case and shot himself to death in his home as police converged outside. Investigators searching Bland's property found most of the $300,000 that was paid in ransom by her family, but they never found any trace of Lawson. A judge declared Lawson legally dead two years after her disappearance and her husband, a Birmingham-area attorney, has since remarried. McPherson admitted she was with Lawson for several hours on the first day or two after the abduction. She also admitted being with Lawson while Bland made the ransom demand. Family affair: Karen McPherson, left, is up for parole after she pleaded guilty to helping her cousin Jerry Bland, right, abduct Carrie Lawson in 1991 . However, she maintained Lawson was alive when she left her in Bland’s custody and claimed she didn't know what happened to Lawson. She has been trying to get out of prison for years and attempted to withdraw her guilty plea in 1994, but a judge refused. In 2003, McPherson wrote a judge that she had the 'stability of mind and character' to be released and could only be rehabilitated fully outside of prison, but the court again refused to set her free. Relatives of the missing woman say they are worried the board might free her to prevent overcrowding at Tutwiler prison, Alabama's lone state prison for women. She has served 21 years and ten months in jail. Lawson, who was 25 and recently had graduated from the University of Alabama law school, was abducted after she and her husband received a telephone call early on September 11, 1991, saying her father was gravely ill at a hospital. Authorities say a masked gunman met the couple as they left home headed to the hospital, forced the woman to tape her husband's hands, and then drove off with her. The vehicle was found in a neighboring county, and Bland killed himself about three weeks later after being identified as a suspect. Officers at the time were outside the home, which already had been searched. 'How could they do that, leave the guns inside?' said Kubiszyn. 'It was all very strange.' Lawson, originally from Cleveland, Tennessee, was never found despite repeated searches of old mines and roadsides and years of work by a private investigator hired by her father. 'I don't know that I think that we'll ever find Carrie, but I know where she is,' said Kubiszyn. 'She's in heaven.'","Carrie Lawson's relatives paid her abductor $300,000 ransom for her safe return .

But peer a little closer and these mundane objects so typically overlooked contain an entire world - that is, if Brazilian artist William Kass has anything to do with it. From an ice cream cone to a man's shaving brush, the imaginative architect, 32, creates familiar scenes from films and everyday life using food and household objects as substitutes for the scenery. 'Spring break on a plate': Cauliflower, biscuits and fruit loops cereal are used to create a vision of palm trees, rubber rings and sandy beach bars in this particular piece . Hikers struggle to reach the peak of this corn cob 'mountain' while 'Shaving Brush Savannah' shows a man wading through the 'grass' of a brush to hunt down a stag . He photographs tiny figurines in his carefully constructed sets to create a series of eye-catching images. Just one of the mini marvels can take William, from Sao Paulo, Brazil, up to three days to complete as he painstakingly arranges and lights the scenes in his home office turned studio. He said: 'I started my work this year, the project is called Minimize. 'I am an architect and I wanted to use my skills to create something which shows humans in a surreal, macro world. Under fire: Soldiers walk through a paint-splattered war zone, shielding themselves as they are attacked from above . Dancing in the rain! A ballet dancer gracefully spins while surrounded by water encircling her - the illusion of a rainy day was created by placing her on top of a shower head . 'My work can be a way to draw attention to the small details of our daily life using foods and daily objects as a scenery. 'I buy small dolls which I use in each of my images. I use the dolls and create a scene for them using everyday objects or food. 'In some cases I try to do a remake of a movie scene. 'Depending on the scene, I can spend anywhere between one and three days creating each image.' In one image neighbours can be seen mowing and trimming their 'gardens', which are actually hairy cocount shells. Another different world shows a pair of spacesuit-clad people trekking through a wild territory to investigate a body in a time-shell - but further inspection reveals that it is a pair of models wading through spaghetti to peer inside half of a cherry tomato. Abandon ship: A scene from The Titanic is produced using upside down wafer cones, with blocks of ice creams, as a replica of the ship sinks in the background. All aboard! These figures dash between the pillars of a train station - which is actually made up of wine corks carefully balanced on a wooden floor . The Untouchables is given a whole new spin as the steps with the buggy falling down the steps are actually stairs made from crackers . For . another of his images, William Kass uses the inside of a watermelon as . the setting for a scene showing the first man on Mars and in another he . uses ice-cream cones as icebergs to show the sinking of the Titanic. 'I have a home office, which doubles up as a studio, but I'm looking for a place outside of my house to continue my work,' he said. 'The main difficulties I face when creating my work are when I use food to create the scenarios as the food spoils easily. 'For example for the image called Titanic, I used real ice cream, so I had to study the lighting before as the ice cream melts too fast. Into the unknown: Spacemen wade across the alien land to inspect a time capsule - created from strands of pasta and cherry tomatoes . Emergency! Firefighters tackle a blaze in a matchbox, as they try and clamber through a smouldering pile of charred matchsticks . Tending to the fields: Miniature mowers tend to their coconut lawns as they snip hairs on the shells and rake in the straggly fine threads . Party time! These dancers are surrounded by bright lights and look like they're having fun - undoubtedly helped by the thrill of perching on a bunch of grapes . 'Every scene that I imagine is a challenge. Most of the time, when I'm producing the scene, it ends up a little bit different than I first imagined. 'My favourite image is the ""Shaving brush Savannah"" because of the simplicity of the image, it's simple but at the same time it is also a strong image. 'I also like the ""Spring Break"" because of the composition. 'Since the beginning of this year I've been working full time on my photography creating images for the art and advertising markets.' 'For me, this project is great. I'm loving this series. 'It is constantly a work in progress as I continue to come up with new ideas for scenes.'","William Kass creates everyday scenes using food and household objects as substitutes for the scenery .

Two Marine generals have been fired over the security lapses that allowed 15 Taliban insurgents to infiltrate the NATO base in Afghanistan where Prince Harry was housed last September. The attack claimed the lives of two U.S. Marines, including a Lieutenant Colonel, and destroyed six $24million Harrier jets and a C-130 transport plane - the largest single loss of American air power since the Vietnam War. Major General Charles 'Mark' Gurganus, the commander of Regional Command Southwest in Afghanistan, and Major General Gregg Sturdevant, the commander of the Marines' aviation wing, have both been asked to retire, it was revealed today. Major General Charles 'Mark' Gurganus, (left) the commander of Regional Command Southwest in Afghanistan, and Major General Gregg Sturdevant, (right) the commander of the Marines' aviation wing, have both been asked to retire . Target: The Taliban said that Prince Harry, who was stationed at Camp Bastion, was a target of the attackers . Marine Corps Commandant General James Amos demanded the resignation of the two commanders because they failed to ensure security at the base. On September 14, 2012, 15 Taliban insurgents, dressed in U.S. military uniforms, slipped under a fence at the military outpost in Helmand Province. Taliban propagandists said the Camp Bastion attackers intended to find and assassinate Prince Harry, who was living at the compound. There have been conflicting reports as to whether Captain Wales, the fourth in line to the throne, was sent to a safe room or whether he was treated like any other soldier during the four-hour gun battle. Prince Harry is the pilot of an Apache helicopter gunship. However, the team targeted numerous NATO aircraft, destroying or heavily damaging more than a dozen and causing hundreds of millions of dollars in damage. Reliving the day: Details of the September 2012 raid were state secrets until now . USA Today reports that General Amos said : 'In their duty to protect their forces these two generals did not meet that standard.' Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Raible, 40, was killed when he mustered a counter attack against the invaders and charged armed only with his sidearm. Marine Sergeant Bradley Atwell, 27, was killed, as well. American Marines and members of the British Royal Air Force killed 14 of the attackers and captured one. General Gurganus was in charge of ensuring that the American aircraft were secure from assault. He requested more Marines for base security, but was denied. Still, commanders say the general left base guard towers unoccupied and other defenses under-manned. General Sturdevant was faulted for assuming other units would protect his aircraft wing and not setting up security measures of his own.","Major General Charles 'Mark' Gurganus and Major General Gregg Sturdevant have both been asked to retire over the September 2012 attack .

He has suffered from chronic foot pain since birth, but now 13-year-old Kaleo Niko will move with ease after making the brave choice to have both legs amputated. The Colorado teenager was born with Arthrogryposis, a rare muscular disorder that made running and walking unbearable. When the pain grew worse after four surgeries, the eighth-grader consulted doctors and even amputee Olympic climber Craig Demartino before deciding to remove his legs below the knee and get prosthetics. Brave: Kaleo Niko, 13, chose to have his legs amputated rather than continue to deal with the chronic pain caused by his rare muscle disease, Arthrogryposis . Heartbreaking: Kaleo Niko, 13, said he was initially really scared at first, but feels good after the operation . Kaleo . had the amputation surgery on September 3 at Shriners Hospital for Children in . Salt Lake City, Utah. The . hospital will cover the cost of the surgery and first set of . prosthetics, which will be fitted on October 21 - just days before . Kaleo's 14th birthday. 'Every time I walked, it hurt my ankles and feet. If I . walked a lot, I'd get stabbing pains in my legs,' the Walt Clark Middle School student told Reporter-Herald. 'When the doctor first brought up amputation, I didn't want to even hear about it.' 'I was really scared at first. And when I woke up I was good,' he told RTV6. Supportive: Kaleo Niko is surrounded by family Shriner¿s Hospital for Children, which is covering the cost of the surgery and the first set of prosthetics . Phantom limbs: Kaleo Niko had both legs amputated below the knee and said he feels like he can still 'wriggle his toes' even though he no longer has them . Devoted: Kaleo Niko's mother, Helen Niko, said doctors detected her son's disease before he was born and gave her the option to have an abortion . Influential: Kaleo reportedly consulted amputee Olympic climber Craig DeMartino on whether he should proceed with amputation . Kaleo said he was at peace with the difficult decision because it meant he would finally be able to keep up with friends. Even though he enjoyed swimming, . golfing, basketball, and bowling, Kaleo said he couldn’t do any of them . for more than a few minutes at a time. 'I couldn’t keep up with my friends. Sometimes, I just had to sit out and watch them,' he said. Kaleo's supportive mother Helen Niko said doctors had diagnosed her son's condition while she was pregnant and gave her the option to have an abortion. 'I just can’t imagine not . having him here,' she said. 'There were a lot of tests thrown at us and . whatnot. They wanted us to be fully aware of what we were getting into, . in case we wanted to abort. We just refused.' She said she was worried about . amputation, but  also knew this sort of pain was something a . mother’s hug could not fix. 'As a parent you want to be able to take that pain, but there are some that you can’t,' she told ksn.com. 'I remember one night, he looked at me, . crying, and he said ‘I’m done'. 'It was just time. He was ready. He wanted to see what life was like with two working feet.' Kaleo underwent his first surgery at . 13 months for bilateral clubfoot correction, which he had every four . years again at ages four, eight and 12. Over time, his heel would lift, causing him to walk on his toes and requiring another surgery. Now, with both legs removed and new prosthetics, Kaleo will be able to get back to being a kid without the chronic pain.

One road town: Prince Harry is training at an air force base just outside the tiny desert community of Gila Bend, Arizona . The prince poses in front of an Apache helicopter earlier this year. He will stay at Gila Bend as part of a 12-week RAF Apache training course . Meeting the locals: Prince Harry wooed Jes Donaldson in San Diego last month . 'There are probably some fathers here . who would go to extremes to protect their daughters,' said Mr Henry, . 64. Helicopter pilot Harry, 27, was sent . to Gila Bend last week, as the conditions mimic those he could face in . Afghanistan. He will live at a nearby base for the next month. It is a contrast to the past four . weeks he spent at the El Centro base in California where he could enjoy . the nightlife of San Diego. 'Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and we have some very pretty girls here. 'It is a very quiet town with a lot of good Christian people. This isn't a party town.' The sleepy town - a former stagecoach . stop - has just 1,700 residents, one bar - and a £60 a night hotel . designed to look like a Space Ship. It enjoys a minor notability among . aficionados of roadside attractions for its quirky welcome sign which . boasts the conurbation is 'home to 17000 friendly people and 5 old . crabs'. But party central it isn't. The reason why, however, it is such . an attraction for the British military is that its soaring daily . temperatures - well over 110F - bitterly cold nights and arid conditions. The prince will live at the local . Gila Bend Air Force Auxiliary Field base for the next month while he . hones his skills and on Friday night he was seen at a local pizza . restaurant enjoying something to eat - and a couple of beers - with his . fellow recruits. Owner of the Little Italia, Antonino . Buccellato, said he was one of 30 pilots who stopped off for a bit to . eat, ordering a 'meat lovers' pizza and telling the manager 'that's the . best pizza in the world'. 'The customers recognised him but they were polite and no-one stared,' he said. Waitress Michelle Green, 37, added: . 'He was a gentleman. Gila Bend is a nice small town. But we don't even . have a movie theatre to take a girl on a date.' It was a relatively quiet night for . Harry, who has lived up to his wild reputation while stationed for the . past four weeks at the El-Centro base in California, a few hours drive . away. All there is: Bartender Brigette Mowry works at Netos, the only nightlife option in Gila Bend . Local lifestyle: Cowboy Terrell Farnsworth hasn't even heard of Prince 'Henry' He has regularly been seen enjoying . the nightlife of San Diego and is even said to have romanced 26-year-old . cocktail waitress Jess Donaldson, who boasts a large rose tattoo across . her midriff - and an even bigger boyfriend. Although Miss Donaldson has . vehemently denied a liaison, the pair were photographed apparently . kissing at a gig in the Belly Up Tavern before heading back to Harry's . suite at the nearby Marriott Courtyard hotel. Fortunately - or not, as the case may be - Gila Bend offers less in the way of nightlife. New home: The prince will live at the local Gila Bend Air Force Auxiliary Field base for the next month . Barren: A rusty bridge just outside Gila Bend - the terrain in the location is said to be similar to Afghanistan . Party boy: Prince Harry as he strutted his stuff barefoot on the side of an swimming pool at a Croatian nightspot during a summer holiday . Brigette Mowry, 45, bartender at . Netos, the town's only bar, said: 'Sometimes the British pilots come in . here and play pool or have a beer. 'If we put on a karaoke night that'll be the only chance of meeting any local girls.' Mayor Henry added: 'It is a pretty quiet nightlife scene here in Gila Bend. 'I would advise the Prince to take in the beautiful sights of the desert instead.' While Space Age Lodge waitress Renee . Vidana, 38, warned that 'here are a lot of girls in town who would kill . to meet a British prince, I think he is going to be swamped when he . comes here', others are less impressed. Cowboy Terrell Farnsworth, 49, interviewed on his horse, said: 'I have no idea who Prince Henry [sic] is.","Gila Bend was chosen by the MoD for .

Gunmen killed at least 40 people today in an attack on a college in northeast Nigeria, witnesses say, in a region where Islamist militants have targeted schools and universities. Islamist sect Boko Haram has intensified attacks on civilian targets in recent weeks in reaction to a military offensive against its insurgency. Boko Haram and spin-off Islamist groups like the al Qaeda-linked Ansaru have become the biggest security threat to the nation which is also Africa's second largest economy and top oil exporter. Scroll down for video . Devastation: Rescue workers and family members gather to identify the shrouded bodies of students killed this morning in an attack on an agricultural college . Gunmen stormed the College of Agriculture in Yobe state and shot students as they slept in the early hours of this morning, state police commissioner Sanusi Rufai said. They also set fire to classrooms, a military spokesman in Yobe state, Lazarus Eli, told Agence France-Presse. One witness counted 40 bodies at the main hospital in Yobe state capital Damaturu, and politicians claim that victims, most of whom were young men, were taken in van loads. Boko Haram is fighting to overthrow . Nigeria's government to create an Islamic state, and has launched a . number of attacks on schools including a raid which killed 27 students and a teacher at a school in Potiskum, a town about 30 miles from the site of today's attack. The group's name translates as 'Western education is forbidden' and regard schools as a symbol of Western culture. The College of Agriculture in Gujba in northern Nigeria has become the scene of the latest in a string of school attacks by Boko Haram . Across Nigeria thousands have been . killed since Boko Haram launched its uprising against the state in 2009, . turning itself from a clerical movement opposed to Western culture into . an armed militia with growing links to al Qaeda's West African wing. In May Nigerian President Goodluck . Jonathan declared a state of emergency in three northeastern states . including Yobe, and ordered a military offensive aimed at crushing Boko . Haram's insurgency. There was an initial lull in the violence as Islamists fled bases in cities, forests and mountains across the northeast. Dark times: In May President Goodluck Jonathan declared a state of emergency across three northern states of the country as a result of Boko Haram activities . Then the militants began revenge attacks on schools and then on the security forces and civilians believed to be helping them. In June, Boko Haram carried out two attacks on schools in the region. At least nine children were killed in a school on the outskirts of Maiduguri, while 13 students and teachers were killed in a school in Damaturu. In July in the village of Mamudo in Yobe state, Islamist militants attacked a school's dormitories with guns and explosives, killing at least 42 people, mostly students. Boko Haram is led by Abubakar Shekau, in August reports surfaced that the Nigerian military had killed him in a shoot-out but a video released last week purportedly showed him alive.","Boko Haram gunmen entered the dorm in the early hours of this morning and open fire and kill at least 40 as they slept .

A Chinese school has solved its problem with a lack of space for a school sports day by using the emergency lane of a nearby motorway. The Xingguo School, in Guiyang, Guizhou province, is a school that mainly has children from rural migrant workers in the city and therefore does not have a lot of resources. It did have a small playground, but this ended up being built on, leaving the kids with nowhere to exercise until teachers came up with the bright idea of using part of the local motorway. Risky: Running races at the school take place on the emergency lane of the motorway . There are about 500 students in the school, but without even a small playground the children need an alternative location. The local council could only tell them that there was nothing suitable where the children could enjoy running or any other form of exercise. Headteacher Manchu Ni, 56, said: ‘We rarely organised sports which require a larger space than we have available. But we were then told that we faced closure if we did not do something as it’s the law that primary school students should have physical fitness test. There was nowhere else we could go. ‘We always stage events after rush-hour and will make sure that teachers stand along the edge of the emergency lane to make sure cars realise the children are there and drive carefully.’ Lack of resources: The school, Guizhou province, doesn't even have a playground . Duty-bound: The headteacher said that the school faced closure if it didn't host sports lessons . The school has now organised several races where the kids have a running test on the road bridge despite the busy traffic. ‘We know it’s dangerous and is also not that healthy with all the smog, but we don’t have any other choice if we are to stay open.’ said the headmaster.

Nicholas Brandram, 31, a descendant of Queen Victoria, crashed into a cyclist on his Harley Davidson but did not stop, a court heard . Queen Victoria's great-great-great grandson crashed his Harley Davidson motorbike into a cyclist outside London’s Hyde Park and drove off without stopping. Nicholas Brandram, who is grandson of Princess Katherine of Greece, struck cyclist Martha Franklin as he drove around Hyde Park Corner earlier this year. The back wheel of Miss Franklin's bicycle was damaged after the collision with the 1948 Harley Davidson being ridden by Brandram, 31, a decorated former British Army Captain who has served in Iraq, Bosnia, and Afghanistan. City of London Magistrates' Court heard that Brandram, who is now a stockbroker living in Fulham, south-west London, did not stop to see if she was hurt or exchange his details after the incident on March 6. Prosecutor Kerry McNulty said: 'Mr Brandram was driving his Harley Davidson motorcycle on the Hyde Park Corner giratory when he collided with a cyclist. 'Her back wheel was damaged and I have no injuries caused. Mr Brandram then left the scene without exchanging details.’ Brandram, who represented himself, told the court he drove away from the scene because he was unaware he had collided with Ms Franklin. He told magistrates of his glittering military career and added that he was an ‘upstanding member of society.’ 'I remember an incident while on my motorbike in the area described by the prosecutor and I remember a big group of cyclists in traffic,’ he said. 'I had right of way as the zebra crossing was 60 metres away - I kept going when one of the cyclists came ridiculously close to me. 'The claim is that I damaged their back wheel but I don't understand how they wouldn't have fallen off and me as well. 'I provided first aid before to someone who has had an epileptic fit so I would have stopped if I’d have known. If I’ve caused damage I take full responsibility for that.' Hyde Park Corner: Bartram was riding his 1948 1200cc Harley Davidson when he collided with the cyclist . Brandram’s 1200cc Harley Davidson is large enough to knock a cyclist over at five miles an hour, the court was told. He told the court: 'I ride a bicycle myself and realise the risks. I’m an upstanding member of society and have recently resigned as a member of the British Army and have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. 'I have a very loud bike so it's not impossible I collided with her without me realising it. At the same time, with such a big bike I don’t know how I didn't feel the collision.' Brandram was given five penalty points on his licence, a £200 fine, and ordered to pay £105 compensation after admitting driving without due care and attention and failing to stop after a road accident. Leaving court he thanked the magistrates and indicated he would pay his fine immediately. Brandram, now a manager at Killik & Co stockbrokers, was awarded a Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal during his distant relative's celebrations last year. His grandmother, Princess Katherine, was Queen Victoria's great-granddaughter, a distant relative of Prince Philip, and the daughter of King Constantine I who ruled Greece between 1913 and 1922.","Nicholas Brandram hit Martha Franklin's bike at Hyde Park Corner, London .

'After reviewing and prioritizing our slate of movie/mini-series development, we’ve decided that we will no longer continue developing the Hillary Clinton miniseries,' NBC said in a statement Monday afternoon.

'[W]e won't seek other partners and are not proceeding with the film,' she wrote. Ferguson provided a lengthy explanation for his decision in a column for the Huffington Post. He said he initially got pushback from Clinton aides Nick Merrill and Phillipe Reines, 'who contacted various people at CNN, interrogated them, and expressed concern about alleged conflicts of interest generated because my film was a for-profit endeavor.' That didn't deter him, he explained, but 'when I approached people for interviews, I discovered that nobody, and I mean nobody, was interested in helping me make this film. Not Democrats, not Republicans - and certainly nobody who works with the Clintons, wants access to the Clintons, or dreams of a position in a Hillary Clinton administration,' Ferguson wrote.

Ferguson said he wasn't surprised by the . Republicans National Committees' recent decision to boycott CNN with . regard to the 2016 presidential primary debates if they aired his film.

'Wow, I thought, this guy is a really good actor,' he wrote. 'And I also saw one reason why Hillary Clinton might not be thrilled about my movie.'

The chef will be based at Buckingham . Palace but be prepared to travel to the Queen's other residences - . including Balmoral - for three months of the year. A 'good understand of kitchen French' is also desired for the role that comes with accommodation and involves a 45 hour week. Candidates must also have a City and Guilds catering qualification or equivalent. 'From . state banquets for 200 to lunches for two; and from canape receptions . for 800 to staff restaurant meals; our chefs prepare it all to the same . exceptional standards,' says the job advert on the Royal website. 'In . this hands-on position you will help to lead and train the junior chefs . to deliver quality fresh food to the highest standards, and you will . also take charge of the kitchen operation when working from smaller . kitchens and when deputising for senior colleagues. 'Although primarily based at Buckingham Palace, you will also work as part of a team at other Royal residences throughout the UK, spending a total of approximately three months away from London.' The successful candidate will also have 'contact with members of the Royal family', the advert states. The sous chef would join a team of Palace cooks, such as Royal Demi Chef De Partie, Shaun Mason (pictured) The chef will also need to 'travel on duty to other kitchens in . the UK and abroad as required, ensuring that these kitchens are . organised and operated to the same level of expertise and diligence . required in the main Royal Kitchen.' Special K, jam sandwiches and chocolate cake are some of The Queen's favourite foods, according to her former personal chef. Darren McGrady, who worked at the Buckingham Palace kitchens for fifteen years, last year revealed that away from the spotlight the 87-year-old British Monarch is a woman of simple tastes. While she feasts on elaborate dishes at state banquets, when at home she enjoys uncomplicated cuisine. The advert states the sous chef role would include state banquets for 200 and canape receptions for 800 . Mr McGrady said that she traditionally starts the day with a light breakfast followed by lunch, afternoon tea and dinner, topped off with a generous gin and Dubonnet before bedtime. A typical lunch, served at 1pm, would be fish, such as a grilled Dover sole, placed on a bed of wilted spinach. Then there would be afternoon tea of cakes, scones and sandwiches using de-crusted bread. Honey sponge, ginger cake and the chocolate biscuit recipe that Prince William chose to be served at his wedding reception were the top sweet treats and Mr McGrady would also rustle up his special Chocolate Perfection Pie. Dinner would often be venison or salmon from Balmoral and white peaches from Windsor Castle.

Kat Cole, the 35-year-old president of Cinnabon, had an unlikely rise to corporate power. For 15 years Cole worked at Hooters, starting  off as a waitress and working her way up to becoming vice president. At first, the job was just to help pay for college, since she had to pay for her education herself. Cole had a humble beginning, growing up under a single mother who fed her family for $10 a week, mostly with canned food and frozen lasagna. So Cole took as job as a waitress at the sports bar chain's Jacksonville location. But the more she worked at Hooters, the more it took her away from school at the University of North Florida and her dream of becoming an engineer.

After that, the company continued to ask her to help with other openings, first in Mexico then Argentina and two U.S. states. 'I came back to school and was failing because I hadn't been there,' she told Bloomberg Businessweek. Gut-buster: The Cinnabon Classic Roll has 880 calories, 36 grams of fat and 59 grams of sugar.

Above, Cole with her niece, left, and in Paris, right . Two months after she finished her MBA, the company promoted her to president of Cinnabon. While some have questioned Cole's quick rise to power, she points out that she's only ever had one male boss. Since coming to Cinnabon, Cole has helped the bakery chain expand outside of the mall food court through licensing deals. This year Cinnabon retail sales will hit $1billion and that's due in large part to her marketing strategy. Now you can get versions of the Cinnabon at Taco Bell and Burger King. You can eat Keebler Cinnabon cookies and taste the Cinnabon flavoring in your morning bowl of Cream of Wheat. Soon you'll be able to buy Cinnabon-flavored Green Mountain Coffee K-cups for your Keurig and add Cinnabon-flavored International Delight Creamer. Cinnabon your life: Cole has helped expand Cinnabon's business through licensing deals with other companies to use the Cinnabon flavor . 'The brand punches way above its weight,' said Cole. But Cole has also come to power at a time when there is increased pressure on food producers to help change American eating habits. The Cinnabon is an infamously indulgent dessert and the classic roll comes in at a whopping 880 calories with 36 grams of fat and 56 grams of sugar. That's the equivalent of eating two Big Macs. 'It's almost pronographic,' she says. 'It's just so over-the-top.' While Cole has considered changing the product to reflect a more health-conscious consumer, she decided in the end not to change a thing. Market research also proved that while customers wouldn't eat the enormous Cinnabon often, they wanted the option to have it when they wanted. That once-in-while indulgence had to be 'so worth it - which Cinnabon is,' Cole said. 'It became obvious that it was not the route to go.'","Kat Cole started her career in the food industry as a Hooters waitress to pay for college .

An elderly husband and wife have been charged with murdering their spouses and two children and hiding the bodies more than 30 years ago - and then marrying each other and moving 1,1000 miles away. Officials said Monday that 71-year-old Gerald Uden and 74-year-old Alice . Louise Uden, who live in Chadwick, Missouri, face first-degree-murder charges in .

Vanished: Reagan Uden, 10, left, and Richard Uden, 12, right, disappeared in 1980 and have never been seen again. Now, their adoptive father is charged with murdering them . The crack in the case came when authorities recently found the body of Alice Louise Uden's ex-husband, Ronald Holtz, in an abandoned Wyoming mine. Holtz, 25, was last seen in December 1974 in Sheridan, Wyoming. The boys' mother, Virginia Uden, is also believed to have been killed by Gerald, according to authorities . Six years later, in September 1980, the wife of Gerald Uden disappeared from Lander, Wyoming, along with her two sons, age 10 and 12. Uden had adopted the two boys but was not the biological father, according to ForTheLost.org, a website devoted to missing persons cases. Virginia Uden and boys Reagan and Richard were last seen at Virginia's mother's house. They had left after a visited and were meeting Gerald to go hunting. A few days later, Virginia's car was found vandalized and soaking with blood. It had been covered in pine boughs in an attempts to hide it. Gerald and Alice Uden are in custody in Missouri while Wyoming authorities attempt to extradite them. Authorities in Wyoming were not available on Monday to discuss the case.

Loss: Henry Konietzky, 59, died just 28 hours after he contracted a bacterial infection from seawater . A man has died just 28 hours after he contracted a flesh-eating bacterial infection from seawater. Henry Konietzky, 59, died after he was exposed to the deadly bacteria while wading in the Halifax River in Florida on Saturday. It is just the latest death connected to the Vibrio vulnificus bacteria - which normally lives in warm seawater - in the Volusia and Flager counties. Nine people have died in the area from the bacteria this year. Mr Konietzky, a married father, had accidentally stepped on some ants before getting into the water and sustained ant bites, which could have created an open wound for the bacteria to get inside. He then waded into the water, knee-deep, to set crab traps. The next morning the man from Palm Coast woke to find what looked like an insect bite on his leg. Debbie Stack, the man’s sister-in-law, told Click Orlando: ‘They did not take [the bite] seriously until it started festering and quickly. Then he started feeling ill.’ The keen fisherman was rushed to hospital on Sunday but he was dead by Monday. Ms Stack said: ‘They tried multiple antibiotics but nothing was touching it. Nothing even phased it.’ Scroll down for video . Distraught: His family members said they do not . feel his initial symptoms were taken seriously enough.

Health officials said that there had . been 26 cases of the bacteria, including nine deaths, in the state of . Florida just this year. Ms Stack said the family were considering making signs to put near the river to warn people of the dangers.

Comedians used to portray them as bossy and interfering, but research reveals spending time with your mother-in-law can actually make you happier. Experts claim the findings point to the importance of relationships in happiness and wellbeing. Those who have frequent contact with both a mother and mother-in-law benefit from two sources of close maternal support, they say. Truth and fiction: The 2004 film 'Monster-in-Law', starring Jane Fonda, left, and Jennifer Lopez, right, explores the fraught relationship some people have with their mother-in-laws . ‘It reflects the importance of having a close family unit,’ said  Dr Melissa Weinberg of Australia’s Deakin University. ‘This shows that people with a balanced family life are likely to have higher well-being than those who are seeing more of one side of the family and less of the other.’ If a relationship is maintained with only one mother figure ‘then there is an imbalance in the family, perhaps with disappointment or even resentment by the non-connected partner,’ the study concluded. Wellbeing Index: The Australian Unity Wellbeing Index was carried out by researchers at Deakin University in Victoria . The Australian Unity Wellbeing Index found those who had weekly contact with their mother and mother-in-law had a wellbeing score of 78.7, well above the normal range of 73.7-76.7. Those in frequent contact with their mother had a well-being score of 74 out of 100 and those who saw their mother-in-law scored 73.1. Those who rarely or never saw either their mother and mother-in-law had a below average well being score of 71.6. Family first: For the first time, the survey also asked people how they would spend two hours a week to do anything they wanted. Most people chose to spend it with their family (12%) while the smallest proportion chose sex . The telephone survey of 2000 Australians found that overall personal wellbeing, a measure of people's satisfaction with their own lives, has remained virtually unchanged since late 2011. For the first time, the survey asked people how they would spend two hours a week to do anything they wanted. Most people chose to spend it with their family (12%) while the smallest proportion chose sex (0.2%). The survey also found men wanted to spend their time surfing, golfing and fishing, while women wanted to spend their two hours reading.","Scientists at Deakin University, Victoria, asked 2,000 people about in-laws .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:26 EST, 30 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:05 EST, 30 September 2013 . North Carolina has a new law scaling back the period for early voting and imposing stringent voter identification requirements. It is among at least five Southern states adopting stricter voter ID and other election laws. The Justice Department on Aug. 22 sued Texas over the state's voter ID law and is seeking to intervene in a lawsuit over redistricting laws in Texas that minority groups consider to be discriminatory. Republican lawmakers in southern states insist the new measures are needed to prevent voter fraud, though such crimes are infrequent. Democrats and civil rights groups argue the tough new laws are intended to make voting more difficult for minorities and students, voting groups that lean toward Democrats, in states with legacies of poll taxes and literacy tests. Attorney General Eric Holder holds a news conference at the Justice Department in Washington,Thursday, Sept. 26, 2013 . Attorney General Eric Holder is expected to announce the lawsuit against North Carolina at a news conference Monday, according to a person who has been briefed on the department's plans but is not authorized to speak publicly about the matter and spoke only on condition of anonymity. Holder will be joined at the news conference by the acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's civil rights division, Joceyln Samuels, and the three U.S. attorneys from North Carolina, the person said. In the North Carolina lawsuit, the person said, the government will challenge requirements in state law that eliminate the first seven days of early voting opportunities and eliminate same-day voter registration during the early voting period. Same-day registration allows voters to cast a ballot immediately after presenting elections officials with proof of their name and home address. The Justice Department challenge also is aimed at a provision eliminating the counting of certain types of provisional ballots by voters who cast ballots in their home counties but do not vote in the correct precincts. Newly emboldened by a Supreme Court decision that struck down the heart of the Voting Rights Act, a growing number of Republican-led states are moving aggressively to tighten voting rules . Finally, the federal government will challenge a provision in the new law that requires voters to present government-issued identification at the polls in order to cast ballots. In North Carolina, a recent state board of elections survey found that hundreds of thousands of registered voters did not have a state-issued ID. Many of those voters are young, black, poor or elderly. In remarks Sept. 20 to the Congressional Black Caucus, Holder said the Justice Department will not allow the Supreme Court's action to be interpreted as 'open season' for states to pursue measures that suppress voting rights. The Justice Department will ask a federal judge to place the four provisions in North Carolina's new law under federal scrutiny for an indeterminate period — a process known as pre-clearance. However, the provision of the Voting Rights Act that the Justice Department is invoking may be a difficult tool for the Obama administration to use. A handful of jurisdictions have been subjected to pre-clearance, or advance approval, of election changes through the Civil Rights Act provision it is relying on, but a court first must find that a state or local government engaged in intentional discrimination under the Constitution's 14th or 15th amendments, or the jurisdiction has to admit to discrimination. Unlike other parts of the voting law, the discriminatory effect of an action is not enough to trigger court review. Nowhere is the debate over voting rights is more heated than in Florida, where the chaotic recount in the disputed 2000 presidential race took place. Florida election officials are set to resume an effort to remove noncitizens from the state's voting rolls. A purge last year ended in embarrassment after hundreds of American citizens, most of whom were black or Hispanic, were asked to prove their citizenship or risk losing their right to vote.","North Carolina has a new law scaling back the period for early voting and imposing stringent voter identification requirements .

Sold: The 'uneconomical relic', here driven by an auctioneer at Goodwood Revival Sale, can still hit 165mph . Legendary: The Alfa Romeo 8C-35 cast all other race cars into shadow when it debuted in 1935. Italian star racer Tazio Nuvolari (pictured) made headlines when he spontaneously leaped in after his car broke down half way through a race - and still took the title. The winning motor has now sold for £6million at auction . The Italian Grand Prix contender first hit the tracks in 1935 - under the management of Scuderia Ferrari before they put their own brand to cars. It was the latest product of a long-standing rivalry between Nazi Germany's racing team and Mussolini's. In 1933, Adolf Hitler ploughed state funds into the coffers of Mercedes Benz and Audi, who responded with seemingly unbeatable models. But in time for the Italian Grand Prix, Mussolini commissioned Alfa to launch the 8C-35, and everything changed. After one race, rivals were shaking behind the wheel. The groundbreaking car's lucky drivers would routinely leap from fifth place to first in under two minutes. Immaculate: After 80 years, it is still on top form. For four decades it lay unused in a garage in Buckinghamshire . Wartime: Despite a revamp, the car still retains all of its original features including the gear stick and mirrors . Full throttle: Rivals feared the Italian record-maker, which routinely leaped into pole position from nowhere . A household name of the day, Italian racing legend Tazio Nuvolari, did just that when his own ride - Alfa's sister car - broke down on the second lap of the 1936 Coppa Ciano race. The pint-sized racer pushed aside the assigned driver Carlo Pintacuda and zoomed into the lead to take the title - and left a media frenzy trailing in his wake. Yesterday a besotted buyer could not resist making history again by handing over £5,937,500 for the Alfa Romeo 8C-35 at the Goodwood Revival Sale near Chichester. The offer beat the previous world record for an Alfa Romeo set in 2010, with a motor enthusiast handing over £4,245,118 for the historical vehicle. Often regarded as uneconomical relics, . Alfa Romeos are the holy grail of motors, according to Jeremy Clarkson, . who announced on Top Gear that you have to own one to be a true . 'petrolhead'. But after the war, Mussolini's motor spent almost four decades decades unused. It was bought . by wealthy industrialist Dennis Poore who could drive it whenever and . wherever he wanted. He often took it for a spin at local hill climb . competitions. But by 1955 he retired it to a barn at his home in Taplow, Buckinghamshire, where it remained untouched until his death in 1987.

Miss Daly is known to devote months to planning her wardrobe for the series. But the dress she chose for the first show of the series on Friday night had fans wondering if it was time for a change of stylist. The outfit was clearly too tight for her slender frame and became transparent under the glare of the lights, treating those at home to the unflattering sight of her shapewear, which had creased underneath and displayed what appeared to be rolls of flab around her middle. Viewers tweeted complaints including ‘Tess Daly, fat or pregnant? #girdle’, ‘Can someone please tell Tess Daly that the yellow hair,  yellow face, yellow dress look on HD is iris destroying’ and ‘Is Tess daly pregnant? #SCD if not sack the stylist!’.

Fashion fail: Other viewers described Miss Daly's outfit as 'trussed up' and 'horrendous' Others described her as looking ‘trussed up’ and ‘horrendous’. Miss Daly, 44, failed to impress on Saturday night either, with a floor-length purple dress that appeared to swamp her.

The TV chef’s performance with Karen Hauer to the Maroon 5 single Moves Like Jagger drew comparisons with John Sergeant’s memorably bad attempt at the paso doble in 2008. The former BBC political editor earned the nickname ‘the dancing pig as he stomped along, dragging partner Kristina Rihanoff across the floor.

Heartibreaking: Mrs Miller, pictured here on her wedding day with Mr Miller did not know if he would live . Expectant mother: Julie Miller was looking forward to the birth of her new son with her husband, Justin . Mr . Miller, from Northampton, had been looking forward to the arrival of . his second baby with his wife Julie when he was struck down with what he . thought was flu. But his . condition deteriorated and he was rushed to hospital, where he was . diagnosed with the life-threatening Guillain-Barre syndrome, which . attacks the nervous system. Two . days later Mrs Miller went into labour and was admitted to the same . hospital, just yards from the intensive care ward where her husband was . fighting for his life. Mrs Miller said: ‘It was . heartbreaking because he was supposed to be my birthing partner, instead . my mum had to film it for him, hoping that one day he would be well . enough to watch it. ‘It was bittersweet to know he was so close when he his son was being born yet he was too ill to be there.’ Mr Miller learned he was the . father of a new baby boy called Ben when Mrs Miller sent him a text . following the birth on March 13 this year. An hour later, kindhearted nurses carefully transported Mr Miller in a wheelchair from his bed to the maternity wing. With . his facial muscles paralysed he was unable to smile but tears of joy . rolled down his face as he held his son for the first time. Stronger: After making a slow recovery, Mr Miller gradually returned to strength and was able to hold Ben . Rehabilitation: Mr Miller manages a smile for the camera while hugging his three-year-old daughter, Amy . Mr Miller said: ‘I didn’t know if I . would live or die or spend the rest of my life paralysed, but for that . moment all that mattered was seeing my son. ‘I was so happy to get the chance to meet him even if I wasn’t able to smile.’ He added: 'Of course it was . devastating to miss the birth but I will be forever grateful to the . wonderful nurses who took it upon themselves to take me to the maternity . ward to meet him.' Mrs Miller said: ‘When I saw him in the doorway I burst into tears. The fact he made it to the delivery room at all under the circumstances was incredible. ‘I was so moved that the staff could be so kind. It meant so much to us. ‘We were all crying because at that point nobody knew what the future had in store for Justin. I didn’t know if that would be the first and last time he met his dad. 'It was heartbreaking but joyous all at once. I didn’t know if I should smile or cry so I did both.’ But the meeting was broken up after just a few minutes when Mr Miller was taken back to the intensive care unit. His wife and son were later discharged, both with a clean bill of health. Mrs . Miller said: ‘ It was hard going home without him but the good news was . his condition was improving so we had a lot to be grateful for.’ Happy family: Mr Miller has now returned home after making a quicker recovery than experts believed possible . She visited her husband every day with new pictures and videos of their son and daughter Amy, three, determined that he would not miss out on those precious first few days of Ben's life. And slowly his condition began to improve. After three weeks Mr Miller was moved to a rehabilitation unit. Mrs Miller said: ‘It was ironic because he was learning to walk and talk all over again while our son was doing the same.’ Then the day came that Mr Miller was able to hold his son again for the first time since the birth. Mrs Miller said: ‘This time he was stronger and could cradle him and smile. It was a fantastic moment.’ He was also able to see daughter Amy for the first time in weeks too, but it was another three months before he was allowed home. And while doctors predicted a slow recovery, he stunned them by returning to work as a delivery driver weeks later. Mrs Miller said: ‘People started calling him superman because he recovered so quickly but we call him superdad. ‘He is our hero and we are so proud.’ Mr Miller added: ‘I worked so hard in the rehab unit knowing my family were waiting for me at home. It’s wonderful to be a family again.’ For more information about the condition visit www.gbs.org.uk .

A Chinese-born chemist sobbed in court today as she was sentenced to life in prison for killing her husband with a tasteless, odorless poison during their divorce battle. Tianle Li, 42, who worked for a decade for one of America's biggest pharmaceutical companies, was a cold, calculating murderer who poisoned her husband rather than let him divorce her, a judge said on Monday. Li, of Monroe, New Jersey, won't be eligible for parole for more than 62 years for the killing of Xiaoye Wang, a computer software engineer, in early 2011. Li continues to deny any role in her husband's death. In a brief, tear-filled statement read in court on Monday, Li said she . prays for her husband's soul and will appeal the trial verdict. Crocodile tears: Tianle Li, pictured in court today, sobbed as her sentence of life in prison was handed down at the New Jersey court . Li, who denies any part in her husband's death, won't be eligible for parole for more than 62 years for the killing of Xiaoye Wang . 'This was planned, calculated and committed in a cruel and depraved manner,' state Superior Court Judge Michael Toto said. Fatal dose: Xiaoye Wang died after his wife poisoned him in the midst of their divorce . Li was convicted in July of murder and hindering apprehension. Her attorney had sought a 30-year sentence. The couple had a son who is now four years old and in the care of relatives. The former Monroe resident worked for New York City-based bio-pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb. Prosecutors introduced evidence during the trial that Li ordered thallium, a tasteless, odorless poison, through work in 2010 after researching its effects on humans. Thallium has been banned for consumer use in the U.S. since 1972. It can be fatal in doses as small as a gram and has been called 'the perfect poison' because it is difficult to detect in lab tests. It was initially suspected to be the toxin used in the 2006 fatal poisoning in London of former Russian KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, but it was later determined he had ingested the rare radioactive isotope polonium-210. Wang, 39, checked into Princeton . Medical Center in January 2011 suffering from what appeared to be the . flu or some other virus. He eventually lapsed into a coma and died on . January 26. Li was at her husband's side in the hospital, even changing his . bedpan, Altman pointed out to the judge. 'She . was secretly keeping a journal of all his symptoms, wondering when he . was going to die,' prosecutor Christie Bevacqua told Toto. 'She . calculated every aspect of her husband's murder; not only how to do it, . but how to get away with it. She thought she was going to get away with . this murder. Trouble brewing: Police had been called to disturbances at the family home in New Jersey . 'She chose to murder her husband rather than allow him to divorce her.' Li, who is from Beijing, came to the U.S. in the late 1990s and worked for Bristol-Myers Squibb for about 10 years. She met Wang when both were studying at the University of Pennsylvania. The couple lived in Monroe, in central New Jersey, and prosecutors said at the time of Li's arrest in February 2011 that police had been called to the residence several times for domestic disturbances. Altman said in court Monday that some of the disputes arose from culture clashes between the Americanized Li and her husband's more traditional family, who had come to help the couple care for their son.","Tianle Li won't be eligible for parole .

Amanda Knox was all smiles in the rain in Seattle, Washington, as she chatted on the phone while picking up supplies at a pet store ahead of the re-trial in Italy . Italy's highest court in March . ordered the new trial for American student Knox and her former Italian . boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, overturning their acquittals in Ms . Kercher's 2007 murder. Knox, now a 26-year-old student in Seattle, has not returned to Italy for the trial and she is she compelled by law to do so. The appellate court hearing the new case could declare her in contempt of court but that carries no additional penalties. 'We refute the idea that because Amanda is not coming, that Amanda is guilty, that Amanda is using a strategy.

Knox . served four years of a 26-year sentence, including three years on a . slander conviction for falsely accusing a Perugia bar owner in the . murder, before leaving Italy a free woman after her 2011 acquittal. The . bar owner wrongly accused of killing Meredith Kercher today insisted . that Amanda Knox is guilty of the British student's murder. Patrick . Lumumba, who Knox initially suggested might be responsible for killing . Meredith, told the hearing that he had suffered from the false . allegation, which saw Knox convicted of slander.

The Toluca Lake home of Bob and Dolores Hope is up for sale with an asking price of $27.5 million for the five-acre property, which includes a 15,000-square-foot mansion, a one-hole golf course, and an indoor pool. A guest house and an adjoining 4,000-square-foot office space also make up the sprawling estate on Moorpark Street, where Bob and Dolores Hope lived and entertained Hollywood celebrities and presidents from 1939 until their deaths in 2003 and 2011, respectively. In addition to its proximity to the Lakeside Golf Club, the estate’s new buyers will have at least one celebrity neighbor: singer Miley Cyrus is reported to live nearby, according to the Los Angeles Times. The Robert Finkelhor-designed traditional main house was updated in the 1950s by John Elgin Woolf to add more contemporary elements . Although mature trees surround the property, the sun bathes the outdoor swimming pool . The property in the San Fernando Valley property has an extensive rose garden . The announcement of the listing comes on the heels of an auction that included golf memorabilia and mementos from the couple’s homes in Toluca Lake and Palm Springs that was estimated to bring in more than $500,000. The Hopes commissioned Robert Finkelhor to build their beloved English traditional house on a former walnut grove in 1939. It was later remodeled 'in a more contemporary style' in the 1950’s by architect John Elgin Woolf, who also designed homes for Cary Grant, Errol Flynn, Judy Garland, Ricardo Montalban and Katharine Hepburn . The estate grew considerably over the years as the Hopes acquired surrounding properties; it now consists of four parcels totaling 5.16 acres. A one hole golf course complete with green and sand bunker lay just beyond the rose garden . The compound has a main house and a front office building . The library features wood paneling and a fireplace . A curved wall of glass adds dimension in the formal dining room . A main house of 14,876 square feet, as well as a two-bedroom guest house, a two-bedroom staff quarters and additional offices can be found on the storied compound. Leading through a reception area, the home opens to a handsome foyer with hardwood flooring and curving spiral staircase. Interior amenities include an office, billiard room, chef's kitchen and a formal living room lined in floor-to-ceiling glass that looks onto a patio and grounds. The upstairs houses four bedroom suites, including a master wing with his-and-her bedrooms, baths, closets and a shared study. Lifelong residents: Bob Hope lived at the property from 1939 until his death in 2003. Dolores Hope (pictured right) passed away in 2011 . A wall of glass sits on one side of the indoor swimming pool and spa, while mirrors on the other side reflect the outdoor views . Among the home's features is a polished wood wet bar, whilst a sweeping spiral staircase connects the upper and lower floors of the house . The living room features a stone fireplace and several seating areas . The Hopes' longtime house is staged with contemporary furnishings . Outside, the home rounds out with sports facilities, including a one-hole golf course, a pair of pools (one indoor and one outdoor), numerous patios and a massive stone motor court. Bob Hope lived at the property from 1939 until his death in 2003. Dolores Hope passed away in 2011. The Toluca Lake estate is the last of the late Hopes' impressive real estate portfolio to come to market. In December 2012, a pair of Palm Springs properties that had been owned by the couple listed for $659,000 and $469,000, respectively. The compound in Toluca Lake is a massive 14,876 square-feet and sits on more than 5 acres . Sliding glass doors open to terraces and outdoor seating areas . A large dressing room with vanity has a view of the garden . The main house has six bedrooms and seven bathrooms . Bob died in 2003 at 100 and his long-running career saw him meet presidents, star in films and tour the world firing his famous one-liners. His second wife Dolores, who he married back in 1934, died in 2011 at 102. The entertainer was often cited as the biggest private landowner in California. Last year his daughter Linda sold her late parents’ Toluca Lake estate, near Los Angeles, along with some of its contents, in a well-publicized garage sale.

Astonishing photographs of the Queen on holiday as a teenager have come to light for the first time 74 years after they were taken. The images, captured on the eve of the Second World War, show Princess Elizabeth and her family relaxing on board a cruise ship and meeting with foreign dignitaries. They were taken by a musician working on board the boat, named The Empress of Britain, and discovered this year by his descendants, who previously had no idea of his brush with royalty. Candid: This never-before-seen photograph shows the Queen, second left, aged 13 with her sister Margaret and her parents George VI and Queen Elizabeth . Holiday: The Royal Family is shown on board The Empress of Britain in 1939, before the outbreak of the Second World War . The informal snaps show Elizabeth, then aged 13, with her father George VI, her mother Queen Elizabeth and her sister Margaret. One catches the young princess as she grabs hold of her hat to stop it blowing away in the strong wind. Others show the King and Queen boarding the cruise ship and inspecting her crew. Saxophonist Leslie Willoughby took the photographs after approaching the Royal Family and asking if they would mind posing. Arrival: The King and Queen pictured as they boarded the cruise ship surrounded by a large crowd of well-wishers . Line-up: The Royal couple inspecting the ship's crew as they boarded the vessel for their holiday with their daughters . When his widow Eve died in 1993, eight years after him, the images were handed down to his niece Shirley Fleming, now 79, and her husband Ray, 76. But the couple only discovered the photographs early this year when they were clearing out a cupboard at their home in Wotton, Norfolk. They now plan to pass on the pictures to Her Majesty, saying that she deserves to own the mementoes of her own youth. 'It's really lovely to look back and see what he did and who he saw,' Mr Fleming said. Casual: The images were captured by saxophonist Leslie Willoughby with the permission of the Royal Family . Tranquil: The King and Queen talking to Mackenzie King, prime minister of Canada, in another photograph from 1939 unearthed in Mr Willoughby's archive . 'We are pensioners we have got enough to live on for the rest of our life. We just think that these should be shared. 'We want the Queen to see them.

The probe into the confrontation between former chief whip Andrew Mitchell and police has cost £237,000 . The police investigation into the Plebgate affair, which led to the resignation of former chief whip Andrew Mitchell, has cost £237,000 so far. Detectives have previously signalled that the probe could stretch into next year after being handed new evidence into the confrontation between the MP and officers guarding Downing Street. Mr Mitchell was accused of launching a foul-mouthed rant at police as he asked to cycle through the main gates on September 19 last year. In a letter to MP Keith Vaz, Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Patricia Gallan confirmed the mounting cost of the inquiry, which has seen statements taken from all 800 officers in the Diplomatic Protection Group. Mr Vaz said: 'It has now taken more than a year to investigate an incident that lasted for 45 seconds, costing the taxpayer an astonishing £237,000, the equivalent to 10 new Metropolitan Police constables. 'It must be in the best interests of the Metropolitan Police Service and Crown Prosecution Service to bring this operation to a conclusion. 'It is also neither good for the police officers involved or for Andrew Mitchell that this saga continues.' Last week, eight people including five police officers arrested under Operation Alice were re-bailed. The five constables are from the Diplomatic Protection Group, which is responsible for guarding politicians and foreign dignitaries, and includes a 46-year-old woman present when the row broke out. Two of the officers - the woman and a man who is also 46 - were arrested over alleged leaks to the media about what happened. The members of police staff are two women . aged 46 and 49 who were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender, . and a 23-year-old man who was held in December. MP Keith Vaz said it has taken police 'a year to investigate an incident that lasted 45 seconds' As the anniversary of the incident passed, Scotland Yard came under fire for its handling of the inquiry. Ex-director of public prosecutions Lord Macdonald saying it was 'outrageous' that the probe continued. Former home secretary Jack Straw, a 'personal friend' of Mr Mitchell's, waded into the row and urged conclusions to be reached. In her letter to Mr Vaz, Ms Gallan said that as of September 19 this year there were five officers involved in Operation Alice, supported by an officer from the Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS) High Tech Crime Unit and an analyst from the DPS Intelligence Bureau. Metropolitan Police detectives have taken statements from all 800 officers in the Diplomatic Protection Group . Pressure intensified in the wake of the incident when the Daily Telegraph published a police log of the incident, which claimed Mr Mitchell called officers 'plebs' and swore at them repeatedly for making him walk through a side gate. The former Tory chief whip insisted he did not use the words attributed to him, and later said he was the victim of a deliberate attempt to 'toxify' the Tories and ruin his career. A Channel 4 investigation cast doubt on the officers' account when it revealed CCTV footage which showed there was not a large group of tourists outside the main gate at the time as had originally been claimed. An email from a civilian witness backing up the police account of events has also been called into question.

In the past 30 years, fossil finds have shed light on the sequence of evolutionary transformations. It is thought that the first whale ancestor was a furry, four-legged omnivore that evolved into a range of amphibious species 50 million years ago. Over time, whales lost the connection . between their backbone and hind legs, then gradually lost the hind legs completely. Whales are thought to have evolved into fully aquatic species around 45 million years ago. The whale belongs to a group called Achaeocetes, which are ancient sea mammals that still show some of the characteristics of their terrestrial ancestors. Fossil finds over the past 30 years have shown how a sequence of evolutionary transformations, between 52 and 40 million years ago, led to today’s whales living in the oceans rather than on land.

Over time, whales lost the connection . between their backbone and hind legs, then gradually lost the hind legs completely.

So far, fossilised remains of over 15 of the majestic marine mammals have been discovered in the Ocucaje desert some 310 kilometers (190 miles) south of the capital Lima. 'There is probably a greater number of fossils in the sand but it takes high-tech equipment to locate and recover them,' said Cesar Chacaltana, who heads a team during a tour of the site, which spans 45 square kilometres. This is the first time that such an old sea mammal has been found in South America . Up until now, evidence of ancient sea mammals such as this had only been found in Egypt, Pakistan, India and North America . It is thought the bodies were preserved by the low level of oxygen in the substrate, which delayed decay caused by bacteria. In February last year, experts located the remains of a minke whale believed to be 3.6 million years old. 'It is a species known only in Peru,' Mr Chacaltana said, estimating that the whale weighed about 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) and measured six meters in length. In 2008 researchers found remains of a sperm whale (Livyatan melvillei) that were 12 million years old. A decade ago, Mr Chacaltana also came across the jaw and three-meter skull of a giant shark, considered a mega predator, that lived off the Peruvian coast.

Romantic: Matt Gencarella, 21, proposes to his girlfriend of two years, Brynn Hathaway, on a wakeboard . Surprise! Matt gives a relieved thumbs up in the wake of the proposal that took Brynn (right) totally by surprise . When she said yes, he swept her up in a bear hug before leaping overboard. 'He told me to take the rope and said, ""whatever you do, do not let go of the this"",' revealed an overjoyed Brynn. 'He said he was going to try a new trick. Then he turned around and got down on one knee and asked me to marry him. 'I had no idea that I would be getting proposed to on a surfboard, I just thought it as a normal day on the lake. 'We . have been wakeboarding and surfing together since we were 12 years old, . so the proposal was incredibly meaningful to the both of us.' 'I . wasn't worried about falling off,' added new fiance Matt. 'All I could . think of was how I was going to ask Brynn to spend the rest of her life . with me. That was all that mattered in the moment.' The pair met at a gymnastics class when they were 11 years old and have been wakeboarding together since they were 12. But . despite his skills on the water, Matt still had a few nerves to . overcome and admitted he found the proposal far scarier than his . daredevil stunt. 'I jumped into the water and said ""Brynn, let's double up"",' he explained. 'I was nervous as we were towed along, waiting to get up and start wakeboarding.

'I . was racking my brain to figure out a fun and unique way of proposing to . her,' added Matt. 'I didn't want to do something cliched.' After . hitting on the wakeboarding idea, recent graduate Matt set about . planning the proposal, with best friend Corey Schneider standing in for . Brynn during a practice run. 'Corey . and I practiced for an hour,' the romantic watersports aficionado . explained. 'We went through every scenario of how she might react and . what I would do in each situation. 'I . told Brynn that Corey's watersports company, Hayden Wake, was going to . shoot a promotional video and they wanted to film us wakeboarding - that . was the decoy.' The decoy provided a perfect excuse for the presence of a camera which was filming the couple as they headed out onto the lake. Sporty: Engaged pair Matt and Brynn met as children and share a passion for watersports . Childhood sweethearts: The pair, who met at school and have been together for two years, will marry next year . Despite the potential for a . very public humiliation, confident Matt also invited friends and family . to share in the special moment. 'The . day before, I called Brynn's two best friends from school to come up . and surprise her so that they could be there for the event,' he said. 'One of the most important things for me was that our close friends and family were there for the proposal. 'I told Brynn that our parents and friends wanted to watch us being filmed, so they were on a boat off to the side. 'I . could not have been happier with how it all went.

A man who has been jailed for raping a woman has been told that he could have contracted HIV as a result of the attack he inflicted upon his victim. Richard Thomas, 27, collapsed when police informed him about the woman's medical status and is still waiting to hear if he has contracted the incurable virus. Thomas, of Leigh in Greater Manchester, knew the woman and was aware that she has another illness but had not known about the HIV. The court heard he was shocked when he was told and asked to be taken to hospital, Liverpool Crown Court heard. He had let himself into her home in the middle of the night and she awoke to find him raping her. 'She froze and no words were exchanged. He pulled up his shorts and left,' said Harry Pepper, prosecuting. 'He . was arrested and interviewed and said he had been drinking heavily, . taken cocaine and ecstasy and could not recall the incident,' he added.

Viewers were 'outraged' with the new format which saw the judges forced to whittle down 100 contestants in all their categories to just 24. This year, for the first time in the show's history, the singers had to battle it out on stage in a ‘musical chairs’ style section which saw performers face the threat of being ousted by a better singer or group.

Fan Kenny Doughty wrote on Twitter: 'X Factor is turning into Hunger Games. It's like pulling wings off flies. Cruel Process. Poor kids.' @elizabethhmae wrote: 'X factor makes me so MAD.

Tense: Contestants vying for one of the coveted seats were made to sing in front of their competitors . The show's new format even prompted a reaction from celberity views with Olly Murs writing on Twitter: wrote: 'NEW bootcamp style on @TheXFactor UK was awesome!!! Not great for the contestants but watching it... Un-real!! Girl category is Pucka!!' But singer Lily Allen blasted: 'When did become alright to f*** with peoples minds. X factor has got fully mean.' Despite viewers' anger the ITV show still managed to attract an average audience of 9.5 million viewers, with a peak of 10.9 million on Sunday evening. Cruel process: Popular Lydia Lucy had taken her seat on one of the six chairs, but was harshly replaced by Abi Alton when Nicole decided to take her through instead . Judges were forced to decide straight after the contestant's performance whether to take them through or not. Those who got a yes, took a seat in the final six chairs on the stage. But . if the judges wanted to send another act through once their six spots . were full they had to option of ditching one of the hopefuls who had . already been given a 'yes'. Lydia Lucy, from Essex, Sheena McHugh and Karen Harding all lost their seats after Nicole had already put them through.

However just a few minutes later, after Hannah Barrett performed, Nicole loved Hannah’s vocal so much that she instantaneously decided to eliminate Sheena and replace her with Barrett for judges houses. Last night there was even more disappointment when Sabrina Rumikie, Katie Markham, Tenors of Roack and Alejandro Fernandez Holt were also eliminated. When Gary remarked that he would drop singer Joseph Whelan from the line-up, dad-of-one Joe burst into tears and while pacing the stage weeping and pleading 'not again' – as he was previously ditched from the show during last year’s Boot Camp stage. But judges Gary Barlow, Nicole . Scherzinger, Louis Walsh and Sharon Osbourne did manage to cut down . their contestants from 100 to just 24 as a result of the process.

'I just don't know, I feel like the other voices were stronger,' said Nicole after asking the girls to wait backstage.

Tough decision: The judges must chose between returning hopefuls Melanie, Amy and Stephanie . Tough choice: Nicole watches the three girls perform on Saturday night's show . Uncomfortable viewing: The process which saw singers perform in front of their fellow competitors before potentially being booted off the show was uncomfortable for many people to watch . You're staying: Tamera impresses with a rendition of Rihanna's Stay . But despite filling up all her six seats being taken, there were three performances to go - meaning Nicole could take advantage of the new twist and swap one girl for another. First up was Hannah Barrett, who made an impassioned plea after taking to the stage: 'Everything I've been through, I tell you I'm not going back there!' she cried. Stern words: Nicole loses it backstage after a string of mediocre performances . Her performance of Etta James hit I'd Rather Go Blind had Nicole raising her hands in delight - and posed a serious conundrum for the former Pussycat Doll. Next up was 18-year-old supermarket worker Abi Alton, whose nerves almost got the better of her before she performed. 'It's . interesting because that's not the song I would have chosen for you.

You've made it: Abi Alton is told she's made the final six . Things got off to a promising start with prison officer Sam Bailey impressing the judges with a version of Emelie Sande's Clown that had the fiery judge up on her feet. 'That was absolutely note perfect,' said Gary. 'I just want you to know that of all the years I've been involved and not involved in this show I've dreamed of a contestant like you,' added a tearful Sharon. 'I've come to  a decision...yes, put your bum on that seat.' Hopeful: Relley Clarke takes to the stage for a performance of Respect by Aretha Franklin . Hugs: Relley Clarke is embraced after making the final six . After a moment of comedy from good natured Souli Roots, who performed Michael Jackson's Man in the Mirror before being given her marching orders, it was call center worker Jayson Newland's chance to shine - and shine he did, with a moving version of Steve Winwood classic Higher Love. 'That's called taking a risk, and it paid off,' said Gary. However, Sharon  wasn't convinced. 'My darling you should be very proud of your self because that was a really solid performance,' she said. 'However, I'm not sure and my decision is...I'm going to send you home.' Emotional: Sheena impresses after taking to the stage, but her time in the top six would be short lived . Emotional: Nicole was close to tears following Sheena's performance . Popular choice: Returning singer Jade Richards impressed with a version of Emeli Sande hit Clown . Sabrina Ramikie, 28, took the next seat with a performance of I'd rather Go Blind. 'It was a flawless performance and my decision is...' said Sharon, pointing to one of the empty chairs. Two down and proud dad of one Joseph Whelan came next, a year after he failed to impress the judges during boot camp. After a performance of Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls, Sharon told the emotional builder: 'I know this means a lot to you. I need people who are gonna be strong - I don''t need wimps.

"By . Nick Constable . PUBLISHED: . 17:43 EST, 19 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:43 EST, 19 May 2012 . Safety fears: A Bob Martin Cat Flea Collar with Dimpylate have been taken off the shelves . Flea collars for pets are being withdrawn from sale after The Mail on Sunday revealed fears that they could poison children. Leading manufacturer Bob Martin is taking the action voluntarily after dog and cat owners began calling the company demanding to know the risks. It follows our report last week about a French decision to ban pet collars containing diazinon, which was originally developed as a Second World War nerve gas. French scientists are studying three cases in which children may have absorbed diazinon, also known as Dimpylate, through their skin after repeatedly cuddling or sleeping with pets. Diazinon poisoning symptoms include headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, muscle-twitching, personality changes and loss of co-ordination. In extreme cases, it can lead to convulsions, coma and even death – although there is no evidence that flea collars could provide sufficient exposure to cause this. Last night, Dogs Trust veterinary director Paula Boyden said: ‘We very much welcome Bob Martin’s move to withdraw these collars from the  market as a precautionary measure. ‘Many dog owners will not have been aware of the possible health hazards of using a product containing diazinon and we commend The Mail on Sunday for raising awareness of this issue. ‘There are safer, equally effective treatments and we see no reason why other manufacturers shouldn’t follow Bob Martin’s example.’ Despite the concerns about the collars in France, Britain’s regulator, the Veterinary Medicines Directorate, has refused to impose a similar ban. It is awaiting a full report from the French and the results of a separate inquiry by European Commission vets and medical experts. However, British veterinary sources believe the move by Bob Martin will increase pressure on other manufacturers. Concern: French experts say children are particularly at risk from collars that contain Dimpylate . A spokeswoman for the company said it had ‘received calls from consumers wanting clarification on the potential risk’. She added: ‘Bob Martin is unaware of any adverse reactions in people and all product packaging clearly states that owners should not sleep with pets that are wearing a flea collar. ‘However, the concern of pet owners is paramount and we have therefore decided to voluntarily remove these products from our range. ‘There are a wide range of safe and effective flea treatments available and we will be working with retailers in the coming weeks to provide alternative products.’ A spokeswoman for rival manufacturer Johnson’s, which uses diazinon in dog and cat collars, said: ‘We are not planning to take any action until we have received advice from the regulatory authorities.’ Industry sources say several hundred thousand of the controversial collars are sold in the UK each year. France’s veterinary medicines watchdog has published a blacklist of 51  collars that contain diazinon. Others containing similar toxic chemicals such as propoxur and tetrachlorvinphos have also been withdrawn. The decision is being examined by the European Medicines Agency. The European Commission said it would consider more detailed information from France before reviewing the sale of flea collars in other countries.","Collars contain diazinon which can cause headaches, dizziness, blurred vision and personality changes .

"By . Emma Lowe and Ted Thornhill . PUBLISHED: . 04:28 EST, 1 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:55 EST, 1 October 2013 . Regrets: Dame Stella Rimington told an audience at Henley Literary Festival of things she missed . MI5 must find a way of convincing the public that delving into private data is of paramount importance to national security or risk fueling the popularity of 'self-seeking twerps' Julian Assange and Edward Snowden, the former head of the organisation said. Dame Stella Rimington, who was director general for MI5 between 1992 and 1996, said that terrorists are using increasingly sophisticated methods to communicate and conceal their plans, and so intelligence services must have the tools to keep one step ahead of them to avoid atrocities like the Kenyan mall massacre. To do this, she said, they must be allowed to gather data on a large-scale - but the public need more assurances that this is necessary and is being carried out with proper supervision. Speaking at the Henley Literary Festival on Monday, The Times reports the real-life former 'M', as saying: 'It is very important for our intelligence services to have the kind of oversight that people can have confidence in, so that we can be quite sure that in giving them these powers we know that they are being properly supervised and scrutinised in the way they use them. 'It may be that we need something more complex to convince the nation that the intelligence services are actually working on their behalf and not acting against them.' She argued that many mistakenly believe that whistleblowers Assange and Snowden, who have released classified information to the public domain, are revealing something scandalous. She added: 'I think adequate oversight could explain to us all that in a way that is not being explained and therefore Julian Assange and Edward Snowden would be seen for what they are - self-seeking twerps.' The mother-of-two also told how she sometimes regrets juggling her hectic career with her young family, as she often regretted missing out on ‘sports day’ and ‘school plays’ because of the real life drama in the office. Dedicated to her job, Dame Stella claimed she would later be wracked with guilt as she explained to her children why she hadn’t made an appearance. Criticism: Dame Stella Rimington has labelled Wikileaks founder Julian Assange as a 'twerp' for releasing classified information into the public domain . She said: ‘I had so many moments where I would worry about being late for the sports day or late for the meeting because I was at sports day. ‘It was perpetual really, you take a day off because your child is in the school play and then some drama will happen at the office. ‘I still had to go home and explain to my child why I didn’t make it. ‘There were a number of things I missed - I wish I could go back too. ‘When they were growing up relied hugely on nannies and grannies.’ Now a thriller writer, Dame Stella was the first female and first public director general of MI5. Dame Stella said women today still struggle to juggle their homes and their work, claiming she is disappointed and unimpressed by the lack of progression for helping working mothers. She added: ‘I look at women in the work place now and I feel incredibly sad that the environment hasn’t changed more. ‘It shouldn’t still be difficult for women to juggle their family and their work life in 2013. The same problems shouldn’t face women today. ‘I thought by the time my daughters were to be mothers that they wouldn’t be faced with the this problem. ‘The government has previously promised to sort out child care and but it has failed. The 78-year-old was director general of MI5 between 1992 and 1996. She relied on nannies for her children . This snap was the first photo taken of Dame Stella after she became MI5 head, trying to keep a low profile . ‘There has been various promises that every borough, every town was going to have child care and they haven’t followed that up and it’s a great same. ‘It is still just as difficult as it was back in our day to have satisfactory arrangements. ‘And for our generation it is very sad to see and disappointing after everything we worked to change. ‘I really thought the world would have adapted better by now. ‘I think having women in senior positions is very important. Having a female Home Secretary is important. It is important women are in these positions to understand what women need in their homes.’ Dame Stella was invited to the festival to promote her latest novel The Geneva Trap.

She is well regarded as one of the most influential reformers in the middle east so it came as no surprise to those watching the world leaders flock to New York this week to see Queen Rania of Jordan arrive at her hotel in the city. Her arrival provides a temporary distraction from the week long debate over whether President Obama will meet with Iranian President Rouhani in what would be the first time in more than 30 years that leaders of their respective countries would come face-to-face. The Queen cut business-like fugure in a smart cream-coloured pencil skirt and blazer as she was spotted arriving yesterday ahead of the United Nations General Assembly which officially opens tomorrow. In keeping with her reputation as one of the world's most stylish royals her business attire was perked up with a pair of killer heels and the new Louis Vuitton Monogram tote bag. Stylish: Queen Rania of Jordan arrives at her hotel in Midtown, New York, ahead of the UN General Assembly which begins tomorrow . Combining a tan cuir calfskin leather body with the designer's iconic brown monogram canvas sides the beautiful bag retails for around £2,300. Queen Rania has been closely involved in humanitarian work in Jordan since her husband Abdullah bin Al-Hussein assended the throne in 1999. The following year she was asked by the United Nation's Children's Fund to join Global Leadership Initiative. She also joined the United Nations Foundation Board of Directors in 2006 and became honorary chairperson for the United Nations Girls' Education Initiative in 2009. It remains to be seen what role the Jordanian delegates will have in the General Assembly talks which are set to be dominated by discussions about Syria. Jordan has repeatedly try to distance itself from the civil war in its neighbouring country by refusing to get involved in the conflict. Protestor: Queen Rania, pictured marching in Amman alongside thousands of her people in 2004 to condemn violence and terrorism . The country's diplomatic stance has been characterised by uncertainty and hesitation which differs greatly from the popular perspective, which is mostly in full support of the Syrian revolution and in favour of the departure of Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad. The nation has faced considerable problems however as a result of the tide of refugees that has flooded across its borders in a bid to escape the fighting. After accepting 520,000 Syrians earlier this month Jordanian officals closed their frontier in an attempt to stem the flow which has seen the national population has rise by 8 per cent in two years. The exodus has placed immense strain on resources and Jordan's government wants to halt the inflow until new camps are ready. The biggest existing facility, Zaatari, houses 120,000 refugees and UNHCR is now building another camp for 130,000. Educator: The Queen, pictured here addressing school children during a visit by members of the United Nations Foundation, has actively campaigned for better education . Compassion: Queen Rania has long been a key figure of reform and peace in her country, pictured here with a victim of the bomb blasts in the nation's capital Amman in 2005 which killed 57 . Power couple: Queen Rania with her husband King Abdullah II pictured during a visit to France . Queen Rania's arrival in New York comes just ahead of Obama's scheduled address to the United Nations General Assembly which is due to take place later this morning. It is expected the President will take the opportunity to call on UN Security Council members to approve a resolution that would mandate consequences for Syria if it fails to cooperate with a plan to turn its chemical weapons stockpiles over to the international community. The president's address will be closely watched for signs that he may meet later in the day with Iranian President Hasan Rouhani, a moderate cleric who has been making friendly gestures toward the U.S. in recent weeks. Even a brief encounter would be significant given that the leaders of the U.S. and Iran haven't had face-to-face contact in more than 30 years. U.S. officials say no meeting is planned, though they hadn't ruled out the possibility that one might be added. The most likely opportunity appeared to be at a U.N. leaders' lunch Tuesday. Rouhani himself is scheduled to address the U.N. General Assembly later this afternoon. The possibility of a thaw in relations with Iran was expected to factor heavily in Obama's address to the U.N. In a preview of the president's speech, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said Obama would discuss 'our openness to diplomacy and the prospect for a peaceful resolution of this issue that allows Iran to rejoin the community of nations should they come in line with their international obligations and demonstrate that their nuclear program is peaceful.' American officials say Rouhani's change in tone is driven by the Iranian public's frustration with crippling economic sanctions levied by the U.S. But it is still unclear whether Iran is willing to take the steps the U.S. is seeking in order to ease the sanctions, including curbing uranium enrichment and shutting down the Fordo underground nuclear facility.","Queen Rania arrives in New York ahead of Obama's scheduled address later today .

Samantha Lewthwaite, of Aylesbury, is seen in a newly-released photo from her school days . A shop worker says a woman resembling ‘white widow’ Samantha Lewthwaite sprayed her with machine-gun bullets during the Kenyan mall massacre. As the four-day siege drew to a close last night, a witness said an AK-47-wielding ‘pale-skinned woman’ with long dark hair – the same as British Muslim convert Lewthwaite – locked eyes with her as she cowered beneath a box before opening fire from a balcony. Amazingly, the woman, who gave her name only as Caroline, escaped unharmed as Islamists stormed the Westgate shopping centre. She said: ‘She was high up but not far from me, close enough that I saw her looking along the floor where I was until she saw me. ‘She stopped and aimed at me and then opened fire. All of the  bullets did not hit me, I don’t know how that happened. ‘She stopped firing at me for a moment and looked away and I jumped up and ran around a corner and that’s how I escaped. ‘She had pale skin and long black hair, and was wearing a baggy black top. I can’t remember very much, but I remember she had pale skin.’ A senior Kenyan anti-terror officer last night revealed that police had received many witness accounts of a female attacker resembling the widow of 7/7 bomber Jermaine Lindsay. He added: ‘We believe that she was involved in the attack. We cannot doubt the eyewitnesses who say they saw her commanding the attackers.’ Mother: Relatives of Samantha Lewthwaite, from Buckinghamshire, in the UK maintained a wall of silence . The vivid description of a female jihadist comes as Kenya president Uhuru Kenyatta last night confirmed he had received intelligence reports suggesting a British woman was involved. Kenya foreign minister Amina Mohamed added: ‘The Briton was a woman... who has done this many times before.’ Yesterday, a Twitter account purporting to belong to militant group Al Shabaab also claimed that Lewthwaite had ‘commanded’ the attack. A post said: ‘We have received permission to disclose the involvement of Samantha Lewthwaite aka sherafiyah [her Islamic name], she successfully overseered [sic] the mission.’ British security officials say they have yet to receive confirmation from the Kenyan authorities of Lewthwaite’s role in the attack, but they would not be ‘entirely surprised’ if she is involved. It emerged yesterday that Lewthwaite’s grandmother, 85-year-old Ellen Allen, was rushed to hospital in Banbridge, Northern Ireland after collapsing from the stress of her granddaughter’s notoriety. In court: Lewthwaite has been on the run since police foiled her bomb plot in Mombasa, Kenya, in 2011. Yesterday, the trial for her British accomplice in this plot, Jermaine Grant (pictured), began in Mombasa . Lewthwaite, from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, has been on the run since police foiled her bomb plot targeting Western hotels and a shopping mall in the Kenyan coastal resort of Mombasa in December 2011. 'She stopped and aimed at me and then opened fire. All of the  bullets did not hit me, I don’t know how that happened' Witness 'Caroline' Yesterday, the trial for her British accomplice in this plot, Jermaine Grant, began in Mombasa. Scotland Yard anti-terror officers gave evidence for the first time, describing the chemicals found at their make-shift bomb factory. As mother-of-four Lewthwaite’s relatives in the UK maintained a wall of silence, a former police detective told the Mail he was ‘not surprised’ to learn of her suspected role in the attack. Noel Hogan, who interviewed the former grammar school pupil shortly before the July 7 bombings, said: ‘If Samantha is involved, it does not surprise me.’ Mr Hogan was hired by a bank to investigate why their customer, Lewthwaite’s husband Lindsay, had spent £900 on dozens of bottles of perfume over a matter of days. Operation: Kenyan soldiers move in formation, clearing the top floor balcony and interior of the Nairobi mall . The suspicious purchases were made just days before the July 7 bombings and were used to make the homemade explosives. 'She was an average, British, young, ordinary girl. She didn’t have very good confidence' Councillor Raj Khan on Lewthwaite . As part of his agency’s investigation, they spoke to Lewthwaite four times. Mr Hogan said: ‘On each occasion it was noted that her stories were inconsistent and her demeanour was unusual. ‘We didn’t consider her a particularly honest individual.’ Yet those who knew Lewthwaite from her hometown of Aylesbury expressed surprise at her role as one of Al Shabaab’s key financiers and bomb-making tutors. Councillor Raj Khan said: ‘She was an average, British, young, ordinary girl. She didn’t have very good confidence. There was nothing that made me worried about her.’ Lewthwaite was seven months pregnant when her husband blew himself up, killing 26 people.","Witness saw an AK-47-wielding 'pale-skinned woman' with long dark hair .

Unimpressed: Former Metropolitan Police deputy assistant commissioner Stephen Kavanagh spoke out after becoming fed up of officers pulling sickies . Police officers are pulling sick days to nurse their hangovers in bed, a chief constable has claimed. Stephen Kavanagh, 47, who leads Essex Police, spoke out after becoming fed up of officers drinking too much and then failing to show up. The Chelmsford-based force’s officers average 12 days off sick every year - but married father-of-one Mr Kavanagh has now vowed to get tough on those abusing the system. The £192,000-a-year chief constable said: ‘If you look at the overall numbers, compared to other forces, there is a group - a small group, but a group nonetheless - abusing the process. ‘If they can’t get time off, they take it sick. If they have a heavy night, on occasions they are taking days off. They will be challenged and, if necessary, they will be dealt with. 'I am concerned the current levels of sickness mean some officers have to pick up the work of those not in. If anyone abuses the sickness management process, then they will be challenged. What I want to do is have a sickness management process that supports those who are genuinely in need.’ Essex Police Federation chairman Mark Smith agreed sickness levels had got out of hand, but added: ‘Police officers are suffering - they are under pressure and more is being heaped on. ‘Managers don’t have time to follow sickness procedures and we are not on top of it. There is no welfare system and the stress is too much.’ Looking inside: Mr Kavanagh said that if for some officers, 'if they have a heavy night, on occasions they are taking days off' (file picture) However Mr Kavanagh was quick to compare his team’s sickness record with that of nurses in a similarly stressful environment at nearby Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford. He added: ‘We should be much better than where we are at the moment. Nurses at Broomfield Hospital have an average of seven days off a year, while my officers are off for more than 12. ‘Policing can be a stressful occupation, but so is being a nurse or a member of any other emergency service or the military. ‘I will be working with the federation to . see how we support those who are genuinely in need and how we work . together to make sure people do not abuse the system. Comparison: Mr Kavanagh said nurses at Broomfield Hospital (pictured) in Chelmsford have an average of seven days off a year, while his officers are off for more than 12 . ‘I think we all aspire to have one of the lowest sickness rates in the country.’ 'If they can’t get time off, they take it sick.

Mr Kavanagh was born in Basildon, Essex, and joined the county’s force in May from a high profile role in the Metropolitan Police, where he started as a constable in 1985. In 1998, the Cambridge University graduate took on the role of Homicide Senior Investigating Officer for East London, leading on 50 murder investigations.

A former teacher who was found dead at her home left a suicide note blaming a routine procedure carried out at a leading cosmetic surgery clinic for making her life ‘hell’. Victoria Meppen-Walter, 44, spiralled into depression after being left with what she described as ‘dreadful facial deformities’ when a mole was removed from her forehead. She took an overdose of pills after typing a note blaming her cosmetic surgeon for her impending death and asking that his name be engraved on her headstone as a reminder of her suffering. 'Suffering': Mrs Meppen-Walter, pictured on a family holiday in 2008, said that she was left unable to leave the house after she suffered pain and facial redness . Aftermath: Mrs Meppen-Walker with a plaster on her forehead following the procedure in September 2011 . Allegations: Mrs Meppen-Walter asked her husband for the surgeon's name to be included in the inscription on her gravestone . In a series of notes, Mrs . Meppen-Walter complained that she had been left with severe pain from . ‘burning flesh in the face, neck and chest’ and spoke of a ‘regular . stabbing pain’ in her forehead. She . said her life had become ‘hell’ because she was unable to leave her . home after her face was left so severely deformed that friends did not . recognise her. In her final note, which was addressed to her husband Ashley, 64, she wrote: ‘Life is for enjoyment not for endless suffering.’ The . letter, written in July, made requests for her funeral and said: ‘What I . would appreciate though is this inscription: “Died as a result of . malice caused by Dr [name blacked out] of Transform in Sep 2011.”’ But . the world-renowned Transform Clinic, in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, . said it provided a ‘high standard’ of care for Mrs Meppen-Walter and . the surgeon involved said he had successfully carried out many similar . procedures. Company . director Mr Meppen-Walter, who found the note at the family home in . Heywood, Greater Manchester, said his wife of 17 years ‘couldn’t take . any more’. Procedure: Mrs Meppen-Walter complained of 'endless suffering' after having moles removed in a procedure at the Transform Clinic in Cheshire . ‘It was only . supposed to be a 25-minute procedure,’ he said. ‘But during the . operation she said there was a lot of blood pouring from her head. A few . weeks after the procedure she realised she had been left with a scar. She presumed it would fade away in time but it didn’t. ‘She said she was in a lot of pain. She would sit there with her head in her hands and her eyes closed.’ Mr . Meppen-Walter, a father of three, said his wife began to lack . confidence and became a complete recluse following the surgery. Then she . began to talk about suicide. He . reported her missing on August 30 after she disappeared two days . earlier and he found her disturbing notes. Officers searched the house . but did not find a body. Her . body remained undiscovered for a further three days in an unused locked . front room of their £500,000 home. It was eventually found by Mr . Meppen-Walter’s son, who climbed in through a window. Initially . Mr Meppen-Walter, his 24-year-old daughter Ainsley and a man aged 24 . were arrested on suspicion of murder. They were released shortly . afterwards without charge. A spokesman for Transform said: ‘The . treatment we provided was of a high standard.

He also said she had been having psychiatric care and ‘we had to . get the police involved as she had been causing difficulty for members . of our staff and myself’. Mrs Meppen-Walter was the step-gran of former Manchester City player Courtney Meppen-Walter, who was jailed for 16 months after killing two people in a car crash.","Victoria Meppen-Walter was found dead at her home in Heywood, Cheshire .

NASA's newest delivery service pulled up at the International Space Station on Sunday after a week's delay, bringing more than a half-ton of meals and special treats to the astronauts who assisted in the high-flying feat. With the smooth linkup, Orbital Sciences Corp. became only the second company to accomplish such a far-flung shipment. The space station astronauts used their ship's huge robot arm to grab the Cygnus capsule, as the two vessels zoomed 260 miles above the Indian Ocean. Scroll down for video . On track: The Cygnus spacecraft as it approaches the International Space Station. The Canadarm 2 which will grapple the spacecraft can be seen lower left. Parking up: After a series of successful steering maneuvers, the Orbital Sciences Cygnus freighter parked about 39 feet from the station . Complex: Ten minutes later, Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano and NASA's Karen Nyberg used the station's robotic arm to pluck the capsule from orbit and prepared to attach it to a berthing slip . ‘Everybody is just so excited,’ Mission Control radioed. Ground teams described the achievement as ‘epic’ and ‘superb.’` Orbital Sciences launched the Cygnus capsule on this test flight from Virginia on Sept. 18. It was supposed to reach the space station last Sunday, but got held up by inaccurate navigation data. A software patch fixed everything. Then the Cygnus had to wait for a Russian spacecraft bringing three new astronauts in midweek. The successful arrival means the Virginia-based company can begin making good on a $1.9 billion contract with NASA for a series of Cygnus deliveries. The next one could fly by Christmas. Applause could be heard in Mission Control once Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano grabbed hold of Cygnus with the space station's hulking mechanical arm. ‘Good capture. That's a long time coming,’ Mission Control radioed. ‘Smiles all around,’ added Orbital Sciences in a tweet. Delay: Cygnus' arrival had been delayed a week - first by a software glitch and then by the higher priority docking of a Russian Soyuz capsule ferrying three new crewmembers to the $100 billion outpost, a project of 15 nations . Dropping off food: The firm, known as SpaceX, holds a $1.5 billion NASA contract for 12 cargo runs to the station, two of which already have been completed . Sunday's successful operation culminated years of effort for Orbital Sciences, which was hired by NASA along with the California-based Space Exploration Technologies Corp. to keep the space station well stocked in this post-shuttle era. SpaceX has been launching its supply ships, called Dragon, for more than a year. It's also working on a possible manned capsule that would ferry U.S. astronauts to the space station, rather than having them hitch rides on Russian rockets. Unlike the SpaceX Dragon that can return items to Earth, the Cygnus is designed to burn up upon descent. Once unloaded of its 1,300 pounds worth of food, clothes and other items, it will be filled with trash and cut loose toward the end of October. That's how the Russian, European and Japanese supply ships end up as well: self-destructing garbage cans. The latest delivery included student experiments and, almost certainly, chocolate for the six-person crew. That's what astronaut Karen Nyberg was expecting, anyway, from her astronaut-husband and 3-year-old son. Following the early morning capture, the astronauts worked to install Cygnus - named after the swan constellation - on the space station. The hatch opening was set for early Monday. Both Parmitano and Mission Control paid tribute to the late astronaut for whom the Cygnus is dedicated: G. David Low. Low flew three times on space shuttles, then went to work for Orbital Sciences to help in this new commercial space effort. He died of cancer in 2008 at age 52. His family attended the Cygnus launch from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility. ‘To our great friend and colleague G. David Low ...this one's for you,’ Orbital Sciences said via Twitter.","Orbital Sciences freighter on trail run to outpost .

A French Foreign Legionnaire suspected of . murdering his wife and daughter placed a noose around his neck and then jumped from a window at his army barracks, it has emerged. Horrified witnesses were on their way to breakfast when Francisco Benitez, 50, committed suicide at around 6am at the site in Perpignan, southern France on August 5. He died instantly. Official French sources had previously . reported that the Spanish-born officer had hanged himself behind a closed door in a toilet after he was questioned about the disappearance of his wife Marie-Josée, 53, and their . 19 year old daughter Allison on July 14. Benitez is said to have left a video message and a letter . protesting his innocence. However, speaking to newspaper Midi Libre, the witness portrayed a very different scene. Sources . in Perpignan suggested that his public suicide may have been meant to . impress fellow soldiers with his sense of honour and shame at being . suspected by French police. The disappearance of Marie-Josée, 53, and Allison, 19, was initially treated as a missing persons case. But suspicion began to mount after . their Facebook and Twitter pages weren't updated and neither used their . bank account or answered their phone. The pair also left behind their car . and pet dog, a sign - say the family’s neighbours - that they did not . intend to stay out long. Mr . Benitez claimed the two women had left Perpignan permanently and gone . to Toulouse, but his story was undermined when police recovered the . pair's passports in the family home. In the days following the two women's disappearance Benitez drove an estimated 4,500 kilometers in his car. Missing: Benitez's daughter Allison (right), 19, and his wife . Marie-Josee Benitez (left), 53, disappeared on July 14 and have not been . seen since . In August, blood . containing Allison's DNA was found in a freezer that Benitez and . another soldier moved from his apartment in Perpignan to the barracks. Her blood was also found in a washing machine the soldier used to wash . his clothes. Investigators concluded the freezer had been scoured and washed along with a carpet a few days after the two vanished. Last week, it emerged that in the weeks before she and her mother vanished, 19-year-old Allison - who was due to take part in the Miss Roussillon contest - had begun a personal investigation into her father. It has been claimed she believed he was leading a double life with a Spanish mistress. French . Police are to question the Spanish woman, whom he is known to have phoned two hours before his . death. Mounting suspicion . against Benitez has also led to speculation that he may have been . involved in the disappearance of another of his mistresses, a Brazilian . woman who vanished in 2004. Model looks: Allison had been due to take part in the Miss Roussillon contest before her disappearance . Benitez was known to have been involved in an affair with Simone de Oliveira Alves , a waitress in a bar in Nimes. The last sign of life from Simone de Oliveira Alves, was a text message sent from her phone, telling Benitez she was leaving him. Benitez told police the two had had a fierce argument, which Miss de Oliveira’s sister's Ivana recently suggested could have happened after she discovered Benitez hadn’t yet separated from his wife Marie-Josée. The former mistress's sister even claimed that her she had been pregnant with Benitez’s child at the time she disappeared.

Long's daughter had previously played on the basketball team and the teenager and her teammates were recorded in the locker room during an away game at Sanger High School, WFAA.com reported. Wendee Long (pictured) has been found guilty of wire tapping in Fort Worth, Texas . The daughter was accused of planting the recording device, but her mother was charged for orchestrating the incident in February 2012. A mother of one of the teenagers recorded, Julie Sheridan, said: 'The whole thing was just shocking is so many ways.' It was Sheridan and other parents who filed the original police complaints. Long was found not guilty of improper photography but guilty of wire-tapping and will be sentenced on October 10. Wendee Long allegedly planted the device after her two daughters had complained the coach shouted too much. Long wanted to catch basketball coach Skip Townsend (pictured) shouting at her daughters but wasn't successful . Long's teen daughter Caydan (pictured) planted the camera phone in the locker room . Her teenage daughter Caydan, who did not face any charges, placed a camera phone inside a locker and pressed record. It did not capture coach Skip Townsend, 61, saying or doing anything inappropriate during the half-time meeting, authorities told WFAA-TV. Someone anonymously sent the video to the superintendent and several board members and Long turned herself in to authorities.

Long had been the principal at Wayside Middle School for five years in the Eagle Mountain-Saginaw district. She was placed on paid administrative leave when the incident came to light and the school district conducted its own investigation.

'She has not violated any law,' Peugh told WFAA. 'We do not believe anything has taken place that should involve the justice system.' Julie Sheridan, whose daughter was in the locker room at the time, said: 'I don’t understand why someone would go to those lengths to break a law to try to get something to go the way they want it to go.'

Since allegations surfaced back in May that Mayor Ford had been filmed smoking crack, he has been taking every opportunity to try and rehabilitate his damaged image. A month ago Ford 'beat' wrestling legend Hulk Hogan in an arm wrestling match and on Monday he couldn’t resist the opportunity to be pictured alongside one of the city’s favorite sons. Rapper Drake and Toronto Mayor Rob Ford were pictured together at a press conference to announce that the Toronto Raptors will host the 2016 NBA All-Star game . Photo op? Since allegations surfaced back in May that Mayor Ford had been filmed smoking crack, he has been taking every opportunity to try and rehabilitate his damaged image . It was also announced that Drake has a new role as ‘global ambassador’ for the city’s baseball team, the Toronto Raptors, and he will even have a voice in rebranding the team. The hip hop star is well known for his ‘nice guy’ image which is at odds with a number of other rap stars – and even the mayor of his hometown. While Drake looked every inch the lady’s man in his blue suit, it was in sharp contrast to the rotund Ford who was wearing an ill-fitting suit and constantly mopped at his sweaty brow. Social media was abuzz with people who couldn’t resist the opportunity to comment on Toronto’s very own version of the odd couple. Hot in here: Drake's sharp blue suit was in contrast to the rotund Ford who was wearing an ill-fitting suit and constantly mopped at his sweaty brow . Anything for cameras: In August Ford took part in a bizarre arm wrestling match against Hulk Hogan . ‘Toronto may be the only city on earth where the breakout rap star has a cleaner image than the mayor,’ tweeted @goldsbie. ‘Drake is to hip hop what Rob Ford is to healthy living’ chimed in @dcos9. While @seanjunor added: ‘Mayor Rob Ford spent the day with Drake. An album full of content emerged. Thug life mayor’ It was back in May when allegations first emerged that there was video footage in existence that showed him smoking crack. His supposed dealers tried shopping the tape to news outlets including Gawker and the Toronto Star, but neither could come up with the $200,000 requested. Crack scandal: A still from the video that was shopped around to news outlets in May, depicting the mayor smoking crack. The video has since disappeared . Social media was abuzz with people who couldn't resist the opportunity to comment on Toronto¿s very own version of the odd couple . Eventually Gawker lost contact with the person selling the video and when they resurfaced the source said it was 'gone'. The match-up with Hogan back in August may have been one attempt on Ford's part to draw attention away from the video. Then came Monday’s press conference to announce that Toronto will hold the league’s annual showcase for the first time. Tim Lieweke, president and CEO of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, said the team is in the process of planning a major facelift that will include a new look and new colors in time for 2016. Drake will be heavily involved in the effort, which is expected to take the next two seasons. ‘I’m really out here with the people. I’m in touch with what they want to see,’ Drake said. ‘I really just want excitement for this team. I want us to be one of the biggest teams in the league.' Lieweke called this the beginning of a 'new age' for the Raptors. But the Raptors have a long way to go on the court. They haven’t made the playoffs since 2008.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:20 EST, 30 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:24 EST, 30 September 2013 . The families of a young teenage couple who were brutally killed and dumped in a ravine in 1980 have spoken out about their relief that the killer has finally been convicted after 32 years. The murder of Sabrina Gonsalves and John Riggins, both 18, in Davis, California remained unsolved for decades until a DNA breakthrough helped track down their killer, Richard Hirschfield. Hirschfield, now 64, was convicted last year of sexually assaulting Sabrina before slitting her and John's throats and discarding their bodies in a ravine days before Christmas. He is now on death row. A year since his conviction, the families of the victims have spoken to 48 Hours about the pain they endured for decades - and their relief that the deaths have finally been solved. Loss: John Riggins and Sabrina Gonsalves, both 18, were murdered in 1980 - and it took investigators 32 years to convict their killer. Their families have now spoken about the struggle for justice . 'I'm not free, because I miss her,' Sabrina's sister, Andrea Rosenstein, said. 'But, he's out of our life. We never have to think about him again. I can just miss her - I can just think about that and we're really ready to do that.' It is finally some closure for the families, who initially thought the killers had been found in the mid-80s before the case was dismissed and the accused were found innocent. The couple met just months before their deaths; Sabrina, who hoped to become a physical therapist, and John, a budding sportsman with dreams of becoming a doctor, met while working for the town's recreation department that summer. 'He was really her first boyfriend. And . she fell in love with him,' her sister remembered. 'John was so much . fun... He was funny and lighthearted and he loved sports... They were . perfect together.' Sadness: John's parents, Richard and Kate Riggins, said they felt guilt they could not be there to protect him . Enduring pain: Sabrina's sister, Andrea Rosenstein, said she could finally concentrate on missing her sister . On the night of December 20, 1980, Sabrina, who was attending the University of California at Davis, was traveling with John in his van to her sister's birthday party - but they failed to turn up. The families were worried, but initially thought the teenagers could have been in a car wreck because of the thick fog that night. Thirty-six hours later, the van was found about 30 miles east of Davis in Sacramento County - and just a few hours later, the bodies were found less than a mile away in a ravine. 'It was sickening,' former Detective Carol Daly said. 'The horrificness of what we were seeing and what they must have gone through. 'They had duct tape around their eyes and around their mouth... Looking at them, we knew their throats had been cut. And they were dumped. Just like trash.' Sabrina had been sexually assaulted and John had a head injury that suggested he had tried to protect her. Missed: Sabrina (right with her sister and mother) was abducted with John as they drove to her sister's party . Young love: The couple had met the previous summer and seemed perfect together, family members said . Devastating: John's van was discovered 36 hours later, and hours after that, their bodies were found. It appeared that Sabrina had been sexually assaulted and John had tried to help her . In the following weeks and months, police received hundreds of tips but the investigation went nowhere - until six years later, when they thought they finally had a breakthrough. Another murder had been committed by Gerald Gallego that had similarities with the Sweetheart Murders - but Gallego had been in jail when they were killed. Police believed that his friends had carried out the murder so it looked like a copy cat to try to clear him. In 1989, his half brother, David Hunt, was arrested with his wife and two friends. They claimed they were innocent and on the eve of their trial, after three years in prison, DNA evidence was found on a blanket in the van that was covered with the killer's semen stains. With the development of DNA testing, the stains could now be scrutinized - and it emerged they did not belong to any of the Hunt group. It meant the trail was cold once again. Sketch: Authorities released this sketch of a suspicious-looking man in the area but no arrests were made . Caught: Eventually, after more than 20 years, DNA tests showed the DNA of Richard Hirschfield in the van . By 2002, the state crime lab was routinely comparing DNA in cold cases to that stored on a database of criminals. The DNA from the blanket was found to match a suspect already in a Washington prison. It belonged to a man called Richard Hirschfield, who had been accused of sexually assaulting women and children. He was convicted of rape in California in 1975. Authorities said he had friends who lived opposite to Sabrina and they believed Hirschfield had abducted her and her boyfriend simply because she was pretty. Investigators questioned his brother, Joseph, who lived nearby and told him about the DNA evidence, causing him to shake, they said. The next day, Joseph Hirschfield was found dead in his car after committing suicide with carbon monoxide. He left a note reading: 'I have been living with this horror . for 20 years. Richard did commit those murders, but I was there. I . didn't kill anyone, but my DNA is still there.' Accused: He was accused years after David Hunt and Doug Lainer had mistakenly been tied to the crimes . Anger: Hunt and Lainer had always denied any involvement and happily gave their DNA for tests . His DNA was never found in the van and authorities do not know what role he played in the killings. A decade later, after investigators trawled through 200,000 pages of discovery, the case was finally brought to trial in September 2012. After hearing the evidence - and Hirschfield's lawyers' claims that his DNA was on the blanket simply because he had slept in the van because he was a drifter - the jury found him guilty of the murders. The families spoke at a second hearing to determine if Hirschfield should get the death penalty. 'Visualizing the way he died, you know, wrapped up in tape, throat cut, thrown in a ditch, trying to breathe... knowing he's dying and... excuse me,' Dr. Richard Riggins told the court as he became emotional. 'I wasn't there. And there was nothing I could do. So I'd failed in my biggest duty to him.' The jury took just two hours to decide to give Hirschfield the death penalty. Sentenced: Hirschfield, pictured in court last year, has now been sentenced to death for the killings . Speaking in January 2012, Judge Michael Sweet referred to the families and their pain. 'You have endured so much,' he said. 'The tortured history of this case must have taken away any hope you had that the person responsible for these acts would be discovered and held to answer. 'My sincere and deep-felt apologies for the tragedies you have suffered.' John's father, speaking of his relief, added: 'We will never know the gifts that John and Sabrina would have given society, but we do know Hirschfield’s contribution, humiliation, pain and death.'","Sweethearts Sabrina Gonsalves and John Riggins, both 18, were killed in 1980; she had been sexually assaulted and he had tried to save her .

The ex-wife of a man who shot dead five schoolgirls seven years ago this week, revealed today that she believes he was 'getting back at the Lord' over the death of their premature daughter. Marie Monville was married to Charlie Roberts, 32, when he opened fire at an Amish . school in rural Pennsylvania on October 2, 2006. The milk truck driver, who was not Amish, singled out girls aged between six and 13 in his deadly attack - ordering the male pupils and teachers out of the classroom before he lined-up and shot the children one-by-one in the head. Mrs Monville, who has since remarried, told GMA today that on that fateful morning, Roberts had left her a suicide note in which he wrote about the death of their daughter Elise. Scroll down for video . Marie and Charlie Roberts pictured on their wedding day in November 1996. Ten years later, he shot dead five little Amish girls in a one-room school in rural Pennsylvania . Coming to terms with tragedy: Marie Roberts Monville was married to Charles Roberts when he shot dead five girls in an Amish schoolhouse and injured five others seven years ago this week . The couple's first child had died in 1997 just 20 minutes after she was born three months prematurely. Unexplained: Roberts, 32, shot dead five little girls and seriously injured five others before turning the gun on himself . She told GMA: 'And in some way he felt like he was getting back at the Lord for the loss that we had sustained.' Roberts . also made the chilling admission in his letter that he had molested two . relatives although police could not prove any attacks had taken place. The father-of-three had acted normal . on the morning of October 2, 2006. He had returned home from his night . shift at 3am and rose to wave his own two children off to school. Marie Roberts, as she was then, left the house soon after and returned to find rambling suicide notes written by her husband. She managed to speak to him briefly . on his phone soon after but didn't understand fully what was happening . until police arrived at her door. 'It was a gorgeous day, one of those Indian Summer days. We walked down to . the bus stop with the kids and he kissed them and said he loved them,' she said. 'I didn't understand the scope of what was going on until the police . came to my door. They said that Charlie had walked into the schoolhouse, . that he held the girls hostage and shot them and five of them died . before he shot himself. 'To know that the man who walked down to the bus that morning and kissed . his own kids and said that he loved them was capable of hurting someone . else's children was unfathomable - yet there was no way to say that it . didn't happen, because it just had.' The . shootings devastated the devout Amish community of Lancaster County . isolated from the modern world with no television or cars to spread the . message of what happened. Tragedy: Five schoolgirls were shot dead in Roberts shooting attack after he barricaded himself in to the one room schoolhouse. Police believe he intended to molest his victims but shot them instead when police disrupted his plan . In mourning: These little girls were pictured at the funeral for Roberts' five victims, all aged between 6 and 13 . As news spread, grief-stricken families began to arrive at the one room schoolhouse in their traditional buggies and horses. Five . couples were to be told their little girls had died while Marie Roberts . had to gather together her three children to try and explain what had . happened. 'My son was five and he was outside playing in the backyard,' Marie says in the film. 'The windows . were open and the breeze was blowing in with the sounds of their . laughter and playfulness. 'I just soaked in that moment thinking, 'Is this going to be . the last time I ever hear this? In a matter of minutes I'm going to . have to shatter their world and tell them something no parent would ever want to say.  Am I ever going to hear . them laugh again?' Funeral procession: The community was devastated by the multiple shootings in rural Pennsylvania in 2006 . 'I drew them in and we sat there together in the . silence of that moment almost as if - if we were quiet enough the world would change, but it didn't.' Reports at the time suggested that Roberts told his wife in their last phone call that he had molested children in his family 20 years ago and was going to do it again. Police said they believed this was his intention in taking the girls hostage but was stopped by the arrival of police to the scene. He had barricaded the door shut and lined the girls up in front of a blackboard and bound their feet. Police attempted to negotiate with him before he fired the deadly shots using a handgun and shotgun. He killed Naomi Rose Ebersole, seven, Anna Mae Stoltzfuz, 12, Marian Fischer, 13 and sisters Mary Liz and Lina Miller, eight and seven. The most severely injured survivor of the schoolhouse attack remains . unable to eat, sit or talk. In December, the victims parents wrote to the families who lost children in the Sandy Hook massacre. Shooting: A similar classroom in an Amish school near to Nickel Mines. The victims were aged 6 to 13 and included two sisters . Herman Bontrager, a spokesman for the Nickel Mines Amish . community, said: 'This is a time when the scabs are rubbed raw again.' Mrs Monville has spoken at many churches about what happened and released a book on her experiences earlier this year. Entitled One Light Still Shines: My Life Beyond the Shadow of the Amish Schoolhouse Shooting, she says she hopes it will appeal to others who have suffered 'similar brokenness'. She admits that the months that followed were hard but she relied on her faith to get her through. 'I had never known a place of desperation like that ,' she said.  'There was nowhere . to run nowhere to hide, there weren't any real answers. I was being . looked on by the world to give some kind of answer but for me there was nothing for me to go back to but the Lord. 'It doesn't matter what your circumstances are God is in the midst of them.' When it's someone that you've loved, the lens with which you look at the story is completely different because it is not a story it's your life.' 'I want to invite the reader into my story, knowing that we all have places of similar brokenness regardless of circumstance.  I hope the reader will view their circumstances differently, through the lens of expectancy – looking for God to breathe joy upon the places they need it most and would otherwise expect it least.'

Captive man: Whitey Bulger, 83, was sentenced to life in prison with up to 30 additional years behind bars . James 'Whitey Bulger' has written an explosive letter from solitary confinement denying any involvement in the death of Debbie Davis and accusing her family of cashing in on her death, it was revealed today. For the first time, the convict gives his version of events surrounding the brutal 1981 murder of the teen and said the $1million pay out the government awarded to her family was 'A F***ING RIP OFF OF THE TAX PAYERS MONEY!!' - even though the defense for his murder trial cost taxpayers $2.6million. He blames Davis' boyfriend - his former henchman - Stephen Flemmi  for the woman's slaying, claiming Flemmi carried it out when he found out the teen was secretly dating another member of the mob and had been doing a lot of drugs. In his recent trial, Bulger was charged with the murder of Davis but the jury served up a 'no finding' verdict. In his letter, obtained by RadarOnline, he insists:  'I never killed a woman in my life!' Remembering the day he met her at a Massachusetts jewelry shop, he said: 'Debbie was young, kind of cute, or pretty is a better adjective, with a nice smile. 'Very young, I thought 15 or so, when her and Stevie started going out. But [she changed] into a material girl. 'Soon Debbie is driving a Corvette . car, hair streaked with blonde, lots of flashy stylish clothes. She was . very thin, pretty and changed.' It wasn't long before Flemmi . discovered his teen girlfriend was on speed and went to coke parties . behind his back, Whitey wrote in the letter. Better days: Whitey Bulger wrote in a recent letter from prison that the 16 years he spent on the run with his girlfriend Catherine Greig were the best of his life (pictured together here in an undated photo) Spotted: Greig and Bulger were captured in 2011 in their then-apartment in Santa Monica, California . When she quit her job at the jewelry . store, 'Stevie would send Debbie and her mother on vacation to keep her . busy and happy. Plus constant gifts of expensive clothes, jewels. 'She and her mother went to Acapulco, Mexico, nice place in the winter, first class Hyatt Regency, etc. 'She and her mother were there for two weeks, soon her mother comes home, alone!' the inmate recalls . 'No word from Debbie, no phone calls, . Stevie is going nuts!! She comes home with long story. Changed, demands . he marry her, buy land, put up two houses.' It was when Flemmi bugged her phone that he found out she was seeing someone else. 'The whole Davis family is in on this . and Stevie knows it and slowly goes insane. He winds up killing . Debbie,' Bulger claims, adding that her whole family knew he was . innocent from the get go. In his letter he calls them 'low . lives' who knew that Debbie was running with a dangerous crowd and accuses them of making a living from her death. In September 2009, a judge ordered . Bulger and Flemmi to pay the Davis family $33.5 million in damages after . a wrongful death lawsuit. They later got $1,000,000 from the federal . government. 'A F***ING RIP OFF OF THE TAX PAYERS . MONEY!! UNREAL …' Bulger writes. 'I would bet my life … if [the Davis . family] was offered that Debbie could come back [to life if they] would . return the money, it would NEVER HAPPEN!!!!' Wanted: The FBI released these photos of Mr Bulger (left, center) and Ms Greig (right) in an effort to find the two fugivites . Traveling man: Bulger, seen here in an undated photo that was shown at his trial, was on the run from about 1995 to 2011 but now he will spend the rest of his life behind bars . Earlier days: In his latest letter, Bulger said that the years on the run- and not the ones when he was working his way up to be Boston's biggest mob boss- were his favorite .

Three young blind people from Phoenix, Arizona, have conquered yet another dream that most would deem unrealistic due to their visual impairment. Max Ashton, 17, Tanner Robinson, 24, and Katie Cupp, 19 completed the arduous Alcatraz Invitational Swim through the rough waters between Alcatraz Island and Aquatic Park in San Francisco, California, on Sunday. With the help of sighted swimming guides, Ashton came in first, swimming the 1.25-mile distance in just a little over 50 minutes. Blind and brave: Max Ashton, 17, (right) swam from Alcatraz to the San Francisco mainland as the first blind person. He was guided by Paul Tiffany (left) during the swim . With a little help: Ashton, middle, and his two sighted guides - the Tiffany brothers Mike, left, and Paul, right . Finish line: Swimmers participating in the Alcatraz Invitational Swim were greeted by friends and family at Aquatic Park on Sunday . Record: Ashton, right, completed the swim in a little over 50 minutes, the first blind person to do so . Ice-cold waters: It's a long and tedious swim from Alcatraz Island to the San Francisco mainland . The hardest part of making the swim is staying on a straight line, so Ashton was guided by two brothers, Mike and Paul Tiffany, both of Phoenix, who made sure he did not veer off course. The brothers said the trip was uneventful, although Ashton clocked one of them when he swam too close. ‘I took a couple of shots in the face from Max,’ said Paul, who has made a total of six Alcatraz swims. According to Ashton, it feels ‘good to show people I can do everything, really', he said after making it across the bay. ‘I feel great now. This is huge. Next is college.’ This is not the first time the high school college prep senior has done ‘the impossible’. When he was 13, he climbed Kenya’s Mount Kilimanjaro, and a year later he crossed the Grand Canyon. The two others who also did the swim, Robinson and Cuppy, were both happy they did it. Made it! Visually-impaired Tanner Robinson, 24, (second from right) is greeted by his teammates after completing the swim from Alcatraz . Escape from Alcatraz: The island with its prison was once deemed impossible to escape from . Robinson has also climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro and made the rim-to-rim trek across the Grand Canyon together with Ashton in fundraising events put on by the Phoenix-based Foundation for Blind Children. However, the bay swim was ‘the hardest one’ of the challenges, he told the San Francisco Chronicle. Between 1933 and 1963, the U.S. government sent some of its most dangerous criminals to Alcatraz Island, including the likes of Al Capone, Machine Gun Kelly and Whitey Bulgar. The current in the San Francisco Bay is often strong and unpredictable, which is why of the 36 prison inmates who tried to escape, only six made it out of the waters alive. Robinson, who works at the secretary of state's office in Arizona, finished in an hour and 16 minutes. Happy: Katie Cuppy, 19, who is also blind, is helped up from the water after finishing the swim in one hour and 24 minutes . Nothing is impossible: Cuppy, who is studying special education, says blind people can do anything that a sighted person can . Robinson said he kept going, despite the . cold water and his novice status as a swimmer, thanks to months of . training at Arizona's Lake Pleasant. ‘The nice thing about being blind is you don't know where the finish line is,’ he said. ‘It was just like another training.’ Cuppy, who is studying special education and hopes to teach blind children, did the swim in one hour and 24 minutes. ‘This shows we can do anything else a sighted person can do, without limits,’ she said.","Max Ashton, 17, from Phoenix, Arizona, did the swim between Alcatraz and San Francisco's Aquatic Park in 50 minutes .

Children as young as five were shot up to five times by the terrorists that carried out the Westgate mall massacre, it has emerged. The attack, carried out last week by gunmen from Somalia-based terrorist group Al Shabaab, left 67 people dead, including six Britons. New accounts of the extremists' merciless assault reveal for the first time the fate of some of the 30 children who attended a cooking event at the mall. Some of them were as young as 12. Response team: A grab from a video made available on Saturday September 28 showing an armed undercover police officer guarding a stairwell approaching the scene of the terror attack . Brave: An armed undercover police officer, left, and head of Westgate security (no name available), right, approach the terrorists . Rescued: Undercover police officers and police with guns asking shoppers caught up in the incident to leave with their hands up as they crouch on the ground for cover . Escape: A young girl runs from a store in Westgate, beckoned on by officials and shoppers . One girl at the event, 16-year-old Nehal Vekariya, was shot through the eye, according to The Sunday Times. The paper reports her father’s final phone conversation with her. He said: ‘She said “I’m okay, I’m with friends, call Mummy fast and tell her I’m okay”.’ When her mother called her she heard yelling and then gunshots, then the line went dead. She had been cut down at close range. The paper also reports that witnesses describe children as young as five being hit up to five times by the terrorists, as they roamed the mall looking for victims. Terrified: Civilians take cover as gunmen roam the mall during the terrorist attack earlier this month . Saved: A woman drops from a ventilator shaft in the mall as plain clothed police rescue her . Mall massacre: A soldier carries a child to safety as armed police hunt the gunmen who went on a brutal shooting spree at Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi on September 21 . Memorial: A soldier from the Kenya Defence Forces salutes while another pays his respects as they and other Kenyans came to light candles, sing and pray,to mark one week since the terrorist attack . Solemn: A Kenyan girl lights a candle to pay her respects to those killed in the Westgate mall massacre . Mitul Shah, 38, meanwhile, a London-born father of one caught up in the siege, was hailed a ‘hero and a star’ for reportedly offering hicmself as a hostage to allow children to escape from militants. According to The Sunday Times, one of the gunmen told victims: 'You didn't spare our women and children. Why should we spare yours?' Firefighters, police and soldiers were faced with horrific scenes when they entered the mall. One firefighter told the paper how he was sent in to put out a fire in the CCTV control room, started by rocket-propelled grenades that were fired by soldiers. He heard screaming from a balcony, then gunshots, then saw blood dripping from above. Some security men were crying, he said. Then a severed hand and a head wrapped in cloth landed on the floor next to them. A Western security official told The Sunday Times: 'They were saying to the troops, ""If you come any closer we will execute a hostage"".' The extremists had piled dead bodies up against the doors to hinder their progress. It's understood from intelligence sources that the Kenyan military deliberately caved in the top floor car park to kill them, by firing rocket-propelled grenades at the support columns. They assumed that if the hostages weren't already dead, they soon would be. Al Shabaab was making proclamations on social media that they weren't willing to negotiate. As many as 30 hostages were taken by the terrorists according to the British High Commission, with many of them still unaccounted for. A British SAS unit was on standby to help the Kenyan military, but they weren't called in. Eight suspects are being held over the attack according to Kenya’s Interior Minister Joseph Ole Lenku said. Three others who had been detained were released. At least five attackers also were killed. Destroyed: Vehicles are seen in the rubble in the destruction at the Westgate Shopping Centre . However, there are fears that some of the extremists, including suspected British terrorist Samantha Lewthwaite, may be on the loose, having escaped through the city’s drainage system. A unnamed source told The Sun on Sunday: ‘It may have been a way out for some of the terrorists. They could have escaped like sewer rats.’ On Saturday leaked intelligence briefings revealed that the Kenyan government had been warned some months ago Al Shabaab was planning an attack in Nairobi between September 13 and 21. One report named suspected  terrorists in Nairobi who were ‘planning to mount suicide attacks on an undisclosed date, targeting Westgate Mall’ and a cathedral. Mutea Iringo, principal secretary in the Ministry of Interior, said: ‘Every day we get intelligence and action is taken as per that intelligence and many attacks averted. But the fact that you get the intelligence does not mean something cannot happen. ‘What we are saying is that we are at war, and that every day some young Kenyan is being radicalised by al Shabaab to kill Kenyans.’ The murderous attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya has brought home the need for ‘permanent vigilance’ against terrorism in the UK, Prime Minister David Cameron said today. Mr Cameron said he had no intelligence of plans for an ‘imminent’ attack in Britain but acknowledged that there was a ‘worry’ that British-based Somalis trained by the extremist Al-Shabaab group in the east African country might return to the UK with the intention of committing outrages. He said that he had chaired meetings of the Government's Cobra emergency contingency committee over the past week to discuss the implications of the Westgate attack. Contingency plans have already been put in place in the period following the similar attacks in Mumbai, India, in 2008, he said. Mr Cameron told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: ‘We have been looking at this for a long time because of the appalling attack that happened in Mumbai in India. ‘I have personally chaired a whole series of meetings years ago, but again actually this week, to check that we have got everything in place to prepare for those sorts of attacks. ‘We don't have intelligence that something is about to happen, but it pays to be very, very prepared, very, very cautious, and to work out we have everything in place we can to deal with awful events like this.’ Asked whether he was concerned that British-based Somalis might export terror from the African state to the UK, Mr Cameron said: ‘There is always a worry of that and there is a hotbed of terrorism in Somalia that spills over into other countries, and we are concerned about that and follow that. ‘What it shows I think is that we have to keep going against Islamist extremism, whether that is people that are home-grown in our own country or whether it is extremism that is fomenting either on the Horn of Africa or in West Africa or in Afghanistan and Pakistan. ‘It goes to this whole argument about why we need well-funded intelligence services, why we need to be engaged in the world, we need to share intelligence with others and why we have to be permanently vigilant. ‘I take these responsibilities incredibly seriously, I chair the Cobra meetings myself and I make sure that everything from ambulance to fire to police, that everything is prepared. ‘We don't have intelligence about anything imminent, but of course when that Mumbai attack happened and you see what happened in Kenya, any responsible government would look at its own processes and procedures, and say how would we cope with something like that?’","Gunmen targeted 30 children who were taking part in a cooking event .

Sunday marks the finale of AMC's 'Breaking Bad,' but that doesn't mean Albuquerque residents are going into mourning. Instead they are getting ready to celebrate with watch parties and red carpet casting events. Local Jesuit volunteers at Immaculate Conception Church will . hold a watch party in the basement of the downtown church while other fans . will gather at Hotel Albuquerque for a special VIP showing serviced with . special cocktails named after 'Breaking Bad' characters. The town's celebration of the hit show's finale is perhaps not so surprising given the new business it has brought to the area. The southwestern New Mexico city that's . played home to the Emmy-award winning series for the last five seasons . is and will continue to benefit from a tourism boost thanks to the . drama's popularity. Scroll down for video . 'Breaking Bad' stars Aaron Paul (left) and Bryan Cranston make meth during an episode that aired during Season 5 . Debbie Ball, owner of Albuquerque's The Candy Lady,  spoke to The Independent about creating blue rock sugar that substituted as crystal meth during the first two seasons of 'Breaking Bad.' 'After . the show's star Bryan Cranston handed one to David Letterman on air . last July, (Ball) sold 30,000 bags in 12 months, profits increased by 20 . per cent, and the counterfeit Class A now accounts for a quarter of her . daily sales.' 'Albuquerque itself has become… a . really important character in our show,'Cranston said recently. 'It . gave it a justifiable location. A sound, solid place that not many . people have related to. They've seen Los Angeles, they've seen New York, . but they haven't really seen Albuquerque.' The show follows former high school teacher Walter White, . played by Bryan Cranston, producing methamphetamine with a former . student, Jesse Pinkman, played by Aaron Paul. The Candy Lady's Heisenberg 'Meth' rock candy in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The fastest selling items are $1baggies of Heisenberg ""Meth"" rock candy. The Octopus Car Wash in Albuquerque has been a part of ""Breaking Bad"" since Season 1 when Walter White took a part-time job there and later in the series it was used as a cover to launder his drug money. Despite its dark themes of drug . trafficking and violence, tourism officials say 'Breaking Bad' highlighted neighborhoods around the city and gave viewers a sense of . Albuquerque. The show displayed the city's downtown Route 66, its . various stores and restaurants, and even took audiences to Latino . barrios and nearby American Indian Pueblos - places rarely seen in . Hollywood. A city-run website detailing locations of scenes - from seedy motels to . the one-time headquarters of a now deceased drug lord - has seen tens of . thousands of visitors. 'Breaking Bad' fans from all over the world have traveled to Albuquerque to view Walter and Skylar White's fictional home. The owners of the home have reported counting over 400 visitors a day pacing the street outside of their home . Tourists even like to visit the exterior of the White's house. The . Independent reveals that the home's occupants have owned the house since . the 1960s and are retired. According the the paper, they like fans who stop by to look at their house as . long as they are 'respectful' and don't try and jump in their pool. Before the show, Albuquerque didn't have an image,' said Ann Lerner, . Albuquerque's film liaison. 'When I started this job in 2003 and I . mentioned New Mexico, people would say, `Oh, I love Santa Fe.' No one . thought of Albuquerque.' That has changed in the five seasons that 'Breaking Bad' has aired on AMC, growing its reputation and buzz as . Netflix users raced to catch up on previous episodes. Since then, . trolley and private limo tours of scenes from the show have sold out and . created waiting lists that go on for weeks. The series, she said, has boosted inquiries to the city's film office, which offers a tax incentive to productions that film in the state. And two more television series are currently under production, Lerner said. 'Breaking Bad's' Walter White (Bryan Cranston) at fictional restaurant, Los Pollos Hermanos during Season 2, Episode 11, 'Mandala' Twisters served as Gustavo Fring's Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant in 'Breaking Bad', Seasons 2 through 4. A colorful Los Pollos Hermanos chicken logo remains on the wall just inside the Twisters entrance as a reminder of its role in the award winning AMC series. Albuquerque businesses also have taken advantage by selling 'Breaking Bad' themed products like 'blue meth' candy-encrusted donuts and character-related clothing. One art store, Masks y Mas, continues to sell statues of La Santa Muerte, the Mexican folk saint of death. That underground saint was shown in one season opener and was the spiritual protector of the show's cartel assassins, cousins Leonel and Marco. Meanwhile, the show has become a weekly social media event during every airing as Albuquerque residents and visitors post photos and links of sites they've visited. Often, a character's death or a single quote can spark a hashtag on Twitter to trend worldwide. 'Breaking Bad's' Christian ""Combo"" Ortega sold meth to customers in front of Burt's Tiki Lounge in Albuquerque, New Mexico . 'We expect this craze to continue for a while,' said Tania Armenta, a vice-president for the Albuquerque Convention & Visitors Bureau. 'All this has translated into more visitors who come here and then enjoy all aspects of the city.' The show recently won the Emmy for outstanding drama while co-star Anna Gunn, who plays Skylar White, won for best supporting actress in a drama series. Actor Bryan Cranston (3rd-R) and members of 'Breaking Bad' pose in the press room with the Best Drama Emmy during the 65th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles . In accepting the award for best drama series, show creator Vince Gilligan even gave Albuquerque a shoutout. 'Thank you to a wonderful crew in Albuquerque, N.M.,' he said, generating more buzz on social media. On finale night, a number of watch parties have been scheduled around town and food related to the show has been ordered in advance. 'I'm nervous,' said Lerner, who plans on joining the city's watching frenzy but from her own living room.

Top Gear has admitted it broke strict BBC rules on product placement by featuring items made by a company headed by a former cocaine smuggler. The logos of Corbeau Seats and Luke Harnesses are repeatedly shown in cars being driven by celebrities in the hit car show hosted by Jeremy Clarkson - despite a ban such items being given 'undue prominence'. Corbeau Seats, which along with Luke Harnesses is owned by CM Consolidated, has highlighted its involvement with Top Gear on its Facebook and Twitter pages, the Mirror reported. Mention of the show was absent from their pages this morning. Branded: while actor Benedict Cumberbatch drives, the logos of Corbeau seats and Luke harnesses are clearly visible, which breaches BBC rules on product placement . Vic Lee, 59, Managing Director of Corbeau Seats and Luke Harnesses, was sentenced to 12 years in jail in 1993 for smuggling more than 41 kilos of cocaine worth £6 million into Britain stashed in a trailer belonging to his racing team. In 2005 Lee was caught smuggling another £1.7 million of the drug, which was found in the boot of his BMW M3 in a High Wycombe car park. He was found guilty and sentenced to another 12 years, but was freed in 2010 less than half-way into his term. Yesterday the BBC declined to comment on Top Gear's links to Lee. And again: the Luke and Corbeau logos are clearly visible when actor Hugh Jackman takes the wheel. BBC rules on branded products say a wide range must be used so that no brand receives 'undue prominence' But Andy Wilman, the show's executive producer, admitted they had broken guidelines on making reference to trade names, brand names and slogans, which must always be 'clearly editorially justified'. In addition the BBC is not permitted to accept 'free or reduced cost products' in return for credits. Frontman: Jeremy Clarkson presents the show alongside Richard Hammond and long-suffering James May . Corbeau’s products feature in the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car section of the show, in which celebrities drive a Vauxhall around a racetrack. The products also feature in other segments. Mr Wilman told the Mirror: 'I put my hands up. It’s my mistake. He told the paper that Vauxhall had installed the branded seats and the harnesses. Mr Wilman said that when he asked Vauxhall about them, Vauxhall said they had received the seats and the harnesses for free. But he added that it was his job to check product placement rules, not Vauxhall's. 'I will be putting it right. I am bang to rights. I am going to pay Corbeau and take the logos away,' he told the Mirror. 'We have never given them prominence over the years because we have different manufacturers for Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car. 'This slipped under the radar.' Speaking last year, Lee said he had paid for his crime and wanted to put it behind him. He told Birmingham's Sunday Mercury: 'This is something I can never get away from but it is something for which I have been punished and which I would like to put behind me once and for all. 'But people just won’t let me do that. 'I have been lucky enough to be given the opportunity to get back into the industry that I love. 'People should view me as a glittering example of prison working properly, not jump on me every time I do something new.' His first company, Vic Lee Motorsport, was liquidated after police became suspicious of the number of times his team tested at Holland's Zandvoort circuit. Lee and others were convicted in 1993 of importing drugs hidden in their race transporters.","The hit BBC show has repeatedly shown items made by Corbeau and Luke, whose logos have been clearly visible .

Charity shop: The snake was discovered at the British Heart Foundation shop in Surbiton, London, on Friday . Corn snakes are a harmless breed of reptile which can grow up to six feet in length and live for about 20 years. They come from the Americas and are most often seen in the south eastern United States when they can be found living in fields, pine forests and agricultural areas. They often hide and sleep during the daytime and are more active at dawn and dusk. They are not venomous and do not tend to be aggressive. Wild corn snakes often hunt small animals, birds and other reptiles.","Engineer was visiting British Heart Foundation shop to change gas meter .

Kind-hearted: Nick, originally from Stroud, Gloucestershire, but living in Bristol with his girlfriend Leah Wilkins, worked for the Prince's Trust . ‘Taking drugs is so out of character for him, he's always had a wise head on young shoulders, and so as a family we are trying not to be angry for one silly mistake that was made. ‘I can't thank everyone enough, they worked so hard to try and keep him alive and the matrons on the ward were outstanding. ‘The messages of support have just been overwhelming, I can't begin to tell you how many lives he touched. ‘I really want people to be aware of the dangers of taking drugs in nightclubs - it's cost our precious son his life and ours have been taken too.’ Officers from Manchester police are investigating the death. Detective Inspector Aaron Duggan, of Manchester Police, said: ‘First and foremost, our thoughts go out to the family of this young man following this tragedy. ‘We have now launched an investigation to establish the circumstances leading up to his death. ‘It is possible that there may a particularly bad batch of drugs out there in the community and that is a concern to us. ‘I would always urge people not to take illegal drugs and remind them that you do not know what they have been made up with. ‘They can contain poisons and illicit chemicals that can have potentially fatal effects.’ Detectives are investigating whether there may have been a 'bad batch' of drugs circulating in the club and have appealed for information. ‘To all those who heard on the National news on Saturday 28th September 2013, a 30 year old man from Gloucestershire had lost his life in a Manchester nightclub after taking illicit substances - this was our son, local boy, young man, Nick Bonnie. ‘We don't want to have any obituary or such like printed but have decided that his life was too precious and important to go unreported. ‘He played local football for Kings Stanley Youth teams up until the age of 16, Leonard Stanley Under 18s, Brimscombe &Thrupp and finally Cashes Green. Nick was a keen sportsman, avid follower of Liverpool AFC and only last week completed the ‘Tough Mudder’ challenge for Help the Heroes in Wales. Nick was known by many as having a big heart, big personality and the most infectious smile in Stroud. ‘Nick Bonnie lost his life tragically, senselessly and needlessly in a nightclub in Manchester on a 'lads' weekend. This has devastated the lives of us, his parents, his two brothers Thomas and Ryan, and his beautiful and devoted girlfriend, Leah. Our family and friends, Nick's friends, work colleagues and all those who had the privilege of knowing him and those he helped in his employment at the Princes Trust. ‘Nick was born in King's Stanley and went to the local primary school. He progressed to Marling before taking a gap year and travelling around Australia before gaining his degree at University in Plymouth. 'He returned home to work with a local firm of solicitors in Stroud before embarking on the true vocation of his life, working at the Princes Trust. He has helped many young people in the early stages of his employment with them and helped raise funds and promote the profile of the Trust in his current role. He has been to Highgrove on several occasions and attended one of the Queen's garden parties at Buckingham Palace. ‘Everyone who knew Nick was aware he loved life, lived it to the max and in making one stupid mistake he has cost himself his life. ‘We hope that after reading this, we may have gone some way in helping anyone/ everyone in the realisation that drinking and use of any illicit drugs are a killer with consequences that will devastate lives for ever. ‘Our thanks go to all those who have taken to time to send messages of support to out family. Our lives and all those who were blessed to share a part of his are broken. Our life will never be the same without Nick and he will never be forgotten.’","Nick Bonnie, 30, had been at Warehouse Project in Manchester with friends .

The current condition of the 18-year-old is not known, and it is not clear what kind of seizure-like symptoms she experienced. However, the most common symptoms are seen in the grand-mal seizure, in which a person loses consciousness and usually collapses. The loss of consciousness is followed by generalised body stiffening, then by violent jerking, after which the person goes into a deep sleep. During grand-mal seizures, injuries and accidents may occur, such as tongue biting and urinary incontinence. District EMS Chief, Paul Sabol, said the 18-year-old was the third person to report feeling ill since . the exhibition opened on Friday, according to Fox News.

More than 20 Tory MPs have begun talks with UKIP about forming a pact ahead of the 2015 general election, Nigel Farage claimed today. Arriving at the Conservative conference at the centre of a media storm, Mr Farage urged Tory supporters to back UKIP in next year's European Parliament elections to trigger an earthquake in British politics. But the idea of local agreements was rejected by George Osborne who insisted anyone caught doing deals with rival parties would not be allowed to stand on a Tory ticket. Stand-off: UKIP leader Nigel Farage arrived at the Tory party conference at the centre of a media storm as Chancellor George Osborne rejected the idea of MPs standing on a joint ticket . The Tory party conference in Manchester has been dominated by UKIP today, with Mr Farage addressing three events with activists. A growing number of Conservative MPs want to reach an agreement with UKIP to stop voters switching to the anti-EU party. Mr Farage has refused to enter a formal electoral pact with the Conservative Party saying he is despised by David Cameron. But he has indicated he would not stand in the way of agreements in local constituencies with the most eurosceptic MPs. Today Mr Farage suggested there are 'a couple of dozen' Tory MPs with whom his party could come to an agreement at a local level. 'There are a couple of dozen Tory MPs who hold a range of views on several issues, not just Europe, that are very close to our own,' he told BBC Radio 4's The World At One. 'We have had informal discussions with a handful, no more than that.' During a speech at a Bruges Group event later, Mr Farage criticised Mr Cameron for not keeping his pledge of a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. 'He let us down like a cheap pair of braces.' And he called for Tory voters to back UKIP in the European Parliament elections next year: 'I have got a suggestion to all the Tory delegates here in Manchester this week and generally care about regaining British independence. 'If you want British independence you have got to vote UKIP on May 22 next year. It will up the ante and keep the pressure on for a referendum and it would force Labour into promising a referendum - and in many ways the sooner the better.' Publicity: Mr Farage, pictured campaigning in Weaste, near Salford, urged Tory supporters to vote UKIP in next year's European Parliament elections . However the Tory leadership is adamant that no-one standing for the party will be allowed to appear on the ballot paper on a joint ticket with UKIP. Mr Osborne said: 'There aren’t going to be any deals with UKIP and there are not going to be Conservative-UKIP candidates locally. 'The only candidates who will stand for the Conservative party at the election are Conservative candidates – a sort of statement of the obvious. 'There’s a very clear rule in our country, which is that candidates have to be approved by the party and the Conservative party will be fielding Conservative-only candidates.' The Chancellor, who has unveiled plans to force the jobless to work for their benefits, urged his party to stop obsessing with UKIP. 'The Conservative party is appealing to all parts of our country – we’re not moving to the left or the right; we are on the centre ground of British politics,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'And I think policies on immigration, welfare and Europe which are sometimes called ‘right-wing policies’ or policies that appeal to people who might be tempted to UKIP, I think they have a very broad appeal. 'I find people of all political colours worried about immigration, worried about welfare. And which party is tackling those problems? The Conservative party.' It comes after it emerged several . Tory MPs are planning to run on ‘joint tickets’ with UKIP at the . election. A handful of MPs  were said to be considering a ‘Unite the . Right’ campaign to prevent Labour capitalising on a split vote following . a surge in support for Mr Farage’s party. The sitting Tory MP would stand as a . Tory-UKIP candidate. In return for its support, UKIP would expect to be . able to influence Conservative Party policy. Nadine . Dorries was the first to float the idea earlier this year, saying she . would be ‘having that kind of conversation’ with activists in her . constituency and that many Conservatives have ‘huge empathy’ with UKIP. Eight Tory-held seats are said to be at . high risk of being lost because of UKIP splitting the traditional Tory . vote and letting in Labour or the Lib Dems. Banned: UKIP leader Nigel Farage to due to appear at three events at the Tory party conference, but has been erased from the official guide . Farage has refused to enter a formal electoral pact with the Tories saying he is despised by David Cameron . David Cameron pledged yesterday to remove all commitments to ‘ever-closer union’ from EU treaties. In a hardening of his stance, the Prime Minister said he wanted to go as far as erasing the EU’s original mission statement, which commits nations to closer integration. He said: ‘Others can sign up to an ever-closer union, but Britain should not. I’m determined to make sure we get out of that.’ Speaking at the Tory Party conference, Foreign Secretary William Hague also told delegates that more countries were coming round to Britain’s view that powers should be returned to individual countries. Mr Farage there are many MPs who take a . different view from the Tory leadership on Europe, naming Peter Bone . and Jacob Rees-Mogg. He . said: ‘If either they, or others like them, even Labour MPs, with their . local associations, chose to propose running on a joint ticket then I . would leave the local Ukip association to have those negotiations ... After all we are a party that believes in real localism and doesn’t . think that the centre is the repository of all wisdom.’ Speaking . about not being allowed into the secure zone of the Conservative Party . Conference in Manchester Mr Farage said: ‘It seems I am persona non . grata.’ Writing in the Times he added: ‘To the Tory High Command I am a plague carrier.’ The proposal comes as the latest YouGov poll shows Labour has surged ahead, mainly at the expense of the Conservatives who are losing voters to Ukip. The poll puts Labour on 42 per cent, the Tories on 31 per cent, UKIP on 13 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent. Miss Dorries said yesterday: ‘I know other MPs in marginal constituencies are in talks about entering into agreements. It’s going to be very difficult in the general election when you’ve got two candidates espousing the same sort of values. ‘We’ll have a Conservative candidate calling for a referendum, being strong on crime, immigration and grammar schools, and the Ukip candidate saying much the same sort of things.’ Conservative Central Office yesterday said joint tickets would not be allowed and any MP who tried would not have their nomination papers signed. Foreign Secretary William Hague last night insisted Tories ‘don’t make pacts with other parties … we win over the voters of other parties’ and cautioned wavering supporters. He said: ‘If someone is contemplating voting Ukip who would otherwise vote Conservative they could, by default, produce a Labour government which is the absolute opposite of what they might want on Europe for instance.’","Chancellor refuses idea of Conservative candidates doing local deals .

A garage boss crashed a customer’s £50,000 sports car, killing his niece’s fiance eight months before they were due to get married. Peter Farwell lost control of the powerful two-seat Ariel Atom, which can accelerate faster than a Ferrari, near to his garage in Kent before crashing into trees. Farwell and his passenger, Garry Jarrett, were both seriously hurt after clipping a kerb and careering off the road. Garry Jarrett (left) died a week after Peter Farwell (right) crashed a powerful sports car into trees near to his garage in Kent, where he was carrying out repairs on the car. Farwell has been jailed for eight months . Garry was due to marry Sian Farwell (right), who gave birth to their son Alfie 10 months ago, in May next year . Garry, a 24-year-old father of one, was airlifted to hospital where he died a week later while Farwell escaped with ankle injuries. Garry was planning to marry Farwell’s niece Sian Farwell, after the birth of their son Alfie just 10 months before. Farwell, 47, was jailed for eight months by a judge sitting at Maidstone Crown Court after admitting causing death by careless driving and was banned from the road until July 2017. Judge Michael Carroll heard that the car crashed in Kemsing, Kent, as Farwell was taking it back to the Forge Garage where he was servicing it. The unnamed customer had given his permission for Farwell to take it out for a ride. Police Constable Jamie Woodhams, from Kent Police’s serious collision investigation unit, said: 'This, as in all fatal collisions, was a tragic case. 'Mr Jarrett’s fiancee, Farwell’s niece, had recently given birth to a son before this incident and our sympathies go out to the whole family.' Garry's parents, Chris and Roger Jarrett, said their son was a 'loveable family man' who also worked for the family business Automatic Machine Services (AMS). The £50,000 Ariel Atom can reach 60mph from a standing start in less than three seconds making it the third fastest-accelerating car in the world (file picture) Chris said: 'He loved his little boy so much - the day Alfie was born was the happiest day of his whole life and he had wanted a son so much. That is the most heartbreaking thing about this.' 'We’re going to make sure Garry’s memory lives on through his son.' Garry's wife said that only hours before the crash she and Mr Jarrett had returned from a holiday in Cyprus and said he was 'one in a million'. 'We had an amazing time and we’d finally booked our wedding, for May 2014. 'He just doted on Alfie, he would do everything he could for him, whatever he needed. His family was everything to him.' Mr Jarrett was a car enthusiast and loved extreme sports, especially track days and bicycle racing.

Television property shows talk about 'forever homes' but not many of us are lucky enough to stay in the same house we grew up in. Jack Haddock is one of the fortunate few - he moved to his semi-detached home in Walsall in the West Midlands at the age of one, and he is still there now, 85 years on. And not only does the 86-year-old RAF veteran live in his parents' house, but he also uses the same appliances that they were using decades ago. Stability: Jack Haddock has lived in the red-brick semi in Webster Road, Walsall, for 85 of his 86 years . Houses going up in Walsall in the 1920s: Mr Haddock's parents were among the first to get a council house . Mr Haddock remembers sheltering in the Anderson shelter during bomb raids - now he uses it as a shed . Mr Haddock is still listening to the old wireless that the family heard the outbreak of World War Two announced on in 1939, and the Anderson Shelter that they used to shelter in during bombing raids is still in the garden, where it now serves as a shed. He said: 'I'm very attached to this house and I love living here.  I know lots of people in this community and would hate to move.' Jack Haddock senior never missed a week's rent for the house, which was originally owned by Walsall Council, and nor has his son, who now pays Walsall Housing Group a little more than the seven shillings and 11p it cost his father each week. The younger Mr Haddock, who has never married, was born half a mile away in Hospital Road but moved into the red-brick house in Webster Road in 1928 as a one-year-old baby with his parents, Jack senior and Florence. His father worked on the trams in the 1920s and was one of the first people in Walsall to apply for a council house there. Mr Haddock, who has no children and who keeps fit by cycling 20 miles every day, said: 'I was tempted to get married once, in the 1970s or 80s, but I had mother-in-law trouble. Staying put: Mr Haddock, a keen amateur photographer, says he cannot imagine living anywhere else . The house has had additions since Mr Haddock's parents knew in, including an upstairs bathroom and new wiring . How it was: Open land in the vicinity of where Webster Road was to be built, before construction work started . Mr Haddock's house cost Walsall Council £295 to build in between the wars - it is now worth £85,000 . 'She and my girlfriend wanted me to move to The Delves, a few miles away, but I opted against it because I wanted to stay here. 'I cut it dead - and that was the reason.' The house was built by Walsall Council at a cost of £295 and when Mr Haddock's father applied for it, he was told his references from the local vicar, the tramp depot and the Royal Artillery in which he had served during the World War One, were not enough - he needed a child, too. 'So I was brought into the world,' said Mr Haddock junior, 'and my parents were given a tenancy at a new council house in Webster Road.' He has lived there ever since, apart from five years living in the south when he joined the RAF after World War Two as a driver. He said: 'At the time we moved in, it was quite modern and state of the art, although of course we all had coal fires then and the bathroom was downstairs. Parents: Mr Haddock's mother Florence May, left, and father Jack senior, moved into the house in 1928 . The air raid shelter that Mr Haddock sheltered from night raids in as a boy is still standing in his garden . Still going strong: The RAF veteran who has never married or had children, cycles 20 miles every day . 'My earliest memories are of steam trains roaring past our house on the way to Ryecroft Engine Shed, which is now Mill Lane Nature Reserve. 'I was 12 at the outbreak of World War Two and I vividly remember the night time bombings.  We spent many a cold night in the Anderson shelter at the bottom of our garden, which I still use now as a shed.

Mr Haddock is still going to the local grocery shop he's frequented since the 1930s, when it was run by a man named Joseph Venables. He said: 'It was an institution because he ran the shop in true Victorian fashion - everything was precise, he was always well dressed and there would be religious music playing on the radio on Sunday evenings.'

Anthony Hughes has been jailed for life after admitting murdering his father Brian Hughes . A vicious son beat his terminally ill father to death after he brooded for up to 20 years over the bitter break-up of his family. Anthony Hughes, 32, had been resentful over the way his mother Susan was treated by Brian Hughes during their stormy relationship. But his hatred turned to murder on Easter Sunday following a series of rows just ten days after he was forced to move back in with his 60-year old estranged father. In the days before the killing, Hughes jnr text his mother in a rage asking: 'Can I kill the f..g bastard - he talks a lot of sh*t.' Then tragedy struck during another family bust up when he jumped on his father as he lay on a sofa and repeatedly punched him in the face. As his half sister ran out onto the street to get help, Hughes dragged his father outside as the victim tried to get to his feet - and then began kicking and stamping on his head up to 20 times as he lay on the ground. A . 999 operator who fielded a call about the fatal beating listened as his . half sister Rebecca Gosling was heard screaming in horror as she . witnessed the killing. While police dashed to the scene, Hughes jnr rang his mother back and said 'I’ve killed him, he was going to get us. He will never hurt anyone again.' When officers arrived to arrest him he added: 'They are here mum, bye mum, I’m sorry,' before the call was terminated. Mr Hughes snr, who had been given two years to live after being diagnosed with terminal bowel cancer which had spread to his liver and lungs was pronounced dead at the scene with multiple injuries. His blood and dentures were found in the living room. His son later claimed to police his father was a 'scary f..ked up dude' who had 'kicked off' that resulted in him giving him 'a good kicking'. Brian Hughes died after his son repeatedly kicked and stamped on his head up to 20 times . Details of the killing on March 31 emerged as Hughes jnr, of Darwen, Lancashire, was jailed for life after pleading guilty to murder. Preston Crown Court was told Mr Hughes snr had four children by four different women and his relationship with Susan had been volatile. Prosecuting Miss Kate Blackwell QC said: 'His mother would often refer to Brian Hughes as “the bastard”. Feelings of resentment had bubbled under the surface with Anthony Hughes for many years.' Anthony's sister Rebecca Gosling in blue dress standing outside Preston Crown Court . Hughes jnr was said to have been prone to violence himself. The court heard he beat up and injured three of his girlfriends between 2012 and 2013. He was given a suspended jail term but then moved in with a fourth woman only to beat her up too by pushing her into a wardrobe. Hughes jnr was kicked out the woman’s house and went to stay with his father. Miss Blackwell added: 'During the week before the death, he began to express frustration at living with his father and over the course of the weekend sent a series of texts to his mother, one saying, ""can I kill the f..king bastard"". 'When asked why, he replied, ‘he talks a lot of sh.t’. He was reminded that he was an ill man.' The court heard that the night before the attack Hughes jnr had asked his father for a 'moderate amount of money to have his hair cut' only to become 'furious' on finding a letter revealing Mr Hughes snr had £5,000 in his bank account. He later arranged to meet with his half sister Miss Gosling - who had only met her father once prior, at the ICI Club where his father was drinking. The pair arrived at the club and Miss Gosling was introduced to her father who seemingly didn’t recognise her. The two returned to their father’s home before Mr Hughes snr returned home at around 2:45am. The QC added: 'The deceased walked in and said something insulting to the defendant. The defendant flipped and jumped up and rushed over to where the deceased was. At no time did the deceased make any attempt to defend himself.' During the attack Hughes jnr kicked his father to the floor and began punching him and stamping the left side of his head. He then walked away but a short time later returned and kicked him in the head a further 15 to 20 times using a 'lot of force.' Post mortem tests showed Mr Hughes snr had part of his skull shattered in the beating and his face was severely fragmented. In mitigation, defence counsel Peter Wright QC said: 'He knows and realises not only the appalling gravity of this case and the terrible loss of life and affect on others. He admitted from the offset responsibility as he did on the night. Scene: Police cordoned off the house where Brian was dragged out of by his son Anthony . 'His mother Susan paints a very depressing picture of the circumstances in which this man’s early childhood had been spent in a mostly unhappy environment. 'The relationship between him and his father was fractious, and punctuated with drunken arguments. The texts showed he was frustrated and at the end of his tether with him. A 999 operator who fielded a call about the fatal beating listened as his half sister Rebecca Gosling was heard screaming in horror as she witnessed the killing . 'He felt routinely rejected, trivial things escalated into a full blown argument and matters came to a head. It was a lethal combination of drink and feelings of resent over all these years which poured out.' Hughes jnr must serve 18 years eight months before being considered for parole. Judge Anthony Russell QC said: 'For many years you had hated your father from who you were estranged following the relationship with your mother. 'Your anger boiled up fuelled by drink, insults were exchanged when he got home in the early hours and your anger turned to violence. 'He was in no position to defend himself.He was 60, in poor health with terminal cancer and his mobility was affected. “He was particularly vulnerable and there was a considerable amount of suffering before his death. The attack was brutal and savage and there was a degree of hatred and cruelty.' After the case Det Insp Andy Hulme, of Lancashire Police said: 'This was a cowardly and sustained attack on an innocent man. 'Anthony Hughes has shown absolutely no regard for his father and now faces a considerable custodial sentence to consider what he has done.

Number one fan: Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne leaves the conference hall with his wife Frances following his his keynote speech . Britain faces seven more years of austerity in public spending –but will reap the reward in the shape of tax cuts after the next election, George Osborne said yesterday. The Chancellor used a confident conference speech to announce that he aims to put the public finances back in the black by 2020. Mr Osborne said a Tory government would aim to run a budget surplus by that stage – a strategy adopted by countries such as Canada and Sweden to prepare themselves better for financial shocks. Following his pledge yesterday to . make thousands of long-term unemployed work for their benefits, he said . he would rewrite his fiscal mandate so the Tories achieved an absolute . surplus in the next Parliament, provided the recovery was sustained. At . the same time, capital spending – on new roads, rail and broadband, for . example – would grow, meaning intense new pressure on day-to-day . Whitehall spending. Economists . said it would mean overall public spending effectively being frozen in . real terms for a decade, between 2010 and 2020, and a significant . retreat of the size of the state. In . a speech that borrowed rhetorical flourishes from Ronald Reagan and . Tony Blair, the Chancellor drew a critical electoral dividing line with . his pledge to go further than current  government plans for paying off . the structural deficit. This . would allow him to start paying off Britain’s national debt, which is . on course to reach £1.4trillion by the next election – rather than just . the deficit, effectively the nation’s credit card. The . Chancellor gave a strong signal that he favours tax cuts, however, . telling the conference: ‘Together we are going to share in the rewards.’ Recalling the Tories’ slogan that Labour didn’t ‘fix the roof when the sun was shining’, by . running a budget deficit even in its boom years, Mr Osborne declared: . ‘Let us never make that same mistake again. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Warning: George Osborne told the Tory party conference that the recovery was still at risk and it would be some time before incomes started rising . ‘Never . again should anyone doing my job be so foolish, so deluded, as to . believe that they have abolished the age-old cycle of boom and bust. ‘When . we’ve dealt with Labour’s deficit, we will have a surplus in good times . as insurance against difficult times ahead. Provided the recovery is . sustained, our goal is to achieve that surplus in the next Parliament. ‘If . we want to protect those things we care about, like generous pensions . and decent healthcare, and buy the best equipment for the brave men and . women who fight in our Armed Forces, all of us are going to have to . confront the costs of modern government – and cap working-age welfare . bills. And only if we properly control public expenditure will we be . able to keep lowering taxes for hard-working people in a way that lasts. Carl Emmerson, of the . Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: ‘If you don’t want to put taxes up, . then you could go for flat public spending – freezing it in real terms . for two more years to 2020. That would mean we’ve had ten years of no . growth in public spending. If people are expecting the next parliament . to be a couple of years more austerity and then lots of giveaways, then . they are going to be disappointed. ‘Obviously, . there is a benefit in having a lower deficit – you have lower debt . interest payments, you get debt down quicker, you have more . flexibility.’ Mr Emmerson . said the extension of austerity would lead to new questions about the . viability of the Government’s ring-fences on areas of spending including . the NHS, schools and foreign aid, which have meant deeper cuts . elsewhere. Labour Treasury spokesman Chris Leslie said the Chancellor . could not be trusted after pledging earlier to run a budget surplus from . 2015. ‘George Osborne . promised in 2010 that by the time of the next election in 2015 he would . balance the books completely; we wouldn’t have a deficit at all and it . turns out we’re going to end up with a £96billion deficit.

Two people who were viewing a house had to be rushed to hospital after they plunged 14ft into the basement when the floor collapsed. The man and woman - who have not been named - were walking round a £90,000, six-bedroom property in Nottingham on Saturday afternoon. The potential buyer wanted to transform the Grade II listed building, which is described as being 'in need of a full renovation', into a dream home. A man and woman were viewing the Grade II listed property in Nottingham on Saturday when the floorboards gave way and they fell 14ft giving them neck and back injuries . But the estate agent and a customer ended up being taken to hospital with head and back injuries after the ground floor of the end-terrace home gave way and sent them plummeting into the cellar. In a statement Savills, who are selling the property, said: 'Two people were injured following an accident at a property located in St Ann’s, Sneinton, Nottingham over the weekend. 'Our first concerns are with the two people hurt, one of whom is a Savills employee. We wish them a full and speedy recovery.

Since he started practising aged 14 Matt Howes worked tirelessly to become a DJ but his career looked to be over after he lost his arm in an accident in 2011. But instead it gave him even more determination to succeed and the 25-year-old is now performing with the likes of Tinie Tempah and Tim Westwood. Scroll down for video . Living the dream: Matt still out performing despite a traumatic accident which nearly killed him . Talented: the DJ played his first one-armed gig two weeks after leaving hospital and without practising . Matt was playing to packed clubs every night at the height of Malia's party season when a car accident nearly killed him. But just two weeks after leaving hospital, and with 70 stitches sill in him, Matt was back playing in front of a 1,000 strong crowd, despite not having practised one-handed. He said: 'It was the best experience of my life. The place erupted. It was totally surreal. It was pure euphoria. 'There was no doubt in my mind that my DJ career wasn't over when I lost my arm. It just spurred me on to do it even more. 'Being a DJ is about putting on a good show and giving people something they can take away and remember. It is one of the luckiest and rewarding jobs out there.' He has held residencies all over the world including in Tenerife, Ibiza, and Serbia and is now touring the UK, and had a stint on radio with a show on BBC Radio 1 Xtra earlier this year as part of their 'New Talent' scheme. All of which is in stark contrast to life following his surgery just two years ago. After playing his final gig in Malia, he flew back home to Norwich to recuperate and the reality of what had happened sunk in. 'I was completely devastated but at the same time I was genuinely happy to be alive because I could have died,' he said. 'From that moment on I knew things were never going to be the same. There was a lot of mixed emotions. It was an emotional overload. 'It was revealed later that the only reason I didn't die that day is because the dirt and grit from the road clogged up my artery, stopping the bleeding.' The decision to amputate was made by Matt's nightclub boss as there was no time to wait for mum Mandy Bargewell (right) to arrive . Matt is now touring the UK following performances with Tinie Tempah and Tim Westwood . In fact paramedics had told Matt that just two more minutes outside an operating theatre could have been fatal. The decision to amputate his arm was actually made by his nightclub boss because doctors couldn't wait for his mother to arrive from England. Once back in the UK he had to learn to walk again due to the extensive injuries he suffered to his legs and was virtually housebound, too embarrassed to go out. Matt added: 'I became a bit of a social recluse. I had not come to terms with what happened. Truth be told it only really sunk in 12 months ago. 'I felt a bit sorry for myself and like I was missing out on all the action.' Ambition: Matt has dreamed of being a DJ for years and started parctising when he was just 14 years old . Since the accident Matt has become a well-known face on the DJ circuit and has met artists including rapper Devlin (right) After just four weeks resting at home, he decided enough was enough and booked a ticket to go back to Malia to DJ again at the resort's biggest club, Candy. 'I was DJing every night and sunbathing every day. I was back where I belong - I was back home, behind the decks with a crowd in front of me. It was no different to before. 'It was more to prove a point to myself and the other DJs. I thought to myself it can't be that hard. I had to do it. 'I've achieved quite a lot at a young age but I've not accomplished anywhere near what I want to do. 'The dream is to be on a level where I am DJing in three or four countries a week, every week. It will happen. I am determined to succeed.' Matt is also helping to support others like himself as one of the ambassadors for UK charity The Limbless-Association. Fundraising for the charity is very close to his heart as he wants to inspire others who may be going through a similar experience to believe that they can do anything they set their hearts on.","Matt Howes, 25, from Norwich, was riding his moped on Malia in 2011 .

And half a century after the notorious sex scandal rocked the political establishment, Mandy Rice-Davies appears to have lost none of her striking beauty.

Miss Rice-Davies advised Lloyd Webber on the storyline, but her friend Christine Keeler was nowhere to be seen at yesterday’s launch, having refused to take part. Miss Keeler’s sexual liaisons with Tory minister John Profumo and Russian naval attaché Yevgeny Ivanov led to one of the biggest political scandals of the 20th century. But pictured last month, she was almost unrecognisable from the 19-year-old brunette who found herself embroiled in the affair in 1963.

The 71-year-old – who now lives in sheltered accommodation in south London - will be played by actress Charlotte Spencer in Lloyd Webber’s musical. Then Minister of War, Profumo was forced to quit in disgrace after he lied to the House of Commons about his affair. It was alleged Keeler was asked to spy on him by the Russians. They were introduced by society osteopath Stephen Ward - at a party in Cliveden House in Berkshire in 1961. Ward was later prosecuted for living off the immoral earnings of Miss Rice-Davies and Miss Keeler but took an overdose before his trial ended and died three days after being convicted. The trial implicated several establishment figures in an underworld of sex and prostitution and damaged the government of Tory prime minister Harold Macmillan. Giving evidence, Miss Rice-Davies was questioned over her relationship with Viscount Astor, who owned Cliveden House. After the prosecuting lawyer pointed out he had denied ever having met her, she famously replied: ‘He would, wouldn’t he?’ Lloyd Webber said the trial was ‘one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in British history’ and said he hoped his musical – entitled Stephen Ward - would help set the record straight. He said: ‘I find him a fascinating character. He was clearly a life-enhancer. But in no way was he an immoral person.’","Mandy Rice-Davies appears to have lost none of her striking beauty .

Grapes at a commercial-scale vineyard in London have been harvested for the first time since the Middle Ages. Bunches of tiny ortega grapes have been picked by volunteers at Forty Hall Vineyard, in Enfield, north London, which sits within views of landmarks such as Canary Wharf and The Shard. These grapes, with other varieties yet to be picked, will be used to produce still and Champagne-style sparkling white wines. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Capital: A commercial-scale vineyard in London has harvested grapes for the first time since the Middle Ages . Vines: Forty Hall Vineyard, in Enfield, north London has more than 7,000 vines featuring a range of grape varieties . Produce: The vineyard does not have onsite wine-making facilities and the grapes will be processed by organic winemaker Will Davenport, in Sussex . Vineyard manager Sarah Vaughan-Roberts hopes they will one day compete in London's fine dining market alongside more well-known foreign brands. She said: 'We think our wine would be a real interest to the growing number of foodies in London. 'These are the kind of people who seek out interesting, different and artisan foods that are locally produced. 'We also hope very much that any of the government bodies to do with London, like the government office for London or the mayor's office, will be one day drinking our wine at their functions.' Enterprise: Vineyard manager Sarah Vaughan-Roberts believes the site could eventually produce between 10,000 and 15,000 bottles a year and become a self-sustainable enterprise . Ms Vaughan-Roberts, who studied . viticulture after being inspired by a radio programme about vineyards in . New York and Paris, said the first bottle should be ready in 2015 - but . would not speculate on price. They do not have onsite wine-making facilities and the grapes will be processed by organic winemaker Will Davenport, in Sussex. They have 7,000 vines - of grape varieties include sauvignon, chardonnay, pinot noir, pinot meunier, autauga and the increasingly popular bacchus. Organic: The vineyard is totally organic but the Forty Hall is pushing for 'biodynamic' status . Community: Volunteering has been at the heart of the project which prides itself on being a community enterprise . With more than 400 vineyards across the country and traders reporting an increase in sales year-on-year, the English wine industry currently appears to be blossoming. Wine retailer Majestic recently announced sales of English sparkling wine had trebled last year while many of the major supermarkets now also stock a range of domestic products. And according to English Wine Producers, the organisation responsible for the marketing and promotion of English and Welsh wine in the UK, the first two months of this year saw record sales. Meanwhile, this year's spectacular summer has seen vineyards across the country enjoy a bumper harvest. Ms Vaughan-Roberts believes they . could eventually produce between 10,000 and 15,000 bottles a year and . become a self-sustainable enterprise. One of the wines produced will be an English sparkling wine made in the same way as Champagne. The project has been funded by a lottery grant and the land was donated by Capel Manor College, the nearby horticultural school. The vineyard is totally organic but the Forty Hall is pushing for 'biodynamic' status. This is a working practice based on a theory devised by Rudolf Steiner in 1924 - and in elements of lunar cycles and homeopathy. 'It is kind of an organic-plus,' added Ms Vaughan-Roberts, who lives in Hackney and commutes to Forty Hall by public transport.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 04:05 EST, 30 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:18 EST, 30 September 2013 . Plans to increase the motorway speed limit to 80mph are still being developed, despite the government announcing it had shelved the idea. Ministers have admitted that many drivers already travel at 80mph and the policy will be revived in the future. The idea was officially abandoned in June because senior Tory figures feared it would alienate women voters. U-turn: Ministers announced the idea of increasing the speed limit to 80mph had been shelved, but now admit it is still being worked on . The policy was launched with a fanfare in 2011 by then transport secretary Philip Hammond, who claimed the 70mph limit had been 'discredited' and a rise to 80mph would boost the economy. But he was replaced by Patrick McLoughlin who announced the policy was no longer a priority. 'This is not going to happen with Patrick McLoughlin as Transport Secretary,’ said a source. But divisions have emerged in the Department for Transport, with junior transport minister Stephen Hammond revealing the plan could be easily introduced because the Government has ‘not stopped work’ on the idea. Split: Roads minister Stephen Hammond revealed divisions over the decision to drop the 80mph plan . The road safety minister said: ‘Mr Hammond is a great supporter of 80 miles per hour. He thinks it's the right thing to do. ‘That's not a universal view among my colleagues and at the moment, because there are a huge number of other things on, we have not stopped work on it but it's not a priority. ‘Given that a lot of people travel at 80 miles per hour and we could enforce 80 miles per hour, at some stage we will want to come back and look at it.’ Britain’s speed limits are lower than many other countries in Europe. France and Italy both impose a maximum of 81mph, while Germany has no restriction at all. The RAC expressed disappointment at the decision to drop the speed limit increase. Motoring groups had argued that 80mph is a safe speed in a modern car, providing drivers leave enough room between vehicles. But last year campaign groups estimated that raising the motorway speed limit to 80mph would cost society an extra £1billion a year, including £766million in fuel bills and more than £62million in health costs. The groups, which include road safety charity Brake, the Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) and Greenpeace, also estimated that the higher limit would lead to 25 extra deaths and 100 serious injuries a year, as well as 2.2 million more tonnes of carbon emissions.","Policy was launched with fanfare in 2011 claiming it would boost economy .

Burberry chief executive Angela Ahrendts is one of three women on a board of eight directors . Firms which employ higher numbers of female executives make more money, research suggests. A new report found companies where women make up a third of board members made on average 42 per cent more profit, while shareholders received 53 per cent higher returns. Catering services firm Sodexo compiled wide-ranging research on diversity at work and found that hiring more women in senior roles boosted business’s performance. However, the report found that tokenism did not work and that firms needed to hire multiple female managers in order to benefit. It pointed to research by Catalyst which showed firms with three or more female directors had a profit margin of 16.8 per cent, compared with 11.5 per cent for the average company. Debbie White, 51, chief executive of Sodexo UK & Ireland, said: ‘One woman around the table won’t improve company performance. ‘You have to overcome the lone-voice syndrome for diversity to be successful.’ The number of women in Britain’s boardrooms has grown from 6.2 per cent in 1999 to 17.3 per cent this year, among the companies listed on the FTSE 100. Burberry has the highest proportion of female directors on its board with three out of eight, including chief executive Angela Ahrendts. Sodexo’s report, which will be published in full next month, said mixed gender boards brought ‘business benefits’, but warned against rigid Government quotas. It said: ‘What is becoming increasingly important and being mentioned more and more, by both males and females alike, is that this must not become a numbers game. ‘Reaching quotas and targets for the sake of reaching quotas is not beneficial to anyone. ‘Appointing female board members should be about the richness of the board as a whole - the combined contribution of a group of people with different skills and perspectives.’ The report said the increase in female directors had stalled in recent months, however, saying: ‘evidence suggests this could be starting to slow’. Benefit: Alison Cooper is a rare female Chief Executive of FTSE 100 company Imperial Tobacco . Carolyn McCall, head of easyJet, is the only other woman CEO in the FTSE 100 despite the study's findings . In 2011, the Government told companies to double the number of women on their boards within four years, or face government intervention. It followed a report by Lord Davies’ which recommended the UK should have 25 per cent women on FTSE 100 boards by 2015. Business Secretary Vince Cable said earlier this year: ‘The argument for more women in our boardrooms is clear - they bring fresh perspectives and ideas, talent and broader experience which leads to better decision-making. ‘This is not just about equality at the top of our companies. It is about good business sense.’","New report found tokenism doesn't work - firms need multiple female heads .

But a British aristocrat from Cornwall has struck a deal which will see the product shipped from his gardens to be sold in the birthplace of the hot beverage. The Chinese Embassy's trade minister visited the Tregothnan plantation in Cornwall to view the business opportunities on offer. Trade: Managing Director Jonathon Jones, Head Gardener Neil Bennett and Estates Director Andrew Jarvis welcome members of the Chinese delegation to the Tregothnan Tea Gardens in Cornwall . Deal: Zhou Xiaoming from the Chinese delegation and Jonathon Jones with Tregothnan's Wardian Case in the UK's only tea gardens . Zhou Xiaoming, Chinese Economic and . Commercial Minister and Councillor, led a delegation of five from the . embassy on a two-day tour. They visited the UK's only tea plantation, to taste the famous tea with the view of shipping it over to China, the birthplace of the much-loved hot drink. The Honourable Evelyn Boscawen, whose family has lived on the private estate since 1335, said he welcomed the strengthening of links between Cornwall and China. He said: 'This reinforces my belief that Tregothnan and Cornwall will be the headquarters of our growing international business.'

Abby Keverne, 25, picks tea leaves which will be shipped to China . The Tregothnan Estate is located beside the village of St Michael Penkivel, three miles south-east of Truro, Cornwall. It started supplying England's first tea, the Camellia sinensis, in 2005. The two-day trip was organised in conjunction with the China-Britain Business Council (CBBC), which helps UK companies to grow and develop their business in China. Jonathon Jones, Gardening Director at The Tregothnan Estate, near Truro, Cornwall, goes about his daily routine of collecting leaves . Tea was first drunk in Britain in the 17th century when King Charles II married the Portuguese princess Catherine of Braganza, who brought the habit of tea drinking with her. The first pieces of evidence from Britain was written in 1660 when Samuel Pepys recorded in his diary: 'I did send for a cup of tee (a China drink) of which I never had drank before.' The East India Company brought back many products, but tea proved to be one of the most successful. At first it was promoted as a medicinal beverage but by the end of the seventeenth century, it was taken as a drink, albeit mainly by the aristocracy. In 1690 nobody would have predicted that by 1750 tea would be the national drink, and one that is still consumed by thousands of people in the UK every day. A tea plantation in 2006: Chinese tea farmers pick spring tea leaves in Shaoping County, Guangxi Zhuang . Tea is said to have originated in Yunnan, China during the Shang Dynasty, which ruled the country from 1500 BC–1046 BC. Since then, the Chinese have consumed tea for thousands of years. At first it was a medicinal drink used by the Han dynasty, but would become one of the most consumed hot drinks on the planet when it was exported abroad. The earliest credible record of tea drinking dates to the 3rd century AD, in a medical text written by Hua T'o. Tea production in China was a laborious process, . conducted in distant and often poorly accessible regions. For many hundreds of years the commercially used tea tree has been, in shape, more of a bush than a tree. Tea was first introduced to Portuguese priests and merchants in China during the 16th century before it was introduced to Britain during the 17th century. As it quickly became the national drink, British businesses used India as a centre for tea production to try and compete with the Chinese monopoly. Tea remained a very important item in Britain's global trade, contributing in part its global dominance by the end of the eighteenth century. To this day tea is seen worldwide as a symbol of 'Britishness', even though its routes are heavily ingrained in China.","Trade delegation visited Tregothnan, the UK's only tea plantation .

So . when Britain’s biggest retailer returned for a fourth go at putting a . supermarket in their high street, the residents knew they had a real . fight on their hands. For 25 . years the people of Hadleigh in Suffolk had put up posters, written . letters and held marches to stop the retailer installing itself in the . town. Shopkeepers had warned . that the arrival of a supermarket would destroy the town by . undercutting their traditional shops and forcing them to close. But . when Tesco announced yet again it was planning to build a supermarket . in the historic wool town, where 92 per cent of buildings are listed, . the residents decided there was only one way to take on the mighty . retailer. Tesco protestors (left to right) Maureen Reddrop, Linda Garrod, Anita Young and Jim Bottley celebrated beating off supermarket giant Tesco's bid to open a store in their traditional market town . Threat: Campaigners who want to protect the High Street of Hadleigh in Suffolk have fought off Tesco again in the latest set-to in a 25-year battle . Instead of . organising a new petition or preparing placards, the town pulled . together to raise an impressive £80,000 war chest – made up of donations . from shopkeepers and individuals – to pay for a team of experts, . including a top London QC. Jan . Byrne, 77, of the Hadleigh Society, said: ‘We realised we could no . longer just argue as amateurs. It was made clear to us that the local . council was only going to take notice of professionals. ‘It . seems ridiculous to have to pour big money into it, and for a small . town to raise that kind of sum, but we did it. It shows the strength of . feeling about the prospect of Tesco moving in.’ A . small team of retired residents in the town – described by poet Sir . John Betjeman as ‘one of the most perfect small towns in England’ – . pored over every word of the supermarket’s application. They . then commissioned professional reports to highlight the possible impact . the store could have on the town’s traffic system and its economy. Seven . of the town’s  traders, including the sweetshop, a butcher and a . florist, said they would definitely shut if Tesco won permission for its . 2,500 square metre store in the town centre. A further seven stores – including the post office, a newsagent and a tile shop, said they would ‘probably’ close. Mrs Byrne said: ‘We have a medieval high street with small family shops selling local goods, and we do not want to lose it. Moment of truth: Bosses met at Hadleigh Town Hall to decide on proposals for a Tesco's in the town . 'Hands off Hadleigh': Campaigners stood outside with posters to block the move for the fourth time . ‘I want people who can give us a good service and who can tell us where the food has come from. ‘We’ve got two butchers. The food is very, very local – they can tell us the farm where the meat is from. ‘When everyone was worried about horsemeat, I knew that the beef burgers I bought had come from just up the road.’ At a packed council meeting the residents’ hard work was rewarded when permission for the store was rejected by a single vote. Peter . Beer, planning committee chairman, said: ‘The impact on the local . highway network, the effect on the vitality of the town centre in retail . terms and its design and impact on listed buildings were all . fundamental to the council’s decision.’ The campaigners greeted the decision with applause. Long road: The supermarket giant first applied to build a store in 1987 and after several attempts has still failed to get pernission . Andrew . Cann, spokesman for the Chamber of Commerce, said: ‘It’s a victory for . the people of Hadleigh as it was simply going to destroy the high . street, and people come here because of the environment and the . independent stores.’ Tesco . has not ruled out appealing or putting in a new application, but Mrs . Byrne said local people have already got plans for the proposed site, a . plot of abandoned warehouses. She said: ‘People are dreaming about what would happen if Tesco would go away and let us buy the site. ‘The one thing we have not got is small retirement units for independent living for people who want to downsize.’ Tesco . said many Hadleigh residents had supported its project, which, it said, . would have brought jobs and more choice to the town. Tesco had planning applications rejected in 1987 and 2000. A government inquiry in 2001 rejected an appeal. In 2011 a further application was rejected.","Hadleigh councillors vote to block new supermarket to protect local shops .

"By . Andrew Levy . PUBLISHED: . 17:05 EST, 30 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:11 EST, 1 October 2013 . Children's happiness has been sacrificed in the obsessive race for exam results at state schools, a leading independent head teacher said yesterday. Dr Tim Hands, chairman of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference, said it was assumed that academic success would lead to happiness, not the other way round. Government education policy since the latter part of the 20th century had acted like a ‘dead restraining hand’, he argued, culminating in the ‘flawed’ reliance on school league tables. Excessive interference: Dr Tim Hands, the Chairman of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference said it was assumed academic success would lead to happiness, not the other way around . ‘The story of the last 50 years is the intrusion of Government and the disappearance of the child,’ said Dr Hands, Master of Magdalen College School, Oxford. ‘More radically put, it is by extension the intrusion of the State and the disappearance of love. 'The long, interfering arm and dead restraining hand of Government has emasculated the education system of this country.’ Labour ‘zeal for egalitarianism’ had been followed by the Tories’ fixation with ‘league table-driven academic excellence’, which meant ‘pastoral care has been distorted and down valued within the maintained sector’. Dr Hands added: ‘The post-80s drive on academic standards was based on the mistaken belief that you do not need to make a child happy as your first priority, so that they can be successful as your second. ‘Indeed, it believed that if you make a child academically successful, then happiness will follow.’ This had led to ‘excessive curricular interference’. ‘Principles of commercial accountability were transferred to the education of the child. Hence the flawed mechanism and, still worse, flawed metric of league tables,’ he went on. Dr Hands said independent schools had maintained their focus on  children’s well-being and were also better at providing extra-curricular activities. He made his comments at the annual meeting of the conference, which represents more than 300 independent schools. The organisation was founded in 1869 amid an atmosphere of Victorian recognition of ‘the existence of the child’, he said. ‘It was the age when the child could ask for more and, newly, expect to be heard,’ Dr Hands added, before referencing two characters from the Victorian novels of Charles Dickens. ‘The underlying historic realisation was that children are special. And, because of this, they should be loved – not threatened by violence by the likes of Mr Squeers or filled with facts by the likes of Mr Gradgrind. ‘This background is important. For if it was the 19th century that invented this understanding of the child, it is the 21st that bids fair to hold its funeral. The chief mission and pride of our schools, historically and at the present, is to keep that concept of the child alive and cherished.’ In a challenge to Government control, he added: ‘Children and childhood are too precious to be abandoned to the anonymous and impersonal guardianship of the State. The State is not currently suitable to direct education unaided or unchallenged because it does not understand the child.’ Private schools risk haemorrhaging ‘huge numbers of pupils’ because fees are becoming unaffordable, a leading head teacher said. The warning came from Alex McGrath, head of King’s Ely Senior School in Cambridgeshire, who added: ‘This will lead to a more widespread view in our society that we are bastions of privilege.’ Annual day-only fees are just over £12,000 a year. Boarding schools typically charge £27,600 per pupil.","Dr Tim Hands described the reliance on school league tables as 'flawed'

Death: Officers visited the home of Amar Khosah, 52, in Southampton when he was reported missing - but simply posted a note through his door . Police failed to find a missing man who was lying dead in his bed for up to 12 days after overdosing on prescription painkillers, an inquest has heard. Officers visited the home of Amar Khosah, 52, in Southampton when he was reported missing - but simply posted a note through his door. The body was only found when his sister broke in herself. A coroner said it was possible the man could have been saved had Hampshire Constabulary officers investigated properly, adding: ‘The property could have been entered at any time.’ Police have apologised, saying the officers involved had received ‘refresher training’ but should have checked the flat. They added that the probe was ‘confused’ and ‘limited’ but nobody was disciplined. Mr Khosah was reported missing on July 23 by a health worker after missing two appointments. Police called at his home several times and posted notes through his door - but never tried to get in. Family friend Fabian Nicholas told the inquest that Mr Khosah’s sister Simbo had given officers permission to force their way in. But police said there was no record of permission being granted. The body was discovered on August 4 by his other sister, Amar Sameja, who had returned to her Southampton home from India on July 31. She broke into his flat and found him on his bed. The inquest at Southampton Coroner's Court comes less than two weeks after the same force apologised for failing deaf pensioner Marion Jones, 89, who dialled 999 after falling at home. Street; The body was discovered on August 4 by his sister, Amar Sameja, who had returned to her Southampton home from India on July 31. She broke into his flat on this road and found him on his bed . An officer from Hampshire Constabulary visited her home and simply left when she failed to answer the door. She was found dead inside five days later. 'We do have a situation where if the property had been entered he could have been found wholly unharmed' Coroner Keith Wiseman . Pathologist Dr Sanjay Jogai said Mr Khosah had died from an overdose of prescription painkiller tramadol. He believed the time of death was three to five days before the body was found. Coroner Keith Wiseman recorded an open verdict, saying it was unclear whether Mr Khosah had taken his own life intentionally or by mistake. He was critical of the police investigation, saying: ‘The property could have been entered at any time from July 23 onwards. ‘This becomes intriguing because if he . had not in fact died at that stage then we do have a situation where if . the property had been entered he could have been found wholly unharmed.’ Hearing: The inquest at Southampton Coroner's Court (pictured) in Hampshire was told that Amar Khosah, 52, was reported missing on July 23 by a health worker after missing two appointments . The Investigations Standards Team and Hampshire Constabulary’s Professional Standards Department reviewed how the case was handled. Both concluded there was ‘confusion among officers’ about the status of Mr Khosah’s disappearance. 'It was clear officers had not applied the force's missing person policy correctly, that the investigation lacked ownership and consistency and that officers should have considered searching Mr Khosa’s property earlier' Superintendent James Fulton, Hampshire Constabulary . The reviews said: ‘Officers did not . exercise enough urgency. The investigation needed greater continuity and . control. The concerns of the mental health worker should have made . officers increase the risk factor.’ Superintendent . James Fulton of Hampshire Constabulary said: ‘Once again I wish to . extend our sympathies to Mr Khosah’s family. I recognise this has been a . very difficult time for them and that they have lost a much-loved . member of their family. ‘While it cannot be concluded that the investigation, if managed differently, would have led to a different outcome, there is evidence that the investigation could have been concluded sooner if it had been graded appropriately. Concerns: A coroner said it was possible the 52-year-old could have been saved if officers from Hampshire Constabulary (whose headquarters in Winchester are pictured) had investigated properly . ‘It was clear officers had not applied the force’s missing person policy correctly, that the investigation lacked ownership and consistency and that officers should have considered searching Mr Khosa’s property earlier. ‘The Professional Standards Department (PSD) investigation concluded that no individual officer or police staff member had a case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct. ‘However, following the coroner’s comments, PSD will review further what individual and organisational learning should follow. ‘We have also assured Mr Khosah’s family that all officers involved in this investigation are being spoken to and given refresher training on the problem areas highlighted. ‘The force is reviewing policy to establish clearer guidance on the levels of risk and the correct categories of missing people, establishing clear standards of investigation for attending officers . ‘Force training will support the roll-out of the amended policy. The force is determined to learn the lessons of this case and we will incorporate the coroner’s findings into the review of how we deal with missing people in future.’","Officers visited Southampton home of man when he was reported missing .

Business: The new Tory tsar said she understood the sacrifices people have to make when they start out . ‘My football career started in 1993 when I saw an advert in the Financial Times newspaper, that said “football club for sale”’, she said. ‘I phoned up and got the details and went to my chairman at the time and said there is this football club for sale in Birmingham why don’t we buy it and I’ll run it. ‘”Football”?

That was on the Friday and on the Monday we owned a football club.’ At her first press conference with 200 journalists she was ‘desperate to look at least 25 so I had big hair, big shoulder pads and gave a serious presentation of all these things I was going to do with this football club now I was the CEO’. But when she finished her ‘very serious presentation’ she asked for questions. ‘A little hand went up. “Yes sir” I asked.

These images show the heart-stopping moment a man ran away from police and into the path of a tube train. The man was narrowly missed a second time by an Overground Line train as he went back across the tracks at Barking tube station. The dramatic scenes happened on Saturday at 7.15pm after the unidentified man came down the concourse and spotted police officers on routine patrol. Officers were on routine patrol at Barking station in East London when this man made eye contact with them before running away and into the path of two trains including this Overground train . He also ran in front of this eastbound District Line train in his attempts to escape from police who say they were not there to arrest him and were just on routine patrol . After making eye contact with them he immediately turned and ran, jumping across empty tracks and on to another platform. Realising there was no way to escape, the man ran along along the platform before going back onto the tracks, crossing the path of a District Line train heading towards Upminster before jumping into the path of an Overground Line train. The man came so close that the driver of the second train, who was travelling westbound, was forced to apply the emergency brake. The man also ran in front of another Hammersmith and City Line train which was stationary at the time. As he has yet to be identified, police cannot say if he is wanted in connection with any other crimes, and have no explanation for his behaviour. The man, who hasn't been identified, ran in front of a third Hammersmith and City Line train which was stopped at the time before escaping from the station . This is the man police would like to speak to, but until they identify him they cannot say if he was wanted in connection with another crime and cannot explain his behaviour . British Transport Police have an office inside the station and often have officers on patrol there. Investigators are now viewing CCTV footage of the incident and speaking to witnesses to try and identify the young man. PC Church, the investigating officer, said: 'Trespass on the railway is, in itself, extremely dangerous and irresponsible, but to run in front of moving trains is putting your life on the line. 'We don’t believe the man was injured during the incident and thankfully, no one else was, but this was still extremely thoughtless behaviour. 'If you recognise the man, or have any further information about the incident, I’d urge you to come forward.' Despite the emergency brake being used there were no delays because of the man's actions.

Mr Dhanota says that after he began to . complain about his mistreatment, he was axed from his . £37,500-a-year job in October last year on grounds of poor . performance. The IT manager of Chadwell Heath, Essex, is suing the bank for race and religious discrimination, sexual harassment and victimisation. He is seeking £56,825 for loss of earnings and injury to feelings. Giving evidence today at Central London Employment Tribunal, Mr Dhanota told how he joined the bank in July 2011 after working in IT for 15 years. Mr Dhanota, who is British but of Indian . origin, said: 'I have always taken pride in my religion and culture and . find it upsetting and distressing when people mock, ridicule or . disrespect my personal beliefs.' Mr Dhanota said that in January 2012, he . 'politely reminded' Mr Tanna that he was a Sikh and found his constant . abuse offensive and reported him in confidence to HR. He said that his objections only spurred Mr Tanna on to humiliate him further in front of colleagues. In April 2012, Mr Tanna began to launch unprovoked physical attacks, Mr Dhanota told the tribunal. He said: 'The violent conduct was more or less continuous. This included punching, wrestling and finger twisting.' 'At times, the physical assaults would be so aggressive as to cause my turban to loosen, which was the cause of significant distress to me.' Accusations: Mr Dhanota says that staff at Samba Financial Services, Mayfair, pictured, mocked his religion . Refuted: The company deny all of Mr Dhanota's claims in the case held at the Central London Employment Tribunal . Mr Dhanota, who is now deputy head of IT for an NHS Trust, added: 'On one occasion, Jack Tanna showed me explicit pornographic images on his mobile phone, which he knew to be offensive to me by virtue of my religious beliefs and it was clear he found it amusing when I was shocked and offended. 'He would often boast about organising prostitutes and sexual gatherings for his Saudi counterparts, referring to them as ‘dirty Arabs’, which I also found very offensive.' In October 2012, another manager, Prakash Kale, allegedly asked Mr Dhanota ‘Will your turban flash red in the event of an emergency?’ The same month, a third senior manager, Bhupendra Bharakda, left Mr Dhanota 'mortified' by placing a sticky note saying ‘Sign here’ on the back of his turban. Mr Dhanota's solicitor Jay Joshi, of law firm . Judge Sykes Frixou, said: 'It is both shocking and ironic that such an . ethnically diverse bank appears to condone such outrageous acts of . bullying, harassment and discrimination.' Samba Financial Group strongly denies all Mr Dhanota’s allegations and is vigorously contesting his claim. The case continues.

The distraught teenage sister of April Jones said today she dreams of hugging her murdered sibling just one more time and to hear her say 'I love you'. Jazmin Jones and the five-year-old were 'inseparable' and the room they shared is exactly as it was when she was abducted and killed last October. April's bed in Machynlleth, mid-Wales, is still made and is covered in her favourite cuddly toys to remind her bereft family 'she will always be with us', the 17-year-old said. Tragic: April Jones's sister Jazmin (right) said today she was desperate to hug the five-year-old just one more time and hear her say 'I love you' 'I wish I could feel her hug me or hear her voice say ""I love you"" just one more time,' Jazmin told The Sun. April was kidnapped and murdered by Mark Bridger, who coaxed her into his car as she played on her bike on October 1 last year. But Jazmin has admitted she wishes she had been there to protect her sibling. 'I couldn't do anything that night. I felt so helpless. I kept thinking it can't be April — it must be a joke,' she said. Bereft: April's funeral was last Thursday, which saw her parents Coral, Paul, and siblings Harley and Jazmin cling to one another for support . Outpouring: April's family file into church behind her coffin while the community in Machynlleth, mid-Wales, stand and watch . Before he killed April, paedophile Bridger had stalked local girls online and police found pictures of children, including Jazmin, on his computer. But the student said today: 'I don't think of him. My mind is always on April.' It came just four days since April Jones's family were finally . able to say a formal farewell to their ‘sweet, . innocent little girl’. Her mother Coral sobbed with grief as she joined hundreds of mourners at April's funeral in Machynlleth last Thursday. Cruel: Mark Bridger (left), who was convicted of April's murder in May, has never revealed where her body is . Coral, . her husband Paul, and children Jazmin and Harley, 10, dressed in . April's favourite colour of pink for the touching funeral service. The . tight-knit town in mid-Wales came to a standstill as the . youngster’s tiny coffin made its final journey from her home to the . packed church where her funeral was held. Pure grief: April's mother Coral sobbed as she entered the church, wearing a bracelet bearing her daughter's name . The horse-drawn carriage was filled with pink flowers that spelled out April's name. It . sat alongside a small golden crown and a card from her parents and . siblings that read: 'Shine bright like a diamond. Find happiness with . the angels April.' As the family arrived, a poignant . montage of images of April played on a 50inch flat screen TV taken from . the family's own album of images. The . images were put together as part of a GCSE school project by Jazmin. Machynlleth, which has stood behind the family throughout the trauma, was . also decorated in the five-year-old's favourite colour of pink and . ribbons were hung from railings, shop windows and lampposts. It is very nearly a year since April was snatched as she played just a few yards from her terraced home. The youngster had been allowed to stay out a little later . than usual following a glowing report from teachers at her primary . school. It was then that the . father-of-six Bridger conned April, who was friends with one of his . daughters, into his Land Rover before speeding off.

Despite . a mountain of evidence stacking up against the former abattoir worker, . including fragments of a child’s skull in his fireplace, Bridger . vehemently claimed he could not remember what he had done with April.

PC Andrew Gouge, 34, groomed a 'vulnerable' 13-year-old girl online before convincing her to meet up with him in a park . A paedophile policeman spotted groping a 'vulnerable' 13-year-old girl in her school uniform after grooming her online was today jailed for 21 months. PC Andrew Gouge, 34, had just passed his Sergeant’s exam when passers-by realised he and the youngster were not father and daughter and raised the alarm. He first met the victim on an internet chatroom and, after exchanging Blackberry Messenger details, they met up on a number of occasions, usually in public parks. Kathy Hirst, prosecuting, told Woolwich Crown Court: 'It seems that they made contact towards the beginning of this year because by February they had swapped Blackberry Messenger pins in order for them to be able to contact each other in that way, and also they were emailing each other.' The court heard Gouge, who is estranged from his wife, had never sought to hide his real age from his victim, but visited the chatrooms under the pseudonym 'Josh Little'. During the course of police interviews, the victim, now 14, told officers that she had met Gouge on four occasions in parks in Orpington, Kent. Ms Hirst said: 'Most of the time, she said, they spent talking, on the third meeting there had been some physical contact including kissing.' She told how on the fourth meeting, members of the public spotted the pair and called police after becoming concerned about the nature of their relationship. Ms Hirst continued: 'Clearly on that occasion the activity was witnessed by others, they had been kissing, and also that he was observed to have his hand up her school skirt, and resting under her skirt.' One witness said she had though the pair were father and daughter before noticing that they were behaving awkwardly. Ms Hirst said: 'She went home and called her father who suggested that she should phone the police if she was unhappy and perhaps take a further look.' After going back to see Gouge and the young girl 'snogging' with his hand up her skirt, the woman called the police. Another . witness saw the same scene moments later after hearing schoolchildren . talking about seeing a girl in school uniform kissing an older man. Two officers who had been on patrol in Bromley arrived at the scene and caught Gouge in an embrace with the 13-year-old. Sentencing: Concerned members of the public who spotted the pair in the park called police leading to Gouge being jailed for 21 months at Woolwich Crown Court, pictured . 'He was in fact recognised by one of the officers as being a local officer,' said Ms Hirst. Both Gouge and the girl initially told officers they had only met that day with the Gouge claiming the youngster had come across him 'lying in a field'. However, after further investigations officers discovered the truth and went to the young girl’s house to speak to her. Ms Hirst said: 'She said that he had sent a picture of him with no top on and she said that she had sent him a picture of her bottom that was partly covered by a t-shirt.' She also reluctantly revealed that they’d had sexually explicit conversations which had involved him asking for oral sex. Sentencing Gouge to 21 months imprisonment, Judge David Tomlinson said: 'You were a serving police officer at the time of those offences. 'Indeed you been in the police force for some 10-and-a-half years and I accept, as I am told, about your service in general. Detective Chief Inspector Pete Thomas . 'You had the status of Acting Police Sergeant by the time of these unhappy events. Your police station at Bromley was local to where you met this child. 'It seems that she was already in a fragile and vulnerable state when you made contact with her.' He added: 'Though there was no particular relationship with the girl and you owed her no specific duty of care, you were in a position of trust within the community as a whole.' Gouge, of Grays, Essex, admitted one count of meeting a child following sexual grooming and sexual activity with a child. Dressed in a maroon t-shirt and jogging bottoms, Gouge sat with his arms crossed and showed no reaction as his sentence was read. He is currently suspended from the Met and is facing disciplinary proceedings. Detective Chief Inspector Pete Thomas, of the Met’s Sexual Offences, Exploitation and Child Abuse Command, said: 'Andrew Gouge has shown himself to be someone who has targeted, groomed and exploited a vulnerable young child for his own sexual needs. 'His conduct has caused significant harm and the investigation highlights the need to remain vigilant to the risks posed by social media and the internet in order to safeguard children. 'The Metropolitan Police Service is committed to protecting children and bringing sexual predators like Gouge to justice.' Commander Allan Gibson, the Met’s Directorate of Professional Standards, said: 'Gouge signed up to protect and serve his community; but seriously failed in that commitment and has caused untold harm to the victim, her family and his own friends and colleagues. 'He has tarnished the reputation of both the organisation and his colleagues. All members of the police service are expected to behave impeccably whilst on and off duty. Gouge did no such thing.' Gouge will also be subject to a Sexual Offences Prevention Order and a Restraining Order.","PC Andrew Gouge, 34, met the girl online before meeting her in a park .

They are usually advised to restrict consumption amid fears over mercury, which builds up in oily fish. The metal can damage the brain of unborn children. This has led to mothers-to-be being advised by the Food Standards Agency to limit the amount of tuna, mackerel, sardines, salmon and trout they eat, and to avoid shark, swordfish and marlin altogether. Warning: The Food Standards Agency had previously advised mothers-to-be not to eat fish like mackerel, pictured, because of the metal . But a large-scale British study  suggests that concerns over mercury levels in fish may be unfounded. With fish credited as having numerous health benefits, the researchers said they hope that ‘many more women will now consider eating fish during pregnancy’ – although the FSA said that its advice remains unchanged. The researchers compared mercury levels in blood samples from more than 4,000 pregnant women from the Bristol area with information about their diet and lifestyle. Fish accounted for only 7 per cent of the mercury in the women’s bodies, and food and drink accounted for 17 per cent. Other sources of the toxic metal include air pollution, dental fillings and pesticides. Overall, only 38 of the women – fewer than 1 per cent – had mercury levels higher than the maximum  recommended by the US National Research Council. There is no official safe level in the UK. The study  concluded that advice to pregnant women to limit seafood intake is unlikely to reduce their mercury  levels substantially. No basis: A large-scale British study suggests that concerns over mercury levels in fish like salmon, pictured, are unfounded . Professor Jean Golding, lead author of the report published in Environmental Health Perspectives, said: ‘We were pleasantly surprised to find that fish contributes such a small amount to blood mercury levels. ‘We have previously found that eating fish during pregnancy has many health benefits for both mother and child. We hope many more women will now consider eating more fish during pregnancy.’ Professor Charles Kingsland, of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: ‘Fish is a valuable nutrient and is something we wouldn’t tell patients to avoid because it is full of mercury. ‘We’d say to eat more of it because it is full of omega-3 oils and all things that are good for you.’ But the Food Standard Agency said its advice stands. A spokesman said: ‘Most people do not eat enough fish. However, children, pregnant women and women who are trying to get pregnant should not eat shark, marlin or swordfish. If you are trying for a baby or are pregnant, you should have no more than four cans of tuna a week. Mackerel, sardines, salmon and trout should not be eaten more than twice a week.’ The study also found that herbal teas were linked to higher mercury levels in the blood, perhaps due to contamination. Wine appeared to raise mercury levels more than beer. However, women who ate lots of chips and white bread tended to have lower levels.","Food Standards Agency warn pregnant women metal could be harmful .
But results of large-scale study have questioned this theory .
Fish accounted for only 7% of mercury in a women's body .
Other food and drink accounted for 17% .
Dental fillings and air pollution are also sources of the toxic metal ."

Ms McCullins leg became increasingly . itchy and swollen and after a week she went to see a doctor who told her . it was actually a spider bite. She . added: 'By that time, my leg was extremely swollen and painful. Although the antibiotics helped with the bite, I had developed . cellulitis.' Ms McCullins was bed-ridden for a week at her home in Basingstoke after the 'excruciating' bite on her left ankle throbbed a glowing red and became infected, right.  She said she knew the bite was caused by the false widow, left, after researching her symptoms on the internet and finding photos of similar bites . Stuart Hine, an expert from the . British History Museum, said the false widow spider has been living in . Hampshire and along the south coast of England for more than 30 years. They are thought to have come into the country from abroad through ports where there are shipments of bananas. The false widow - or Steatoda nobilis - is a relative the potentially lethal black widow found in America and Asia. It has been spotted at least 50 times in parts of London and Kent over the past month. It is thought the drop in weather at the start of September forced the arachnids into people's houses. Symptoms of a false widow bite include swelling, pins and needles and minor chest pains. Hine added: 'These symptoms may last for a couple of days but the total effect is unlikely to be more serious than that.' The serious skin condition meant she . had to return to the doctor for stronger antibiotics, but it still took . around three weeks before the swelling subsided. 'I’ve heard horror stories of infections developing into the flesh-eating bug necrosis,' contuined Ms McCullins . 'When . my leg turned black I feared I may have caught it and be at risk of . having to have my leg amputated. I’ve been absolutely terrified of . spiders all my life - I have a real phobia of them. I’m just really glad . I didn’t actually see the spider itself.' Ms . McCullins claims she knew the bite was caused by the false widow after . doing some research on the internet and finding photos of similar bites. Stuart Hine, an expert from the British . History Museum, said the spider has been established in Hampshire and . along the south coast of England for more than 30 years.

Hine said: 'If handled unwisely or accidentally, adult Steatoda nobilis . - the formal name for the false widow spider - are capable of biting . humans. 'Reports from those bitten describe a certain amount of pain and often a degree of swelling in the affected part. 'These . symptoms may last for a couple of days but the total effect is unlikely . to be more serious than that. However, if symptoms were to persist, it . would be advisable to seek medical attention.' Antibiotics prescribed by Ms McCullins' GP failed to clear up the infection and it led to cellulitis - an infection that affects deep layers of the skin, pictured. When she returned to her doctor she was told she may have to be admitted to hospital and put on a drip if another dose failed to work .","Christine McCullins, 54, was bitten by a false widow spider in Hampshire .

Jimmy Hill – one of the most influential figures in English football and the face of Match of the Day for 25 years – is suffering from Alzheimer’s, it emerged yesterday. The 85-year-old former footballer and television presenter is living in a care home near the South Coast after his condition deteriorated. Hill was diagnosed in 2008, but his battle with dementia only came to light yesterday amid a legal wrangle over his assets. Jimmy Hilll, pictured with his wife, Bryony, at their former home in Sussex in 1998 - he gave her joint powers of attorney with a solicitor . He had given joint powers of attorney . to his current wife Bryony, 62, and a solicitor in 2005, when he was . still in good health. But . Hill’s five children from his two previous marriages only discovered the . existence of the legal document in 2008, when Hill was deemed by . doctors to be too ill to look after himself. As a result, none has any . say over his future treatment or the management of his assets. His . condition was made public yesterday by his youngest son Jamie, 46, and . his daughter Joanna, 50, who are his two children from his second . marriage. The pair said . they decided to raise awareness of their father’s illness to highlight . concerns over the difficulties that arise when a parent with a large . extended family becomes too poorly to make decisions for themselves.

Jimmy Hill pictured at a Fulham v Chelsea match in 2006 - he was diagnosed in 2008, but his condition only came to light at the weekend . Mr . Hill junior, a property consultant who lives in West London, said: . ‘This will become a more common problem over the years because there are . so many families in the same position as ours. Because of the power of . attorney, the children have no say over decisions over dad’s health care . or his assets.’ Jimmy Hill had a massive impact on English football. During . his successful playing career he became chairman of the Professional . Footballers’ Association in 1957 and later a manager. While at the PFA . he succeeded in scrapping the maximum wage for players, paving the way . for today’s multi-million-pound footballers. He . also pioneered all-seater stadiums and was instrumental in introducing . the ‘three points for a win’ rule in 1981 that helped transform the . modern game into a far more exciting spectacle. His broadcasting career spanned 40 years and he racked up 600 appearances on Match of the Day. Mr . Hill junior, who visits his father at the nursing home where he has . been since last year, said: ‘He is the most sprightly physical specimen . in the home, but his mind is not what it was. ‘The home is the best place for him. That is not my complaint. ‘My concern is we only discovered in 2008 that power of attorney had been signed three years earlier. ‘We said in 2008 that if Bryony’s lawyer steps aside and one of us children has joint power of attorney, we will be happy. ‘Unfortunately, . that was declined.

Secretary. Joanna Hill, . who lives in Mexico, added: ‘It is a shame that we as his children have . no rights over his care. Children whose parents have married more than . once should be made aware that they will be unable to influence their . affairs if they register a power of attorney.’ In . his autobiography Hill admitted he had made mistakes in his private . life and caused upset. Hill married his first wife Gloria, with whom he . had three children, in 1950, when his playing career was taking off. He . left her when his eldest son Duncan was only seven for his second wife .

They say we are all creatures of habit and this pensioner has certainly proved that saying to be correct. Loyal customer Peter Butler has bought 32 cars from the same garage over the past four decades. The 92-year-old man has buying his cars from the Howards Motor Group garage in Weston super Mare, Somerset, since 1974 - a total of 41 years. Peter Butler's wife Marcia poses by one of the couple's first Nissans - a Datson from late 1976 . Another motor bought from Howards Moror Group circa 1977 . Marcia poses with a sporty red number, also from 1977 . And despite the garage selling a range of cars, for Mr Butler there was only ever make he was willing to invest in - the Nissan. Mr Butler, said: 'A lot of people ask why . I've bought so many Nissans and I tell them, why change when you have . something which satisfies you. 'I know the cars won't let me down.' The former Royal Air Force pilot bought his first Nissan when the company was still called Datsun in 1974. The Datsun Cherry set him back a grand total of £3,750. The couple invested in this more sensible motor in 1979 . In the mid-eighties Mr Butler bought this two-door motor, pictured pulling into his driveway . Mr Butler said: 'My wife and I were walking past the garage and saw the white Datsun Cherry in the window. 'We literally stopped in our tracks. I went and bought it because we liked the look of it. 'I bought that car for my wife and then a few months later I bought myself a Sunny as the Cherry was so reliable.' Since then, the former Royal Air Force pilot has been returning to the business in Herluin Way and has purchased every Nissan model ever made. He said he would usual buy the cars brand new and sell them on within a year - as the vehicles only had a year warranty. The pensioner, pictured outside the garage in Weston super Mare, bought this more modern car in 1999 . The couple downsized somewhat in early 2003 with this red Micra . The pensioner says he has only ever had one breakdown over the past four decades. Mr Butler said: 'I have only ever been let down once - and that was a Sunny. 'I was driving round a roundabout and the gearstick just came off in my hand. 'But it was soon fixed and it was back to normal.' Mr Butler, who is a full-time carer for his wife Marcia who has had Alzheimer's disease for 22 years, has just bought himself a brand new Nissan Micra. The former RAF pilot recently bought his latest car - a brand new black Micra . The 92-year-old said he has always bought Nissan cars as he knows they won't let him down . He said: 'I got it last month. It's fantastic and I know it will be as good as the other 31.' Datsun began production in 1931 and is now owned by the Nissan Motor Company. From 1958 to 1986, only vehicles exported by Nissan were identified as Datsun. In 1986, Nissan phased out the Datsun name but relaunched in 2013 as the brand for low-cost vehicles manufactured for emerging markets. The Nissan Bluebird was launched in 1957 and was the company's best selling sedan vehicle. Due to its size, it was popular with taxi drivers. The Cherry was Nissan's first front wheel drive model launched in 1970. Howards Motor Group in Weston super Mare, Somerset, pictured in 1974 when Mr Butler first bought a Nissan .

The submarine car driven by James Bond in The Spy Who Loved Me has been sold at auction for £550,000. The Lotus Esprit was the subject of a fierce battle between a female buyer and a telephone bidder, who eventually came out the winner at RM Auctions in Battersea, South-West London. The distinctive-looking vehicle was designed for an underwater scene in the 1977 spy film, which starred Roger Moore as 007. Scroll down for video . Sold! The Lotus Esprit submarine car featured in The Spy Who Loved Me has been bought for £550,000 . Bidding war: Two buyers competed against each other for the distinctive-looking vehicle . Auction: The bidding war in Battersea, South-West London was attended by DJ Chris Evans, pictured in a white hat . Those in the auction room - including Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans, a motoring columnist for the Mail on Sunday - clapped as bids went up to £550,000, which after charges left the buyer £616,000 out of pocket. Peter Haynes, from RM Auctions, said the auctioneer was pleased with the price despite it coming in at under estimated prices of between £650,000 and £950,000. 'We are very happy with that price, it is very strong money for what is an important piece of movie memorabilia,' Mr Haynes said. 'Bearing in mind it is not a car that can be driven on the road, the price just goes to prove the draw that all Bond-related memorabilia has.' The car cannot be driven on the road, although it is said to be a fully operational submarine. Underwater: The car, nicknamed 'Wet Nellie' during filming, worked as a self-propelled submarine . Film: The Spy Who Loved Me starred Roger Moore as James Bond . The previous owner, who has chosen to stay anonymous, found the car after buying a storage container in Long Island in 1989. It is believed the Lotus was left in storage by the production company which paid for the container for 10 years. But when the payment ran out and nobody came to collect it, it was put up for sale. The man who bought it earns a 'very modest' living through his business which rents out construction tools. He did not recognise the car for what it was as he had reportedly never seen a Bond film at the time. When he pulled the covers off the car and found it had no wheels and a dented roof, he was less than thrilled with his buy. Shells: The production company used several different versions of the Lotus Esprit to film the chase scenes . Specifications: James Bond's car was designed to convert into a submarine when underwater . But as he drove the car home on the . back of a truck, other drivers who recognised the vehicle radioed him to . tell him what it was. Back home he rented The Spy Who Loved Me on video, and realised how valuable his find was. The . Lotus was nicknamed 'Wet Nellie' during filming and was built by a . former Navy SEAL at a cost of around $100,000 - the equivalent to . $500,000 today. Although . Roger Moore starred as Bond in the film, the submarine car was driven . by retired Navy SEAL Don Griffin during underwater filming. Discovery: A small business owner found the valuable car after he bought a storage container in a blind auction for $100 . There were actually several different . Lotus Esprits used to film the sequence where Roger Moore and Barbara . Bach escape the enemy by driving off a pier into the sea. The car up for sale is the only one that worked as a self-propelled submarine. Since its discovery the car has been exhibited from time to time but largely kept with its private owner. James Bond expert Doug Redenius tracked down its owner and confirmed the Lotus's authenticity. The 1964 Aston Martin DB5 driven by Sean Connery in Goldfinger and Thunderball was previously sold by RM Auctions for $4.4million in 2010.","Submarine car abandoned in storage bought for just $100 in blind auction .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 11:33 EST, 30 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:33 EST, 30 September 2013 . UKIP was hit by a fresh race row yesterday after a senior aide to Nigel Farage referred to a British Asian journalist as being ‘of some form of ethnic extraction’. Gawain Towler, the party’s chief press officer, came under fire after he accidentally texted the description to one of the journalist’s colleagues. Mr Towler, who is also a lead candidate for the party in next year’s European Parliament elections, insisted he had meant no offence and wearily referred to himself as ‘today’s comedy racist’. But Tory MPs called for him to apologise. Row: Towler, left, referred to journalist Kiran Randhawa, right, as being 'of some form of ethnic extraction' Nick de Bois, secretary of the backbench 1992 committee, said: ‘There’s no room in any walk of life, let alone politics, for this type of racially insensitive language.’ Fellow Tory Nadhim Zahawi added: ‘It’s outrageous. Nobody in 2013 should use language like this – especially if you want to be seen as fit to run the country.’ It comes after Godfrey Bloom faced . criticism for complaining about foreign aid going to ‘Bong Bongo Land’ and Mr Farage referred to ‘coloured people’ in a radio interview. Last week a UKIP councillor insisted he was not racist – because he has been on holiday to the Carribean. Viv Lewis, 83, repeatedly insisted ‘I . like coloured people’ as the party again faced claims it was out of . touch with modern Britain. Mr Towler is one of Mr Farage’s closest aides and runs the party’s communications operation. He is standing for the party in next year’s European Parliament elections and is the candidate to become MP for North Dorset. In a text message exchange he was informing UKIP organisers of a visit to Manchester by Mr Farage. He warned that there would be two journalists from the London Evening Standard meeting them at Mancehster Piccadilly station. He wrote: ‘James, my fault but I told the Standard that Nigel would be arriving at approx. 10.30 this morning. Publicity: The row risked distracting from UKIP leader Nigel Farage's visit to Manchester where he hopes to woo disaffected Tories . ‘They have called and I expect a snapper and a female journalist (of some form of ethnic extraction) at Piccadilly.’ The remark about Kiran Randhawa, a British Asian journalist who works for the Standard, sparked a furious backlash. Mr Towler rejected the claim he was racist, telling reporters his wife is Indian. But he added: ‘I am today’s comedy racist.’ He blamed a poor quality answerphone message in which he had not picked up the ‘multi-syllabled’ name of the journalist. He later told The Times: ‘If I’d got the right name I would have used it but I didn’t so I needed to give a head up . ‘I was thinking of using the term “babe” but they aren’t going to have the first idea what I’m going on about.’ But Tories at their party conference in Manchester condemned the remarks. Nick de Bois told the Standard: ‘There’s no room in any walk of life, let alone politics, for this type of racially insensitive language.’ Apology: UKIP councillor Viv Lewis, from Cornwall, repeatedly referred to 'coloured people' during a TV interview but denied being racist . Nadhim Zahawi added: ‘It’s outrageous. Nobody in 2013 should use language like this — especially if you want to be seen as fit to run the country.’ The row distracted attention from Mr Farage’s appearnces in Manchester where he tried to woo Conservative to back his party in next year’s European elections. Mr Farage insisted Mr Towler’s remark was ‘not meant maliciously’ and only people who were ‘very silly’ could consider it to be racist. Asked whether Mr Towler should be sacked for the comment, he added: ‘What would you suggest, prison camp? Forced labour?’ Mr Farage has tried to repair the party’s . reputation in recent weeks, insisting it had ‘grown up’ and was ready to . win seats in the Commons. Last week Mr Lewis, from Cornwall, was been forced to apologise for a BBC TV . interview where he denied being a racist - while also referring to . ‘coloured people’. Asked . about UKIP’s immigration policy, he said: ‘I have already had heated . arguments about that. Racist I am not. I like coloured people. ‘I have been to the West Indies. I have sampled their hospitality. I like coloured people. ‘But . what I don’t like is people who walk into this country and immediately . get given money when there’s a lot more deserving cases among English, . British people,’ said the retired coach driver who represents Cornwall’s . Camborne Treswithian.","Gawain Towler is also a candidate in next year's European elections .

The battle to turn Britain around is ‘not even close to being over’, George Osborne warned today as he vowed to stick to his economic plan. The Chancellor told the Tory party conference that family finances would not improve overnight as he rejected Labour’s plan to ‘fix prices and confiscate wealth’. Unveiling new welfare reforms, Mr Osborne set out a new commitment to cutting Britain’s debts and promised to freeze fuel duty until 2015. Warning: George Osborne told the Tory party conference that the recovery was still at risk and it would be some time before incomes started rising . Chancellor George Osborne set out a range of policies in his speech to Conservative delegates including: . Mr Osborne said he could not rule out . future tax rises, but said he thought it was possible to balance the . nation’s books through spending cuts and reining in welfare spending. He . unveiled plans to strip benefits from the long-term jobless unless they . work full time picking up litter, removing graffiti or preparing meals . for the elderly. The US-style ‘work for the dole’ programme will start within six months and affect 200,000 welfare claimants. And . he promised help to motorists with the cost of living. Mr Osborne said: . 'Provided we can find the savings to pay for it, I want to freeze fuel . duty for the rest of this Parliament. 'Conservatives . don't just talk about being on the side of hard-working people. We show . it day in day out in the policies we deliver.' Mr . Osborne also unveiled his ambition to ensure that a future Conservative . Government will run a surplus in good times as well as bad. 'It . should be obvious to anyone that in the years running up to the crash . this country should have been running a budget surplus,' he said. 'That’s what we mean when we say they didn’t fix the roof when the sun was shining. Let us never make that same mistake again.' He said the plan would allow Tories to . deliver tax cuts and increased infrastructure investment to ensure that . the UK is prepared for any future economic crash. Mr . Osborne told delegates: ‘Our plan is working. We held our nerve in the . face of huge pressure. Now Britain is turning a corner. ‘That . is due to the resolve and the sacrifice of the people of this country. For that support we owe the British people a huge heartfelt thank you. Thanks to you Britain is on the right track.’ Welfare: Mr Osborne accused Labour of allowing people to linger on benefits for years - with no questions asked . Karren Brady hailed Chancellor George Osborne . as 'the right man with the right plan' and launched an attack on Labour . who she said 'all but bankrupted the country'. The football boss and Apprentice star . was unveiled as the Conservative’s new business tsar, fuelling . speculation she will launch a political career. Speaking . at the Tory conference in Manchester, the West Ham vice-chairman spoke . of the difficulties of being the first woman ‘to break into a very male . dominated industry’ – including being asked what her ‘vital statistics’ were. She said: 'David Cameron and George Osborne held their nerve and stuck . to the plan and I hope you can see how right they were - we are now . starting to recover, we are turning a corner.' The 44-year-old, who has spoken of her . desire to ‘get involved’ in running the country, was chosen to . introduce the Chancellor’s keynote conference speech. He went on: ‘We have to deal with our debts and see our plan through. And yes, if the recovery is sustained then families will start to feel better off. ‘Because what matters most for living standards are jobs, and low mortgage rates, and lower taxes. ‘But family finances will not be transformed overnight. Because Britain was made much poorer by the crash. ‘That is what happens when you get a catastrophic failure of economic policy of the kind we saw five years ago the result of a decade of Labour failure when bust follows boom when banks get bailed out and when government budgets spiral out of control.’ He added: ‘This battle to turn around Britain it is not even close to being over. And we are going to finish what we have started. There can be no recovery for all if there is no recovery at all.’ He accused Labour of allowing people to linger on benefits for years – with no questions asked – while letting uncontrolled numbers of migrants fill low-paid jobs. The ‘Help to Work’ scheme – quickly dubbed ‘Made to Work’ – is likely to face furious opposition from left-wing activists and charities. But Mr Osborne told Tory delegates: . ‘For the first time, all long-term unemployed people who are capable of . work will be required to do something in return for their benefits to . help them find work. ‘They will do useful work to put . something back into their community – making meals for the elderly, . clearing up litter, working for a local charity. Others will be made to . attend the job centre every working day. ‘And for those with underlying problems, like drug addiction and illiteracy, there will be an intensive regime of help. No one will be ignored or left without help. But no one will get something for nothing.’ The Liberal Democrats have agreed that the scheme, which is larger than expected, should begin next April – confirming welfare as a major election issue. Around 200,000 jobseeker’s allowance claimants will be affected each year. Mr Osborne used his speech to the conference to warn that ‘many risks remain’ to the economic recovery. Business: The Chancellor visited Cartwright vehicle manufacturers in Altrincham, Cheshire, where he toured the factory accompanied by joint managing directors Steven (left) and John Cartwright . New policy: Around 200,000 unemployed people claiming jobseeker's allowance in the UK will be affected by a new Tory 'work for your dole' scheme . He argued that what matters most for . living standards are ‘jobs, and low mortgage rates, and lower taxes’ – . an implied rebuke to Labour leader Ed Miliband’s proposal to use . 1970s-style laws to fix energy prices. He argued that it is crucial . for Britain’s future economic health that the long-term unemployed no . longer have ‘a life on the dole’. Support: Mr Osborne's wife Frances was in the audience for his keynote speech to the Tory conference . The . £300million Help to Work scheme will be . funded from spending cuts and savings elsewhere, to be detailed in the . autumn statement. Claimants put on community work . placements will have to do 30 hours a week for six months, plus ten . hours of job search activity a week, and show they are doing ‘everything . they can’ to find paid work. Placements will have to be of wider benefit to the community as well as the individual claimant. Those . who break the rules will lose four weeks of benefits for their first . breach of the rules, and a quarter of a year’s worth for any second . offence. Mr Osborne said: ‘By the time . Labour left office, five million people were on out-of-work benefits. 'What . a waste of life and talent. A generation of people recycled through the . job centres – collecting their dole cheques year in year out, and no . one seemed to notice. 'For . an open-door immigration policy meant those running the economy didn’t . care: there was always a ready supply of low-skilled labour from abroad. Well, never again.’ The Chancellor argued that, under . Labour’s welfare system, people were better off on benefits than in work . and nothing was asked for in return for handouts. But Rachel Reeves, Labour’s Treasury spokesman, said: ‘It’s taken three wasted years of rising long-term unemployment and a failed Work Programme to come up with this new scheme. ‘But this policy is not as ambitious as Labour’s compulsory jobs guarantee, which would ensure there is a paid job for every young person out of work for over 12 months and every adult unemployed for more than two years. ‘With Labour’s plans we would work with employers to ensure there are jobs for young people and the long-term unemployed – which they would have to take up or lose benefits. 'Under the Tory scheme people would still be allowed to languish on the dole for years on end without having a proper job.’","Chancellor cautions that family finances will not improve overnight .

He then injected himself with high doses of drugs, as well. When the boy's mother when to Lehtinen's Redmond, Washington, home to pick her son up, she found both Lehtinen and the child unconscious. Suspected overdose: A father allegedly injected himself and his four-year-old son with heroin in Redmond, Washington . A needle was still sticking out of the boy's chest, according to police. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer reports that Lehtinen's wife of six years allowed the couple's son to stay with Lehtinen while she went out of town for a job interview - despite her husband's history as both a heroin addict and a heroin dealer. She returned to Redmond last Tuesday - on the very day that her divorce from her husband was finalized, authorities say. Both Lehtinen and the child were rushed to the hospital. Both survived. The child is still recovering at Seattle Children's Hospital. It is unknown whether he will suffer long-term damage from the drugs that were pumped into his system. Police tape surrounds the home where the father and his son were discovered by the boy's mother on Tuesday . Prosecutors believe Lehtinen was trying to kill the boy and himself with drugs - but failed. Lehtinen is charged with attempted murder. Lt. Charlie Gorman told q13fox.com: 'In 35 years as a police officer I’ve never run across anything like this.' A neighbor added: 'I just don’t understand how messed up you have to be to inject your 4-year-old with heroin.'","Mother arrived home in Redmond, Washington to find the pair unconscious but still breathing ."

'Attack': Mark Newman, 49, allegedly punched colleague Karen Woosman up to six times when she ended their relationship . A male nurse punched his lover up to six times when she ended their workplace romance, a disciplinary hearing was told. Mark Newman, 49, also hid his history of violent attacks from his employers at the University Hospital of Wales, in Cardiff, before the attack. The father-of-three allegedly hit Karen Woosman, 43, in the back of the head 'four, five or six times' when she asked him to leave after an argument about a text message on her phone. The divorcee mother-of-one had embarked on a 'casual and fun fling' with Newman, her colleague in the surgical short stay unit, the Nursing and Midwifery Council was told. But during their relationship she felt 'intimidated' by Newman who would leave flowers and chocolates on her car, the panel was told. She accused him of 'acting like a 13-year-old boy rather than a 40-something father' and proudly telling colleagues they were seeing each other. The mother told the hearing that she decided to end the fling when the text message was brought up. She said: 'Mark was going berserk - he was calling me all the names under the sun. 'I told him to leave the house but he said he wouldn’t. I pushed him firmly in the chest to tell him to get out. He started to punch me at full force with a closed first in the back of the head. 'From the way he was attacking me I felt sure he would not have stopped until I was lying on the floor. 'It all happened in a blur, I didn’t expect him to ever hit me, I fell to the ground, I was in shock, I was frightened. The next morning I was stiff and I had shooting pains in my neck.' Newman had three previous convictions for . violent behaviour between 1984 and 2010 which he did not reveal to . management when he was given his job. Miss Woosman said she was initially attracted to the father, from Cardiff, because he was 'funny and charming'. She added: 'We were seeing each other outside work against my better judgment because I had just got divorced and wasn’t in the best state of mind. 'But I found him funny and charming. I naively thought we could maintain a professional relationship. 'I told him not to tell anyone but he started talking about me to people at work. Colleagues: Newman and Woosman both worked in the surgical short stay unit at the University Hospital of Wales, in Cardiff . 'Mark then became very possessive, he told me he would make my life difficult if I stopped seeing him.' Miss Woosnam claims she tried to sever contact with Newman who was suspended after the incident. From behind a screen at the hearing she told Newman: 'I never loved you. You would say you loved me all the time and I had to say it back. 'You knew from day one it was casual and just a bit of fun, but you became very serious after a while and I didn’t want to do it any more. 'You used to put things on my car like lots of flowers and chocolates, I felt intimidated by you. You were telling people around work about us. I don’t know what you were hoping to achieve by that.' Newman denies hitting Miss Woosnam and claims she fabricated the attack. He told her: 'I can assure you that if I had punched you, or another person, four times with a closed fist you would had to have gone to an A&E department.' Employers: Newman failed to declare his previous convictions to bosses at the University Hospital of Wales, the tribunal heard . Newman admits failing to disclose three convictions when he applied for his job as a nurse at the 1,000-bed teaching hospital in the Welsh capital. He was convicted of criminal damage in 2010 and received 100 hours unpaid community work. He was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and criminal damage in 1985. And in 1984 he was convicted of using threatening, abusive, insulting words or behaviour contrary to the Public Order Act. Newman, a nurse since 1994, denies dishonesty and claims his fitness to practice is not impaired. Presenting officer James Edenborough told the hearing: 'The registrant had these convictions but did not disclose them. The charges deal with different matters but they are related in type.' Newman denies an allegation of accessing a different woman’s medical records for no clinical reason. He is also accused of calling a consultant 'incompetent' and 'useless' in front of a patient which he also denies. The hearing in Cardiff continues.

A benefits cheat who claimed he could barely get out of bed was caught out playing cricket for his local club, a court heard yesterday. Stewart Lorains pocketed more than £22,000 in Disability Living Allowance while regularly competing for Boosbeck, east Cleveland. The 53-year-old claimed to have diabetes, asthma and psoriatic arthropathy - an arthritic condition - and needed daily help from his sister for everyday tasks. Lorains acting as wicket keeper for his cricket club whilst claiming £20,000 in Disability Living Allowance . On his application form, he said he was constantly in pain, was slow at walking, and needed assistance to wash, go to the toilet and with eating and dressing. The Department for Work and Pensions received Lorains’ application in the summer of 2008 and started paying him the benefit in November of that year. Prosecutor Martin Towers told Teesside Crown Court: 'It can be said with certainty that as from May 2009, Mr Lorains was a great deal better than he disclosed. The 53-year-old claimed to have diabetes, asthma and psoriatic arthropathy . 'He was an active cricketer from 2009 to 2011. The prosecution obtained various statistics and observed him when he kept wicket and opened the batting.' Lorains - who describes cricket as 'my life and soul' and who according to the Boosbeck club website played 41 games between 2009 and 2012, scoring 614 runs at an average of 18 - was also a boxing coach and football referee, his barrister Tamara Pawson told Judge Howard Crowson. She said: 'When his condition slightly improved and he was allowed the chance to play cricket again, he self-medicated, and he took the chance to play. 'This is not a man who deliberately defrauded the Government to live some kind of elaborate lifestyle. He accepts he exaggerated the extent of his condition to a degree.' Lorains, of Liverton Mines, east Cleveland, pleaded guilty to failing to notify a change of circumstances at an earlier hearing. Yesterday, he was given a four-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, after Judge Crowson heard he was a carer for his wife who has arthritis. Miss Pawson told the judge: 'If he goes to prison today, his wife will suffer dramatically. While he deserves to be punished, she clearly does not. 'An immediate custodial sentence would have significant negative consequences upon Mr Lorains and in likelihood create more difficulties for him. 'He has been an upstanding member of the community. Prior to the onset of rheumatoid arthritis, he was a very active sportsman. He describes cricket as his life and soul.' He was given a four-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, after Judge Crowson heard he was a carer for his wife who has arthritis . On his application form, he said he was constantly in pain, was slow at walking, and needed assistance to wash and go to the toilet . Judge Crowson told grandfather Lorains: 'You have had a good life as a volunteer, helping young cricketers and boxers and doing a lot of work for others. 'You realised you were not as poorly any more and allowed them to pay out more than you were entitled to. 'It is an unhappy situation that once the mis-statement has been made it can be forgotten and the money received, and it’s not really harming anyone, but the reality is it is harming us all.' Speaking after the case, James Blake, Department of Work and Pensions fraud investigator, said benefit cheats needed to know that fraud investigators were targeting them. 'We use data matching, act on tip-offs and if we need clear evidence on film we will use the latest covert technology to get it,' he said. 'In this case the defendant was filmed playing cricket, but we are able to track fraudsters in a variety of situations and circumstances, as well as following people from home to work and back again.'","Stewart Lorains 'suffered diabetes, asthma and psoriatic arthropathy'

The identity of the man who buried a mysterious message in a bottle in a cathedral 100 years ago was today revealed as a local stonemason. Teresa Armatage, 78, has learned it was her grandfather, William Raybole, who had penned an intriguing note in Durham Cathedral, saying: ‘This grave was opened on Sunday May 11th 1913’. The revelation came after experts carried out a delicate operation under the media spotlight to ease the message from the bottle last Friday, as reported by MailOnline. Uncovered: William Raybole, who was today revealed as the person behind the well-preserved message in a bottle at Durham Cathedral, is pictured (left) in his military uniform and (right) walking with his wife Harriett . Discovery: Mr Raybole penned an intriguing note, saying: 'This grave was opened on Sunday May 11th 1913' The glass vessel was unearthed days earlier by stonemason Steve Mann while relaying the flagstones near the Venerable Bede in the cathedral’s 12th century Galilee Chapel. A faded note, written on the back of a theatre advert, carried the names Mr W Raybole, Mr W Carter and Mr G Yeoman, bracketed together with the word 'Grave' and what appears to be a capital 'D'. Mrs Armatage said: ‘It was really emotional when I learned it was his name on the paper. We all knew him as Grandpops. He served for many years as a stonemason at the cathedral. ‘I don’t know why he would have written the note. They had probably opened a grave by mistake while carrying out work and left the message as a way of easing their consciences. Exciting find: The glass vessel was unearthed days earlier by stonemason Steve Mann while relaying the flagstones near the Venerable Bede in the cathedral's 12th century Galilee Chapel . Picture perfect: Local Stonemason Mr Raybole had penned an intriguing note in Durham Cathedral (pictured) ‘I recognise the handwriting, as well. It is almost identical to that of my father and his son, Jack Raybole.’ 'It was really emotional when I learned it was his name on the paper. I recognise the handwriting, as well' Teresa Armatage, granddaughter . Mrs Armatage, of High Pittington, near Durham, said Mr Raybole had been involved in the historic exhumation of the remains of St Cuthbert in 1899, before they were reburied in their present place. Mr Raybole was badly injured during a raid on Sunderland while serving with 9th Battalion The Durham Light Infantry. Mrs Armatage said: ‘He ended up having to have his leg amputated and was fitted with a wooden leg. ‘The cathedral was extremely kind to him and the Durham Dene and Chapter Library gave him a job. He worked there until he was 80 and was a familiar sight in Durham. Advert: Before it was opened, the only clue to what lay within was the words 'Globe Theatre', visible on the paper's letterhead. It was advertising a production of English dance and folk songsin London's West End . ‘He would come out of his house in Gilesgate and walk to the old drill hall, where he would rest before going to the Market Place. He would rest again before making the final climb to the cathedral.’ 'It was a delicate operation easing it out little by little' Bob Elsey, conservator . Mrs Armatage added: ‘It would be fascinating to find out who the other men were. Perhaps they also have family still living in the area.’ Before it was opened, the only clue to what lay within was the words 'Globe Theatre', visible on the paper's letterhead. The bottle was handed over to Durham University conservator Liz Brannigan, who looked on as freelance conservator Bob Elsey gently prised the cork out under a microscope last week. Century old: Stonemason Steve Mann holds the bottle, which was handed over to conservator Liz Brannigan . Mr Elsey said: 'After five minutes the cork it started to loosen.

'They had probably opened a grave by mistake while carrying out work and left the message as a way of easing their consciences' Teresa Armatage, granddaughter . A theatre advert - believed to be the closest piece of paper to hand when the note was made - was for a production of English dance and folk songs at the Globe Theatre, in London’s West End. Cathedral archaeologist Norman Emery said: 'The interesting thing to the advert is that it refers to the sole lessee of the Globe Theatre as Charles Frohman, the American impresario of the day. Frohman produced J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan.' The Globe was renamed the Gielgud Theatre in 1994 and is located on Shaftesbury Avenue.","Teresa Armatage, 78, learned man was her grandfather, William Raybole .

Bond: Toby Hart, 16, and his 11-year-old brother Stephen, whom he was trying to protect when he fell to his death . A 16-year-old plunged 60ft to his death from cliffs while trying to protect his younger brother who has special needs, an inquest heard. Toby Hart slipped off the precipice while making sure his 11-year-old vulnerable sibling Stephen was not too close to the edge. Toby and Stephen and Toby’s friend Jamie had gone rock climbing and scaled the top of a 60ft cliff while the rest of the family stayed on the beach. They were walking along the top where Toby flanked his brother so he did not get to close to the edge in Cadgwith, on the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall. Toby and Jamie had been friends since birth and had always walked either side of Stephen to ensure his safety. But Toby lost his footing and fell 60ft onto rocks - on the beach where his parents were sat enjoying a holiday, an inquest in Truro, Cornwall, heard. Speaking after the inquest, their devastated father Graham, 50, a Volkswagen franchise manager, said: ‘He had a fantastic personality and everyone loved him. ‘We will remember him for his cheeky smile and a great outlook on life. ‘Toby and Jamie have always been very close. They would always keep Stephen in between them to ensure his safety, even if that was just walking down a path. ‘The fact that Toby died when trying to protect and ensure the safety of his little brother sums him up well - he was extremely caring.’ Risk: The Todden in Cadgwith in Cornwall, where Toby Hart had a fatal fall while his mother and father sat on the beach . The family were enjoying the second day of a week-long holiday with his family and best friend, when the incident happened just days before his 17th birthday. Kind Toby, from Lowton in Cheshire, had climbed the Todden, a mass of land which separates two beaches, with his brother and pal. But a piece of grass gave way and Toby fell and his father Graham ran across the beach to find his son wedged between two boulders after his fall on July 22 last year. Accident: Tragically Toby lost his footing on The Todden, a mass of land that separates two beaches . Witness Phillipa Sharp, an off-duty nurse who was visiting Cadgwith, told the inquest she saw the three boys about one metre from the edge of the cliff. She said: ‘I glanced up again to see that one of them had slipped. His arms were failing. He struck the cliff twice before cartwheeling through the air.’ Phillipa ran to the scene and tried to resuscitate Toby while others called the emergency services. He was taken to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro by air ambulance where he died later that day from head injuries. Remembered: The community of Cadgwith organised for a bench to be placed on the Todden in his memory . Cornwall Coroner Emma Carlyon recorded a verdict of accidental death at Truro City Hall in Cornwall on Monday. Toby’s parents said there were no warning signs about the dangers of the cliff, but they did not believe that would have prevented his death. At the age of 14, kind Toby told his parents he wished to register as a organ donor. Only a few hours after his death, his heartbroken parents agreed to donate his organs, which have since helped to save four lives. The community of Cadgwith organised for a bench to be placed on the Todden in his memory. The plaque on the bench reads: ‘Toby’s bench. Sit here and smile, he was having fun. In memory of Toby Hart, aged 16.’ Jamie used his passion for cars and got a job at Honda as a car sales executive in the months before his death. He had also recently taken as a shop assistant at Topman. Graham said: ‘He was car mad and was excelling in his new job. He also loved football and supported Liverpool like his granddad.’ Since his death, his parents have set up a charity called ‘Toby’s gift’, which they have used to promote awareness for organ donation and raise funds for cystic fibrosis, a disorder in which a friend of Toby’s suffers from and a disease he took great interest in.

A crucial plot point in the finale of Breaking Bad was inspired by a 16-year-old fan of the show who died from a rare form of cancer before he ever got to see Sunday evening’s finale. Kevin Cordasco died from neuroblastoma earlier this year after fighting the rare form of brain cancer for seven years. A massive fan of the show, Cordasco got to meet Bryan Cranston, who plays Walter White, after a friend of his mom contacted the actor. Scroll down for video... Touching tribute: Super fan Kevin Cordasco, who died from cancer earlier this year, helped to influence how the show ends . Breaking Bad, the story of a struggling high school chemistry teacher who becomes a drug dealer, ends on Sunday after five seasons . Cranston visited Cordasco in hospital last September and recalls how impressed he was by the teenager’s devotion to the show. ‘Bright, personable, and knowledgeable, he wasn’t just a fan, he was into the structure of the story, the complexity,’ Cranston told Forbes. The show’s creator Vince Gilligan also visited Cordasco last October - giving him Danny Trejo’s severed head as a keepsake - he too was impressed by Cordasco’s devotion to the show. ‘I think he was our number one fan ever for Breaking Bad,’ Gilligan said. ‘He was so smart and astute about the show.’ Super-fan Kevin Cordasco had said that he wanted to know more about two secondary characters Gretchen and Elliott, pictured, before the show ended . Sadly plans to fly Cordasco to Albuquerque to film a cameo never happened because of his declining health, although he did visit the writer’s room in Los Angeles and once again he left a lasting impression on the people who make the show. ‘I was so happy to meet him,’ said writer-producer Tom Schnauz. ‘He was such a smart, kid so full of life. We got to hang out in the writer’s room and joke and have a good time.’ When Gilligan met Cordasco he had asked him what he’d like to see on show. ‘I came back and reported [what he said] to the writer’s room, and it colored our perception of the show. We added something to these final eight episodes that we wouldn’t have otherwise if Kevin hadn’t mentioned that,’ he recently recalled on the show's Insider Podcast. Cordasco told Gilligan that he wanted to know more about two secondary characters - Gretchen and Elliott - who had appeared near the start of the show.

Then years later Grey Matter had grown into a $2 billion dollar tech company, while White was a struggling school teacher who had just learned he had cancer. When Gretchen and Elliott offered to pay for Walt’s cancer treatment, he and instead decided to cook meth to pay for his treatment. Despite being just 16-years-old, Cordasco was intrigued by the impact that White’s relationship with Gretchen and Elliott had had on the rest of his life. As a tribute to the teenager who died from cancer earlier this year, the first episode of the final eight had been dedicated to 'Our Friend Kevin Cordasco' Kevin Cordasco meets President George W. Bush in April 4, 2007, after a fundraising stop in Los Angeles . The teenager’s interest in the secondary characters prompted Gilligan to speak with the writers about how they could be re-introduced at the story at the end. Gilligan also offered to tell Cordasco how the series ended, but the teenager said he would prefer to watch.Sadly that wasn’t to be as he died on March 11. As a tribute to him, the first episode of the final eight had been dedicated to ‘Our Friend Kevin Cordasco.’ Kevin's mother, Melodie said that her son would have been overjoyed at the acknowledgement. She said: 'It was just heartwarming; I know my son was sitting there, watching it (saying) ''Mom, Look, I made it."" It was overwhelming - the feeling, the love and support.'

Now research has shown we become comfortable with our personal style only at the age of 33. Before then, a lack of confidence or even trying too hard means many of us end up wearing clothes we will regret. The study by M&S and Oxfam’s Shwopping Initiative shows women are least confident in their fashion choices aged 24. It proved that inexperience led to fashion faux pas, with 40per cent saying they made most of their fashion blunders as teenagers.

And even with a strong sense of personal style, only 38per cent of us like and wear half the clothes in our wardrobe. Rather than buying selectively, 48per cent sad they regret buying items of clothes just one week after they take them home.

Samantha Lewthwaite, of Aylesbury, is seen in a newly-released photo from her school days . A former classmate of 'White Widow' Samantha Lewthwaite said she became obsessed with Islam as a teenager at school. The unnamed classmate alleged that 29-year-old Lewthwaite - who is rumoured to have had a . hand in the terrorist attacks on the Westgate mall in Kenya - was known . to be fixated on the religion even as a pupil. It also emerged today that neighbours have said her father is appalled by the idea that his daughter may have masterminded the massacre. Former soldier Andy Lewthwaite came face to face with the toll of terror attacks when he served in Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles in the 1970s. Now he is struggling to come to terms with allegations that his daughter - already the world's most wanted woman - was behind the attack that has killed more than 60 people in Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi. A neighbour told the Daily Mirror: 'Andy is aware of how appalling indiscriminate shootings are. For him to imagine his own daughter is involved in this is very painful. 'He has been very dignified... his daughter is apparently tarnishing both his reputation and his country's reputation.' Although there is . no evidence which proves Lewthwaite was involved in the horrific attacks . in Nairobi which left dozens dead, Kenya's foreign . minister has said a British woman was among the Islamist assailants. And . yesterday a woman who was inside the shopping centre said she locked . eyes with an AK-47-wielding ‘pale-skinned woman’ with long dark hair – . the same as British Muslim convert Lewthwaite – as she opened fire from a . balcony. Amazingly, the woman, who gave her name only as Caroline, escaped unharmed as Islamists stormed the Westgate shopping centre. Enthusiast: Now schoolmates from Buckinghamshire have said Lewthwaite was involved with Islam in her schooldays . She . said: ‘She was high up but not far from me, close enough that I saw her . looking along the floor where I was until she saw me. ‘She stopped and aimed at me and then opened fire. All of the bullets did not hit me, I don’t know how that happened. ‘She . stopped firing at me for a moment and looked away and I jumped up and . ran around a corner and that’s how I escaped. ‘She had . pale skin and long black hair, and was wearing a baggy black top. I . can’t remember very much, but I remember she had pale skin.’ A . senior Kenyan anti-terror officer last night revealed that police had . received many witness accounts of a female attacker resembling the widow . of 7/7 bomber Jermaine Lindsay. He added: ‘We believe that she . was involved in the attack. We cannot doubt the eyewitnesses who say . they saw her commanding the attackers.’ Kenya foreign minister Amina Mohamed added: ‘The Briton was a woman... who has done this many times before.’ Terrorist attack: Smoke rises from the Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi, Kenya. Gunshots rang out from the upscale mall this morning, the day after the president declared an end to a four-day siege by Islamic militants . A . Twitter account thought to belong to the militant group al-Shabaab, . which tweeted their cruel attack, also claimed that Lewthwaite . ‘commanded’ the attack. A post said: ‘We have . received permission to disclose the involvement of Samantha Lewthwaite . aka sherafiyah [her Islamic name], she successfully overseered [sic] the . mission.’ British security officials say they have yet to . receive confirmation from the Kenyan authorities of Lewthwaite’s role in . the attack, but they would not be ‘entirely surprised’ if she is . involved. The classmate, who knew Lewthwaite in her days at The . Grange School in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, in the late 1990s said she was a model . student who was popular with teachers.

Men may believe that whizzing around in an expensive set of wheels is the way to a woman's heart, but they couldn't be more wrong. The stereotype that women are turned on by flashy cars is in tatters as new research has shown that, while 48 per cent of men are convinced an expensive car makes them more attractive to the opposite sex, women actually labelled drivers of expensive sports cars as arrogant, self-centred and dangerous. New research aimed to establish whether the type of car you drive actually does influence perceptions - and the results could make you think twice before buying your next car. Sorry, Lewis Hamilton! Women label drivers of sports cars as 'arrogant, self-centred and dangerous' While men might believe a sports car gives them the edge, women overwhelmingly associated the drivers of these cars with more negative personality traits. Meanwhile, men tended to most associate negative personality traits with drivers of 4x4s, viewing owners of these vehicles as arrogant, rude, and self-centred. By comparison, women felt that saloon drivers (like Ford Mondeo, Renault Megane, VW Passsat) were likely to be hard working and safe drivers, while hatchback drivers were seen as being modest. Both sexes attributed the most positive personality types with eco- car drivers (such as Nissan Leaf, Toyota Prius), naming them as the most likely to be conscientious, intelligent and also the safest drivers on the road. Despite being one of the most difficult colours to keep clean, the research found that black is the car colour that is most likely to turn someone’s head. Not so fast! While men might believe a sports car gives them the edge, women overwhelmingly associated the drivers of these cars with more negative personality traits and prefer those who drive eco-friendly cars . The research suggests that the perfect car for a man looking to attract a partner would be a black eco-car, such as a Toyota Prius or Nissan Leaf. Phill Jones, a spokesman for Motors.co.uk, who carried out the research, said: 'Our survey provided an interesting snapshot into how people perceive car drivers, with the bad boy sports car stereotype still holding true. 'The disparity between men and women suggests that the yummy mummy “Chelsea tractor” stereotype might be having a similar effect on men as sports cars appear to be having on women. 'While there is no doubt that owning the Batmobile or a Back to the Future Delorean would be a conversation starter if you’re looking to meet new people, in reality the car we buy is likely to make us feel more confident rather than make other people find us more attractive.'

Gary Hake, 35, discovered he could dribble tea out of a hole in his chin after cutting it during a game of football . As a keen footballer, it is no surprise that Gary Hake is good at dribbling - but not in quite the way you might imagine. When the burly teacher cut his chin during a football game, it reopened an old wound and, as he sat in hospital waiting to be patched up, he discovered he could dribble tea out of the hole. Rather than chasing the doctors to take a look at him, the 35-year-old from Chatham, Kent, decided to video his unusual new trick, before posting the horrifying footage online. Mr Hake, a father of two, was hit in the face as he jumped for a header during a game with his team, Sheppey and Sheerness United FC, on Saturday. He said: 'I remember jumping up for a header and then I’m not entirely sure what happened. 'I don’t know if it was an elbow or what but the next thing I remember is coming down in a bit of a daze with blood everywhere.' The accident reopened an old wound, but Mr Hake plugged the bleeding hole below his lip with Vaseline and played on for 10 minutes before he was taken to Sheppey Community Hospital. Waiting to be seen, he discovered he could spurt tea from the hole, and asked his niece to film it on her mobile phone. She then posted the gruesome footage on Facebook. Mr Hake said: 'The accident opened up a wound from about nine years ago, although this time itw as a lot worse. 'When I did it nine years ago, I thought about doing the thing with the tea then, so this time I thought I’m not going to miss the opportunity to do it this time. 'I didn’t hurt. I think it helped clean it out a bit.' Mr Hake, who had two stitches to the wound, retired from football last year after 30 years of games but was persuaded to sign up again at the start of the season.

Dr Tim Hands says parents being made to feel it is morally wrong to send children to private schools . Parents are being made to feel it is morally wrong to send their children to private school, according to a leading headteacher. Dr Tim Hands, Master of Magdalen College School in Oxford, said there is a view that being privately educated is damaging to a child, and that . youngsters are at risk of becoming social lepers. He said: 'We . are asked to believe that our schools induce a new kind of social . leprosy, with one politician recently arguing that attendance at an . independent school was ""seriously disabling"".' Dr Hands, who is this year’s chairman of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC), suggested it was 'illogical' that buying a house, car or holiday can be seen as acceptable but paying to educate a youngster privately is not. He also warned that government education reforms over the last 50 years have put academic success over children’s happiness. He said that in the last few decades people have become 'more bothered' about private education, and this has been fuelled by the attitudes of politicians. 'Making the journey to independent education, parents are currently made to feel, is an unacceptable mobility: expenditure on purchase of a car, holiday or house is moral; expenditure on the education of the child is not,' he said. 'The illogicality is clear. Why should those members of the public who so value education find that those responsible for publicly funded education do not value them?' In a speech to the HMC’s annual meeting in central London, Dr Hands said in 2005 then Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke about how parents could transform their child’s education. The headteacher said some private schools like Christ's Hospital in Horsham (pictured) have a diverse pupil base where the majority receive bursaries and only a few students pay the full fees . 'Examples included moving house in . order to access a better school and employing a personal tutor - one . quarter of all parents in London pay for private tuition in the course . of their child’s school career,' he said . 'Moral . opprobrium attached to neither of these, though the latter is of course . paying for a private education, and the former is not social but . postcode mobility, potentially productive of social division.' Dr Hands suggested that in some cases, state schools are more exclusive than private schools. He cited The London Oratory School, a state Catholic secondary school, claiming that only a small percentage of its pupils are eligible for free lunches - a key measure of poverty - and that it had been reported that houses nearby were on sale for millions of pounds. Former Labour schools minister Lord Adonis said parents who send children to private schools are buying a 'high quality academic education' At the other end of the scale Christ’s . Hospital, a fee-paying school in Horsham, West Sussex, the majority of . pupils receive bursaries and few pay the full fees. Ahead of his speech, Dr Hands said: 'My . feeling is as a parent that over the decades people have come to feel . more bothered about the concept of private education, and that has been . politically fuelled.' Earlier this year, Lord Adonis, who served as a schools minister under the last Labour government, said that parents who send their children to private school are buying a 'high quality academic education'. But he added that it can be 'seriously disabling for students going to exclusive fee-paying schools that they see so little of society while they are at those schools.' Dr Hands said: 'Our schools are not marooned on islands of privilege; they are instead preventing our island from being marooned. It is not our schools that are splendidly isolated but our politicians.' He also used his speech children have been 'neglected' by government education policy in the last half century. 'The story of the last 50 years is the intrusion of Government and the disappearance of the child. 'More radically put, it is by extension the intrusion of the state, and the disappearance of love,' he said.","Dr Tim Hands said there is a view that private education damages children .

"By . Becky Barrow . PUBLISHED: . 19:21 EST, 30 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:55 EST, 1 October 2013 . Prudent savers have been hit by a ‘catastrophic’ fall in interest rates over the past year with accounts paying an average of just 0.44 per cent. Many homeowners are benefiting from low interest rates, but a Bank of England report yesterday laid bare the pain being inflicted on Britain’s savers. With a nest egg of £1,000, the average account would earn interest of just £4.40 a year – which would then be taxed. 'Catastrophic': Savers have been hit with a fall in interest rates, with accounts paying an average of 0.44 per cent . But homeowners are being offered the cheapest loan deals since records began in 1998. The average two-year fixed-rate deal for a person with a 25 per cent deposit charges 2.56 per cent. Last August, homeowners were typically being charged 3.69 per cent, which means they are saving £89 on the monthly repayments for a £150,000 loan. Savings groups blame the Funding For Lending scheme, launched in August 2012, which let banks borrow cheaply from the Bank of England, rather than encourage savers to make deposits. Banks can borrow an unlimited amount at as little as 0.25 per cent interest as long as they maintain, or increase, lending to individuals and businesses. A report, from financial data firm Moneyfacts, warns the interest on fixed-rate bonds, dubbed the ‘darling of the savings market’, has also collapsed. Sylvia Waycot, from Moneyfacts, said it took just a month from launch for Funding For Lending to devastate the market. She added: ‘Anyone opting for an easy life by just rolling the bond into another term may have a shock when they get their interest due to the catastrophic fall in rates.’ In September 2008, a £10,000 five-year fixed-rate bond typically paid 5.17 per cent, equal to total interest of £2,866. Five years later, the average is 2.28 per cent, giving just £1,193 – less than half the gain from the 2008 deal. Saving: Homeowners, however, are being offered the cheapest loan deals since records began . Simon Rose, from the campaign group Save Our Savers, said: ‘Prudent savers who have put money by, often for their retirement, are having the rug pulled out from under them. ‘Every day we hear from people who rely on their savings who are in despair at their increasingly precarious situation.’ Since January, there have been 1,181 cuts in interest rates, but only 52 rate increases, according to the group Savings Champion. It counted the rate cuts on all variable-rate accounts, including tax-free cash ISAs. Anna Bowes, of Savings Champion, said: ‘Savers have been hammered this year. How much more pain can savers endure?’ The news comes as it emerged that three million Britons borrowed money in July to pay for food. A report by the Debt Advisory Centre said around 2.5million people also borrowed to pay their energy or water bill. Figures also show that Britons borrowed £8.4billion on their credit cards last month, the most since records began.","Savers earning just £4.40 on nest egg of £1,000, while homeowners saving £89 for monthly repayments on £150,000 .

A United Airlines flight had to be diverted after its '300lb' captain suffered a fatal heart attack late Thursday night, forcing an off-duty pilot to take over control of the plane. The Seattle-bound flight 1603 from Houston had to make an emergency landing in Boise airport with the help of an off-duty pilot - who just happened to be a passenger on the plane - while others stepped in to help a doctor performing CPR. Captain Henry Rockwell Skillern, of Humble, Texas was still alive when he arrived at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center but later died, spokeswoman Jennifer Krajnik said on Friday. Sad passing: Captain Henry Skillern, 63, was identified as the United Airlines pilot who died from a heart attack mid-flight . Emergency: A Seattle-bound United Airlines flight had to be diverted to Boise airport after its captain suffered a fatal heart attack last night . Passenger Ken Martin told Seattle TV . station KOMO that a first-year resident doctor sitting next to him . volunteered to help perform CPR. She was one of two Army radiology residents on the flight who tried to save the captain. She told Martin the pilot appeared to . weigh over 300lbs and was taken from the cockpit into the first . class cabin where the CPR was performed. Globe-trotter: Skillern, better known to his loved ones as 'Rocky,' married 49-year-old Miranda Moris in September 2007 and lived for a time in Mexico . She was visibly upset, Martin told KOMO, when she returned to her seat as they could not revive him. Two Madigan . Army Medical Center doctors onboard performed CPR, according to Jay Ebbeson, a . spokesman for the hospital at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. Ebberson said the two are captains and radiology residents who were . returning to the base near Tacoma, Wash., from a medical course at Fort Sam . Houston in San Antonio. As the medical emergency unfolded somewhere in the skies between Houston and Seattle, the plane's first officer gave air traffic controllers an update on the situation. ‘We got a man down, chest compressions going on right now,’ the crew member said over the radio. ‘I'm not sure too much right now on status.’ United Airlines spokeswoman Christen David said another off-duty United Airlines pilot was onboard and helped land the plane. Despite the emergency, passenger Bryant Magill described a calm scene on-board. 'I'm really impressed with all the . flight attendants,' Magill told KOMO. 'They kept themselves calm. They . kept it professional. There was no panic on the plane.' 'I am sad to confirm that our . co-worker passed away last night. Our thoughts are with his family at . this time,' Miss David said in an email. The coroner indicated that Mr Skillern died from an acute myocardial infraction and listed the cause of death as natural, the station KBOI2 reported. Another off-duty United pilot was onboard and helped land the plane, David said. Pilots are required to get medical . certificates that show they don't have major heart problems, according . to the Federal Aviation Administration website. In 2007, the mandatory pilot retirement age was raised from 60 to 65. Emergency: There were 161 passengers and six crew members on board United Airlines Flight 1603 on Thursday night who departed Boise Airport for Seattle just before midnight .

Prince Harry did it with his 'bad taste' Nazi costume, Princess Beatrice did it with her 'Pretzel hat' at William and Catherine's wedding. Now Prince Edward has become the latest royal to cause controversy with his choice of clothing after wearing a tie that 'symbolises the barbaric sport' of bullfighting - according to animal rights campaigners. The League Against Cruel Sports, which campaigns against violent sports such as bullfighting, shooting and fox hunting, said it was 'disappointed' to see the Earl of Wessex wearing the tie patterned with matadors when he opened Liverpool's new Central Library earlier this year. Faux pas: The matador tie worn by Prince Edward has caused offence among animal rights campaigners . Attention was drawn away from the £55million library - which had just been through a three-year  refurbishment - and to the item of clothing knotted about the neck of the eighth in line to the throne. The offending article was spotted by several people who turned up to see the event, several of whom were not impressed the Prince's choice of attire. One member of the public who was at the event said: 'It was very inappropriate for a member of the Royal family to wear a tie like that. 'I had to look closely, I couldn't believe he was wearing a tie with bullfighters on it.' Official blunder: The Earl of Wessex wore the tie when he opened Liverpool Central Library . Bullfighting is a traditional blood sport in many countries, including Spain, Portugal, the Philippines, some Hispanic countries and the south of France. Animal cruelty campaigners object to the suffering and killing of the bulls for entertainment purposes. Bullfighting has been banned in many places - most recently in Catalonia, where a bill forbidding the sport came into effect in 2012. But supporters of bullfights say it is a culturally important tradition, and movements to revoke the Catalonian ban often appear before the Spanish congress. The League Against Cruel Sports campaigns to stop bullfighting and all other cruel fiesta events involving animals. These include the Pamplona Bull Run - when dozens of bulls are chased through the streets of the Spanish city of Pamplona - and the Toro del Fuego - a Spanish custom involving setting a bull's horns alight and allowing it to run through the streets. A spokesperson from League said: 'Bullfighting is an incredibly cruel and outdated spectacle. 'We are very disappointed to see such an influential public figure wearing an item of clothing that symbolises the barbaric bloodsport.'

A former mayor has been cleared of committing a sex act while sunbathing naked but is still banned from going into his garden without clothes on. Keith Brookes, 67, was cleared of committing a sex act in front of other people and children when he was spotted by a neighbour. The former mayor of Cleethorpes has been a naturist for 30 years and regularly enjoys sunbathing in his garden while nude. But when he was accused of outraging public decency by committing a sex act he and his family found the accusations ‘devastating’ and he was subsequently suspended from the Conservative party. Councillor Brookes appeared at Grimsby Crown Court this week where Judge Tremberg said he was of ‘positive good character’ and had spent much of his adult life serving the community on a voluntary basis. She told him: ‘You took inadequate steps to ensure that you could not be seen.’ Judge Tremberg added that Councillor Brookes had been convicted of no offence and had not admitted, or been found guilty of, committing a sex act in his garden. Jeremy Evans, for the prosecution, said neighbours were holding a barbecue with friends and two children could see that Councillor Brookes was sunbathing naked in his back garden and was asleep. He was later seen by an adult looking over a fence applying sun lotion ‘but also to the area of his genitals’. ‘He accepts that he did not take all reasonable and necessary steps to ensure he wasn’t visible by others,’ he added. Caught: Mr Brookes was seen applying lotion to his private parts by someone looking over the fence . Councillor Brookes has been given a three-year restraining order, with a condition that he is banned from being in his garden unless his private parts are covered by clothes. Councillor Brookes has said he was more than happy to accept this order in a bid to resolve any difficulties. He said after the hearing: ‘I am delighted with this not guilty verdict, not only for myself and my family, but also for my Conservative colleagues, who I work with. ‘It’s clearly been a great pull on everybody’s health. This has opened the door for us to move on and get on with our lives. Relief: Mr Brookes, pictured during the election results of the . north-east Lincolnshire local elections 2012, was delighted with the verdict . ‘I would like to thank everybody, including friends, local business people and neighbours, for all their support.’ His jubilant daughter, Kate Brookes, 34, said she was ‘truly over the moon’ at the ‘fantastic’ outcome of a not guilty verdict. She said: ‘The past few weeks have been simply devastating. ‘The false accusations came as a complete shock. We are just so delighted finally to see the case not just dismissed from court, but officially closed with a ‘not guilty’ verdict. ‘To the kind and caring people who expressed their sympathy and backing following the malicious allegations- thank you. Defence solicitor Richard Hackfath said: ‘This is a case about privacy. The defendant had created what he believed to be a private space in his back garden, where he believed he was not overlooked.’ ‘He fell asleep at a time when there was no one about and, when he awoke and realised people were in the next door garden, he moved into an even more secluded position.’ ‘He is a man with almost 40 years’ public service and he has had his reputation and private life dragged into the public domain and into the gutter by a misconceived prosecution. The restraining order had been jointly drafted and agreed between the prosecution and defence ‘to calm a situation blown out of proportion’, said Mr Hackfath. ‘Mr Brookes has never broken the law in his life so it gives him no difficulty in agreeing to the order being made.’","Ex-Cleethorpes mayor Keith Brookes was cleared of committing a sex act .

But she abruptly ended the five-minute interview with Engel after he asked her about the proposal to Snowden, who fled the U.S. in May and sought refuge in Moscow airport before he was granted asylum. 'I don't want to discuss America. I'm sorry,' she said. 'I think [the interview is] done because it's not going the right way.' After she walked out the room, Engel told the Today show: 'I get the sense that somebody had told her don't go there, don't talk about this.' Chapman, the daughter of a senior KGB agent, was arrested in 2010 with nine others, accused of working for a spy ring for Russa's external intelligence agency. In the limelight: Chapman, who was deported from the U.S. in 2010, poses during Moscow Fashion Week . She pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy and was deported back to Russia in July 2010 as part of a prisoner swap. She has since become a celebrity in Russia. After her arrest, a former boyfriend leaked explicit pictures of Chapman, which led to more sultry photo shoots for magazines. She also appeared on the catwalk at Russian Fashion Week in Moscow clothed in a skin-tight leather ensemble, edited a magazine, given lectures and now runs a foundation. Snowden, who left long-term girlfriend Lindsay Mills back in Hawaii when he fled the country, was holed up in the Moscow airport for weeks before he was granted asylum there in August.","Chapman, 31, walked out of interview after being quizzed about her proposal on Twitter to NSA leaker .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 23:15 EST, 19 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:29 EST, 20 September 2013 . A former South Texas street gang member started snoring as he was lethally injected in a Texas prison. Robert Gene Garza, 30, smiled and blew a kiss to friends and relatives as they entered the death chamber. In a brief final statement, he thanked them for coming and told them he loved them. 'I know it's hard for you. It's not easy. This is a release. Y'all finally get to move on with your lives,' he said. Garza took several deep breaths as a lethal dose of pentobarbital began flowing into his arms, then began snoring. All movement stopped within less than a minute. He was pronounced dead 26 minutes later, at 8.41pm. Executed: Robert Gene Garza, 30, was killed by lethal injection on Thursday after being sentenced to death row for organizing the killing of four women in 2002 . He became the 12th condemned inmate executed this year in Texas, which carries out capital punishment more than any other state. Garza was a member of a Rio Grande Valley gang known as the Tri-City Bombers even before he was a teenager, and he told police that the 2002 shootings that lead to the deaths of four women was made under duress. But prosecutors said Garza orchestrated the gang's plan to silence the women, who Garza thought had witnessed another gang crime, and was present when several gang members opened fire on the women when they arrived at their trailer park home after work at a bar. Garza, who was arrested in late January 2003, was convicted under Texas' law of parties, which makes a non-triggerman equally culpable . 'I really didn't have anything to do with the scenario the state was providing,' Garza told The Associated Press recently from death row. 'I guess since we are gang members, they got me involved through the gang. 'I think they were just trying to close his case ... and they needed somebody.' Evidence later would show the women were killed by mistake. The gang member in the other crime never went to trial because he accepted a plea deal and prison term. Garza, who was arrested in late January 2003, was convicted under Texas' law of parties, which makes a non-triggerman equally culpable. Evidence showed Garza was a gang leader, told his companions how to do the killings, was present when the shootings took place and 'in all likelihood was a shooter but is downplaying his part,' Joseph Orendain, the Hidalgo County assistant district attorney who prosecuted him, said this week. In February, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review his case. His lawyer, Don Vernay, said appeals were exhausted. Garza filed his own last-day appeals Thursday to the high court, delaying his punishment by some two hours until the justices ruled. In his appeals, he argued that jurors should have been allowed to hear his mother’s testimony that he stayed in the gang because he feared retaliation if he quit. Garza argued the state should assure him the lethal dose of pentobarbital to be used in his punishment was chemically effective and obtained legally. Texas prison officials have said their inventory of pentobarbital is expiring this month. National record: Garza was executed at the Department of Criminal Justice Polunsky Unit in Livingston (pictured) on Thursday, making him the 12th person killed by the state in Texas this year which is the highest in the country . Concertina razor wire guards against escape from the facility, located 75 miles northeast of Houston . Glimpse of life on the inside: Death Row guard Sgt James Ludwig stands outside a cell . Garza also was charged but never tried for participating in what became known in the Rio Grande Valley as the Edinburg massacre, the January 2003 slayings of six people at a home in the city. In the case that sent him to death row, Garza was convicted of two counts of capital murder for the slayings of the four women. Evidence showed the women were living in the U.S. without legal permission just outside Donna, about 15 miles southeast of McAllen. In his statement to investigators, which Garza insisted was coerced, he said he carried out the 'hit' with three other gunmen in two vehicles who opened fire on six women in their parked car.

Teachers who set Shakespeare to hip-hop to appeal to young people was today condemned as ‘viciously racist’ by a youth mentor backed by ministers today. Education Secretary Michael Gove invited Linsday Johns to address the Tory party conference on the inane, dumbed down methods used by some schools to make the classics more relevant to young black children. Mr Johns hit out at the use of street slang, hoodies, baggy jeans and baseball caps to make English lessons ‘achingly cool’. Anger: Youth mentor Lindsay Johns used a speech to the Tory conference to condemn attempts to make literature classics cool . Mr Gove has faced criticism from some teaching unions for insisting pupils study literature classics by ‘dead white men’. But Mr Johnson backed the idea, insisting Shakespearean plays should be studied in their original form without ‘positively evil’ attempts to appeal to youth culture. He also accused opponents of Mr Gove's reforms who ‘piously’ advocate a more inclusive curriculum display ‘staggering levels of hypocrisy’ as they have often enjoyed a ‘Rolls-Royce, Oxbridge humanities education’. Mr Johns is a writer and broadcaster who runs a youth programme in Peckham, south-London. He said the ‘pernicious rush to relevance’ in classrooms was actually harming the children it is designed to help. Mr Johns told the conference in Manchester: ‘Floundering as we now are under the Sisyphean burden of political correctness, teachers are hell-bent on making everything achingly cool and hip as they think that this is the only way young people will engage and learn. Mr Johns hit out at the use of street slang, hoodies, baggy jeans and baseball caps to make English lessons 'achingly cool' ‘This obsession with relevance is not only massively condescending but it's also shooting the very people it is ostensibly setting out to help in the foot. ‘The truth is Hamlet does not need a hip-hop soundtrack for young people to enjoy it or understand it. It's been doing just fine for the last 400 years. ‘It's not only incredibly patronising but also viciously racist to think that black and brown kids in the inner cities will only get Shakespeare if it's set to a hip-hop beat and presented in three-minute MTV Base-style chunks. ‘It is positively evil to deny inner city kids access to the manifold joys of hearing their national poet's true voice, in essence their birthright, simply because of a culture of low expectations. ‘With absolutely staggering levels of hypocrisy the overwhelming majority of those who denigrate the canon and who piously advocate a more inclusive, easier, “down wiv da kids”, curriculum are often metropolitan liberals who have themselves enjoyed the massive intellectual and social benefits of a Rolls-Royce, Oxbridge humanities education, with what's more, I'll wager, absolutely no hip-hop whatsoever.’ Mr Johns said it was ‘blindingly obvious’ that an academic curriculum focused on the classics would better enable young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to achieve their potential. Black and ethnic minorities who read classic white authors should not be accused of ‘selling out’, he said. Mr Johns told the conference: ‘You can of course be fiercely proud of your Jamaican, Ghanaian or black British roots and ardently love Horace, Boccaccio and Milton. ‘The two are in no way mutually exclusive and they certainly don't make you any less black or less brown by reading them. ‘Only an intellectual amoeba would assert that studying the canon is tantamount to selling out, to being a coconut or an Uncle Tom.’ Support: Chancellor George Osborne (left) and Education Secretary Michael Gove were in the audience for Mr Johns' speech . He went on: ‘I'm so tired of the vacuous PC educationalists and the hand-wringing liberals that take great offence at Michael Gove's championing of a bunch of dead white men and what they perceive to be arcane, difficult books. Books which they claim have no relevance whatsoever to modern multicultural Britain and to the lives of Tommy, Dwayne, Abdul or Nadeen in the inner cities. ‘As any sane, sentient and intelligent person knows those doing the carping are speaking utter nonsense.’ He went on: ‘To deny kids in the inner cities access to such mind-expanding, life-affirming and potentially life-changing authors is not only undeniably selfish and wrong but is actually positively nefarious. ‘That there is a positive correlation between an academically rigorous canonical curriculum and enabling young people, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, to truly achieve their potential in a highly competitive, modern world is frankly so blindingly obvious that even Stevie Wonder could see it.’","Lindsay Johns uses speech to launch sustained attack on trendy teaching .

A mother has been accused of caring more about alcohol than the son she allegedly starved to death after she turned up to court so drunk yesterday that her manslaughter trial could not go ahead. Amanda Hutton, 43, is accused of manslaughter of her son Hamzah Khan after his mummified remains were found in his cot next to a teddy bear. Jurors heard how Hutton turned up to court so drunk on Monday morning that she was in no fit state to hear evidence and her trial had to be postponed. In court: Amanda Hutton, 43, depicted giving her evidence in this artist's impression, today denied she cared more about alcohol than the son she is accused of starving to death . Police had to escort her to Bradford Crown Court, but despite being given a morning to sober up in cells, she was still too drunk to take to the dock in the afternoon. In the witness box today, Hutton admitted she hit the bottle on Sunday night after a phone call with her ex Aftab Khan, and admitted she could not remember how much she drank. She said: 'It really rocked me. I had been coping quite well and was being strong through this trial. I did have something to drink, but I don't know how much.' Her barrister Stephen Meadowcroft QC asked her: 'Were you fit to come to court?' Hutton replied: 'In hindsight, no.' Drunk: Amanda Hutton, pictured today at Bradford Crown Court, was yesterday so drunk when she turned up to her trial for the manslaughter of her son that it couldn't go ahead . Giving evidence: Amanda Hutton, shown in the witness stand in this artist's sketch, admitted she took to the bottle on Sunday night after a phone call with her ex but said she couldn't remember how much she'd drank . Prosecutor Paul Greaney QC accused Hutton of thinking more about alcohol than Hamzah. Mr Greaney said to her: 'For a substantial period before Hamzah died, drinking was more important to you than his welfare.' Hutton replied: 'No, that's not true.' The prosecutor said: 'You cared more about alcohol than you did about that child.' The defendant said: 'Not at all.' Earlier in the hearing today, Hutton sobbed in the witness stand as she recalled how she discovered Hamzah Khan and kept his mummified remains in a cot for two years. The prosecution revealed today how Hutton went on with . her life while her son's tiny body decomposed in her bedroom because she 'cared more about alcohol than her child'. Hamzah died in December 2009 but was not found by police until September 2011, who were called after complaints from neighbours. In the dock: Amanda Hutton today described how her son Hamzah Khan died and was kept in her room for two years . Bradford Crown Court has heard that within hours of his death she . ordered a pizza and continued to claim child benefit in his name to help pay for her alcohol. Describing when he died, the 43-year-old today said she was at Morrisons supermarket when she got a . call from her grown-up son Tariq to say Hamzah's eyes were rolling back . into his head. Hutton, 43, said: 'I rushed upstairs to my bedroom and found Hamzah had passed away. 'I picked him up and checked all his pulse points and there was nothing. 'I tried to give him mouth-to-mouth but that wasn't working.' Tragedy: Amanda Hutton's four-year-old son Hamzah Khan was found dead at her home in Bradford . She said: 'I picked him up from my bed and put him over my shoulder and brown vomit came out of him, from his mouth.' Hutton said wanted to call the police but Tariq stopped her. Asked why, she said: 'I'm not sure.' Hutton was asked what she did after Hamzah died. 'I stayed in my bedroom all night with him,' she said. 'I held him for hours.' Terrible discovery: Police were called to Hutton's Bradford home and discovered her son, who had been dead for two years . Hutton, . who denies manslaughter, gave her evidence in a quiet voice, facing the . jury in a black skirt, black top and black cardigan. Hutton said she began drinking heavily after Hamzah's death. She said she slept on the sofa. Hutton said: 'I just didn't know what to do.' She agreed that she had continued to claim child benefit for Hamzah after his death. But Hutton told the jury this was because she thought questions would be asked if she stopped claiming. Father: Aftab Khan arriving at Bradford Crown Court where Hutton is charged with the manslaughter of their son, Hamzah Khan . Paul . Greaney QC, prosecuting, asked her: 'You had a four-and-a-half-year-old . child that fitted into a baby-gro for a six to nine-month-old baby, . that hadn't been eating and you didn't seek medical attention for him.' The prosecutor showed the defendant a photograph of the baby-gro Hamzah's body was found in, as he asked the question. She replied: 'No I didn't.' Mr Greaney asked her whether she thought this was a breach of the responsibility she had for her child. Hutton said she believed Hamzah would grow out of his eating problems, just like his elder brother, Qaiser, who is now an adult. Hutton . denied drinking heavily before Hamzah's death. Mr Greaney said to her: . 'For a substantial period before Hamzah died drinking was more important . to you than his welfare.' Hutton replied: 'No, that's not true.' The prosecutor said: 'You cared more about alcohol than you did about that child.' Hutton said: 'Not at all.' She denied locking Hamzah in a room in the dark as a punishment. Mr Greaney said: 'Not only did you neglect him, you abused him.' She replied: 'No, never.' Hutton also denied referring to Hamzah as a 'silly bastard'. Mr Greaney asked the defendant: 'Do you accept he died because he was malnourished?' She shook her head and said: 'Without sounding flippant, I'm not an expert. I don't know the cause.' Hutton added: 'I don't think he did. I'm not sure.' The trial continues.

British soldiers in Hellmand Province have handed a base over to Afghan forces as the native troops take on a greater role in the conflict. In a demonstration of the increasing capability and confidence of the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), the British Army has relinquished control of Patrol Base (PB) Ouellette to the Afghan National Civil Order Police (ANCOP). The base, which is situated on Route 611 in the district of Nahr-e Saraj, had been home to UK Armed Forces since July 2011. Ceremony: Joe Davies, 26, from the the Royal Regiment of Scotland, plays the bagpipes at revaille on the morning Patrol Base Ouellette in Helmand is handed over to Afghan forces . The transfer is part of an ongoing base . reduction programme which is expected to leave just four bases in . central Helmand, alongside Camp Bastion, by the end of October. The handover, which was marked by a ceremony held by Afghan officials, comes as British forces are longer needed to provide support to Afghan forces in Nahr-e Saraj . District. Security along Route 611 is now entirely conducted by the ANCOP who will keep the base as part of their force structure in the area. The road is a crucial link between . northern Helmand and the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah.  Security . along the route is vital to the freedom and safety of locals, and is key to economic development in the area. The base reductions are discussed closely with the local Afghan forces to ensure the best solution as part of the ANSF’s enduring presence in the area. Packing up: Soldiers load stores and equipment onto vehicles as they close down Patrol Base Ouellette in upper Gereshk Valley, Helmand Province, Afghanistan . Brigadier Rupert Jones, Commander Task Force Helmand, said: 'The handover of Patrol Base Ouellette is another indicator of the progress of the Afghan security forces as a whole that we have seen across central Helmand this summer. 'This progress has enabled us to reduce our forward bases one by one. 'As we come to the closing stages of what is typically the fighting season it’s a good moment to reflect on the reality that the Afghan National Security Forces have done exceptionally well. 'They have very firmly have held the momentum in Helmand over the insurgent all the way through.' An Armoured Fighting Vehicle (AFV) of the Mercian Regiment is guided into the base by a soldier . Lieutenant Colonel Jon Swift, said: 'Over the last six months we have seen a lot of development in this part of Nahr-e Saraj district. 'Until recently, this was one of the most contested areas in central Helmand. The improvement in security is, in large part, thanks to the efforts of the ANCOP to reduce the threat to locals who use the road. 'It has been pleasing to see that each time the ANCOP have developed they have taken on more responsibility for security in the area and that has led us to this stage where we can hand the base over to the Afghans as they provide security now and into the future.' Soldiers from 2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland (2 SCOTS) who make up the Police Mentoring and Advisory Group have assisted with training and advised their ANCOP counterparts at PB Ouellette throughout Operation Herrick 18, the most recent changeover of British forces. Handover: An armoured Caterpillar digger from the Royal Engineers, (RE), removes debris as part of the closure of Patrol Base Ouelette in upper Gereshk valley, Helmand Province, Afghanistan . Lieutenant Simon Wright, 2 SCOTS, said: 'Our mission was to advise, train and mentor the ANCOP and we have certainly achieved that. They’re a very tough bunch, particularly the commanders. They are not afraid to take on the insurgents.' Second Lieutenant Zahir Khan, ANCOP Platoon Commander, said: 'We really appreciate that ISAF were here to provide security when we needed it. Now that they are leaving we will do our best to continue to provide the same security as ISAF forces did. 'Before this camp was built people felt threatened by the insurgency in the area but now they are safe.' Major Steve Dallard, the officer commanding PB Ouellette, said: 'Challenges still remain for the ANSF in the area but the ANCOP here have proven themselves to be well-trained, well-resourced and well-led, and more than capable of maintaining security on Route 611. 'They have established lots of checkpoints along the Route and have a much better awareness of the local area and population than we have had.'","Soldiers relinquished control of Patrol Base Ouellette in Helmand Province .

"By . Matt West . PUBLISHED: . 06:54 EST, 23 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:22 EST, 23 June 2013 . US coffee chain Starbucks has finally paid corporation tax, for the first time since 2008. Bowing to pressure from MPs and the public late last year Starbucks agreed to pay £20million in corporation tax by 2015 and the Exchequer has now received the first £5million, the company said today. The payment comes after the coffee chain faced a wave of protest late last year and was condemned by politicians for failing to pay corporation tax for almost every year since it began operating in Britain in 1998. Starbucks’ chief financial officer Troy Alstead told the influential House of Commons Public Accounts Committee last December that the coffee shop chain had made a loss for 14 of the last 15 years, achieving only a small profit in 2006. Public outcry: Starbucks faced a wave of public protest over its failure to pay corporation tax in almost every one of the last 15 years . But he and executives from other large . corporations including Google and Amazon were branded ‘immoral’ by the . committee’s Labour chairman Margaret Hodge. Starbucks was revealed to have paid . nothing in corporation tax between 2009 and 2012, despite sales of . £400million in 2011, and had only paid £8.6million since it began trading . in the UK. Last year, Starbucks told investors its European businesses made a $40million (£26million) profit in 2011, but accounts filed for its UK, German, and French units, which make up 90 per cent of European revenues, showed a loss of $60 million (£39million) for the year to September 30 2012. This year however the European arm of the company has turned a profit. In its most recent trading update Starbucks said operating profit in Europe was $5.2million (£3.4million) for the three months to 25 April, up $12.2million (£7.9million) on an operating loss of $7million (£4.5million) for the same period a year earlier. A Starbucks spokeswoman said today: ‘Six . months ago, we felt that our customers should not have to wait for us . to become profitable before we started paying UK corporation tax. ‘We listened to our customers in . December and so decided to forgo certain deductions which would make us . liable to pay £10 million in corporation tax this year and a further £10 . million in 2014. ‘We have now paid £5 million and will pay the remaining £5 million later this year. ‘We are also undertaking measures to . make Starbucks profitable in the UK, such as relocating unprofitable . stores to more cost effective locations, closing them where that is not . possible and placing greater reliance on franchised and licensed . stores.’ Legal and fair: Starbucks' chief financial officer Troy Alstead claimed late last year that the coffee shop chain was an 'extremely high taxpayer' despite having paid no corporation tax since 2008 . Tax avoidance has become a major theme for . the Coalition Government as it has pursued a policy of austerity since . coming to power three years ago. Downing Street has previously been . criticised for lowering the top rate of income tax from 50 per cent to . 45 per cent and for imposing cuts to benefits payments while not doing . enough to close tax loopholes. Last week, Prime Minister David Cameron . announced he had secured agreement with Britain's network of overseas . territories and Crown dependencies to sign up to a new global clampdown . on tax evasion. Tax, and the use of global tax havens, . also formed one of the major themes of last week’sG8 Summit at Lough . Erne, Northern Ireland. The first payment in corporation tax to . be made by Starbucks for five years follows a fiery showdown with MPs late last year. Too little to latte: But Mr Alstead's claims drew a wave of fresh protests and led to consumers boycotting the coffee shop's stores until Starbucks eventually agreed to pay £20million in corporation tax in December . Starbucks insisted it was ‘an extremely . high taxpayer’ globally and acted ‘to an ethical’ as well as a legal . standard, despite declaring losses on its UK operation.’ Mr Alstead blamed an over-aggressive . entry to the UK market for its failure to pay corporation tax claiming . the strategy had left the coffee chain with expensive properties that . did not make money. ‘It is fundamentally true, everything we . are saying and everything we have said historically,’ he told the . committee while saying Starbucks remained committed to making profits . here. He conceded a tax deal struck with the . Dutch authorities - that he declined to detail - was ‘an attractive . reason’ for basing the coffee company's operations there. However, it later emerged the deal saw . around 6 per cent of Starbucks’ UK branch profits reduced to 4.7 per . cent in what one MP called a ‘cosmetic’ deal with the UK tax office, . before being transferred to the Netherlands holding company as a . dividend, meaning there was no profit to declare. Starbucks also charges a 20 per cent mark-up on coffee which it buys via Switzerland where it pays 12 per cent tax. ‘Respectfully, I can assure you there is no tax avoidance here,’ insisted Mr Alstead at the time. ‘We have a global tax rate of 33 per . cent around the world. Our tax rate outside the US is 21 per cent. That . is higher than most multinationals' global rate. We are an extremely . high tax payer.’","Starbucks pays £5m in corporation tax for the first time since 2008 .

George Frideric Handel’s 1727 anthem]. Alexander Macleod was originally one of the doctors funded by the Highlands and Islands Medical Service established 100 years ago. This transformed rural health provision 35 years before the establishment of the National Health Service. Before the Medical Service there had been concern about the state of medical provision in the Highlands and Islands. There . were reports of poultry buried as treatment for neurological . conditions, uncertified deaths, do-it-yourself child delivery; and a . handful of doctors and nurses to cover vast areas of the country. When doctors did arrive they did not stay long. The island of Papa Westray in Orkney had 13 doctors between 1895 and 1914. Eventually . there was sufficient public concern for a comprehensive inquiry into . healthcare provision in the Highland and Islands to be announced in . 1912. It was chaired by Sir John Dewar, Liberal MP for Inverness, and a son of the founder of Dewar’s whisky. The . Dewar committee report led to the setting up of the Highlands and . Islands Medical Service in 1913 with a Treasury grant of £42,000. Doctors . would have a basic income but could continue to treat private patients. Fees were set at minimal levels but any who could not pay were still . treated. A house, telephone, . car or motor boat and locum cover were provided. By 1929 there were 175 . nurses, one on St Kilda, and 160 doctors in 150 practices. Stornoway had its first surgeon in 1924, Wick in 1931, and Shetland and Orkney by 1934. ‘Dr . Alec was a man of great observational powers and stamina and cared for . his patients 24 hours a day through a time when most had no transport, . no telephones and no electricity, visiting on foot and sometimes on . horseback. ‘He delivered many children born on the island and had a formidable reputation as an obstetrician. ‘He . was responsible for the first air ambulance flight to the Western Isles . in the 1930s when he arranged for an aircraft to take a patient to . Glasgow who was too infirm to travel by land and sea home to Clachan in . Uist. ‘That patient was my . great uncle, Reverend Calum Gillies, and the flight is commemorated in a . memorial cairn beside the one to be unveiled to the MacLeods. ‘All the Macleods understood the true meaning of service and of supporting communities as well as individuals, something we are having to rediscover today in general practice as we try to integrate health and social care in Scotland. ‘They exemplified throughout their professional lives, the spirit of the motto of RCGP, Cum scientia caritas, or science with compassion.’ Both Alexander and John became well respected fellows of the RCGP. The Macleod family are part of the National Museum of Scotland's exhibition ‘Scotland: A Changing Nation’ which documents the doctors' lives on North Uist. Dr Gillies said: ‘Dr Alec brought me into the world. I have been a rural GP for most of my life and I have always thought the Macleod family were the epitome of health care. They were definitely role models for me.’ Mrs Macleod added: ‘My father-in-law would travel out to the surrounding islands on horse or by boat. The horse was not even his but the owners let him take it whenever he wanted and he would have to wait for the tide to go out before riding out. ‘Sometimes he an appointment went on longer than anticipated he would have to wait until the tide went back out so he could ride back to North Uist. Patience is a virtue when you live on an island. ‘The GPs on North Uist always considered the district nurses as a vital part of the ""team"". Often they were called before the doctor and especially before there were phones in the island.’","Dr Alexander Macleod and family spent 70 years caring for North Uist .

Victim: Patricia Goodband, 76, was found dumped in a 12ft deep manhole in her Buckinghamshire garden . A wealthy pensioner was allegedly murdered by the man who stood to inherit her fortune and her body dumped in the garden of her home, a court has heard. Patricia Goodband, 76, was set to leave her two properties and £230,000 to her friend of more than three decades Christopher Symons. Symons is alleged to have beaten her around the head before dumping her body at the bottom of a 12ft deep brick-lined manhole in the back garden of her home in Woodham, near Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire, in December last year. Her body had been covered with soil, stones and bags of rubbish, Reading Crown Court was told. Joanna Glynn QC, prosecuting, told the jury that Mrs Goodband was last seen alive on December 22 last year. She said that the body was found after a 'painstaking investigation' of the area surrounding her home on January 21 this year. Ms Glynn told the court that her body had been 'well concealed' in the deep shaft, which was hidden beneath a manhole cover. Only those familiar with the grounds of the property would know of its existence, the prosecutor claimed. She said: 'She had been murdered and brought there by her killer, having received extremely serious head injuries. 'Specifically, she was beaten around the head at least six times, twice around the face and four times around the back of the head. 'She had been thrown down the shaft in the most callous way you could imagine.' The jury was told Symons and Ms Goodband had been friends for 30 years before he was alleged to have killed her and together they ran a haulage and aggregate business from her home. Symons and his wife had once owned the house where Mrs Goodband lived and in 1994 she put the land surrounding the property into his joint ownership. Ms Glynn said: 'This was not a normal friendship, this was not a normal business relationship. 'Its clear Patricia Goodband during periods of the 30 years they had been friends was emotionally very attached to him.' Grim: Mrs Goodband's body was found hidden in a 12ft manhole in the garden of her home near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire . The jury was told that in 2008 she created a will in which she left two properties and all her money to Symons. Akeman House, where she lived, was worth between £550,000 pounds and £600,000 pounds at the time of her death. A second property in Edgecote, near Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, was estimated to be worth between £170,000 and £200,000 pounds. Symons would also have received the £230,000 in her bank account as part of the inheritance. Ms Glynn said that Symons had always denied that he was anything more than friends with Mrs Goodband but she said it was not important to the prosecution case. 'She had been thrown down the shaft in the most callous way you could imagine.' Joanna Glynn QC, prosecuting . Despite their close relationship, the court heard that things changed on Christmas Day, 2007, when Symons attacked Mrs Goodband. After allegedly beating her around the head it was him who called police. Officers waited for her to return from dog-walking and she told them nothing had happened. Mrs Goodband wrote in a diary entry written around the time of the incident: 'Chris snapped today. Bad night. Not a day to remember.' '(He) went wild. I got thumped aside my jaw - ear - deaf - aches. Bashed about head. Must think about future, what went wrong.' She added: 'Perhaps once again I have (unclear) my usefulness. The second bash. I will not wait for a third.' The day after the alleged incident, she wrote: 'Then had the gall to tell me to get out. Disgraceful conduct,' and she noted bruises emerging over the next days, while expressing her loneliness. Investigation: A forensics tent surrounds the manhole where Mrs Goodband's body was found in January of this year . However, on December 30 that year a diary entry stated she had spoken to Symons. She said: 'What a weight off my mind. I’m sorry, I would not have chosen this but I must adjust.' Prosecuter Ms Glynn said: 'It’s not clear what arrangement they had come to but what is clear was this was not a normal relationship.' Mrs Goodband was described as a recluse by her neighbours who disliked traveling. She worked for 10 years for a couple of retired medical professionals cleaning their home and had a reputation for being intelligent and fit and healthy. 'Its clear Patricia Goodband during periods of the 30 years they had been friends was emotionally very attached to him.' Joanna Glynn QC, prosecuting . But Symons cast doubt on this after she had disappeared, by implying to her friends that she had displayed the early signs of dementia, Ms Glynn told the court. She said this was part of his effort to lay a false trail to confuse those searching for her, to make them think she had gone to Yorkshire where her daughter Samantha lived at the time. Ms Glynn said: 'It was well known by friends and neighbours that she had fallen out with Samantha some years before, so what he devised was a trail of evidence that she had gone to stay on December 22 with somebody called Sue, who apparently lived in Stockton, and was going to take her to see Samantha. 'This was quite untrue. Patricia Goodband had no intention of going to Yorkshire.' Symons was also accused of using text messages to try to throw investigators off the scent. Two messages were sent by a phone in Mrs Goodband’s possession but registered to him, on December 18 and 22. Co-defendants: Jennifer Creasey, left, and Kathleen Adams, right, both deny perverting the course of justice . The first, sent to Symons’ phone, confirmed she had bought the train tickets for her journey to Yorkshire. Detectives discovered no tickets were ever bought. The second read: 'Please thank Bob for taking me to Milton Keynes railway station. I have arrived in Stockton safely.' Ms Glynn said mobile phone cell site analysis said in both cases the messages had been sent and received by phone masts covering Akeman House. She said it was consistent with the phones being next to each other on the same table and Symons sending them to himself to cover his tracks. She said of the second call: 'The handset was nowhere near the north of England. The one thing we can be sure of is Patricia Goodband was not in Stockton. She was almost certainly dead by that point.' The prosecution believes that Mrs Goodband died on December 22 because she and Symons visited mutual friends - Mr and Mrs Pointer - who described her as wearing the same clothes that her body was found in. Symons, 63, who appeared over video link after the jury was told he had been unwell, denies a single charge of murder. Co-defendant Kathleen Adams, 74, denies one count of perverting the course of justice and Jennifer Creasey, 73, denies two counts of perverting the course of justice. The trial continues.

The U.S. is hopeful that years of standoffs over Iran's nuclear programme are coming to an end after UN talks yesterday. Secretary of State John Kerry met one-on-one with the Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif at the end of the summit, shaking his hand and sitting beside him in the highest-level contact between the two nations for six years. However officials want the Islamic nation to draw up a detailed plan of action to reassure the world it is not secretly trying to develop an atom bomb. Scroll down for videos . After the UN summit Kerry leaned over and asked the Iranian foreign minister to talk one-on-one in the highest-level contact between the nations in six years . President Hassan Rouhani (far right) has taken to the international stage for the first time since being elected . Kerry said: 'Needless to say, one meeting and a change in tone, that was welcome, does not answer those questions. 'All of us were pleased that the foreign minister came today and that he did put some possibilities on the table.' Fresh talks will now be held on October 15-16 after the UN council's five permanent members, plus Germany, agree to fast-track negotiations. Iran is keen to win a reprieve to tough sanctions which have slashed oil exports by more than half, restricted its international bank transfers, devalued its currency and sent inflation surging. Zarif said the end result would have to include 'a total lifting' of the international sanctions, adding: 'We hope ... to make sure (there is) no concern that Iran's program is anything but peaceful.' 'Now we have to see whether we can match our positive words with serious deeds so we can move forward.' The upbeat tone comes a day after Iran’s new president, Hassan Rouhani, called on . Israel to join an international treaty banning the spread of nuclear . weapons, chiding the Jewish state for being the only Middle East nation . that has failed to do so. Rouhani faces a backlash in his country after seeming to concede that the holocaust happened in a TV interview, after eight years of denials from former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . 'Almost . four decades of international efforts to establish a nuclear . weapon-free zone in the Middle East have regrettably failed,' Mr Rouhani . told a United Nations meeting on nuclear disarmament on the sidelines . of the General Assembly. Israel is the only Middle East nation that has not signed the landmark 1979 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and Mr Rouhani said that has prevented the region from establishing a nuclear-free zone. It has never commented on suggestions it possesses a nuclear arsenal. Mr Rouhani also said all nations should be subject to International Atomic Energy Agency inspections and other nuclear safeguards. Iran insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only, and says it needs to enrich uranium to produce reactor fuel and for medical purposes. But world powers fear Iran is trying enriching uranium to higher levels which would enable it build warheads. Amir Hekmati, a joint U.S. Iranian citizen, has been in prison in Iran since 2011 after being convicted of spying . Earlier in the week Mr Rouhani said a deal over Iran's nuclear weapons should be struck with the US within three months. Mr Rouhani told the Washington Post: 'The only way forward is for a timeline to be inserted into the negotiations that's short–and wrap it up. 'That is a decision of my government, that short is necessary to settle the nuclear file. 'The shorter it is the more beneficial it is to everyone. If it's three months that would be Iran's choice, if it's six months that's still good. It's a question of months not years.' The apparent thawing of relations between America and Iran in recent weeks has seen Rouhani apparently admit that the holocaust happened in an interview broadcast on CNN. Rouhani's predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad spent years denying the holocaust as part of his rhetoric against the Jewish state of Israel, one of America's strongest Middle Eastern allies. While the new President would not be drawn on the scale or numbers invovled, he is now facing a backlash at home after a conservative news agency accused CNN of wrongly translating the remark. The improvement in relations between Iran and the West has also prompted the father of an imprisoned former U.S. Marine to beg for his son's release. Hekmati (pictured left), a former U.S. Marine, claims he was visiting the Islamic state to see his grandmother . Hekmati's father, Ali, says he has a brain tumour and wants to see his son 'one more time'. Right is a picture of Amir taken from Facebook in which he is said to be wearing a headdress for a Halloween party . Ali Hekmati is asking Rouhani to order the release of his son, Amir, as Ali is now suffering with a brain tumour and may not have long to live. In a letter, the ailing father says: 'I long more than ever to see Amir's face. I am now very sick. 'I ask that you let me see him again, one more time, and so that he may lead our family when I am gone. 'Amir is a good man. An honorable man. He is not a spy, I can assure you of that.' Amir Hekmati, who has dual U.S. and Iranian citizenship, was arrested in Iran in 2011. The family claim he was visiting his grandmother but the Islamic state accused him of being a CIA spy and convicted him. A short while later a video was released showing Amir 'confessing' to his crimes. Amir's father has reason to be hopeful after Iran freed dozens of political prisoners last week, just as Rouhani was headed to New York for the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. Earlier this month, Amir wrote a letter to US Secretary of Sate John Kerry describing his 'miserable prison conditions' and his belief that Tehran wanted to use him in a possible prisoner exchange. Hekmati's letter was smuggled out of prison and his sister authenticated the handwriting. The State Department said it was trying to determine Hekmati's condition through Swiss diplomats in Tehran. The Swiss represent U.S. interests in Iran because no U.S. officials are based there. The two countries severed diplomatic relations in 1979. Two other American citizens are believed to be detained in Iran: Retired FBI agent Robert Levinson and Christian pastor Saeed Abedini. The release of prisoners and the softening on nuclear talks are part of a fresh charm offensive by Iran following years of icy relations under the former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. As a condition of any deal Iran has said it will agree to international inspections along the lines of those between 2003 and 2005 and has not ruled out a meeting with Barack Obama. Rouhani added: 'If Mr Obama and I were to get together, we would both be looking at the . future, and the prospects ahead and our hopes for that future. 'The notes and . letters and exchanges between us are in that direction, and they will . continue. We need a beginning point. I think that is the nuclear issue.'","John Kerry spoke one-on-one with Iran's foreign minister Mohammad Zarif .

Jailed: Janet Cooper has been jailed for eight years after masterminding a £1m scam through her position as a town council clerk . A former town council clerk who masterminded a £1million scam from her office has been jailed for eight years. Janet Cooper spent the money on Mediterranean cruises, holidays with her husband in Devon, a £21,000 car and a box for council staff for a match at West Ham United. When the scale of her offending was uncovered she claimed to be blind and said she had no memory of events. The convicted fraudster - once the subject of a Channel 4 documentary - also carried a white stick and wore black glasses. After the hearing at Sheffield Crown Court, investigating officer Detective Sergeant Stuart Hall said: 'There is no medical evidence to substantiate her blindness or memory loss.' Cooper was clerk at Brierley Town Council, near Barnsley, for three years. From the beginning of her time at the council she began pocketing a total of £295,000, which she siphoned off from £695,000 public works loans she dishonestly obtained. She used the money to go on holiday, buy a new Volvo and offered £375,000 cash on a four-bedroom bungalow, as well as spending £3,500 for a box at West Ham for council staff to see Barnsley play. She also claimed she was a Channel swimmer and collected sponsorship money. Sentencing her today to eight years in jail Judge Peter Kelson called Cooper 'pathologically dishonest'. She had previously been jailed for 15 months at Basildon Crown Court in 1999 for theft and false accounting and again, in September, 2003 for three years at Leicester for stealing £800,000 from her then employer. On her release she lied on her application form and got her £20,000-a-year job at Brierley Town Council. Her crimes were only uncovered when she went into hospital for a brain tumour operation and a replacement finance officer began investigating. Four council jobs had to be axed, services cut and 5,000 council taxpayers faced increased charges as a result of her offending. Sentence: Jailing her for eight years at Sheffield Crown Court (pictured) Judge Peter Kelson described Cooper as 'pathologically dishonest' The town council is now £1.3 million in debt and has had to take out a £480,000 emergency Government-sanctioned loan to pay recurring annual loan charges of £44,000. It is estimated the current case has cost the state £100,000 in court costs, the police £75,000 to investigate and another £25,000 for the finance officer. Cooper staged the fraud by forging councillors’ signatures on documents and falsifying the minutes of council meetings to apply for loans. 'The dishonesty involved was persistent . at a time when many in this country are thankful for a job. Your salary . wasn’t enough for you and so you deceived your employers in a . sophisticated and complex way' - Judge Peter Kelson . None of the councillors or other officials had any knowledge of her offending. She changed her plea to guilty to four counts of fraud and one of theft on the second day of her trial after the prosecution opened the case. The jury was discharged after returning formal guilty verdicts. Her only defence was loss of memory but Ian Goldsack, prosecuting, told the court that a number of specialists had examined her and 'there were doubts to say the least about the truthfulness of her medical condition'. Cooper, 51, from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, admitted dishonestly abusing her position as council clerk by obtaining loans of £350,000, £152,500 and £66,000 from the Public Works Loan Board and a further loan of £127,000 without authority in 2008 and 2009. She also admitted theft of £295,296 belonging to Brierley Town Council between November 1, 2006, when she first started and when her service effectively ended on December 31, 2009. Cooper maintained they were grants but in fact they were loans, said Mr Goldsack, which had serious consequences for the council. 'It has meant significant cuts to services and people losing their jobs and an increase in taxes payable by the local community to try and cover the costs,' he said. Cheques totaling nearly £300,000 were either drawn or transferred from the council’s bank accounts by Cooper in her own name or that of her husband. She also falsified a large number of invoices, some from companies which had never traded with the council. 'When the investigation was underway she has maintained that she has lost her eyesight and she has lost her memory,' said Mr Goldsack. Former Mayor of Brierley Patrick Doyle said in a statement that it had been a disaster for the council in a disadvantaged area. 'Everyone in the community is a victim of this situation for at least the next 20 years,' he said. Her barrister Andrew Smith said: 'This is a lady with complex psychological and personality issues.' Judge Kelson told her: 'The dishonesty involved was persistent at a time when many in this country are thankful for a job. Your salary wasn’t enough for you and so you deceived your employers in a sophisticated and complex way.' He went on: 'But for your ill-health you would have taken more and more and more.' Afterwards Det Sgt Hall said: 'She would often try and ingratiate herself with other people and appear to be quite generous - but it wasn’t her money. 'There is nothing left in her bank account and there are no assets. It has all been frittered away. Barring the odd holiday or purchase she has not really led a champagne lifestyle. 'She has lied about everything and even her husband is another unwitting victim of the lifestyle she has fabricated.'","Janet Cooper spent the money on holidays and a box at West Ham .

Contrary to previous research, the latest suggests that omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish such as salmon and in nuts, may not halt the decline in brainpower. Eating oily fish has long been hailed as a way to keep brains active and cut the risk of a stroke. But now U.S. scientists beileve eating the fish and nuts might not act as a brain boost after all . Study author Eric Ammann of the University of Iowa, said: 'There has been a lot of interest in omega-3s as a way to prevent or delay cognitive decline, but unfortunately our study did not find a protective effect in older women. 'In addition, most randomised trials of omega-3 supplements have not found an effect. 'However, we do not recommend that people change their diet based on these results. Past studies have credited oily fish with the ability to cut post-natal depression, reduce the risk of Altzheimer's disease and diabetes, stroke and arthritis as well as help children perform better in exams and even add two years' to a person's life expectancy. Contrary to previous research, the latest study suggests that omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish such as salmon and in nuts, may not halt the decline in brainpower . Oily fish such as salmon or mackerel had the most marked effect, reducing the risk by 52 per cent, a study found. Even eating just one portion of any type of fish each week for 10 years leads to a 29 per cent cut in risk of arthritis, compared with those eating less fish. Middle-aged and older women are traditionally more at risk of rheumatoid arthritis. The Swedish study, published in the Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, involved 32,000 women born between 1914 and 1948. The study attributed the benefit to the long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (Pufa) content in fish. Mr Ammann said: 'Researchers continue to study the relationship between omega-3s and the health of the heart, blood vessels and brain. 'We know that fish and nuts can be healthy alternatives to red meat and full-fat dairy products, which are high in saturated fats.' The study, published in the journal Neurology, involved 2,157 women age 65 to 80 who were enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative clinical trials of hormone therapy. The women were given annual tests of thinking and memory skills for an average of six years. Blood tests were taken to measure the amount of omega-3s in the participants' blood before the start of the study. The . researchers found no difference between the women with high and low . levels of omega-3s in the blood at the time of the first memory tests. There was also no difference between the two groups in how fast their thinking skills declined over time. Study author Eric Ammann, of the University of Iowa, said: 'There has been a lot of interest in omega-3s as a way to prevent or delay cognitive decline, but our study did not find a protective effect in older women. In addition, most randomised trials of omega-3 supplements have not found an effect .","University of Iowa scientists believe omega-3 fatty acids do not halt the decline in brainpower as previously thought .

A jobless couple with six children living on benefits have been given a spacious four-bedroom home after complaining their council flat was too small. Maggie Flisher, 26, and her 30-year-old husband Gavin have not worked since 2005 and between them receive around £27,000-a-year in state benefits. The couple had been living in a one-bed flat with their children - aged between three months and eight years old - for the past eight years. But after years of complaining about the cramped conditions, a housing association has finally found them a larger house. Packed in: Gavin and Maggie Flisher, had shared their one-bedroom flat with their six children Lacieann, eight, (centre, rear) Elektra, six, (far left) Gavin Jnr, five, (centre), Lilyrose, two, (right) and three-month-old twins Paris Nicola and Martinjames (front left and right) Mrs Flisher said today: 'We are very pleased to be in.' She added: 'I had to pay for the move myself, so it took us three weeks.' Mrs Flisher claims she has been unable to . work due to depression and mental health issues, while Gavin has . to stay in their cramped home to look after her and their family. The couple complained in July that Maidstone Borough Council in Kent had ignored their plea for a new home for eight years. She explained she had six children, aged between eight and three months, because she is 'super-fertile' and contraceptive methods do not work for her. Problem solved: Gavin with his daughters Elektra (left), Lacieann and his son Gavin Jnr in their one bedroom, which they have now moved out of . Complaint: The family said they had no room for their family. Gavin is shown here with Lacieann in their old cramped kitchen . Until this week, their three eldest children - Lacieann, eight, Elektra, six, and Gavin Jnr, five - all slept in the only bedroom. Maggie and her two-year-old daughter Lilyrose slept on a sofa bed in the lounge alongside three-month-old twins Martinjames and Paris Nicola, who lay in Moses baskets. Gavin slept wherever he could find a space. But now, in their new Maidstone home, the parents have a room with their twins; daughters Elektra and Lilyrose share a room; and Lacieann and Gavin Junior each have their own room. Complaints: The fertile pair say the pill, condoms, arm implants and an injection have all failed to stop them conceiving . No fun: The lack of space meant the family have had to pay for storage for belongings and toys . Costly: The family rely on a total of £27,000 in benefits paid out to them and their six children, who are all under the age of eight . A Maidstone Borough Council spokesman said he could not comment on any particular case. He said : 'We maintain a housing register for homes offered by Kent Homechoice. 'People can apply. They bid for a house and some are successful. All our social housing is in short supply and there is only a small number of four-bedroom houses.' In July, the family said they received an annual total of £22,900 in benefits, including £540 a month in jobseekers allowance; child benefit of £85 every week; and child tax credit of £1,000 a month. They have also been receiving housing benefit of £270-a-month to pay the rent on their flat in the town.","Maggie Flisher and husband Gavin have not worked since 2005 .

Taxpayers will not fund a new identity to protect the mother of Baby P when she is released from jail, it emerged last night. Despite fears over her safety, Tracey Connelly – who allowed her son Peter to be tortured to death by her boyfriend – could walk to her freedom this week without protection. The 32-year-old will be transferred from Low Newton jail near Durham to a parole hostel where she will start her re-integration back into society. Freedom: Tracey Connelly, 32, left, is set to walk free from prison this week without the protection of a new identity. She was jailed in 2009 over the death of her son Baby P, right . Connelly is expected to move away from Tottenham, north London – where her son was abused – and may decide to change her appearance to avoid attacks  by vigilantes. There has been widespread horror at her imminent release, but ministers have decided she should not be granted lifetime anonymity and round-the-clock police protection. Prison sources told the Mail yesterday that Connelly did not meet the criteria for receiving a new identity at great expense to taxpayers. One source said: ‘It is very rare to give prisoners a new identity. The bar is extremely high and Tracey Connelly did not cross that threshold.’ She was jailed indefinitely in 2009 after she admitted doing nothing while her little boy was tortured to death by her boyfriend Steven Barker and his paedophile brother Jason Owen. Release: Connelly is set to transferred from Low Newton Prison in Durham to a parole hostel later this week . Peter was 17 months old when he was found dead in his blood-spattered cot at his mother’s flat after suffering 50 separate injuries, including a broken back. The case provoked a national scandal after it emerged that social workers, police and doctors missed a series of warning signs that could have saved the child’s life. Sickened by the depravity, 132,000 people joined ‘hate groups’ on social networking internet sites calling for Connelly, Barker and Owen to ‘burn in hell’. Still inside: Jason Owen, 37, was one of three people jailed over the death of Baby P. He is back in prison after breaching his parole conditions . Some threatened to violently attack them when they are eventually released. Criminal justice expert Harry Fletcher said: ‘The decision to provide a new identity is reserved for a very small group of people who are at the gravest risk of harm from the public. 'The risk must be so great that it is justifiable to the public purse.’ Anonymity orders are rare and only four are currently in force. These apply to child killer Mary Bell, James Bulger’s murderers Robert Thompson and Jon  Venables and to Maxine Carr, who provided a false alibi for Soham murderer Ian Huntley. The parole board is expected to make a decision on Connelly’s release today. If approved, she will walk free ‘within days’. After spending a stint in a parole hostel, Connelly will be allowed to move into a private home. Officials will be keen to learn how well she integrates back into society and if she forms a new relationship. Social services will be alerted should she get pregnant and would almost certainly apply to have the baby taken into care. Connelly has told friends how she dreams of looking for men on her release. With her time on remand following her arrest in 2007, Connelly has served longer than the five-year minimum tariff handed down at the Old Bailey. Owen was freed on licence in 2011 but returned to jail  after breaching parole conditions. Barker was given an indefinite sentence with a tariff of ten years.","Tracey Connelly, 32, set to walk free this week without protection .

Josephine and Jeff Ruckinger, both 43, shot and killed her mother, 64-year-old Roberta Frew, and brother, 47-year-old John Frew Jr, before being shot and killed themselves by her father John Frew late last Friday. According to police, the Ruckingers knocked on her family's door at about 10pm after the family returned from dinner and was settling to watch TV. Unrecognizable: A man in Pennsylvania unknowingly shot and killed his estranged daughter when she and her husband invaded his home - killing his wife and son . Her mother answered the door and quickly yelled 'Oh my God, they have guns' before she was shot by her daughter wielding a sawed-off shot gun. The couple proceeded into the house and continued to shoot her older brother. When she turned her gun to her father it was too late. He had retrieved a .22-caliber pistol after hearing the commotion and shot her in the head. When her husband tried to retaliate, he shot him as well. By the time police arrived, Mrs Frew, John Frew Jr and Jeff Ruckinger were already dead. Josephine was still alive with a gunshot wound to the head, but died later at the hospital. It was only when Mr Frew was being questioned by police that he was informed that it was his daughter Josephine that he killed. He hadn't recognized her. The two had been estranged for years, and a family member says Josephine nursed a grudge for her family. Josephine had 'a hatred toward the family' according to her aunt Virginia Cruse, who spoke with the Lewistown Sentinel. Cruse said the daughter and mother did not get along, but that she had no idea what spawned Friday's tragedy. When Josephine was about 20, she and a boyfriend trashed her parents' home and stole items including a pistol, then fled to Pittsburgh, Cruse said. After that, she said, 'more or less, they disowned her. Jeff Ruckinger worked for a tire repair company and Josephine had disabilities that prevented her from working, Cruse said.","John Frew, shot Jeff and Josephine Ruckinger dead after they broke into his home .

A pimp who allegedly flew young Argentinian boys to Paris and forced them into prostitution under the threat of black magic has been arrested. 'Andrea Chichi' is the suspected ring-leader of a transsexual prostitution gang that allegedly exploited boys from Buenos Aires. Chichi is accused of forcing 90 boys into the illegal trade. He was arrested by Paris's BRP police division, along with seven others accused of forcing dozens of transsexuals to sell their bodies in the wealthy western Bois de Boulagne park in the French capital. A prostitute waits for clients in the Bois de Boulogne park, western Paris, a hot-spot for prostitutes and where young Argentinian boys were allegedly forced to solicit sex by a pimp, under threat of black magic . A police source told Le Parisien, quoted in The Local,  that Chichi 'pretended he could use black magic' and 'would threaten to put a curse or spell' on any boys who expressed a desire to leave. 'He had a stranglehold on everyone in the network,' the source said, adding that those 'cursed' felt 'more exposed to violence, theft and rape'. According to a police source, quoted in The Local, 43-year-old Chichi was arrested while he tried to board a plane to Buenos Aires, with hundreds of thousands of euros in his luggage. The other seven people were arrested in Hauts-de-Seine, not far from the western Paris park. They are suspected of managing the dozens of prostitutes brought into the country from Argentina. Their operation allegedly involved 'recruiting' young boys from the province of Salta, in western Argentina, putting them up in a hotel in Buenos Aires and advising on various surgical procedures to make them more appealing to clients. The surgery was allegedly carried out by an accomplice called 'Lorena,' the Local said. The accomplices allegedly recruited young boys in Argentina, remodelled them in Buenos Aires, then made them work in the sex trade in Bois de Boulagne park, Paris, pictured . Once trained and remodelled, the young boys were allegedly flown to France where two transvestite 'lieutenants' would manage them and send them to solicit sex from clients in the park. News of the arrests in the alleged prostitution gang comes as France prepares to reform its prostitution laws. There have been calls for sex clients to be heavily fined; prostitutes have hit back claiming this makes their work more dangerous, forced to work in more remote places. Under current French laws, it is legal to 'seek or offer money for sexual services' as long as it is done without advertising. A survey this year found there were . more than 20,000 prostitutes working in France, and that six out of ten . French men and women wanted brothels to be legalised. France . had 1,400 legal brothels before they were all banned in 1946. In . Britain, prostitution and paying for sex are legal if the girl is over . 18 and not acting under duress. The Bois de Boulogne park in the wealthy western region of Paris, is a popular tourist attraction by day . By night, the park allegedly is allegedly where the young boys were forced to solicit sex. Chichi was arrested as he tried to board a flight to Argentina, seven people were arrested in Hauts-de-Seine, not far from the western Paris park . But related activities including soliciting, kerb crawling, keeping a brothel and pimping are all outlawed. Brothels are still legal in Germany, Holland and Switzerland, and tolerated in Spain.

But 40 years after their incredible feat, they have discovered that the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has selected different craters to mark their flight. The lunar surface taken from Anders' and Lovell's Apollo 8 spacecraft looking southward. They named key features but now find these have been 'moved' to the dark side not visible from Earth . And these craters are on the far - dark - side of the moon, which is not visible from Earth. The IAU chose these craters in 1970, according to the Independent, but the apparent snub has just come to light after the agency advertised it was using public campaigns to name celestial bodies including the moon's landmarks. Appalled at their mission's apparent unimportance, Mr Anders wrote to the journal the New Scientist, saying: 'I thought these names would have some priority, but when the IAU honoured our crew with crater names, it picked three craters that were not only well out of sight of our orbital track, but also in darkness at the time of our mission.' The letter, seen by the Independent, goes on to say that he wrote to the IAU to try to correct crater-naming discrepancies. But he says he was 'brushed off by its bureaucracy'. Making history: William Anders, pictured right in 1968, made history when he and James Lovell, left, orbited the moon for the first time and named some its key features . On their Apollo 8 mission they got the first glimpse of the Earth from the far side of the moon . He also provided the IAU with a map of the Apollo 8 flight path, to show how the craters and landmarks along its orbit were chosen, and he says the agency kept his map and never got it back. One of the named landscapes was a small mountain on the shore of the Sea of Tranquility, which had no name. 'I observed it on Apollo 8 and called it Mount Marilyn, after my wife. It was used as the starting points for the descents of Apollo 10 and 11,' he said in his letter. He wrote that although the IAU does not officially recognise the name, 'it is embedded in space-flight history'. Some of the key features of the moon that are visible form Earth - none of which are names chosen by astronauts Anders and Lovell . The IAU has said the issue is now in the hands of the agency's general secretary. Apollo 8 was the first manned circumlunar flight of the moon, and it carried out 10 orbits in 20 hours. It was also the first manned flight of the Saturn V rocket. The crew were the first people to see the far side of the Moon and to get a glimpse of Earth over the lunar horizon with their own eyes. Live television pictures were broadcast to Earth. Founded in 1919, when the idea of space exploration began to look like it could one day be a reality, the Paris-based IAU has long-held the role of naming celestial features. Its announcement this summer that it would open the naming process up to members of the public marks a shift to try democratise the process, but strict rules still apply.","William Anders and James Lovell were the first astronauts to orbit the moon .

Regrets: Dame Stella Rimington told an audience at Henley Literary Festival of things she missed . She was once the real life ‘M’ who put her family on the line to be Director General of MI5. But yesterday Dame Stella Rimington told how sometimes she regrets juggling her hectic career with her young family. The 78-year-old claimed she struggled to be in two places at the same time and stated more should be done to help women in the work place. Speaking after her lecture at the Henley Literary festival yesterday the mother-of-two told how she often regretted missing out on ‘sports day’ and ‘school plays’ because of the real life drama in the office. Dedicated to her job, Dame Stella - who was director general for MI5 between 1992 and 1996 - claimed she would later be wracked with guilt as she explained to her children why she hadn’t made an appearance. She said: ‘I had so many moments where I would worry about being late for the sports day or late for the meeting because I was at sports day. ‘It was perpetual really, you take a day off because your child is in the school play and then some drama will happen at the office. ‘I still had to go home and explain to my child why I didn’t make it. ‘There were a number of things I missed - I wish I could go back too. ‘When they were growing up relied hugely on nannies and grannies.’ Now a thriller writer, Dame Stella was the first female and first public director general of MI5. Yesterday Dame Stella said women today still struggle to juggle their homes and their work, claiming she is disappointed and unimpressed by the lack of progression for helping working mothers. She added: ‘I look at women in the work place now and I feel incredibly sad that the environment hasn’t changed more. ‘It shouldn’t still be difficult for women to juggle their family and their work life in 2013. The same problems shouldn’t face women today. ‘I thought by the time my daughters were to be mothers that they wouldn’t be faced with the this problem. ‘The government has previously promised to sort out child care and but it has failed.

A Chinese teenager suffered horrific burns to her face after she was doused in petrol and set alight because she spurned the advances of a classmate. Zhou Yan, 17, had been flattered when Tao Rukun, also 17 and the son of a wealthy and well-connected family, had asked her out for a date. But when she decided he was too arrogant, and told him to leave her alone, she said he had become aggressive and threatening. Her worried parents had moved her to a new school, but instead of being put off Tao pestered her at her home, and after asking to speak to her in private in her room last September, doused her in petrol and set her on fire. He then stood by as she screamed and her terrified grandmother tried to put out the blaze that left her horrifically burned over 30 per cent of her body, particularly around her head, neck and chest. Despite the pain, her ordeal was not over as her parents could not afford the medical bills, and were reliant on her attacker's family to pay the cost. Tao’s parents were local government officials. Tao’s father works for Hefei urban planning bureau and his mother is with Hefei Audit Bureau. But when she refused to sign a statement saying it had been an accident, the payments suddenly stopped, and she ended up back at home. Her parents said: 'We did not even have the money to properly repair her room that had been damaged by the fire.' It seemed as if Tao would get away with the attack - until her dad posted a picture of his girl before and after on the internet. It went viral, and put massive pressure on local officials to reopen the case. Stalked: Her parents had moved her to a new school, but instead of being put off Tao pestered her at her home .

The Duchess of York has fuelled speculation that she and Prince Andrew might remarry, admitting: 'He is still my handsome prince.' The 53-year-old, whose 10-year marriage to the Prince, with whom she has two daughters, ended in divorce in 1996, refused to deny rumours that the pair might get back together. Instead she said: 'He'll always be my handsome prince.  It's really lovely that we are still a family and the story has a happy ending all the time.' The Duchess of York, pictured yesterday in Bath, has fuelled speculation that she and Prince Andrew, pictured yesterday in Tokyo, might remarry, by saying 'We're still a family - the story has a happy ending' Her comments give strength to recent reports that she and her ex-husband, whose children Beatrice and Eugenie are 25 and 23, are back together again. Friends have claimed that the pair, who have failed to find lasting love with anyone else in nearly two decades apart, are so close that a remarriage might be on the cards. Speaking at the Bath Children's Literature Festival, where she was promoting her latest children's book, the Duchess was asked if she and her former husband might reconcile or remarry. She declared ‘We really respect each other and we honour each other.’ Referring to her own 'happy ending', Sarah told the audience: ‘I met a handsome prince and he was very, very good-looking and we had a beautiful wedding. 'Mummies and daddies in the audience might remember it – I think they might have had a day off. ‘He really is still my handsome Prince. We really believe in being good parents for our girls.’ When asked if they would remarry, she told the Daily Telegraph: ‘He’s still my handsome prince, he’ll always be my handsome prince. It’s lovely that we are such a family and the story has a happy ending all the time. Prince Andrew shakes hands with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at a Tokyo seminar yesterday . The Duchess' comments came at the weekend when she was promoting her new children's book in Bath . Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, pictured at Royal Ascot this summer, are close to both of their parents . ‘In our every day, we really respect . each other and we honour each other and it’s just lovely to have that . sense of integrity, to what we believe is right; to what is good and . compassionate and love and kindness. And that’s the way we are.' The . Duchess was talking about Ballerina Rosie, her new book for children . that tells the story of a young red-headed girl who dreams of becoming a . dancer. 'He's still my handsome prince, he'll always be my handsome prince' - The Duchess of York, speaking about her former husband, Prince Andrew . She told the audience that the inspiration for her first children's book, Budgie The Little Helicopter, came from her ex-husband's career as a helicopter pilot. Last month a friend of the couple, who both live at Royal Lodge, the Queen Mother's former home in Berkshire, said that it was 'only a matter of time' before the couple remarried, prompting a spokesman for the Duchess to declare: ‘There is no truth to this. 'They . continue to be joint parents and best friends and try to set the best . example for the girls.’ But the latest remarks from the Duchess, of whom the Queen is said to be fond, serve only to strengthen the possibility that the couple might formally reconcile. Sarah Ferguson and the Queen's second . son had known each other since childhood, but romance was sparked at a . party at Windsor Castle in 1985, which led to an engagement in early . 1986 and a summer wedding that year in Westminster Abbey. Sarah Ferguson (pictured with Prince Andrew and daughter Beatrice) said they have remained 'a family' The marriage was in trouble by 1991, and with the Duke frequently away, his wife was often pictured in the company of other men. In 1992 the Duchess was at Balmoral when pictures of her having her toes sucked by her financial adviser, John Bryan, were published.  The couple divorced in 1996, but were back living under the same roof at the family home Sunninghill Park, in Berkshire, within a year. The Duchess was not invited back to Balmoral until last month, when she and Andrew joined their daughters and the Queen for the weekend at the monarch's Scottish retreat. In 1999 she told an interviewer: ‘There was no reason for Andrew and I to get divorced; there wasn’t another person in our lives to go to. 'Very beautiful wedding': Sarah Ferguson married the Duke of York, Prince Andrew, in July 1986 . ‘We got divorced because I had to go out to work, and Andrew and I believed that it wasn’t right for me to be commercial while I was still in the Royal Family.’ Andrew has continued to provide financial support for his ex-wife and in a 2009 interview he did not rule out remarrying. ‘Do we have to be married?’ he said. ‘Well, let’s put it another way, I can neither confirm nor deny the possibility. We have two great children. We still look after them.’ Since the couple's divorce, they have both been linked with other people, though neither found anyone for lasting love. American multimillionaire Steve Wyatt and Italian Count Ghaddo della Gherardesca were both seen out with Sarah over the years, while her ex-husband was seen on holiday with Filipino model Alexandra Escat, 25 years his junior, and out with PR women Aurelia Cecil and Caroline Stanbury, among a long list. None has stayed the course for either, however, and with the Queen said to favour a reconciliation, it seems the chances of the Yorks remarrying have never been stronger.

And at its slowest in 15 years is drive-thru giant McDonalds, where customers must wait an average of 9 seconds longer than most fast food joints. Finally: Wait times at American fast food chain drive thrus are now at record highs . Fast food industry publication QSR released its 15th annual analysis of drive thru speeds at nationwide chains. Below are the chains and the average time it takes to be served from order to pickup. Krystal................3.6 mins . Chik-fil-A............3.4 mins . Burger King........3.3 mins . McDonald's........3.16 mins . Taco John's........3.0 mins . Taco Bell............2.6 mins . Wendy's.............2.2 mins . According to the 2013 Drive-Thru Performance Study conducted for industry magazine QSR, McDonalds customers who don’t want to get out of the car for a bite to eat wait an average of 3.16 minutes between ordering and picking up their food. Not a long wait, of course, but the longest in the history of the study. And it all comes down to menu bloat. That’s what the industry calls the newer, more complicated offerings that have been the trend industry-wide as companies try to out compete each other for market share. ‘The operational pressures to assemble those items are slowing down the drive-thru,’ QSR editor Sam Oches told USA Today. Though, the wait isn’t all bad. QSR writes that, in addition to increased complexity of their offerings, fast food chains have also upped the ante on quality of service. Still fast: Normally speedy McDonald's clocked in at 3.16 minutes per average wait time according to a study from industry magazine QSR . ‘The one thing that angers a customer most is to not get the right food,’ Oches said. ‘It's possible to be too fast.’ According to the study, accuracy may sometimes trump speed in the race to win over fast food customers. ‘We knew going into this year’s Study that speed-of-service times seemed to have plateaued over the last few years, but we did not really expect to see the nearly across-the-board increases in service times that were apparent,’ Brian Baker, president of Insula Research, told QSR. ‘Customers will be patient if you give them hot, accurate orders,’ says Oches.

The former SAS soldier who claims Princess Diana was murdered by his old regiment will face police within days over the allegations. The disgraced sniper, known as Soldier N, will face interrogation by top detectives at Scotland Yard this week after he came out of hiding in the Middle East. Last week it was reported that he had fled the country in fear of his life after his high profile claims that SAS soldiers flashed lights to deliberately blind the driver of Diana's car and cause a collision. But it seems he has now reconsidered and flown back to the UK to face questioning. Soldier . N allegedly told his wife that the SAS used the technique, which was . developed for targeting terrorism, against Diana's driver in Paris in . 1997 to cause him to crash. The . 38-year-old former sergeant will also have to answer questions about . allegations that he smuggled thousands of pounds of stolen money into . Britain after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was due to be questioned by Scotland Yard's Detective Chief Inspector Philip Easton who is leading the investigation into Diana's death but vanished shortly beforehand. A source told the Sunday People: 'He was told in no uncertain terms he had to return to face the music. 'He was aware the police wanted to interview him over claims he said the SAS was responsible for Diana's death - and running away wasn't the most sensible option. 'He's now back in Britain and expects to be interviewed by the police. 'His partner and children are still in the UK so he really had little choice.' It is believed he originally fled to the United Arab Emirates where there is a large British ex-military community. But rumours that he had moved on to Thailand are now known to be incorrect. Soldier N's claims about the SAS being responsible for Diana's death were sent to the Yard in July following the court martial of sniper Danny Nightingale. Both men were arrested in 2011 after a police raid found illegal weapons and ammunition in a house they shared. Soldier N was given two years detention . for his part despite an impressive combat record that saw him mentioned . in despatches for his heroic defense of a UN convoy after it came under . fire in 1995 during the Bosnian conflict. Last photo: Diana and Henri Paul, right, and bodyguard Trevor Rees, left, pictured in the car, shortly before the accident in Paris 1997 . Nightingale's conviction was quashed on appeal but was then found guilty at a retrial in July and given a two-year suspended sentence. Since Soldier N's claims were made public another former serviceman has come forward claiming that many people behind the scene believe Diana's death was ordered. A former MI6 agent claims that the attitude of many in the secret services towards the Princess at the time of her death that she had become and embarrassment. He also claims there were fears that her relationship with Muslim Dodi Fayed, 42, posed a threat to the monarchy and said the question often asked was: 'What are we going to do about Diana.' Speaking about going to work on the day after the crash which killed Diana, Mr Fayed and driver Henri Paul he said: 'I'd just sat down when a colleague leaned over and whispered, ""I can't believe we killed her."" 'I was initially confused and said, ""Who?"", and he added ""Diana."" 'At first I thought he was joking - but then I realised he was being completely serious.' The former spy, who had served in Moscow and Eastern Europe added: 'Many people who worked for MI6 at the time thought the organisation played some sort of role in Diana's death. 'My view was that Diana had become an embarrassment and if she had married Dodi it would have presented significant difficulties for the monarchy. 'But even if you accept all of that, why kill her.'","Soldier N fled the UK fearing for his life but has since returned to the UK and will face questioning .

After rooting out thousands of white-owned farms, Zimbabwe is now targeting ‘foreign’ trees for the axe. Indigenous trees can stay, but firs, pines and eucalyptus that were planted by early white settlers to remind them of their distant homes are now being pulled up. But the policy has nothing to do with the politics of President Robert Mugabe, or his black empowerment law meant to reverse the entitlements of the white-led rule of the past. Alien: Species such as the pine tree, above, are being uprooted by the Royal Harare Golf Club because they drink too much water . In the rough: Pine trees are popular with golf course designers who create wooded areas, as shown in this Portuguese course . Royal Harare club manager Ian Mathieson said a program to cut down 'alien' trees and replant trees 'indigenous' to Zimbabwe such as the acacia and msasa varieties is under way, and will take 20 years to complete. So far, nearly 60 gnarled and elderly 'foreign' trees have been removed and more than 300 local trees and shrubs have been planted in their place. Foreign eucalyptus, or gum trees, most of them over 100 years old, are set for the chainsaw, said Mathieson. 'If we are to retain water, these trees need to come down' Mathieson said. Nearby pine trees also make the soil acidic and 'there is also the threat of falling debris from the old trees' he said. The early settlers, mainly British, were homesick regions and golf gave them solace. They planted imported trees and shrubs in Rhodesia, as Zimbabwe was known before independence in 1980. King George V, the queen’s grandfather,  played on the course in 1929, bestowing the royal title on the club. But the last of the hardy, long-living foreign trees he saw are being cut down now. Royal connection: The course took its regal name after King George V, above, played there . The first settlers felled the indigenous trees on the course and wild animals that once roamed there disappeared too. Experts have been called in for the replanting exercise that requires careful planning. Every hole has trees planted in ways to make the game more challenging, according to Mathieson. 'A player has to contend with the trees if he hits the ball out of the fairway' he said. The purple blossoming jacaranda tree, a native of South America and Asia brought to Africa by early missionaries, will be spared at Royal Harare. It has become synonymous with Zimbabwe’s 'spring' season because it blooms at winter’s end. Thorn trees, a member of the local acacia species that grows in dozens of African varieties with different hues and shapes, are the indigenous trees of choice at the golf club. The course is home to more than 100 species of birds, many of which migrate thousands of kilometers to the southern hemisphere every year, he said.","'Alien' trees suck up too much water, according to Royal Harare golf club .

Drunken driver: Thomas Cypress, 58, was ordered to pay a total of $35million in restitution stemming from the 2009 DUI crash that killed a retired couple in Florida . The family of an elderly Maryland couple who were killed in 2009 when a drunken driver slammed into their vehicle have been awarded a total of $35million in damages by a civil court in Florida. Thomas Cypress, the driver of the truck that plowed into the car of Robert and Paulette Kirkpatrick on Tamiami Trail, killing them both, was ordered Monday to pay $5million in punitive damages in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the victims’ children. The decision came just days after a jury decided that Cypress, 58, should pay $30million in compensatory damages to the Kirkpatrick family. ‘I think the jury honored our parents by sending a message to our community that drinking and driving is not something it is going to stand for,’ Steven Kirkpatrick, the couple’s eldest son, told the Miami Herald. Mr Cypress, a former airboat driver, is currently serving 12 years in prison after being convicted in 2010 of two DUI manslaughter counts stemming from the deadly February 2009 crash. The Kirkpatricks, both 63 years old, arrived in Florida to attend an art show in Naples and enjoy a winter vacation. The couple had retired from teaching just a few years earlier. Scroll down for video . Prefect couple: Robert and Paulette Kirkpatrick, both 63-year-old retired teachers, were vacationing in Miami-Dade County in February 2009 when Cypress plowed into their car, killing them . On February 19, Robert and Paulette were riding in a rented car along Tamiami Trail in Miami-Dade County when Thomas Cypress, the brother of a former Miccosukee tribal chairman, veered his truck the wrong way and smashed head on into the sedan. At the time of the collision, Cypress' blood alcohol level was three times the legal limit, and he was driving on a suspended license after an earlier DUI charge. Prior to the 2009 crash, Mr Cypress had been arrested for drunken driving on two separate occasions.

During a two-day civil trial last week, a jury heard from Jennifer and Steven Kirkpatrick, the victims' children, before awarding them $30million in compensatory damages following a 15-minute deliberation. On Monday, the same jurors deliberated for two hours before reaching a decision to award additional $5million in punitive damages. Cypress' attorney William Fink told jurors his client is destitute and has no means to pay the family restitution. But the lawyer hired to represent the plaintiffs insisted that the defendant has the funds to pay the damages based on the fact that he retained the services of a well-known private law firm, CBS Miami reported.

Happy couple: Liam and his girlfriend Melissa Moss stand next to the helicopter. He spent four months planning the proposal . They travelled to Staverton Airfield, Gloucestershire, 15 miles away, before embarking on the 45-minute round trip. The letters of the design were around eight foot deep. He said: 'It was really nerve-wracking as there were so many factors that had to work together for it to come off, like the weather, lots of details which could have gone wrong. 'The lowest the helicopter can go is 500ft so I was hoping we'd made it big enough to read from that distance. I didn't sleep too well the night before as all these things were playing on my mind.

"By . Ryan Gorman . PUBLISHED: . 07:46 EST, 1 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:54 EST, 1 October 2013 . Students experiencing bizarre symptoms including bleached hair and the loss of body hair led to the closure of a California high school’s swimming pool last week. Berkeley High School closed the pool Wednesday after students complained of ailments ranging from burning eyes and itching skin to bleached and missing hair. The school blamed the symptoms on a pH imbalance caused by a faulty CO2 tank. Water polo coach Bill Gaebler, in a letter to parents, explained the pool’s pH level was much higher than normal and that a new CO2 tank had been ordered, according to reports. Missing and bleaching hair: Berkeley High School's pool (similar to the one pictured here) was closed after students began seeing body hair fall out and the hair on their heads bleaching . The pool’s pH level was 8.4, but should reside in a range of 7.2 to 8.0, according to a city inspection report cited by the Daily Californian. Low chlorine levels and the defective CO2 tank combined to bring the ph level to an abnormal level, Mr Gaebler’s letter explained. A pH level of 8.4 is 10 times the allowable limit, the letter noted. The City of Berkley made the decision to shut the pool out of concern for student health, the school is testing the water three times daily, reported Berkeleyside. ‘The pH scale is an exponential scale, so 8.5 is very high (10x), and the level of rapid eye and skin irritation due to chloramines rises significantly at levels above 0.6,’ wrote Mr Gaebler, according to Berkeleyside. ‘The high pH was caused by a defective CO2 tank, CO2 being the gas that buffers (lowers) the pH,’ the letter continued. Though a new CO2 tank has reportedly been ordered by the school, parents still expressed concern over their children losing body hair, among other complaints. ‘If those statements are true, it does raise concern,’ Tracy Hollander, president of the Berkeley PTA Council, told the Daily Califronian. ‘It speaks to student safety. We need to help ensure that students are safe, whether they are walking down a hall or in a pool.’ pH imbalance: School officials blamed high pH levels on the students' discomfort . Another parent was also alarmed by their child’s ‘non-existent’ body hair, stinging eyes and the hair on his head turning white, said Berkeleyside. We didn’t want the pool closed, we don’t want to make a political issue out of it. We want a safe and healthy environment for our children,’ said the parent, declining to be named. ‘We didn’t want the school administration to wait until there was a crisis to deal with this issue,’ the parent added. The replacement tank, which costs $7,000, is expected arrive within seven days, both papers reported. The school is currently using a liquid buffer to restore pH levels to the acceptable range, the Daily Californian noted. Increased diligence: The school pledged to test the water three times a day, as well as have an independent tester conduct monthly evaluations . Despite the curious bleaching and falling out of students’ hair, a city spokesperson told the Daily Californian the closure of a pool is not unusual, and can happen for a myriad of reasons. The school has pledged to test the pool water three times a day going forward, and will soon contract an independent tester to conduct monthly water evaluations, instead of the annual testing previously done, according to the Daily Californian. The pool has twice been closed in the past, according to the Daily Californian, including two years ago for similar complaints – also due to a high pH level.","Berkeley High School students were losing body hair and the hair on their heads was bleaching .

Shocking: A Torquay mother has admitted she feeds her baby pureed cheeseburgers as she cannot cook a thing (file picture) A mother totally ill-equipped for parenthood has approached the authorities for help after admitting she feeds her baby pureed cheeseburgers because she cannot cook. Experts believe this grave situation is mirrored all over Britain because a generation with little or no parenting skills is bringing up their children on a diet of fast food. Significant numbers of youngsters also arrive at primary school not toilet trained and cannot even use a knife and fork, according the Child Poverty Commission. Many of these households say they are too poor to buy items like fruit and vegetables as costs continue to rocket, but the truth is far too many cannot cook at all, family support groups say. And despite courses being run all over the country helping parents to cook and look after their children better, many do not go because they feel 'judged' and fear their child will be taken into care. Members of Torbay Child Poverty Commission in Devon heard from the local woman who pureed cheeseburgers from a fast food restaurant for her child because . she didn't know how to cook. Independent . child poverty expert Michelle Kennedy, who chairs the commission, . admitted she 'gulped' out loud after hearing the claims. Another woman who was given a carrot also admitted she had no idea what it was, she said. The Commission also heard community services were trusted more than local government services by struggling families. Linda Cregan, CEO of the Children’s Food Trust, said:'Torbay has set an excellent example in . making their child poverty meetings public and the Children’s Food Trust . hopes that they and other local authorities make use of the many tools . available to tackle this difficult situation, such as running family . Let’s Get Cooking clubs, or offering cookery training for professionals . working with these families. 'Good, nutritious food throughout childhood but particularly in a child’s early years is critical to healthy development – it is a vital factor not only in preventing obesity but also in performance at school. Sadly, in many cases family cooking skills have been lost through over generations, not helped by the loss for many years of cookery from the school curriculum.' This week a nationwide survey of children's eating habits found they are being sent to school with cold chips or a packet of biscuits in their lunchbox. One reason behind the food children are taking with them is that the value of money has plummeted by two-thirds over the last 30 years as the cost of everyday goods rockets. A three-fold increase in retail prices means that someone would need £299 today to have the equivalent purchasing power of £100 back in 1982, according to the Children's Food Trust. Worrying: Many new parents cannot cook and are afraid the authorities will intervene if they seek help (posed by models) One person told the Trust that 'some children come in with just a packet of biscuits'. Another said they had seen 'poorer quality sandwich fillings, sometimes just margarine'. The poll asked 253 adults, including youth workers, childminders, teachers, doctors and hospital staff, for their views on how children's diets have changed. It found that more than four-fifths (84.6 per cent) say that in the course of their work, they have seen children who they think are not getting enough to eat. A third person said 'some families only give cold cooked rice or cold chips with fishfingers or similar.' Poor diet: Adults working with children were surveyed about the quality of children's food - and some reported packed lunches consisting of cold chips and fishfingers . Lib Dem Bobbie Davies said: 'People feel they're not going to be judged and their children aren't going to be taken away from them.' Sharon Clayborough, from Home-Start, said many families choose not to use children's centres at all because 'they feel they're being watched and their parenting is being challenged. They feel criticised.'","Torquay woman sought help after bringing up baby on takeaways .

The Queen’s husband, who has spent the summer recuperating at Balmoral after undergoing abdominal surgery in June, was visiting volunteers restoring a rare bog on her Sandringham estate in Norfolk. Back on form: The Duke of Edinburgh returned to his public duties today with a visit to a conservation project at the Dersingham Bog Nature Reserve, on the Royal Sandringham Estate, Norfolk . On the mend: Prince Philip's return to health comes after he spent the summer recuperating at Balmoral after abdominal surgery in June . ‘It was the kind of staff used quite frequently by those engaged in countryside pursuits, particularly when walking across uneven terrain,’ said one. ‘It is not something that the Duke uses often.’ Indeed, Philip appeared in fine fettle as he chatted animatedly with the conservationists at Dersingham Bog, a national nature reserve covering more than 400 acres, which is one of the last remaining fragments of lowland heathland in south-east England. The workers were from The Conservation Volunteers (TCV), a national charity which encourages people and communities to transform their health, prospects and outdoor places by getting involved with projects.

A pair of Hollywood actors who were pulled over and handcuffed by the police during a trip to South Carolina claim they were targeted by officers because they are black. Cherie Johnson and Dennis White were apparently accused of possessing marijuana - even though Ms Johnson once fronted a national anti-drugs campaign - and asked if they were carrying a dead body in the trunk of their car. Local police have now launched an investigation into the couple's allegations, which have sparked widespread outrage amidst concerns of racial profiling by police in the state. Ms Johnson, 37, is best known for her long-running roles in sitcoms Punky Brewster and Family Matters, while Mr White appeared in 2009 hit Notorious. Stopped: Dennis White and Cherie Johnson claim they were victims of racial profiling in South Carolina . The pair, who live in Los Angeles, had been conducting an acting workshop in Mr White's hometown of Fayetteville, North Carolina before the incident on September 22, they told CNN iReport. They were driving to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina for a short vacation when they were pulled over for driving at 40mph in a 25mph zone, and issued with a speeding ticket. As they continued along the highway after the traffic stop, they noticed a cotton field by the side of the road and decided to stop and take photographs, as Ms Johnson had never seen cotton plants before. Mr White told CNN that the pair were moved by the symbolism of seeing cotton which would once have been picked by slaves, adding that they reflected on 'the oppression that those little white balls created decades ago'. As they returned to their rental car, they noticed that a police car had stopped next to them, and Ms Johnson told the policeman inside: 'I just wanted to take a picture!' Stars: The two actors both live in California and were visiting the South to hold acting workshops . The couple claimed that the officer, Shad Barfield, then picked up his gun and ordered them to sit in their car. He apparently proceeded to interrogate them, asking if they had drugs and telling Ms Johnson that a warrant was out for her arrest, although he soon admitted that this was not true. She told HLN: 'After he told me that I did not have a warrant for my arrest, and he started asking me about drugs for the third time, I said, ""Are you doing this because we're black?"" And that was when everything took a turn for the worse.' Mr Barfield put both actors in handcuffs, although they were not under arrest, and continued to accuse them of carrying marijuana - even though Ms Johnson was a representative for the Say No to Drugs campaign in the 1980s. After the officer suggested that they might be hiding a dead body in the trunk of their car, Mr Dennis agreed that he could search the vehicle. Fame: Ms Johnson appeared in 1980s sitcom Punky Brewster alongside Soleil Moon Frye, left . Mr Barfield accused him of having a bag of marijuana, but was forced to back down when Mr Dennis pointed out that it was in fact a tea bag. When the policeman did not find anything illegal in the car, he released the couple and allowed them to leave, but they say he did not apologise for detaining them. Mr White told CNN: 'At no point in history is this justified, especially not in this day and age. The equality that our forefathers fought so hard to obtained does not stretched across the board.' After being told of the incident, Marion County sheriff Mark Richardson said: 'Discrimination in any form, including racial profiling, is strictly prohibited by this department and as Sheriff of Marion County SC, I can assure you I will take immediate and appropriate action to investigate the allegations of racial profiling made by Mr White and Ms Johnson. 'This matter will be dealt with by an internal investigation within the department and I will also ask the State Law Enforcement Division to review the allegation made against Deputy Barfield.'","Cherie Johnson and Dennis White were driving from acting workshop when they pulled over to photograph a cotton field .

A clean-shaven James Holmes sat quietly in court yesterday as his lawyers hinted they might not be ready for his murder trial, scheduled to start in February. Defense lawyers said they are rushing to complete pretrial motions and waiting for prosecutors to whittle down their list of potential trial witnesses, which now stands at about 4,000. They said they have too much to do in the judge's current schedule. Clean-shaven James Holmes in a court sketch from yesterday (left) and bearded at an earlier hearing (right) 'If we want this trial to go in February, something's got to give,' defense lawyer Daniel King told Samour. Holmes is accused of firing into a crowded suburban Denver movie theater in July 2012, killing 12 people and injuring 70. He pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to multiple counts of murder and attempted murder. He underwent an evaluation at the state mental hospital, but the results have not been made public. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Holmes looked tidier yesterday than in the past. He had bright orange hair during his first court appearance and later donned a bushy beard and unruly hair. Yesterday, his beard was gone and his dark hair was combed neatly back. Cameras were not allowed in court. Holmes' lawyers asked the judge to give them until November 20 to file motions and to set an October deadline for prosecutors to turn over a list of trial witnesses. Shooting victim Josh Nowlan uses a cane as he arrives at yesterday's hearing (left) while television reporter Jana Winter, right, waits to clear security ahead of her appearance . Prosecutors argued the defense needs less time for motions and that they cannot submit a witness list until December. The deadlines will be decided later. The state hospital and the University of Colorado, Denver, where Holmes was a graduate student, had been ordered to give prosecutors Holmes' mental health records yesterday, but that was delayed after the defense and the hospital said prosecutors were seeking more information than they were entitled to. The judge extended until January 3 a subpoena that could require Fox News reporter Jana Winter to identify her confidential sources for a story about Holmes or face jail for contempt of court. Citing unidentified law-enforcement officials, Winter reported Holmes sent a psychiatrist a notebook containing violent images. Defense lawyers said that violated a gag order. They also argued that officials who denied under oath that they spoke with Winter might have lied, undermining their credibility as trial witnesses. Winter has said she will not identify her sources, and she is fighting to quash the subpoena.

A British man has admitted attempting to smuggle $30million (£80million) of cocaine into Europe from the Caribbean. Rawson Watson, from Kent, faces 10 years in an American jail after he was caught boarding a Belgium-bound plane in the Dominican Republic with a tonne of cocaine in December 2011. The drug was found spread across 20 suitcases in 1,001 separate packages, according to reports. Guilty plea: Rawson Watson has admitted attempting to smuggle $30million of cocaine into Europe from the Caribbean . Watson faces charges along with alleged . Dutch accomplice Nicolas Epskamp and Nayef Fawaz, who is said to have . chartered the plane to transport the haul of drugs. Fawaz was arrested separately in Panama in June last year. Watson's guilty plea was welcomed by U.S attorney for Manhattan Preet Bharara, according to the Telegraph. He said: 'Today's guilty plea ensures that Rawson Edward Watson will be punished for his role in attempting to further the international drug trade U.S aircraft.' Watson will be sentenced in January and faces at least 10 years in prison, but could face a heftier sentence. He will also be fined between $20,000 (£12,350) and $10million (£6.18million). Haul: Watson was attempting to smuggle drugs from the Caribbean island of the Dominican Republic . The 48-year-old was jailed in 2003 after he was found guilty of trying to steal £1.5million worth of Spanish pesetas. His plan to stow away in the hold of a plane hidden in a wooden box was thwarted three years earlier, when baggage handlers dropped the box causing him to fall out onto the tarmac. He managed to flee Heathrow Airport and went on the run for three years, finally getting arrested when police took a DNA sample after he was stopped for drink driving.","Rawson Watson was caught with a tonne of cocaine trying to board a Belgium-bound plane .

Growth: The figures will be a boost for George Osborne, who has seen UK factory output but all other competitors . British manufacturers are on top of the world – outperforming rivals in the US, Europe and beyond, a report showed yesterday. Factory output in the UK in September grew faster than any other major global economy for a fourth month in a row, said researcher Markit. The news fuels hopes that Britain is on the road to a broad-based and sustainable recovery and are a further boost for David Cameron and George Osborne. Official figures published later this month are also expected to show that the economy has grown by at least 1 per cent in the last three months. Markit’s closely-watched index of activity for UK manufacturers, where scores above 50 represent growth, eased from a two-and-a-half year high of 57.1 in August to 56.7 in September. Despite the slight drop, it is still the strongest performance of any of the 25 economies covered by the report, beating 52.8 in the United States, 51.1 in Germany and 49.8 in France. Canada, Ireland, Japan and the so-called BRIC economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China also lagged behind the UK. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: ‘The fastest growth was seen in the UK, which led the worldwide growth rankings for the fourth successive month.’ The firm said UK manufacturing output is likely to have risen by between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of the year – up from 0.9 per cent in the second quarter and the best performance since mid-2010. Booming: Despite a drop in 2009 The manufacturing sector is growing and looks set to continue to going upward as UK factory output increases . In a further boost to the Chancellor – whose 2011 promise that the economy would be ‘carried aloft by the march of the makers’ looked for a long time to be falling flat – employment in Britain’s factories grew at its fastest pace last month for more than two years. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, added: ‘UK manufacturing continues to boom, adding to the flow of upbeat data which suggest that the economy is growing faster than almost anyone expected. Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured preparing for his conference keynote speech, will also be buoyed by the news while the economy looks to be improving . ‘Job creation is also on the rise, with manufacturers reporting the strongest employment growth since May 2010 as firms took on more staff to meet faster order book growth.’ Analysts said the domestic market was the main source of growth last month, although export orders also rose amid higher demand in the US, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Scandinavia, Latin America, Russia and Australia. Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics, said factory output could have grown by as much as 2 per cent in the third quarter of the year between July and September. ‘With manufacturing output still some 10 per cent below its pre-recession peak, there remains the potential for a period of strong catch-up growth ahead,’ he said. Lee Hopley, of the manufacturers’ organisation EEF, said it was ‘another solid month for manufacturing’. He added: ‘The good run of indicators should continue beyond the end of this year with some expansion in manufacturing taking place in Europe, Asia and the US.’ George Buckley, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, predicted that the next batch of official figures would show a resurgent British economy, with gross domestic product up from 0.7 per cent to 1 per cent in the third quarter. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg Bank, added: ‘The economy should see a very strong second half of the year.’","British manufacturers have beaten rivals in Europe and the United States .

US home prices rose 12.4 per cent in August from a year ago, the second straight month to post such a gain. Despite a second straight strong year on year gain, experts fear the housing recovery may be peaking as mortgage rates rise and month to month gains are slowing. Home prices rose 0.9 per cent from July to August, compared to a 1.8 per cent rise from June to July, according to CoreLogic, a data and analytics company. On the rise: Home prices continue to rise as supplies fail to meet demand in many areas . Home prices rose in every state and in 99 out of the 100 metro areas surveyed by CoreLogic, the one exception being Akron, OH – which reported a decline. This report came on the back of a 12.4 per cent rise in home prices the previous month, compared to a year ago, according to the Standard &Poor's/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index. All 20 cities surveyed posted gains from both the previous month and compared with a year ago.Despite the continuing upward trend in home prices, the month to month numbers aren’t as bullish, a trend experts see continuing into the coming months. As mortgage rates continue to rise, they are a full point higher than in May, and more homes are built, the supply should catch up to the demand in many locales, according to Stan Humphries, chief economist for Zillow. Sold!: Home sales have risen 12.4 per cent in each of the last two months . ‘This ongoing moderation is good for the market overall,’ Mr Humphries added. The average 30-year mortgage rate was 4.3 per cent last week, according to Freddie Mac. That’s s light drop from the 4.5 per cent rate seen last week and the 4.58 per cent high seen last month. Some analysts feel they may drop further after the Fed announced last month it would continue quantitative easing – federal buying of toxic bonds and mortgage backed securities. Mortgage rates are expected to rise once quantitative easing comes to an end, perhaps as early as this year.","The rise in home sales was likely fueled by historically low mortgage rates .

Balding: A cockatoo called Lollibaby was rescued from a meth-lab home in Morgan County, Tennesee where the effects of the toxic chemicals had caused her feathers to fall out . It appears that Lollibaby's feathers have fallen out due to the methamphetamine being cooked at the home - a very visual sign of the dangers of the volatile drug. For every part of meth that is made, five parts of toxic waste are left behind, according to experts at Susquehanna Valley Center. The . toxins in the chemical formula used to cook the addictive . drug are known to cause hair loss and 'meth-mouth', the loss of teeth. Many . meth users claw at their skin until they are covered in bleeding, open . sores as the drug can cause a sensation that is describe like bugs . crawling under the skin. Meth also leads to risk of long-term depression, brain damage, strokes, cardiac arrest and ultimately, death. Meth, known as 'poor man's cocaine', is cooked in makeshift labs that can be set up at home. The drug is made with a mixture of household ingredients and takes a heavy toll on the health, with both psychological and physical deterioration in users. Living in a home with a meth lab, or even nearby, is even more damaging to children and pets because their bodies have smaller masses to absorb toxins. Joseph Clapp, who works at the pet store, told WBIR: 'We're trying to get her back to health. 'It's going to be six to eight months, and it may take longer than that because we're just not sure.' He added: 'Imagine what [meth] does to children, and [with] birds and animals, it can still have an effect.' Lollibaby is making daily improvements, according to the pet store who are fundraising for her long-term care. The pet bird will not be put up for adoption. Employees at the store say the cockatoo's appetite is getting better by the day and they have moved her to a larger cage.

An exotic species of lime is being grown in the UK for the first time - and it's bright red. The striking fruit, dubbed the Red Lime, is the same size and shape as the usual green variety. However, it combines orange and sour lime flavours - making it the ideal addition to marmalade, Tequila and other drinks. Striking: The Red Lime is the same size and shape as the usual green variety, but it combines orange and sour lime flavours . New: The unusual crop, which is native to India, is being grown in Britain for the first time . The unusual crop, which is native to India, is known by a variety of names across the world, including a rangpur, lemandarin, canton lemon, sylhet lime and limao cravo. It is believed to have been made by crossing a lemon with a mandarin plant. Red Lime trees are now being sold in Britain for the first time. They can be grown in a sheltered pot on a patio area or in a tub inside a conservatory. A spokesman from Suttons Seeds in Devon -  which has a collection of Red Lime trees on sale - said: 'This is the first time the Red Lime has been introduced to the UK as a tree that can be grown. 'The peel is reddish-orange, with large oil glands that are thin and easily removed, and the pulp has a limelike aroma. 'It is a deep orange colour with eight to 10 segments having tender walls and separating readily from each other. 'It is very juicy and has a flavour like a lime crossed with marmalade orange.' She added: 'Small, whole fruits can be . candied or pickled, but the Red Lime is not fully appreciated until it . is made into marmalade. Unique: The exotic species is very different in appearance from the traditional green lime (above) 'This product is superb and rivals or excels that made from the sour orange.' The Red Lime tree is believed to have been first recorded by Victorian botanist Sir Joseph . Hooker, who was exploring the foot of the Himalayas, from Gurhwal to the . Khasisa Hills. It is a very fast-growing plant and can reach up to 20ft. The Red Lime is the latest hybrid fruit creation to hit the UK. Last May, supermarkets took stock of the 'papple' - a mixture of a pear and an apple. The fruit, which is native to New Zealand, is said to taste like an apple, but has the skin and texture of a pear. Hybrid: The 'papple' tastes like an apple, but has the skin and texture of a pear . And three months later, Marks and Spencer launched the ‘grango’ - a variety of grape that tastes of mango. The unusual crop, which is known for its super sweet taste, is developed in south-east Spain. It is believed to develop its sweetness from the country's warm climate - with the cooler temperatures at night giving it a firm mango-like texture . In 2011, a Washington-based fruit grower unveiled another variant of grape - the 'grapple' - which looks and crunches like a regular apple, but tastes like a grape. The phenonenom for fruit tampering has even spread further afield, with Israeli horticulturalists creating a 'black galaxy' crossbreed of tomato which has almost-black skin.","The exotic species of fruit, dubbed the Red Lime, is a striking red colour .

The Women’s Institute has spent years trying to shake off the ‘jam and Jerusalem’ image. But it is now at the heart of a boom in jam-making. New members are joining local groups to learn the traditional skill, helping to fuel soaring demand for the equipment needed. Sales of preserving jars, thermometers, jam funnels, boiling pans and gingham jar labels have increased by 2,000 per cent this year, Homebase announced yesterday. And there has never been a better time to learn, with Britain having enjoyed a glut of summer fruits – thanks to the heatwave that followed a wet spring – and the Daily Mail giving away How To Make Jam recipe cards every day this week. Janice Langley, chairman of the National Federation of Women’s Institutes, whose members preserved over 5,300 tons of fruit between 1940 and 1945 to help provide food for the nation during the Second World War, was encouraged to see a resurgence in jam-making. ‘The recent glut of fruit will hopefully encourage more people to try making their own jam for the first time and see how easy it is to make the most of our great local produce,’ she said. ‘Many new WI members tell us that they decided to join the organisation to learn traditional skills.’ Rosemary Jameson, director of The Guild of Jam and Preserve Makers, said attendance at jam-making classes had risen significantly. ‘Whereas people used to come and see it as a bit lightweight and just something to try once which they hadn’t done before, now they are taking it seriously because they want to know what is in their food and where it comes from,’ she said. ‘The rising interest is great. People want to be engaged with what they are eating nowadays. ‘Eating something you’ve made yourself not only satisfies your appetite but nourishes you in other ways because it holds memories of the day you made it, which makes it more special.’ As well as the record crops of cherries, . plums, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries and apples reported all . over the UK this year, sugar supplier Silver Spoon has enjoyed a surge . in sales of jam sugar. Good year: Record crops of many British fruit including strawberries have also helped contribute to the surge . ‘As a result of the excellent weather, we have seen a rise in the quality and affordability of fresh fruit,’ its marketing director Tony Lucas told The Grocer magazine. ‘Consumers are taking advantage of the fruit harvest to produce jam as a simple and cost-effective summer recipe.’ Homebase Cookshop buyer Mathew Nicholas suggested that today’s generation are eager to return to the habits of their parents and grandparents. ‘Things may be tough but in true stiff-upper lip style, the British nation has clearly decided that there will always be strawberry jam for tea,’ he said. Will Torrent, an award-winning pastry chef and food consultant, is another convert. ‘Jam-making is one of those things that couldn’t be more British. Picking those wonderful fruits whether in summer or winter and turning them into something you can treasure and enjoy for months to come is priceless,’ he said. ‘I love making jam and the satisfaction you get when you bite into a slice of homemade Victoria sponge with some homemade jam is just heavenly.’","Sales of preserving jars, thermometers, .

Questions have emerged over whether the world record for the most people simultaneously twerking was set on Wednesday - after claims it was actually set last month by nearly 2,000 people. The Guinness World Records verified yesterday's attempt in New York's Herald Square, where 358 people - including a 73-year-old woman - gyrated and bounced for two minutes straight. But in August, 1,945 people were filmed twerking at the same time on the Teen Choice Awards in Los Angeles and it was verified by world record-certifying website RecordSetter.com. Participants were required 'to shake their hips in an up and down bounce motion' and had to 'twerk in unison for at least five seconds' in order to set the record. Real record? Nearly 2,000 people twerked at the same time during the Teen Choice Awards, according to RecordSetter.com, which far surpasses the 358 people in New York on Wednesday . Record: People take part in ""TWERKERS"", an event organized to break the Guinness World Record for largest number of people to perform a twerking, in New York . When the co-founders of RecordSetter.com learned about Wednesday's 'new' record, they were stunned that it had claimed the title, they told The Daily Beast. 'We were surprised to see Guinness recognize today's twerking event as a world record,' co-founder Dan Rollman said. 'While their category title was slightly different and rules varied slightly on performance style and length of dance time, the categories are, in essence, nearly identical.' He added that although he admires Guinness, he believes that calling their event 'a legitimate world record' is simply not true. But Guinness World Records said they had never received a proposal for the attempt made at the Teen Choice Awards so did not consider it the record. Jamie Panas, a PR manager with the Guinness World Records, told the Daily Beast: 'As every Guinness World Records proposal is accompanied by its own set of guidelines which the participants must adhere to, we cannot thoroughly assess whether or not a record was set as we were not involved.

Here's to Barney, a great pal' next to a picture of the pair. Barney was inseparable from the president and his wife, Laura, before he died from lymphoma at 12-and-a-half years old in February. At the time of his death, Bush said: 'He never discussed politics and was always a faithful friend. Laura and I will miss our pal.' During his eight-year tenure in the White House by his master's side, the well-groomed, coal-black pooch starred in ‘BarneyCam’ short films produced by the staff, gave tours of the presidential residence and greeted heads of state. 'He was always polite and never jumped in their laps,' Bush wrote of the four-legged host.

The feisty pet also took a bite out of Boston Celtics public relations director Heather Walker in 2009. Barney had seen his fair share of criticism. Republican strategist Karl Rove jokingly dubbed him a ‘lump’, while Russian President Vladimir Putin said a world leader should own big, not small dogs, Today.com reported. As well as his stays at the White House, Barney also used to accompany Mr Bush when he fished for bass at the family ranch in Crawford, Texas, and was said to have been a ‘fierce armadillo hunter.’ On trips to Camp David, the former president said Barney’s favorite activity was chasing golf balls on the chipping green.'

According to his official biography on President Bush's White House site, Barney was born September 30, 2000, in New Jersey. His mother was a Scottish Terrier named Coors who was owned by former Environmental Protection Agency Director Christine Todd Whitman. According to Politico, Barney is survived by the Bush clan's other Scottish Terrier, Miss Beazley and a cat named Bob. Mr Bush is far from the first American President to have a dog by his side while in the White House. His father, George H. W. Bush, was so attached to his springer spaniel Millie that he had his White House carpenters build a custom birthing box when she became pregnant. George Washington had his pack of hunting hounds, while Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Scottish terrier Fala, once dubbed Big Boy, would often attend galas with him. First dog: Barney, pet terrier of the U.S. first family, walks away from a group picture of the Bush family as they watch the 2004 election results .

Fixture: During his eight-years tenure in the White House, Barney could often be seen roaming the grounds surrounding the White House, including the Rose Garden (pictured) President Calvin Coolidge was also a well-known animal lover. He had in his menagerie six dogs, a bobcat, a goose, a donkey, a cat, two lion cubs, an antelope, a wallaby and a raccoon named Rebecca who walked on a leash. His most famous pet, however, was a pygmy hippo, given to him as a gift by tire mogul Harvey Firestone. Other unusual presidential pets include John Q. Adams' alligator, who he kept in the in a bathroom of the East Room, Woodrow Wilson's pet ram, who enjoyed chewing tobacco, and Lyndon B. Johnson's three-legged dog named Loki.

Four would-be cowboys have brought the wild-west to Brazil with their brazen robberies on horseback. The underage buckaroos, said to be between 13 and 16 years old, were caught on security cameras mugging two terrified women of their purses and shopping in the town of Fortaleza, north east Brazi . The two elderly victims, who have just come out of the supermarket with their shopping bags, are seen cowering on the pavement and trying to run backwards as a horse trots around the corner with an accomplice running on foot behind. Approach: The robbers turn up on their horses and come across an elderly woman standing in the doorway . Reaction: Another women follows out of the door and they spot the teenagers trotting towards them . As the women panic they drop their shopping and, while one manages to escape, the horse-back rider traps the other using his horse to herd her to the wall. Petrified, the woman gives up her goods, shoving the bags into the outstretched arms of the bandit and runs for her life. The side-kick gathers up the loot, leaving much of it behind on the floor, then the scramble is on to saddle-up and get-away with the booty. But first attempts to make a ‘giddy-up’ escape are comical, as the accomplice is a bit of a handicap. He clumsily clambers onto the horse, slipping off several times and nearly dismounts the rider off the bronco. Raising an arm as if they've won the Epsom Derby, the horsemen make their get-away at a slow canter. Run! One of the women manages to escape by scrambling across the pavement to the other side of the road . Panic: One of the women drops their bags on the pavement and one of the thieves reaches down to pick it up . Tussle: The remaining woman tries to save her shopping but the robber has a stronger grasp . Minutes earlier, the security cameras had captured the start of the incident, showing the would-be posse of four buffalo bills on two mules plodding menacingly towards the two female shoppers. Deyse Herbster, a housewife, who lives nearby saw the hold-up and said: 'I thought it was a joke at first with the boys on their horses just approaching the women for a laugh. But when I heard the women scream for help I realised it was serious.' According to locals, this is not the first time that the brazen bandits have attacked passers-by. Going: The robbers begin their getaway, but have left some of the stolen shopping lying on the pavement . Gone: The robbers gallop down the road with the stolen handbags . 'This has been happening for a while and they still haven’t been caught,' said one local, who didn’t want to be named. 'I hardly go out anymore because I’m so afraid,' said housewife, Tassila Maria Menezes de Castro. 'When I do go out, I can’t see a horse without feeling scared.' Police say they are still looking to roundup the culprits. Fortaleza’s military police officer, Francisco Luciano Coelho said: 'You can be sure that once we identify who they are they will be put in jail. Some of the town's residents have, however, found the episodes somewhat funny and are now calling the shopping  ‘rustlers’  junior Zorro bandits.","The four would-be cowboys were said to be between 13 and 16 years old .

Thunder and torrential downpours are due to batter the country tomorrow, with more than a week’s rain expected to fall in just 24 hours. The Met Office has issued severe weather warnings over fears that hour-long bursts of rain across southern England and Wales could cause localised flooding. In particular, motorists are being urged to take care as a build-up of surface water will make for dangerous driving conditions. Wet wet wet: A fisherman braves the wild waves whipped up by strong south-easterly winds today along the North Sea coast at Sunderland, Tyne and Wear . Choppy: The North Sea coast at Sunderland. Short, sharp hour-long bursts of rain are expected across southern England and Wales on Thursday morning . Up to 2ins of rain – a third of October’s average – is forecast, with storms moving into the Midlands and the North later in the day. The sudden turn in the weather follows a drier than average September. Met Office spokeswoman Laura Young said: ‘We have included Wales, the North West and Midlands in our severe weather warning because we cannot be sure how quickly this front will pass through the country. ‘However, it is the bottom third of the UK – the South East and West of England, southern Wales and London – where we expect the worst of the weather. In the worst affected areas we could see 15 to 20mm fall in just one hour. Splash: A fisherman braves the waves at Sunderland.

Temperatures tomorrow, on Friday and into the weekend will stay around 14C in the North . 'Over the course of the day that would not be too much but all at once that can lead to surface level road flooding. ‘That means it will feel quite heavy at times and could lead to some localised flooding. We would advise motorists to take extra care on the roads and be sure to adjust to the difficult conditions. 'In the worst affected areas we could see 15 to 20mm fall in just one hour' Laura Young, Met Office forecaster . ‘In total there will be around 30 to 50mm of rainfall throughout the day, which if you consider that on average we only get around 150mm for the whole of October, is quite a lot. ‘We would also urge people to keep checking our website because, while the warning is only at yellow right now, there is always the chance it could be upgraded.’ She added: ‘It should clear by  Friday with parts of the country blessed with a splattering of sunshine throughout the weekend.’ The predicted downpours are in sharp contrast to last month, which was among the driest in recent years. Miss Young said: ‘We had around 30 per cent less rain last month than expected.

BlackBerry's new Z30 handset, pictured, has a 5-inch touchscreen, 25-hour battery life and new antenna designed for low-signal areas . BlackBerry has officially unveiled its next-generation touchscreen smartphone as it ramps up attempts to claw back its share of the market. Over the past year, BlackBerry has lost 7.5 per cent of its share in the UK to rivals Android, iOS and Windows Phone. The BlackBerry Z30 comes with a 5-inch screen and the largest battery ever to be built into a BlackBerry handset, which the company claims makes the device last for around 25 hours. New antenna technology has also been added, designed to boost signal in areas where reception is low. BlackBerry’s announcement comes just days before Apple’s new iPhones hits shelves on Friday. Findings from market research firm Kantar Worldpanel ComTech show BlackBerry was the third most popular operating system this time last year. However, the Candian-based firm now owns just 3.5 per cent of the share in the UK, down from 11 per cent. With the majority of rivals releasing full-touchsreen devices, BlackBerry has had to take a further step away from its trademark physical QWERTY design seen on previous models. The five-inch Super AMOLED Display is . powered by a 1.7 GHz processor with quadcore graphics that 'makes . browsing web pages faster and games more detailed.' BlackBerry's Z30 also has the firm's Priority Hub built in, which works in a similar way to the notification centres of Android and iOS but with more advanced features. Scroll down for video .

In the UK, Android has 55.2 per cent of the market share. This is ahead of iOS with 31.1 per cent. Windows Phone makes up 9.2 per cent of smartphone OS sales - up from 4.2 per during the same period last year. BlackBerry now accounts for 3.5 per cent, down from 11 per cent last year. For example, the hub is said to be . able to find and filter messages from a person's favourite contacts by . 'learning what conversations and what people are important'. In . theory, the more a phone is used, the better the hub becomes at knowing . which messages should be flagged and which can wait. This includes post . and messages across social networks. BlackBerry Messenger conversations now appear in any app. Users can swipe to dismiss them, or click to open them in the BBM app. The new antenna on the BlackBerry Z30 is said to tune reception in low-signal areas to make sure the user gets the fastest speeds possible. BlackBerry also claims that the new technology means fewer dropped calls. Elsewhere, the handset has a 2880 mAh battery - dubbed 'the largest battery ever built into a BlackBerry smartphone' - and combined with battery enhancements made to the BlackBerry 10 OS version 10.2, is said to be capable of lasting up to 25 hours.

But now the middle-classes are snapping up fake designer handbags, watches and DVDs. More than half of all consumers have admitted buying counterfeit goods, according to a recent study. The research was conducted by consultants from PwC who wanted to explore public attitudes towards the growth in industry of counterfeiting. Buying fake goods used to be preserve of Del Boy-style wheeler-dealers but has now 'gone mainstream' according to a new survey on attitudes to the counterfeiting industry . They concluded fake goods ‘have gone mainstream’, leaving manufacturers of the genuine articles out of pocket. While 90 per cent of the public said they considered buying fake goods ‘morally wrong’, it did not stop them acquiring a knock-off watch or Gucci handbag. In total, 53 per cent of consumers admitted they had bought counterfeit goods – many blaming the fact they could not afford the real thing. Young people were the worst offenders, with almost two thirds buying fakes such as jewellery and designer clothes. Affluent professional and managerial classes were just as likely to buy fakes as unskilled workers and those on benefits. Londoners and people from Northern Ireland were found to be the worst offenders, with Scots the least likely to give in to temptation. More than half of all consumers have admitted buying counterfeit goods, such as DVDs (file picture) Fake designer watches and bags were also popular buys as people cannot afford the real thing (file picture) Mark James, head of anti-counterfeiting . at PwC, told The Times newspaper technological advances and more . fragmented supply chains were behind the fake goods flooding Britain. He said: ‘Just as it has never been easier to start your own business, it has also never been easier to start your own counterfeiting business. ‘Not surprisingly, the study found that most people go to the internet to buy fakes, where things are harder to track.’ One of the key drivers behind fake designer clothing and footwear was identified as the rise in the number of websites claiming to offer ‘discount’ or ‘cheap’ luxury goods. Shoppers are even advised of the best sellers of counterfeit goods on some of the sites. Mr James added that the British public seemed to be unaware that buying the occasional fake could do any harm. He said: ‘Consumers are just not thinking of it in those terms. Even when they are asked about deterrents, being caught and the morality of it come behind safety, the fear of losing bank details and the product not being delivered. ‘But there is a cost. Companies are having their reputations, their brands and their revenues stolen and that has a knock-on effect on jobs.’ The Government estimates that counterfeiting costs the economy £1.3 billion a year.","Survey by PwC found more than half of people say they bought fake goods .

British teenagers are too lazy to do the ‘menial’ jobs snapped up by immigrant workers which keep the economy moving, Boris Johnson claimed today. In a highly-provocative intervention, the London Mayor backed TV chef Jamie Oliver who complained about ‘wet behind the ears’ youngsters who ‘whinge’ about working long hours. Mr Johnson said that far from being ‘apoplectic’ at the claims, he was left ‘vaguely depressed’ by the fact that too many young Brits lacked the drive to seize every opportunity which comes their way. Scroll down for video . Good point: Boris Johnson told the Tory party conference that too many young Brits view some jobs as too 'menial' for them to accept . Question: The London Mayor suggested some young Londoners ate not always able and willing to take up opportunities . In a speech to the Conservative party conference, Mr Johnson said he knew he had ‘probably got myself in trouble’ with his criticism of youngsters, adding: ‘But then, that is my job.’ He told delegates: ‘This is where the speech gets tricky - the question we have got to ask ourselves is: are young Londoners always able and willing to take up opportunities in the opportunity city that we are trying to create?’ He said Oliver 'had a point' when he complained that European immigrants were 'much stronger, much tougher' than Brits and warned his restaurants would close without them. Mr Johnson said more needed to be done to persuade youngsters to view the low-paid, low-skilled jobs which London . creates in such abundance as 'stepping stones, as a beginning to a life in . work that can take them anywhere'. Boris Johnson . At the 2006 Tory conference, Mr Johnson fell out with Jamie Oliver over the chef’s campaign to make school meals healthier. Addresing . David Cameron in the conference hall today, Mr Johnson said: ‘Dave, I . have made it a rule of these conferences never to disagree with Jamie . Oliver, because last time I did so I was put in a pen and pelted with . pork pies by the media. ‘But . the other day he said something that made me gulp because he was . complaining about the work ethic of young people these days.’ Agreement: The London Mayor backed TV chef Jamie Oliver who complained about 'wet behind the ears' youngsters who ‘whinge’ about working long hours . Recognition: Mr Johnson said he could see 'looks of sad acknowledgement' on the faces of the audience as he read out Mr Oliver's remarks . Gulp: Mr Johnson said he knew he was going to get into trouble with his speech, but added: 'That's my job' In an interview with Good Housekeeping in the summer, Oliver said: ‘The average working hours in a week was 80 to 100. That was really normal in my 20s. But the EU regulation now is 48 hours, which is half a week's work for me. And they still whinge about it. ‘British kids particularly, I have never seen anything so wet behind the ears! ‘I have mummies phoning up for 23-year-olds saying to me, 'My son is too tired'. On a 48-hour-week! Are you having a laugh?' TV chef Jamie Oliver . Oliver added: ‘I think our European . immigrant friends are much stronger, much tougher. If we didn't have . any, all of my restaurants would close tomorrow. There wouldn't be any . Brits to replace them.’ Turning . to the conference audience, Mr Johnson said: ‘I am seeing looks of . apoplectic… no actually I can’t. I can see looks of sad acknowledgement. I can see a vague depressed look of recognition. ‘I . know and you know that there are millions of British kids who are as . dynamic and young people are as dynamic and go-getting and motivated as . any potential millionaire masterchef, of course there are. ‘But my question is what if Jamie has a point, what if he has half a point, or even a quarter of a point.’ Controversy: Mr Johnson said Jamie Oliver may have phrased his attack in a 'provocative way' but admitted he was on to something . Future: Welfare, crime and education reforms are needed to better prepare young people for the jobs market . Applause: While Mr Johnson's speech was more downbeat in previous years, he received a standing ovation from delegates . Asking the audience if they agreed with Oliver, they shouted back: ‘Yes!’ Mr Johnson added: ‘He is on to something. He may have phrased it in a provocative way but he was saying something that I think resonates, right? ‘But if he has a point then we need to think about what are the possible origins for that difference in motivation that he claims to detect. ‘We need to think about what we politicians are doing about it. If it is to do with welfare as some people say it is then don’t we need Iain Duncan Smith to get on with reforming that system. ‘And if it’s to do with education as some people think it is then don’t we need Michael Gove to get on with his heroic work restoring rigour and realism to the classroom. ‘And getting away from the all must have prizes approach where all pupils must be above average in maths.’ Laughs: David Cameron was in the audience for Mr Johnson's joke-filled speech . Challenge: Mr Johnson said more needed to be done for young people to 'harness their talents more effectively' Fans: Mr Johnson has been the centre of attention since arriving in Manchester for the Tory conference . He said young people also need ‘boundaries’ and ‘solidity to their lives’ to stop them falling into unemployment and crime. ‘We have got to tackle that complex of problems, crime, welfareism, educational underachievement. ‘And you’ve got to make sure that kids growing up in London are able to take the opportunities that our city offers and at the same time we must make sure that they don’t dismiss some jobs as “menial” which is a word I sometimes hear. ‘And they see them - those jobs which London creates in such abundance in the same way as Jamie Oliver’s eastern Europeans see them – as stepping stones, as a beginning to a life in work that can take them anywhere. ‘I think there is a vast and latent genius in these young people and if could harness their talents more effectively then they would not only have more fulfilling lives but we could drive even faster the great flywheel of the London economy that is now the most diverse in Europe.’ London Mayor Boris Johnson admitted he was 'fudging' his response to questions about his political ambitions . Boris Johnson has admitted that he is 'fudging' over whether he could make a return to the Commons at the general election. There has been growing speculation that the mayor of London could become an MP again before the end of his term in 2016. David Cameron fuelled the rumours by disclosing that he had discussed the idea with Mr Johnson. The Prime Minister told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the mayor could 'absolutely' make a comeback before the country goes to the polls in 17 months' time, and said he would give him a 'warm welcome'. Mr Johnson was mobbed by media and Tory activists as he toured the exhibition hall at the party's conference in Manchester. During a round of broadcast interviews, he was asked by BBC Radio 5 Live whether he was determined to keep fudging his answers on whether he wanted to return as an MP in 2015. 'Yes,' he replied to laughter. Mr Johnson, who served as member for Henley until 2008, dodged a barrage of questions about the possibility of serving as mayor and an MP at the same time. Stressing his commitment to his current role - to which he was re-elected last year - Mr Johnson said: 'I have got a huge job to do... I am going to give it my all. 'I don't want to leave office until some of the things we have got going are absolutely in the bag. 'The programme is to be mayor of London for the next 750 days, or whatever it is.' Asked which parliamentary seats he could look at if he did seek a return, Mr Johnson said: 'The seat I want, I can describe it to you, it has a spongey bottom bit and it swivels and it is to be discovered in the office at City Hall.' The mayor said Mr Cameron's words about him were 'very kind', but insisted the Tory leader was capable of winning the general election without his help. 'I am a toenail in the body politic,' he joked.","Mayor backs TV chef's attack on youngsters who 'whinge' about work .

Tour operator Thomas Cook has ditched the globe logo it first used in 1880, replacing it with a 'Sunny Heart', as the tour operator continues its recovery from near collapse. The 172-year-old firm unveiled the design alongside a new slogan - 'Let's Go' - spelling the end for its famous motto 'Don't just book it, Thomas Cook it.' The rebranding is part of a root-and-branch overhaul by new boss Harriet Green, who was recruited last year to save the household name from collapse, after it was bailed out by its banks. Rebrand: The new 'Sunny Heart' logo will be rolled out in high street stores, hotels, websites and brochures in 70 countries. It will feature alongside Thomas Cook's new slogan 'Let's Go' The tour operator had been battered by weak consumer confidence in Europe and disruption to holiday destinations such as Egypt, amid the political upheaval of the Arab Spring. It was eventually forced to cut 2600 jobs and shut some 195 High Street travel agencies as part of Ms Green's survival plan. The switch to the Sunny Heart follows a year-long trial in Scandinavia, which the firm said met with a positive response from Danes, Finns, Swedes and Norwegians. End of the world: The tour operator has ditched the globe logo it first used in 1880 as it continues its recovery from near collapse . Swedish agency Happy, which also worked on the branding of this year's Eurovision Song Contest, came up with the design. Neither Happy nor Thomas Cook would reveal how much it paid for the new logo, with a spokesman saying only that the cost was 'minimal'. But the cost of rebranding hotels, High Street stores, websites and brochures in 70 countries - including the removal of the 'globe' logo first used in 1880 - could run into the millions, according to travel analysts. New 'Sunny Heart' decals were fitted last night to a Boeing 757, which became the first of the firm's planes to take to the skies bearing the new logo as it flew from Manchester to Greek resort Santorini. Videos accompanying the launch showed holidaymakers at an airport baggage carousel being encouraged to make a 'heart' gesture with their hands. The symbol is similar to the goal celebration used by Welsh footballer Gareth Bale, sold by Tottenham Hotspur to Real Madrid for a world record £86million this summer. Mr Bale has trademarked the gesture, but Thomas Cook said it was 'comfortable' with its legal position in using it in promotional videos. Ms Green has been trying to cut costs . and will follow up the logo change with a bonfire of brands deemed . surplus to requirements, whittling down some 30 different names to just . eight. Alike: The symbol is similar to the goal celebration used by Welsh footballer Gareth Bale (pictured), who was sold by Tottenham Hotspur to Real Madrid for a world record £86million this summer . The changes mark a new chapter in a history dating back to 1841, when former Baptist preacher Thomas Cook began running tours for members of the anti-alcohol temperance movement. While Thomas Cook turned to a Swedish agency for the Sunny Heart idea, industry sources said the final version had to be tweaked by the firm's own marketing team. The design was made 'a little plumper' compared to the original and has also been 'irradiated' by adding a sparkle of light. The new logo was tested in Scandinavia because the region was one of the few parts of Thomas Cook's global empire that was performing very well a year ago, when the trial began. It was felt that the British business had too many other distractions to be the testing ground for a new brand. Positive response: The switch to the Sunny Heart follows a year-long trial in Scandinavia, which Thomas Cook said received positive feedback from Danes, Finns, Swedes and Norwegians .","Thomas Cook has ditched the globe logo it first used in 1880 .

Criticism: JP Alan Bissell has claimed too many crimes are being dealt with by police caution . A magistrate who is retiring after 25 years of service has criticised the justice system for failing to properly punish criminals. Alan Bissell said JPs are now forced to place too much emphasis on rehabilitation. He also hit out at the increasing number of criminal cases which never end up in court and are instead dealt with by a caution. Speaking out on his last day as a magistrate, he explained that punishment has ‘diminished to the point where it hardly features these days’. He added: ‘Rehabilitation is washing over everything. Although it has its place, clearly, I am personally dismayed that the work of the court has diminished to the extent that it has. ‘It dismays me that so much of the work that should be before the court is being handled by the police in terms of cautions.’ He claimed serious cases were being dealt with ‘in their thousands and thousands’ every day by cautions. Mr Bissell, 70, spent most of his working life as a civil servant in London. He moved to North Wales in the 1980s and was appointed a magistrate in November 1989, sitting initially at Flint and then at Mold. He made the comments at Flintshire magistrates’ court where colleagues gathered to pay tribute to his work as a justice. In his speech he criticised successive governments that promised to get tough with sentencing but whose policies had ‘all come to naught’. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling last week said he was appalled that crimes including rape and drug dealing were being dealt with by cautions. He plans to issue new guidance that will effectively ban officers from using cautions for the most serious offences. Born in Sheen, Richmond-on-Thames, Mr Bissell spent most of his working life as a civil servant based in St James’s Square in London. Failure: Alan Bissell said too much emphasis was being placed on rehabilitation in favour of punishment . In the mid 60s and early 70s he worked in the private office of four successive Government ministers - Ray Gunter, Barbara Castle, Robert Carr and Maurice MacMillan Jnr. In the summer of 1965 he drove an authentic, privately-owned London double-decker bus across France to Basle in Switzerland. He also drove the same bus in the film ‘To Sir With Love’ with Sidney Poitier and Lulu, which was filmed in the east end of London; and also in several episodes of the TV series ‘The Persuaders’, starring Roger Moore and Tony Curtis. During his time as a magistrate, Mr Bissell dealt with some colourful cases, including a superstitious drink driver who blamed a magpie for a crash. He also told on defendant, who had crossed into Wales from Liverpool to steal whisky in 2005: ‘It is often said that we take great exception to people who come marauding across the border to thieve. ‘We are quite clear in our minds that is why you came over and why you were there. ‘We have been told it was an act of stupidity on your part. It certainly was, and you will have to be sentenced for that stupidity today.’ Mr Bissell also ordered a farmer who terrified a group of ramblers, including a blind man, with a hedge-cutter to attend a year-long anger management course.","JP claims serious cases are being dealt with in their thousands by cautions .

The policy, a Tory manifesto commitment, would see the surety paid by temporary immigrants from high-risk countries – and the money would then be seized if they failed to leave. She said: ‘Our drive to cut immigration has been so successful that even the Liberal Democrats are boasting about it in their campaign handbook. ‘I don’t remember their enthusiasm for cutting immigration when we worked on the policies – so I’m going to take this with me next time they try to block our reforms. ‘The latest policy they’re fighting is immigration bonds. It’s a simple idea – the Government should be able to take a £3,000 deposit from temporary migrants and return it when they leave. If they overstay their visa, they’ll lose their money.’ She added: ‘Bonds were in our manifesto at the last election. But the Lib Dems suddenly announced that it was their idea. ‘Then they said they were against them. Then they said they were for them – but only to help more immigrants to come here. Now they say they’re against them after all. They were for them, then they were against them, then they were for them and now they’re against them. ‘Confused? Don’t be – the simple conclusion is you can only trust the Conservatives on immigration.’ Mrs . May’s Cabinet colleague Chris Grayling also used his speech to . criticise the Lib Dems, questioning the party’s opposition to human . rights reform. He said: ‘I . don’t know why. It’s blindingly obvious the public want change. I simply . don’t believe that the majority of the people in this country think . that human rights laws are fine as they are.’ Mr . Grayling announced that next year ministers will publish a draft bill . setting out how a Tory government would give the Supreme Court primacy . over Strasbourg rulings. He said: ‘Our Supreme Court should be in . Britain and not in Strasbourg. And under a Conservative government it . will be.’ Critical: The Home Secretary said the Lib Dems took credit for immigration bonds, while seeking to block them behind the scenes .","Lib Dem campaign handbook boasted about cuts in net migration since the election, May said in Manchester today .

Supermarket giant Tesco today revealed its profits have plunged by almost a quarter in the past six months. The UK's biggest retailer says its efforts to turn around its struggling business are working despite the 24.5 per cent pre-tax slump from £1.8billion to £1.39billion. It shares fell by three per cent - down 11p to £3.47 each - as the markets opened in London this morning. Troubled half-year: Tesco reported a 24.5 per cent drop in group pre-tax profits to £1.39 billion in the six months to August 24 . Tesco has blamed restructuring costs and . steep profit falls across Europe and Asia, while main rival Sainsbury's . has gone from strength to strength.

But questions are being raised over the turnaround plans as Tesco battles to stem a continuing decline in its market share.

Mr Clarke said: 'Despite continuing challenges, we have made further progress on . our strategic priorities. 'Our performance in the UK has strengthened . through the half, particularly in our food business, as we have . continued our work to Build a Better Tesco,' he added. The group . suffered a 71 per cent tumble in European trading profits to £55million in the . first half to August 24 and admitted the hit was worse than expected . after conditions worsened in countries such as Ireland, Turkey and . Poland. Profits also fell sharply across Asia, down 12.4 per cent to £314 million, excluding China. Tesco admitted the overseas woes would offset some of the benefit of its UK profits improvement over the full-year.

Jailed: Rapist Ashad Arif, 28, has been sentenced to life in prison for raping a teenager just six years after being jailed for an identical crime . A convicted rapist who was freed from prison and went on to carry out an identical attack on a teenager within three years has been jailed for life. Arshad Arif was considered to be at a high risk of re-offending when he was released from prison after serving five years for his first rape attack and was regularly visited by police. Within three years of his release and just a week after a police officer's quarterly visits he carried out his second rape on a teenage girl. A Judge today branded Arif dangerous and . told him that he would have to serve a minimum of six-and-a-half years . behind bars before he could be considered for release. Reading Crown Court heard his 17-year-old victim was trying to make her way home after losing her handbag on a night out when 28-year-old Arif let her use his mobile phone to contact her family before offering her a lift in a taxi. But instead of taking her home, Arif took her to a muddy park 25 miles away where he raped her twice. The girl managed to escape and her attacker was tracked down by police by the mobile phone he had let the girl use before the attack. Judge Zoe Smith said: 'In November last year the girl was 17-years-of-age and particularly petite. 'On November 25 she had gone to a club with friends for one of their birthdays where she became confused by alcohol and became separated from her friends. 'At about 2am she found herself outside the club without her bag, without her coat or phone and she found herself unable to return inside. 'Mr Arif had gone to Watford on that night to hang about the clubs there. 'At about 2.50am you saw the girl as you walked past the club. She was standing outside and you approached her. 'You allowed her to use your phone and offered to take her home by taxi although she had just used your phone to call her mother. 'You could be seen on CCTV part carrying her part dragging her away from the club. Court case: Judge Zoe Smith, sitting at Reading Crown Court, pictured, said she considered Arif to pose a high risk of serious harm to the public . 'On arrival in Slough you half carried her, half dragged her into Salt Hill Park.' The court heard Arif then twice raped her in the park. The girl eventually escaped, jumped over a wall at a nearby house and hammered on the door to raise the alarm. Arif was identified after police traced the number the schoolgirl had used to phone her parents to the defendant. Forensic tests on a swab taken from the girl also revealed the presence of semen, which a DNA test showed was Arif’s. Jury members heard that in 2004 Arif had approached another drunken 17-year-old in the early morning, under the pretence of taking her home, and raped her in a flat. He admitted rape on the basis that sex was initially consensual and in 2006 was sentenced to five years in jail. Judge Smith said: 'I have come to the conclusion, even taking into account the basis of plea in the earlier matter, that you pose a high risk of serious harm to the public by committing further offences in the future and have reached the conclusion that the sentence must be imprisonment for life.' Arif, from Slough, Berkshire, showed no emotion as he was led to the cells. His young victim, who the court heard now suffered with nightmares and insomnia as a result of the attack, was not in court to see him jailed.","Arshad Arif was jailed for five years in 2006 for raping a 17-year-old girl .

Former Newsnight Economics Editor Paul Mason claims that social networking websites may become a more reliable source of news than the BBC . The BBC is led by a ‘patrician elite’ that fails to listen to its audiences, one of its former editors has claimed. Paul Mason – who was Newsnight’s economics editor for more than a decade - warned websites like Wikipedia and Twitter could soon become ‘more believable’ than BBC News because they are more receptive to corrections from readers. And he blamed an outmoded management culture for preventing the corporation from changing with the times, saying senior executives are more worried about ‘messing up’ than producing interesting programmes. Mason left the BBC in August to become culture and digital editor at rival broadcaster Channel 4. Before leaving, he used an interview with the BBC College of Journalism to launch a series of broadsides against his former employer. The 53-year-old journalist – who published a novel last year – said: ‘Editorial leadership at the BBC has become more modern since I joined 12 years ago. A more diverse set of people now get to be editorial leaders. But the organisation can still feel like it is set up to be led by a kind of patrician elite. ‘There can be a jarring sometimes between newer, younger editorial management and the way the organisation responds to commands and requests.’ He added: ‘The danger sometimes is that the signals that come from the top are “don’t mess up,” sometimes put a bit more forcefully, whereas the signals should be from the outside world, saying “you’re not ordinary enough, you’re not believable enough, you’re not innovating enough.” ‘If I said one thing on leaving this building, it would be: “become more receptive to those signals”.’ During his time at the BBC, Mason was a vocal critic of the corporation’s programme of cuts. Despite insisting the corporation still has a ‘global reputation for telling the truth and being impartial’, he warned it risked being overtaken by social networking sites. He said: ‘To many people Wikipedia is news; Twitter is a news service. Our problem is when Wikipedia and Twitter become more believable than the BBC because they sound more authentic. Or because they are better peer-reviewed in real time: ‘that’s wrong, change it’. They are both subject to more peer-review than BBC output.’ He added: ‘The problem we’ve got as public service broadcasters, is to produce stuff that engages them as well as BBC content did with the 1950’s and 60’s generations…things that make them go “wow, that is so true, and so like my life that I’ve got to watch this every day”.’ Mason is the second senior BBC journalist to leave in recent months. Last week, economics editor Stephanie Flanders announced she was leaving to become chief market strategist for JP Morgan Asset Management’s European unit on an estimated £400,000 salary.

Good news: Billy Connolly last night announced he had been given the all-clear from prostrate cancer . Billy Connolly has been given the all-clear from prostate cancer. The Scots comedian, affectionately known as the Big Yin, announced the news during a live television interview ahead of Celtic’s Champions League match against Barcelona last night. The 70-year-old star, who is an avid Celtic fan, travelled to Glasgow for the match from his home in New York. He told Sky Sports News yesterday: ‘My health - I got the clearance on Wednesday on my cancer so I’m OK.’ Last month it was revealed that Connolly, 70, had undergone surgery for the condition and was receiving treatment for the initial stages of Parkinson’s disease. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, second only to lung cancer in terms of how many it kills. Around 40,000 men a year are diagnosed with the illness. Former chatshow host Sir Michael Parkinson has also been battling the illness. The comedian’s announcement comes six weeks after it was revealed that Sir Michael is similarly expected to recover from the illness after completing a month of intensive radiotherapy. Connolly  underwent an operation in the US which was described as ‘a total success’, but doctors spotted signs of the shaking disorder. Parkinson’s affects 127,000 Britons and symptoms include tremors while the victim rests, rigidity of muscles, slowness of movement, unsteady balance and memory loss. Connolly’s spokesman revealed that, despite the setback, the star will continue with his work commitments. Lifelong fan: Connolly travelled to last night's Celtic match from his New York home. He was pictured here in 2007 when he was named patron of the club's charity association . She said last month: ‘Billy has been assured by experts that the findings will in no way inhibit or affect his ability to work, and he will start filming a TV series in the near future, as well as undertaking an extensive theatrical tour of New Zealand in the new year.’ Fans were concerned earlier this year when Connolly admitted he had started to forget his lines during performances. A show at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast in April was marred by forgetful moments where he asked the audience what he was talking about.","Much-loved comic watched Celtic in last night's Champions League clash .

Neither Maggie Flisher, 26, nor her husband Gavin, 31, have worked since the birth of their first child in 2005, and instead the couple collect around £27,000 a year in benefits. Now Mrs Flisher, who claims that she is 'super-fertile' which makes contraception impossible, has gloated shamelessly on the internet about 'haters' who criticise her state-subsidised life.

She wrote that working was 'a mug's game', adding: 'Why work when I can legally take your hard-earned money and you can't say s*** to me?' In a series of provocative messages on the social networking site, Mrs Flisher, who says depression prevents her from getting a job, suggested those whom she said were 'jealous' of her many benefits should do the same. She said critics who wanted a bigger house should ask the government for one, suggesting that that was what they were there for, and said that she, who hasn't worked since she was 21, had had enough of working. In another post, she boasted of enjoying a midweek night out at her local pub, saying: 'Just been out and got STEAMING... love spending all my money that you HATERS don't', the Sun reported.

Racing pundit John McCririck pleaded with Clare Balding to help him get his job back after being sacked by Channel 4, a tribunal heard yesterday. The 73-year-old twice asked Miss Balding, who led the new-look coverage, to hold meetings on his behalf with the station’s creative controller, Jay Hunt. But his attempts failed in part because Miss Hunt, a former BBC One controller, was a ‘serial age discrimination offender’, he told the hearing. Discrimination claim: John McCririck, 73, pictured with his wife Jenny - who he has called 'The Booby' - arrives at the central London employment tribunal today. He is suing for £3million . McCririck is seeking £3 million compensation, alleging Channel 4 axed him in 2012 after 29 years because of his age. The Harrow-educated presenter accepted that his ‘brand’ was that of a ‘big, fat, sexist, letch’. He admitted there had been plenty of complaints to Channel 4 about his behaviour, and he accepted descriptions of him as ‘nasty, revolting, rude’, ‘boorish’ and ‘obnoxious and sexist’. But he said: ‘I was fully aware Channel 4 approved of it because they kept on having me on their programmes.’ Flamboyant: McCririck, known for his bling, sideburns and deerstalker, claims he is still able to cover horse racing and denies appearances on Celebrity Big Brother have detracted from his seriousness . Media scrum: John McCririck talks to the press outside his tribunal hearing in central London where he was giving evidence today . He claimed Channel 4 had encouraged him to promote himself that way as part of his ‘pantomime villain’ act. And he insisted he had called for more women presenters on Channel 4 Racing – despite once describing one of them as the ‘lay of the day’ live on air and nicknaming others the ‘saucy minx’ and ‘the pouty heiress’. He also referred to 42-year-old Miss Balding as ‘ravishing’ until she objected to the description. Despite this, McCririck approached Miss Balding for help after losing his job when the racing contract was awarded to production company IMG Media. He said: ‘Before this legal action, at my request, she tried to arrange a face to face discussion last December and then again, in January with Miss Hunt who she knew from working together at the BBC.’ But the meetings never happened because Miss Hunt and Channel 4 head of sport Jamie Aitchison had already ‘made their decision’, McCririck alleged. 'Peace talks': Clare Balding tried to act as a go-between and act as peacemaker after McCririck was axed by Channel 4 last year, he said . He said: ‘That was final. Courtesy, and at least giving the victim a personal hearing and opportunity to put their case, meant nothing.’ McCririck was accused of ‘grandstanding’ by Channel 4 barrister Thomas Linden QC during a lively appearance at the Central London Employment Tribunal. The pundit claimed he was the most important member of the Channel 4 Racing team, comparing himself to a star footballer. He also described his love of breasts, explaining: ‘I happen to sadly be someone who likes the female front structure.’ And he told of his attraction to Dawn French and Kate Winslet, adding: ‘I don’t think I’ve got much of a chance.’ Horse racing pundit John McCririck said he has put his home at risk to bring his age discrimination case against Channel 4. The 73 year-old, who lives with . his wife Jenny in Primrose Hill, north London, said if he lost the case . it would be 'disastrous'. He told the tribunal: 'We had to take out a mortgage equity release to pay for our case. 'It is a huge expense. My home is now on the line because of this. I believe what I’m doing is right.' The pundit is suing the broadcaster for £3million. He added: 'I . have put my own personal future on the line. 'But I think it’s so . important for people in their 30’s up to their 70’s who fear anonymous . suits and skirts coming along and getting rid of them.' The tribunal heard McCririck had been warned by his bosses that his forays into reality TV, including Celebrity Big Brother, were harming his journalistic career. But he said: ‘Channel 4…enjoyed and encouraged my media antics. It is all part of the media game. ‘In particular I was expected to play up to the role in which I had been cast – a sort of pantomime villain – which is how some sections of the media and public have tended to see me over the years. ‘I would not have taken on these other commitments if Channel 4 executives had disapproved. ‘If anyone had ever been concerned, or believed I should change, they only had to discuss the issue with me. They never did.’ McCririck added: ‘No one did more for women than I did on Channel 4 Racing. Time and again I said why haven’t we got more women on the programme, why do we have all these boring men?’ He . said in a statement: 'At the BBC Clare Balding approached me through intermediaries . asking me to work alongside her at the racing at the BBC. She wanted me . to join her. He added: 'We . regularly chatted about the prospects, tactics and what role I advised . her to take up along with conditions and terms to seek before agreeing . to sign up. 'We go back, I believe as mutual admirers, for 25 years.' He added: 'Long . before Ms Balding became the national treasure she now is I was a huge . admirer of her natural talent, wide ranging knowledge of countless . issues, spontaneous repartee and communication skills. Admitting he was a 'taxi for hire' from 2010 after his days on Channel 4 were cut to just 40 a year, McCririck said he had pursued appearances on reality TV. 'Discrimination': McCririck, 73, revealed he has put his home in Primrose Hill, north London, at risk to fight the tribunal claim . But he said his persona as a 'bombastic and domineering' individual was a pantomime character that he would have reined in if he had been asked. 'When I came out of Celebrity Big Brother in 2005 to all the howling and catcalling, Davina McCall said, ""don’t worry John it’s all pantomime"". That’s all it was, not serious,' he said. 'This is a different persona, you are putting on a performance, you are doing a pantomime act.' The tribunal was told of several occasions McCririck had been acting in a way he accepted was seen as a sexist and a bigot, including incidents in the Big Brother house. On another occasion he was thrown off Alan Titchmarsh’s ITV show for making rude comments to Ingrid Tarrant about her relationship with her then estranged husband Chris Tarrant. And he refers to his wife Jenny - who was supporting him at the hearing - as 'The Booby', because she was 'not very bright, squawks a lot and was easy to catch'. In action: Clare Balding, who moved to Channel 4 from the BBC, led a new-look team that was brought in after McCririck was axed . Former Channel 4 racing presenter Lesley Graham later said she had her hours slashed in 2009 after 18 years with the broadcaster because she was about to turn 50. She said she was left 'angry' and 'disappointed' by the move and found denials of ageism by Andrew Thompson, Channel 4’s head of sport, 'hard to believe'. She said in a statement to the tribunal: 'In December 2009 Andrew Thompson telephoned me and told me that he was going to reduce my days from 40 to 15. 'I had no notice that this was going to happen and was extremely surprise and disappointed. 'I was shocked and didn’t fully understand the reasons for this. The only reason I could think that my annual days were being reduced was because of my age - I was due to turn 50 in 2010.' She said she was 'effectively replaced' by Emma Spencer and Alice Plunkett, who were 31 and 36 respectively, at the time. He also praised the ‘bravery’ of Miriam . O’Reilly who sued the BBC for sex and age discrimination in 2010 after . she and three other women in their 40s and 50s were dropped from . Countryfile when Miss Hunt was BBC One controller.

In 2012/13, 92.3 per cent of children in England had been immunised by their second birthday, compared to 80 per cent when the jab was first introduced in 1988. Youngsters have their second dose of the vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella before they start school, usually between the ages of three and five. The proportion of babies and toddlers having the first dose of the MMR jab is at its highest level since the vaccine was first introduced in 1988, figures show . The lowest recorded figure for the first dose was in 2003/04, when just 79.9 per cent of children were immunised. Research published in 1998 suggesting a link between the MMR vaccine and autism led to a dramatic decline in the number of children being vaccinated.

Today's report also showed that coverage in England was below that of other UK countries for all routine childhood vaccinations measured at one, two and five years. Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said: ‘Routine vaccination in childhood is vital in protecting children from a range of infectious diseases, many of which have now been consigned to history. ‘The findings from HSCIC's report are a good indication that parents and children are increasingly able to access primary care to receive these vaccinations and to protect their health for the years to come. ‘This is a good reminder to parents to ensure their child's vaccinations are up-to-date, and, if not, to contact their GP.’","92.3% of children in England have been immunised by second birthday .

A YouGov poll for the Sun found that 62 per cent of people back the idea, with just 20 per cent against. ‘The greatest thing we can do to help stabilise families and support commitment and nature is to back the most important man-made institution of marriage through a transferable tax allowance,’ Mr Duncan Smith said. Britain's Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith says marriage must be respected and supported . ‘This is a brilliant move and gives fairness to hardworking families.’ David Cameron, who first promised to introduce a tax break for married couples when he ran for the Conservative leadership in 2005, is expected to use his speech to the conference today to reaffirm his belief that it is right for the state to recognise the institution once more. The Government will allow one member of a married couple who earns under the £10,000 income tax threshold to transfer £1,000 of their allowance to their spouse, reducing their tax bill by up to £200 a year, as long as they are one of the 24 million basic rate taxpayers. Around 3.4 million couples are expected to benefit. Mr Duncan Smith said: '¿Marriage is a great institution. Marriage helps to build commitment and society and should have recognition in the tax system' The Prime Minister suggested yesterday that a majority Conservative government would seek to go further, and extend the measure to more couples if it wins power in 2015. ‘It is not an expensive move. It is very much a first step,’ he said. ‘Marriage is a great institution. Marriage helps to build commitment and society and should have recognition in the tax system. ‘This policy isn’t about the money but about the message that people who make a lasting commitment should be recognised in some way.’ Labour MPs stepped up their attack on the proposal yesterday. Ilford MP Mike Gapes said: ‘It will take the country back to the 1950s rather than dealing with the world as it is today. 'They are basically telling children that some families are less deserving and some kinds of families are better to grow up in than others.’ Harriet Harman, Labour’s deputy leader, said the tax break was ‘stigmatising and moralising’, and shadow Treasury minister Rachel Reeves called it a ‘policy about division’. Ministers argue couples were actively penalised under Labour’s tax and benefits system, while two-earner couples are entitled to taxpayer-subsidised childcare. The Government plans to introduce a new childcare tax break in 2015. In his speech to the conference, Mr Duncan Smith also hailed the Government’s plan to force benefits claimants to spend 35 hours a week doing community work or in a job centre will end the ‘something for nothing culture’. Under the Work Programme, private sector organisations and charities have been tasked with helping the unemployed find a job. And last week, Chancellor George Osborne announced the Help to Work scheme, which will force the long-term unemployed to do community volunteering from next year if they want to claim their benefits. Those who break the rules of the Help to Work scheme, for example by failing to turn up for duty without a good reason, could lose their benefit for four weeks. A second offence would see them lose it for three months. Mr Duncan Smith told BBC Radio 4’s The World At One that Britain could learn from Germany when it came to profiling unemployed people and finding out who needed the most help to get back in to work. He said the measures being announced were part of the attempts to give people a sense of a daily job.","A tax allowance to reduce bills of stay-at-home spouses is 'fair', says IDS .

"By . Professor Jane Stuart-smith . PUBLISHED: . 16:00 EST, 28 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:00 EST, 28 September 2013 . When American singer Madonna married British film director Guy Ritchie  and decamped to London, she picked up more than a penchant for real ale. Her accent took on a strange, clipped English tone. And she’s not the only one. Kelly Osbourne seems to swing from cockney rebel, like her rocker dad Ozzy, to Los Angeles drawl, while former MasterChef host Loyd Grossman has the most bizarre of all ‘mid-Atlantic’ accents. At the other end of the spectrum, Cheryl Cole’s strong Geordie accent allegedly made her so difficult to understand while hosting American X Factor that she was fired. Language barrier: Madonna picked up an English accent from her ex-husband, and although born in England, after growing up on a tourbus and in LA, it is no surprise Kelly Osbourne's speech is a bit mixed-up . A fickle accent is not just a celebrity malady – new research has shown Glaswegians are picking  up London inflections, apparently from watching EastEnders. So why do some people’s accents seem to change, depending on who they are with, while others retain theirs? Here, Jane Stuart-Smith, Professor of English Language at Glasgow University, explains why our accents are so fickle .  .  . Why do accents change? Every time we speak to someone we make tiny adjustments in our speech. We either move away from or towards their manner of speaking. It’s not just accent that changes, but phrases and words too. Sometimes these changes are noticeable (ever been embarrassed by accidentally sounding as though you’re mimicking somebody with a strong accent?), but usually changes are too slight to pick up without recording and analysing speech. Does our accent change  on a more permanent basis? Absolutely. Over time, adjustments become embedded in our linguistic system, . especially if you move abroad or to another part of the country. Cooked accent: Master Chef host Loyd Grossman speaks with an unidentified 'mid-Atlantic' twang . It can take a few weeks or months, or not happen for many years, depending how much you are immersed in the accent. If I watch lots of American films will I develop an accent? It’s unlikely that too many episodes of Friends will make you sound  like a New Yorker, though you will probably pick up some inflections and slang. Our accents alter over time as we hear different things,  but TV and radio merely provide an amplifying effect to changes already under way. In Glasgow, for example, the speech shifts we found were already occurring: EastEnders has just speeded them up. Do we pick up accents because we want to be like someone? It depends on how engaged you are in a programme. If you have a favourite character, you’re more likely to copy their accent, but the news will have little impact on your speech because you aren’t identifying with the presenter or their life. Do we all flit from  accent to accent? No. We all have an accent norm, developed mainly from our parents and peers as we grew up. Generally we are talking to people with accents similar to our own. And as we speak, we are listening to our own voice and that reinforces our own accent. Why do some people hold their accents but others don’t? It depends on the individual. There are differences in our capacity to imitate others. Taking on a new accent is a mental rather than  a physical shift – we’re simply copying body language, as that is what speech ultimately is. It’s also down to how much contact you’re having with different accents. If you are only with locals, then speech will adapt much more quickly than if you are surrounded by a network of colleagues or family with your own accent. Are there general patterns of accent change in the UK? Yes. Consonants seem to be changing quite rapidly, and certain consonant features seem to have spread out from the London area and are now found right across the country. For example, this includes saying ‘fink’ for ‘think’. Vowels are less prone to change at a local level. If you get a train from Glasgow to London and hop out at every station, vowels sound completely different as you descend the country. There  is a lot of levelling in the South East of England, though – around London accents are very similar. Can you develop foreign accents after brain damage? Foreign Accent Syndrome is well documented, but it doesn’t happen as you’d think. I studied a woman who woke up with a Scottish accent after a stroke, and when we actually analysed her speech we found only a few small sounds were really the same as a Scottish accent. However, those subtle changes were enough for her to sound Scottish to people listening to her speak. Just as with visual perception, where we don’t need many elements to see a face, our brain receives small amounts of audio information and makes sense of it by interpreting an accent. The tiny changes in her voice were probably brought on by some kind of speech production change, caused by the stroke.","Humans make tiny speech adjustments every time we address a new person .

Think of Army grub and you may imagine tasteless, depressing stodge that would be best avoided. But, in fact, many military recipes are carefully developed to be easy, cost-effective and nutritious. A new book, Bully Beef And Boiled Sweets, revisits British military meals since the First World War, revealing dishes and ingredients that nowadays rarely grace our dining tables. Yet as a nutritional therapist, I can see how many of these meals do have a place in a modern healthy diet. Rations: A typical selection of ingredients provided in wartime from which a cook would have to provide a nutritious meal . The book’s author, James Mannion, recalls that Napoleon said: ‘An army marches on its stomach.’ Well, that applies to anyone who battles through daily life – these recipes reflect our need for good-quality sustenance. Among the meals’ merits  are a high provision of protein, fibre, vitamins and minerals. For example, just one serving of Woolton Pie – named after a wartime Minister of Food – provides an incredible four vegetable portions. These meals are comforting, with such homemade appeal that children will love them. They demonstrate not just the practical side of Army food – such as that wartime staple corned beef – but also the creativity rationing inspired. Carrot fudge recalls the  days when sugar was scarce. People still wanted something sweet so turned to carrots instead, as they have a natural sweetness. Today you can use the recipe to make healthier treats for children. Here I introduce five of my favourite low-cost wartime dishes from the book and explain why they deserve a place in your repertoire of recipes... Bully Beef And Boiled Sweets, by James Mannion, is published  by Constable, priced £14.99.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 20:45 EST, 26 September 2013 . A babysitter who was charged with having sex with two underage boys two years ago will be spared jail time. Loni Bouchard, 22, of Clinton, Connecticut, was sentenced Thursday to three years in prison, but her sentence was suspended and she was instead given two years of probation, the Hartford Courant reports. It helped her case that the family of one of her victims - who was 14 at the time of the charges - supported the no-jail sentence, Judge David P. Gold said. Under her probation, she is barred from any contact with boys who are under the age of 16. Arrested again: Police released their latest mugshot photo of Loni Bouchard, far left, as she was arrested again yesterday. It is the third mugshot that has been taken of the 20-year-old since July . She is also barred from contacting her victims. 'I'm . really sorry to the victim and their families,' Bouchard, who was 19 at . the time of the relationships, said. 'This will never happen again.' She had previously pleaded guilty to three counts of first-degree reckless endangerment. In . her journal, which was acquired by police, Bouchard wrote that she knew . her relationship with the first victim - whom she had been hired to . babysit - was against the law but did not believe the law had the right . to tell her who she could and couldn't love. She . wrote about the 'amazing' sex she had with the boy, how much she loved . him and wondered why the five-year age gap even mattered. Also charged: Bouchard's mother Kimmy Bouchard pleaded guilty to risk of injury for providing alcohol and marijuana to one of the under age boys . It . also emerged that her mother, Kimmie Bouchard, 46, supplied the boy . with marijuana and alcohol when he visited their Southington home. Kimmi . Bouchard pleaded guilty to risk of injury and received probation. The . victim's mother learned of the relationship with the younger Bouchard . through a Facebook message she intercepted and reported her to police . and got a restraining order. Babysitter's seduction: Loni Bouchard had a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old boy who she was hired to look after . Bouchard had written in her diary about how much she missed him and how unfair it was they couldn't see each other. She . wrote: 'I have finally found the guy who treats me right and makes me . so happy and I can't be with him because the law says so? 'I . don't care about the law. I just want to be with him and not have to . hide it. How can the law tell us who to fall for, who to like and who to . love and especially who to date? I thought America was a free country'. She . also reportedly sent the boy's parents text messages after they found . out about the affair, asking if they could 'work this out'. She also told them they 'don't need to call the police' and 'let's act like adults'. The boy's parents filed a restraining order against Miss Bouchard in May. Around . that time, she wrote in her journal: ‘His mom absolutely HATES me . because of the situation and I understand why, but she's being immature . about it.’ She also wrote that she was cutting herself and used a bracelet the boy gave her to cover the scratches. In . a separate notebook seized from her home, police found letters written . to the boy, where Miss Bouchard said she was upset his parents had filed . the restraining order, and missed waking up next to him. She . was also involved with another underage boy - also 14 - from . Southington. His parents did not allow him to speak with police . investigators. According to the Hartford Courant, bouchard met the boy she claimed to have been in love with at a summer campground in Salem.","Loni Bouchard, now 22, had sex with two 14-year-old boys when she was 19 .
