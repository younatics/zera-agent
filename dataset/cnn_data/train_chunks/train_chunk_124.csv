"San Diego, California (CNN) -- The Obama administration calls its policy on illegal immigrants ""prosecutorial discretion."" In reality, we're finding out, it amounts to business as usual, deporting huge numbers of hard-working immigrants. The objective of the new ""policy"" announced last year was to fool immigration reform advocates into thinking that the administration had grown a conscience and stopped running up its deportation figures by deporting people who represent no threat to public safety. If you're an illegal immigrant with no criminal record, longstanding ties to the community, or U.S.-born children, or if you're a young person who would have been eligible for a pathway to legal status under the Dream Act, you are supposed to get a break so that the administration can focus its limited resources on going after criminal aliens. When the policy was announced last year, the media should have asked President Barack Obama, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton or Domestic Policy Council Director Cecilia Munoz this question: ""If resources are indeed so limited, and since it is more labor intensive to pursue criminals than college students, why shouldn't we expect you to continue to take the easy road and remove noncriminals no matter what you're promising?"" That is pretty much what happened. By all accounts, hardly anything has changed at Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Since November 2011, Department of Homeland Security officials have reviewed more than 400,000 cases; according to a recent report, less than 2 percent of those cases were closed. This revelation has to be a little embarrassing for those right-wing commentators who, when the policy was announced, got carried away and called it a ""backdoor amnesty."" Really? It turns out the door is still shut. And, even in those cases where the individuals were removed from deportation proceedings, they weren't given a pathway to earned legal status or a work visa, perhaps in the hope that, with limited options to make a living and provide for their families, they would, as presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney likes to say, ""self-deport."" Which reminds me, what's the difference between the two major presidential candidates when it comes to immigration? There isn't much of one. In fact, I've interviewed immigration lawyers who say that the ICE agents they deal with at the local level openly refer to the promise of prosecutorial discretion as a ""joke."" Immigration reform advocates aren't laughing. Neither are Latinos, many of whom take the immigration issue personally because many of them know people who have been deported and because they feel affected by the racism driving the debate. Both groups are upset that the administration's much-hyped policy of applying ""prosecutorial discretion"" to hundreds of thousands of deportation cases still in the pipeline has turned out to be little more than smoke and mirrors. It is no wonder that President Obama has so much trouble telling the truth about his immigration record. He can't very well acknowledge to immigration reform advocates that it was political expediency that led him to aggressively deport more than 1.2 million illegal immigrants in his first three years in office. And he doesn't want to admit that he misled supporters by telling them that most of those being deported were criminals as opposed to what he described in a May 2011 speech in El Paso, Texas, as ""folks who are looking to scrape together an income."" Rather than be straight with supporters on the left and risk disillusioning parts of the base in an election year, administration officials chose to deceive them into thinking that the administration had developed a conscience and was focused on going after what Obama called the ""worst of the worst."" This shell game never smelled right to me. In October 2011, I wrote a column for CNN expressing skepticism that the administration was on the level. Obama had already put in so much effort to show that he was tough on illegal immigration, just like all Democratic presidents or presidential candidates have to do because they're perceived by some voters as soft on border security in the same way that in the 1970s they were seen as soft on national security. While he was in office, Bill Clinton launched Operation Gatekeeper to militarize the U.S.-Mexico border south of San Diego and signed legislation to make it easier to deport people and harder for those slated for deportation to contest their removal. Obama went further. By relying on the controversial program Secure Communities, which requires local police to submit to federal officials the fingerprints of anyone they arrest who they suspect is in the country illegally, his administration roped local police into the enforcement of federal immigration law over the objections of prominent Democrats such as Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Having gone to all that trouble, it didn't make sense that Obama would relinquish those ""gains."" It was much more likely that he would keep the deportation machine humming along, while hoodwinking supporters into believing otherwise. In politics, you don't have to fool all the people all the time, just some of the people some of the time. It's sad and depressing. If President Obama and his administration put half as much time, effort and thought into actually fixing a problem as they do in trying to pretend they're fixing it, the country would be much better off.

"(CNN) -- Classic rockers Van Halen on Thursday abruptly postponed more than 30 tour dates, following their June 26 concert in New Orleans. Contacted Friday for comment, a representative for the tour said that no other information was available. No explanation was given, and there was no word on when the appearances might be made up. Thirteen shows, including Saturday's concert in St. Paul, Minnesota, will go on as scheduled. The band is on tour in support of its new album, ""A Different Kind of Truth"" -- the first complete album with original lead singer David Lee Roth since the platinum-selling ""1984,"" which was released on the last day of 1983. Van Halen, which formed in 1974, has a turbulent history. Roth left the band in 1985 after a falling-out with guitarist/founder Eddie Van Halen and was replaced by vocalist Sammy Hagar, who was with the band until 1996. Former Extreme vocalist Gary Cherone joined the band for 1998's ""Van Halen III"" -- the worst-selling album of the band's career. At different times, Eddie Van Halen has undergone treatment for alcoholism and cancer. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007 and later that year announced a reunion tour with Roth again fronting the band. The band also has replaced original bassist Michael Anthony with Van Halen's son, Wolfgang. Several shows during the 2007-08 tour were also postponed, but ultimately rescheduled. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, Van Halen has sold more than 56 million albums. Van Halen forums on the Web lit up with the news, with some fretting the shows would never happen. ""This isn't good,"" said a fan who goes by the handle bsbll4 on vhlinks.com, which bills itself as ""Your Van Halen Internet resource guide.""

"Phoenix (CNN) -- An Arizona jury found Tammi Smith guilty of forgery and conspiracy to interfere with custody Thursday in the 2009 disappearance of 8-month-old Gabriel Johnson, whose whereabouts remain unknown. Smith was accused of trying to help Gabriel's mother, Elizabeth Johnson, wrangle custody of the boy from his father, in order to adopt the little boy herself. She faces a pre-sentencing hearing in June to determine whether she will serve prison time, and formal sentencing July 6. Smith maintains her innocence and will appeal Thursday's verdict, her lawyer, Benjamin Taylor, told HLN's ""Prime News."" ""We're disappointed in the verdict and we're going to move on with our life and go from there,"" he said. Johnson is still awaiting trial on charges of kidnapping, custodial interference and child abuse. She allegedly told the father she killed the infant and put his body in a garbage bin, but later told police she drove from her home in Arizona to Texas and gave him to a couple she met in a San Antonio park. She later told police she handed over the child under Smith's direction, and prosecutors said Smith falsely wrote the name of her cousin on a paternity document as Gabriel's possible father. Smith maintained she did not know where the child was, and that she had nothing to do with the couple who supposedly received Gabriel. Frank McQueary, the boy's grandfather, said the family's hopes of finding the child alive are fading. ""Nobody has seen Gabriel for almost three years now,"" McQueary told HLN. ""It's been a long time, and I just don't think there's anyone out there hiding this baby at this point.""

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama gave a nod to America's heartland Tuesday, saying in an interview conducted during halftime of an NCAA basketball game in Ohio he wanted to show his British counterpart, David Cameron, a part of America rarely seen by foreign visitors. ""I thought it was going to be wonderful for the prime minister to have a chance not only to see a basketball game for first time, but also to come to the great state of Ohio, because sometimes when we have foreign visitors, they only see the coasts, they go to New York, they go to Washington, they go to Los Angeles, but you know the heartland is what it's all about,"" Obama said. Obama's hat tip to Ohio, and his choice of venue, may not be pure coincidence -- Ohio is historically a key swing state in presidential elections. Cameron and Obama flew together on Air Force One to Dayton, Ohio, to take in an opening game of the NCAA basketball tournament. Obama, well-known as a basketball fan, was treating Cameron to a little March Madness, and the pair conducted the joint television interview at halftime of the game between Western Kentucky and Mississippi Valley State. Asked how he thought the teams were playing, Obama replied candidly. ""Both teams are shooting terribly,"" Obama said. ""It may be nerves. These are not teams that normally end up coming to the tournament."" Cameron, asked how he was enjoying watching his first basketball game, said he was ""enjoying it,"" and that Obama was explaining the ins-and-outs of the American sport. ""He was giving me some tips,"" Cameron said. ""He's going to help me fill out my bracket."" Cameron's trip to the United States is intended to demonstrate that ties between the countries remain as close as ever. The White House labeled Cameron's visit -- which started Tuesday and will include meetings with President Barack Obama followed by lunch and dinner at the White House on Wednesday -- an official one, not a state one. That's because the label of state visit is reserved for heads of state, and Cameron is the head of government. Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state. However, the White House statement said Cameron would attend a state dinner Wednesday night, the sixth of the Obama administration so far. ""The fact that we are hosting the prime minister in the manner that we are demonstrates the nature of the relationship between our two countries; the fact that it is a special relationship,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters Tuesday. On Wednesday, Cameron and Obama will hold talks at the White House and address a joint news conference, followed by lunch and, later, the White House dinner with full diplomatic trappings and toasts. Cameron and his wife, Samantha, will leave Washington on Thursday. ""The visit will highlight the fundamental importance of the U.S.-U.K. special relationship and the depth of the friendship between the American people and the people of the United Kingdom, as well as the strong personal bond that has developed between the two leaders and their families,"" a White House statement said. Topics expected to come up at Wednesday's meetings include the coming NATO and G-8 summits, as well as Afghanistan, the Middle East, Iran and the global economy, according to the White House. In a joint op-ed published Tuesday in The Washington Post, Obama and Cameron emphasized the global benefits of the strong alliance between their nations. ""The alliance between the United States and Great Britain is a partnership of the heart, bound by the history, traditions and values we share,"" the two leaders wrote. ""But what makes our relationship special -- a unique and essential asset -- is that we join hands across so many endeavors. Put simply, we count on each other and the world counts on our alliance."" Troops and citizens of the two countries ""have long shown what can be achieved when British and Americans work together, heart and hand, and why this remains an essential relationship -- to our nations and the world,"" the commentary by Obama and Cameron said.

"(CNN) -- Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, one of the world's richest men, Thursday excoriated a young woman model whose accusation that he raped her was dismissed a day earlier by a Spanish court, the prince said in a statement. Bin Talal said the court ruling ""dismissed the totality of the claims by the self-described victim."" ""In doing so, the court engaged in a disciplined factual analysis which eviscerated her credibility, pointing to a multitude of inconsistencies, the absence of any corroborating evidence of her continuously changing story and the fact that all the physical evidence, including a physical examination by an independent physician after the night in question and the report of an independent toxicologist, contradicted her claims of assault and drugging,"" the prince said in a statement Thursday. Bin Talal said the conduct of the model, her lawyers and her mother were ""particularly blameworthy."" ""The model and her mother have admitted that they only learned of HRH Prince Alwaleed by searching the Internet for 'Saudi Royal Family,' yet even then, as the Court pointed out, they did not identify HRH Prince Alwaleed as her alleged attacker, an outrageous defect which, the court agreed, 'infected the whole investigation',"" the statement from the prince's office said. ""Their accusations varied wildly each time they were recounted in the proceedings and the press, in both Spain and Germany,"" the prince said. ""After the model, her mother and her lawyers learned along with the rest of the world that HRH Prince Alwaleed had been in France at the time of the alleged events, they deliberately initiated a relentless public attack on HRH Prince Alwaleed through a public relations campaign involving multiple interviews, calls to reporters, and television appearances, all in an attempt to harm HRH Prince Alwaleed through the media,"" the prince said. The young woman had alleged that the prince raped her on a yacht on the island of Ibiza in 2008. On Wednesday, a Spanish court in Palma de Mallorca found there wasn't sufficient evidence to press charges. The prince, who was never formally charged in the case, has long maintained that he is innocent, that he hasn't been in Ibiza in more than a decade and that others have tried to impersonate him. In September, a Spanish court reopened the investigation into the rape allegation. The woman filed her complaint in Ibiza in August 2008, but a local judge shelved it in 2010, citing a lack of evidence that a crime had been committed, according to court documents. The woman appealed to the next highest court, the Balearic Island Provisional Court, which ruled the lower court in Ibiza should reopen the investigation. According to court documents obtained by CNN, the victim argued in her appeal that the real reason the lower court tossed out the case was that the alleged perpetrator was a powerful member of the Saudi royal family. In September, the Saudi prince, a billionaire and the biggest foreign investor in companies such as News Corp. and Twitter, said in a statement that he was just learning of the accusation. ""These allegations are completely and utterly false,"" said the statement from his investment firm, Kingdom Holding Company. ""The alleged encounter simply never happened."" According to the September statement, the prince doesn't vacation in Spanish waters. But Max Turiel, one of the lawyers for the alleged victim, said last year there was evidence his team had wanted the court to examine further. According to the court documents, the woman believed her drink had been drugged. She sent a text message to a friend stating as much. She awoke on a yacht to find she was being sexually assaulted by a man she identified as the prince, according to court documents. Turiel said ""there were remains of semen"" that should be examined against the prince's DNA, as well as ""remains of a tranquilizer that produced the symptoms she had."" The evidence came from tests carried out 30 hours after the alleged rape, the attorney said, so any alcohol was gone from her body, but not the drug or the DNA. In September, Turiel said the alleged victim's mother could answer questions from CNN, but only through e-mail. He provided responses to questions that he said were from the mother. CNN could not independently confirm the message was from the victim's mother. ""She wanted to reopen the case due to the huge injustice and a feeling of a helplessness; powerful people should not take undue advantage of it and have others subjected to them,"" the message said. The message described the ""man or men"" who allegedly abused the young woman as powerful individuals who threatened her onboard the yacht. Asked if her daughter was afraid to appeal the case, the mother said, ""Part of the fear has a lot of dignity and that can't be bought nor scared off with threats."" The young woman, a dual Spanish and German citizen, was 23 in September, the e-mail said. CNN's Al Goodman in Madrid, Spain, contributed to this report.","Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal says court ruling dismisses ""totality"" of rape accusation .

"(CNN) -- In Wes Anderson's latest film, ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" he tells the tale of two young lovers who reunite and run away into the wilderness after a year apart. It's 1965, and a major storm is bearing down on New Penzance Island, off the coast of New England, and their disappearance sets off an island-wide search and rescue mission. The film stars Bruce Willis, Francis McDormand, Tilda Swinton and Ed Norton along with Anderson favorite Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman. But it's the two young lovers, portrayed by newcomers Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward, who steal the show. ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" which opens in New York and Los Angeles on Friday, has the look and tone of Anderson's prior films ""Rushmore,"" ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""The Darjeeling Limited."" But here, Anderson is examining the notion that love is a driving force that causes a range of different reactions -- especially when those at the center are just 12. CNN spoke with Anderson from Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy, about the making of ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" the film's lack of nostalgic impulses and the impulse for audiences to read deeper into on-screen metaphors. CNN: The word ""twee"" is often used by people these days to describe your work. Does that word mean anything to you? Wes Anderson: Virtually nothing. (laughs) I get the thrust of it, but it's really kind of like white noise to me. I have no opinion about it . CNN: ""Moonrise Kingdom"" tells the story of two 12-year-olds who fall in love and run away. Is this a universal feeling of youth? Anderson: My point of view about it was the memory of feeling that way is so strong for me. Rather than starting with an idea of a character or characters and a setting, instead I was starting out with a feeling. An emotion. A memory of an emotion that I was hoping to re-create in some way. So, that's where it came from. CNN: Is it wrapped around nostalgia? Anderson: Even though there's every reason to think its nostalgic: It's set in the '60s, and it's childhood and first love and that sort of thing. But I don't really associate it with nostalgia. Somebody in Cannes asked me, ""is it your memory of a fantasy?"" It took me a second, to think, ""I don't even know what you mean."" But I see that is exactly what it is. This fantasy I had at that time. CNN: Over the years, your films paint these pictures of various male figures that struggle in some way to grow up or face reality. What's interesting about that for you? Anderson: I kinda think probably the adult and the children -- at least in this new story -- are on parallel tracks. They're not going the same direction, but they're all having these romantic relationships that they're trying to find a way to make work and rescue themselves through them. The kids are the ones that have a clarity about what they want. They don't have any wisdom, but they do have a clear understanding about what they want to have happen. And the adults don't. It ends up making them more confused than the kids. CNN: That clarity, the directness, is intriguing about the worlds and characters that you portray. You don't do macho, ""I don't care"" guys. They know what they want and get a little bit psycho for the girl. Anderson: (laughs) You're right. You could say they get a little psycho for the girl, and you could put this on any of the guys. I'm sure you could track that back over a number of different films. I don't know how it relates to real life. I'd rather not. The psychological indication it makes about myself. But it does seem to be a continuing thread. CNN: ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is the two young actors' first roles in anything. What was the logic behind this casting? Anderson: When you're going to cast people this age, you're assuming that they're not going to be professional. Even if they are, it just means they've been working for eight months or something like that. I had no preconception about what they were supposed to look like, sound like or act like. Even their personalities. I knew what the characters were like and that they had to sort of relate to that. They're sort of outsiders. They've got to be convincing in that. But we started really early in the casting process and set aside a long time to do it. Just looked at one audition after another, waiting for someone to appear that we all felt like we could shut down and move on to the next phase of production. CNN: How much does the setting in ""Moonrise Kingdom"" factor into this story? Anderson: I feel like I want the movie to happen in a place where the audience has never been before. That's sort of a slightly magical world. I started feeling like the movie ought to feel like -- the girl is carrying around a suitcase full of fantasy books -- somewhere along the way, I started to feel like the movie should feel like it could be in that suitcase. That it could be one of those books. So everything that goes into the movie -- where we shot it, the locations, the houses, the sets -- are all my way of make this world that's not a familiar reality. CNN: During the film, there's the idea that a major rainstorm is bearing down on the island. Should I read into that as a metaphor about what's brewing between everyone on screen? Anderson: I'm up for reading into it. I like to hear people reading into it. I tend to try to keep it very abstract from myself. I like to put things and work things in to these stories that feel like symbols to me. But I don't really want to know what they symbolize. I'd rather have someone say, ""I got this out of it."" I want to feel like I'm working with some subconscious stuff that could be stronger because we don't simplify it too much. Let it be open to different connections. I'm sorry I'm sounding a little cosmic about it. The storm should feel like it's about a lot of things. Now I'm going to try one: It could even have to do with what's coming in America or something like that. 1965 is sort of an end to a period. I'm just trying this out, though. That's my first time to have that thought.","Wes Anderson's ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is about young lovers who reunite and run away .

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- The bodies of five more people killed when the Costa Concordia cruise ship sank were found Thursday, bringing to 30 the number of bodies located, Italian officials said. Two of the roughly 4,200 originally aboard the cruise liner remain missing. The Costa Concordia, a ship belonging to cruise line Costa Crociere, struck rocks off the island of Giglio on January 13 with about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members on board. Workers completed the removal of 2,400 tons of oil from the ship's tanks this week, a delicate process that began five weeks ago, the ship's owner said Thursday. Luxury cruise ship collides with container vessel . A salvage company will be selected next month to move the ship, a task that could take a year, according to the statement from Costa Crociere. Divers who located the three bodies Thursday were not able to immediately determine age or sex of the victims, according to Piero De Milito, an official with Italy's Civil Protection Coordination department. ""The bodies were found on the exterior side of the wreck facing the island, between the wreck and the rocks,"" De Milito said. ""In the next 48 hours, we'll be able to bring them on the mainland."" Crews used 20 vessels, including platforms, tugs, transport ships, crane barges and tankers, to defuel the cruise ship, which remains on its side. While the oil has been removed, the ""caretaking"" operation to clean the seabed and monitor the ship will continue for several months, the company said. The cruise line will choose next month which of six bidding salvage companies will remove the wrecked ship. ""The operation to remove the wreck will be a particularly complex one and is expected to take from 10 to 12 months, depending on which tender is chosen,"" the company said.

"(CNN) -- How do you solve a problem like Mario Balotelli? After an eventful fortnight that saw the Manchester City striker gatecrash a press conference, row with teammates and crash his Bentley, it's perhaps no wonder that his club manager Robert Mancini has been driven to despair. When reporters this week quizzed Mancini over an alleged locker room bust-up between Balotelli and teammate Kolo Toure, the Italian sympathized with his frustrated squad. ""I can understand it. I told him (Mario), if you played with me 10 years ago I would give you every day maybe one punch in your head,"" Mancini said ahead of Sunday's trip to Arsenal -- a match that could have a big bearing on the English title race. ""I think in every big game he played very well. I think his problem is his concentration, but I work with him every day. ""I speak with him -- not every day because if not I need a psychologist -- but every two days I speak with him."" It was one of Mancini's most frank discussions about the troubled player who earlier this season set off fireworks in his bathroom with a group of friends, causing severe damage. The controversy continued with Balotelli gatecrashing new Inter Milan boss Andrea Stramaccioni's first press conference late last month. The ex-Inter player unexpectedly entered the press room as Stramaccioni was being formally unveiled as Claudio Ranieri's replacement. Just days later he again aggravated the football world, being reportedly involved in a dressing-room row with Yaya Toure during second-placed City's 3-3 draw with Sunderland. In the same game, in which he scored twice but was criticized for his performance, Balotelli also argued with teammate Aleksandar Kolarov over who should take a free-kick. ""Yaya Toure -- that is totally false,"" Mancini said. ""What happened with Kolarov on the pitch, that is a situation that can happen in difficult moments. ""It is not good but I can understand this situation can happen. After the game it was finished. I am not worried -- it is important that after the game everything was okay."" Then there was Thursday's car crash in Manchester city center. Balotelli, driving his Bentley at the time, escaped unhurt, while a passenger from one of the other vehicles involved was taken to hospital as a precaution, according to police. With Balotelli's erratic antics continuing to grab headlines, Mancini may be pressed to find an answer soon -- especially if he is to quell locker room bust-ups and his squad's growing suspicions there is one rule for Mario and another for the rest. But despite the aggravation, Mancini refuses to completely condemn the 21-year-old Italian. ""Because when you have a player like Mario you should always not talk bad things against him because he is your teammate. If you say something about him, it's better to talk face-to-face, to say what you think,"" he said. ""Mario is young. He can do some mistakes. He has paid for his mistake. I can understand (why players are annoyed.) I understand this. But there are different ways to help guys like Mario.""","""I would punch him in the head if we were teammates,"" manager Mancini says of Balotelli .

"(CNN) -- Turkey is changing its military rules of engagement and will now treat a military approach toward its borders by Syria as a potential threat that ""will be dealt with accordingly,"" Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday. The announcement is a significant escalation of rhetoric after Syria shot down a Turkish plane last week. Erdogan criticized Syria harshly on Tuesday for shooting down the Turkish fighter jet, saying: ""Even if the plane was in their airspace for a few seconds, that is no excuse to attack."" ""It was clear that this plane was not an aggressive plane. Still it was shot down,"" he said. War of words over downed jet . He said Syrian choppers have strayed into Turkish airspace five times in 2012. But, the Turks say, the government never escalated the situation despite the border violations. That could change under the new policy. The shooting down of the Phantom F-4 jet on Friday raised even more tension between Turkey and Syria, two heavily armed regional powers. Relations between the two neighbors have deteriorated during the uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Erdogan has repeatedly called on al-Assad to step down. Turkey has withdrawn its diplomats from Damascus. More than 30,000 Syrian refugees have spilled onto Turkish soil and Turkey is hosting Syria opposition groups. NATO condemned the shoot-down ""in the strongest terms,"" Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said after the alliance met Tuesday at Turkey's request. Both sides say the jet strayed into Syrian airspace, but Turkey says the incursion was accidental and quickly corrected. Rasmussen refused to comment on what intelligence Turkey had presented to NATO about the incident at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. He called on Syria to ""avoid such events in the future"" and said he did not expect the situation to escalate. NATO did not promise any action in response to the incident, and Turkey did not invoke the NATO article calling for collective defense of members, Rasmussen said. The NATO consultations were held under Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's founding charter. The article allows any member to call for consultations ""whenever, in the opinion of any of them, their territorial integrity, political independence or security is threatened,"" the charter says. France's Foreign Ministry called the shootdown an ""attack"" on Tuesday and said it ""constitutes a violation of international law."" It's a reminder, the ministry said, that the regime ""is threatening international peace and security. It is consistent with the regime's escalating violence against its own population."" Alexander Lukashevich, the Russian Foreign Ministry's official representative, expressed Moscow's concern on Tuesday. ""In our opinion, it is important that the incident not be seen as a provocation or a deliberate action that could lead toward destabilizing the situation,"" he said. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the United States commends Turkey for its measured response and stands with the government and the other NATO allies. Washington plans to work with Turkey and others to hold the al-Assad regime accountable and to pursue a democratic transition in Syria, he said. Carney added that the regime's continued use of airpower reflects al-Assad's desperate attempt to maintain control. Security Clearance: Can Turkey force U.S., NATO to attack Syria? The United States and many other countries have been vocally opposed to military intervention in Syria and are unlikely to encourage Turkey to press the issue. After Syrian troops shelled refugees on the Turkish side of the border earlier this year, U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta made clear that the bar is high for Turkey to claim the need for a collective self-defense. Syria raised the stakes Monday in the war of words over the incident. Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi said the plane was shot down in Syrian airspace, disputing Turkey's claim that it was downed over international waters after briefly straying into Syrian airspace by mistake. ""What happened was a violation of Syrian airspace. Even Turkey says Syrian sovereignty was violated. Regardless of whether it was a training mission, a reconnaissance mission, it was a violation,"" Makdissi said. He insisted that Syria was the wronged party, not Turkey. Also Monday, a spokesman for the Turkish Foreign Ministry told CNN that Syria fired Friday on a second Turkish plane that was part of a search-and-rescue mission sent in after the jet was shot down. The plane, which entered Syrian airspace in search of the jet, was not hit, said Selcuk Unal. ""There was no injury, nobody was harmed. But that plane immediately returned to Turkish airspace. And through military diplomatic channels we informed them: 'What's going on?' "" Unal said. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said Sunday that it considered the shooting to be a hostile act. Turkey delivered the message in a diplomatic note to the Syrian consulate in Istanbul, Unal told CNN. In addition to NATO, Turkey also submitted a letter about the incident to the U.N. Security Council. The country made no request for action, but outlined its version of events. ""This attack at the international airspace, causing possible loss of two Turkish pilots, is a hostile act by the Syrian authorities against Turkey's national security. Thus, we strongly condemn it,"" read the letter, dated Sunday. It identified the downed plane as a Turkish RF-4 reconnaissance aircraft, a version of the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. It was flying alone, without arms, in international airspace when it was shot down, the letter read. Turkish search-and-rescue teams found the wreckage of the jet in the Mediterranean Sea on Sunday, about 1,300 meters (4,260 feet) underwater, Foreign Ministry spokesman Unal said. Report: 33 Syrian army members defect to Turkey . Tension between Syria and Turkey escalated sharply in the 1990s over Kurdish militancy. Turkey was angry that the Syrian regime harbored Kurdish militant Abdullah Ocalan. Ocalan founded the Kurdistan Workers' Party, the PKK. The group, regarded as a terrorist organization by Turkey and the United States, has been fighting the Turkish government for Kurdish autonomy. Syria eventually expelled Ocalan and the hostility eased. Syrian-Turkish political and economic ties grew after Erdogan became prime minister in 2003. But over the last year, Erdogan's government grew disgusted with the al-Assad regime over the government's brutal crackdown against Syrian citizens during the uprising. Some observers believe Syria is now supporting the PKK. CNN's Ivan Watson and journalist GÃ¼l TÃ¼ysÃ¼z contributed to this report.","Turkey will consider any military approach from Syria a potential threat, its PM says .

"Madrid (CNN) -- Huge traffic jams snarled central Madrid Thursday, as Spain's first general strike in more than a year kicked off with nine people slightly injured in demonstrations, including police officers, the Interior Ministry said. Interior Ministry official Cristina Diaz said 58 people had been detained. The cause was not immediately clear. Dozens of union members picketed outside the Agriculture Ministry before dawn, with dozens of riot police on hand. Picketers heckled and momentarily blocked a car trying to get into the ministry. Spanish unions are protesting the new conservative government's labor reforms and austerity cuts. The general strike is the first one against the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, which was elected in November and took office in December, in the midst of Spain's deep economic crisis. Spain's jobless rate is nearly 23% overall, and nearly 50% for youth. Nearly 5.3 million Spaniards are out of work. The Socialist-leaning General Workers Union (UGT) said there was a ""massive following"" of the strike nationwide, with auto factories, ports, post offices and garbage collection all stopped by the industrial action. The union also said wholesale food markets and large distribution centers for the big supermarket chains were disrupted. The Interior Ministry said public transport was operating almost normally in Madrid and Barcelona, but in Madrid's Plaza Castilla, commuters said they waited up to two hours for public transport. Some bus services which normally run every five minutes had service only every 30 minutes, according to a municipal bus employee who declined to give his name. Madrid's traffic jams lasted beyond the normal rush hour, an indication that commuters who could not get public transport decided to drive in. The last general strike, in September 2010, was against the then-Socialist government, which also had initiated austerity measures. That strike slowed industry and transport, but much of the country went to work and many analysts saw it as a kind of a draw between the government and unions. Since then, the economic crisis has deepened. Union protests across the nation this month and last drew large crowds, which analysts say emboldened the unions to move ahead with a general strike. The government says the latest labor reforms are needed to bring flexibility to the workplace and to simplify the rules for employers. But unions say the effect will be to make it easier and cheaper to fire workers. The unions' strike theme is: ""They want to end labor and social rights and finish off everything."" At the MercaMadrid wholesale fish market, one of the largest in Europe, seafood wholesaler Alfonso Mozos, who employs 120 people, said before the union action that he doesn't think striking is good. ""It would be better if unions, the government and employers would negotiate and find a solution,"" he said. Union picketers were expected at the entrance to the sprawling market on Madrid's south side, but some employees said they planned to work despite the strike. ""If the boss buys fish and we need to come, we'll come,"" said Pedro Marin, a worker at the wholesale market. ""But if the union pickets outside won't let us in, we'll just have to wait, or maybe go home."" Many other Spaniards, who have already seen their salaries cut or frozen in the economic crisis, were debating whether to strike. If they walk out, they will lose a day's wage, which for government workers could amount to several hundred dollars. Ahead of the strike, unions and government officials in many, but not all, of Spain's 17 regions agreed on minimum services, which generally call for about 30% of public transportation to run, while public hospitals and other essential services have reduced staff, similar to holiday levels. The unions planned 80 demonstrations across the country Thursday, mostly in the late afternoon or early evening. The strike comes one day before the government unveils its 2012 budget on Friday, with the aim of reducing Spain's deficit to 5.3% of gross domestic product this year, and to 3% next year, to meet European Union requirements. The government already approved a $20 billion (15 billion euro) package of austerity cuts and tax hikes to reduce the deficit, and on Friday it is expected to announce a second package of the same size or larger. Government critics say it will be the first time the government really shows its hand on where to make deep cuts in specific programs and agencies. Rajoy, at a recent European Union summit, was reported by Spanish media to be overheard on an open microphone telling another EU leader that the labor reforms would cost him a general strike. The reforms were approved first as a decree law, with immediate effect, and the unions called on the government to make amendments as the bill moved through parliament. But the conservatives have a commanding majority in parliament and later approved the reforms unchanged. The government says the labor reforms make up only a portion of the elements needed to spur an economic recovery. It predicts a 1.7% decline in the economy this year. The government also has demanded reforms in the banking sector, with the aim of getting credit flowing again and to clean up the books of lenders stuck with huge uncollectible debts left over from Spain's real estate and construction boom that went bust, precipitating the economic crisis.","NEW: Post offices, ports, auto factories and garbage collection all stop, a union says .

"Warsaw, Poland (CNN) -- Poland, the European Union's fastest growing economy, wants to become a member of the eurozone -- but its finance minister says the country will wait until ""it is safe to do so."" ""We want to join (the eurozone),"" Jan Vincent-Rostowski told CNN. ""I think we feel that there is still a lot to be done and the eurozone has a lot of homework to do."" The minister says the eurozone must be ""repaired"" and that there is more work to be done. ""We are very concerned, we think half the job has been done, but we are still not entirely out of the woods,"" he said. He says at the moment there is no real safety net when problems arise in the eurozone and there needs to be fewer restrictions on the European Central Bank, for example when it comes to buying government bonds. ""We feel that the so-called firewall is inadequately large and we feel that the freedom of action that the ECB thinks it has is inadequate,"" he added. But despite the difficult economic climate engulfing much of Europe, Poland's economy is continuing to grow. According to Vincent-Rostowski, between 2008 and 2011 Poland achieved a cumulative growth of almost 16% -- double that of the EU's second fastest growing economy, Slovakia. Regardless of Poland's growth, the country is enacting a policy of austerity. Vincent-Rostowski sees this as the most important part of the country's fiscal policy. He says Poland will reduce the ratio of public debt to gross domestic product this year, and is almost certain that they will eliminate ""excessive"" public debt. The finance minister believes his country is well placed should the eurozone's economic prospects improve, or even if they weaken, saying that scenario helps Poland's export performance. ""We are fairly comfortable with both situations,"" Vincent-Rostowski said. ""I am not too concerned one way or another.""","Poland is the European Union's fastest growing economy .

"(CNN) -- Dani Pedrosa edged out world champion Casey Stoner to take pole for the French MotoGP Saturday. Pedrosa was 0.303 seconds faster than his Honda teammate and the pair were the only two riders under the one minute 34 seconds mark at Le Mans. Spain's Pedrosa broke his collarbone last season -- leaving him to miss several races -- but he was back to his best in a qualifying session which started in wet conditions and ended in the dry. It was his 20th MotoGP pole and he will be looking for his 16th victory Sunday. Italian Andrea Dovizioso was third fastest to join them on the front row on his Yamaha.

"Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (CNN) -- Preliminary results for Sunday's presidential election in the Dominican Republic gave former lawmaker Danilo Medina an early lead. Polls closed at 6 p.m. ET in the race, which shaped up as a two-man contest between political veterans. Medina and former Dominican Republic President Hipolito Mejia were in a close race heading into election day. Four other candidates, between them, didn't surpass 5% in the polls. With close to half of the ballots counted Sunday night, Medina led with more than 51% of the vote, versus Mejia's 47%. A candidate must garner 50% of the vote plus 1 to avoid a second round of voting. The election is a rematch of the 2000 presidential contest, where Mejia defeated Medina. Since the end of Mejia's term in 2004, the presidency has been held by Leonel Fernandez, of the centrist Dominican Liberation Party, the same party that Medina belongs to. Mejia represents the left-leaning Dominican Revolutionary Party. Some see the candidates as similar in some respects, but passions nonetheless on both sides are strong. ""The truth is that in the Dominican Republic, I would say the national pastime is not baseball. The national sport is politics,"" said Mauricio De Vegoechea, a political analyst. The boisterous campaigns stretched from the island to New York, where there is a large population of Dominicans. Ahead of Sunday's vote, some 200 foreign electoral observers were in the country, and 60,000 police and troops were deployed for security. ""The big difference, obviously, is that one of these candidates was already president and showed us who he was, and the other candidate has certainly been close to the government, but has never held the executive position and is known as a very qualified official,"" said Javier Cabreja, president of the civic group Citizens' Participation. Mejia, 71, the former president, has a background in agriculture. He served a previous administration as minister of agriculture, and became involved in politics at an early age. Medina, 60, was elected to four-year terms as a lawmaker in 1986, 1990 and 1994. He also served as president of the country's House of Representatives. He twice served as secretary of state. There are more than 6 million registered voters in the country. Dominicans living abroad were allowed to cast their votes as well, so much attention was paid by the candidates to the Dominican population in the United States, and particularly in New York. About 5% of registered voters live outside the island. ""A lot of my family lives in Santo Domingo, that's our homeland, and we have to support our brothers who are there, working hard,"" one voter in New York said. According to the International Monetary Fund, the Dominican Republic is expected to grow between 3.5% and 4% this year. Campaign issues have included discussions whether that growth is trickling down to the average citizen. ""I want there to be in my country social security, better education and better medical services,"" said another New York Dominican voter, Johnny Hinojosa. CNN's Camilo Egana and Maria Santana contributed to this report.","NEW: Preliminary results give former lawmaker Danilo Medina an early lead .

"(CNN) -- Jorge Lorenzo climbed from fourth on the grid to win the French MotoGP at a rain-soaked Le Mans on Sunday and take the lead in the championship. Riding his Yamaha flawlessly in the wet conditions, Lorenzo took the lead on the first lap and eventually finished 9.905 seconds clear of Valentino Rossi, who had the consolation of his best finish so far for Ducati. Rossi held off a determined Casey Stoner, who finished third in the week he announced he was quitting the sport at the end of the season. ""It was really difficult to hold concentration today, in the dry it's complicated but in the wet it's even more,"" Lorenzo said. ""The race feels much longer and you have to remember where the corners are slippery every lap. If you forget one you can crash very easily."" Lorenzo, who won for the second time this season, leads the championship by eight points from Stoner. ""I was pretty happy to hold on for a podium today,"" Stoner said. ""I enjoyed the battle with Valentino at the end, there was clean overtaking and we swapped positions a few times but in the end we knew that Valentino had better pace than us and after he passed there was no way I could stay with him. ""We did everything we could today and to come away with a podium is a good result."" Stoner's Honda teammate Dani Pedrosa started on pole but ended up fourth, and is now 25 points adrift of Lorenzo. ""In the race I immediately realized it was not my day, not a day to take any risk and it was important to simply reach the best position,"" Pedrosa said. Rossi managed to work his way from the third row of the grid to second. The seven-time MotoGP champion overtook Stoner on the final lap to record his best result since joining Ducati in 2011. ""I'm really, really happy,"" Rossi said. ""We knew we had a special opportunity in the wet today, so I tried to ride perfectly and not throw it away.

"(CNN) -- Poland striker Robert Lewandowski scored a hat-trick as Borussia Dortmund swept aside Bayern Munich 5-2 in the German Cup final to win the domestic double for the first time in their history. Dortmund maintained their dominance over their Munich rivals with a fifth straight win. They won the German league title by eight points from Bayern. ""That was a cup final which no one from Dortmund could have better imagined,"" Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp said. ""We were ice cool in our finishing and scored great goals. It's hard to put into words what has happened to us."" For Bayern, it was the worst possible preparation for next Saturday's Champions League final against Chelsea, which will be played at their Allianz Arena ground. ""We cannot complain. Our entire defensive play was a catastrophe,"" Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes said. ""We have to take the blame and we did not deserve to win. ""We still have a major goal in mind and I think we will have all recovered from the shock by the Champions League final. That will be a completely different game."" Bayern started shakily when a mistake by Luiz Gustavo allowed Jakub Blaszczykowski to set up Japanese forward Shinji Kagawa for the first goal after three minutes. The stage looked set for a close contest though when Arjen Robben made it 1-1 from the penalty spot on 25 minutes after Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller tripped Mario Gomez. But Dortmund were 3-1 in front by half time thanks to a penalty by Germany defender Mats Hummels after Jerome Boateng's foul on Blaszczykowski and Lewandowski's first from a perfect Kagawa pass. Dormund all but wrapped up the win when Lewandowski scored his second in the 58th minute and though Ribery pulled one back in the 75th, Lewandowski pounced on an error by goalkeeper Manuel Neuer to head home for his hat-trick with nine minutes remaining. In La Liga, Pep Guardiola's final league game as Barcelona coach ended in a 2-2 draw at Real Betis. Daniel Martin scored two goals in three second-half minutes to put Betis 2-1 up but Seydou Keita salvaged a point for Guardiola's side with an injury-time goal shortly after Lionel Messi had hit the post. Dani Alves was sent off in the 53rd minute after receiving a second yellow card after Sergio Busquets had put Barca ahead in the ninth minute. Guardiola's final game will be the Copa del Rey final against Athletic Bilbao on May 25. Saturday's result means champions Real Madrid can win the title by nine points from their Catalan rivals if they win their final game at home to Mallorca on Sunday. Third-place Valencia lost to 1-0 at Real Sociedad to finish 30 points behind Barcelona in second. In Turkey, Galatasaray won the league title for the second year in a row after a tense 0-0 draw against Fenerbahce, who needed to win to deny their bitter rivals. The trophy presentation at Fenerbahce's stadium was delayed for several hours after angry home fans invaded the pitch and clashed with police. By the time the trophy was finally handed over, only about 200 fans remained in the stadium. Fenerbahce have endured a torrid season. Their chairman Aziz Yildirim is in jail awaiting a trial for match-fixing and the club were thrown out of the Champions League for their involvement in a scandal that allegedly affected 22 matches. However, the country's football federation recently cleared Fenerbahce and several other clubs of match-fixing following an investigation.","Borussia Dortmund win German Cup with 5-2 win over Bayern Munich .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The late Academy Award-winning composer Maurice Jarre enjoyed a glittering career composing the scores to many classic films. French composer Maurice Jarre wrote scores for films by Hollywood legends like John Huston, Alfred Hitchcock and David Lean. Last month, the 84 year-old who died Sunday gave one of his final interviews to CNN's The Screening Room, in conversation with fellow composer Alexandre Desplat. Jarre, who died of cancer, worked with many  legendary directors, like Alfred Hitchcock and John Huston. But it is the French composer's work with British director David Lean -- the scores to ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Dr Zhivago,"" and ""A Passage to India,"" for which he won three Oscars --  for which he is best remembered. Twice Oscar-nominated French composer Alexandre Desplat, who has written the scores for Stephen Frears' 2006 drama ""The Queen,"" and last year's ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"" regarded Jarre as an inspiration and an influence. ""Maurice was an immense artist; an incredible symphonist; a magician of the melody and a benevolent human being,"" Desplat told CNN in tribute to Jarre who he describes as the greatest composer of the last 50 years. Alexandre Desplat: I don't know if you know, but the path that you traced for us French composers is phenomenal and indispensable. And, of course, love for cinema and theater is something that unites us, because I also wrote a lot for the theater like yourself. Maurice Jarre: The love for cinema, that's correct. I also had the opportunity to work with real -- to use a common word -- 'giants.' Volker Schlöndorff , Visconti, John Huston ... AD: and Hitchcock! MJ: Hitchcock. This type of director has disappeared. They no longer exist. AD: One can sense with your work this passion for cinema, and for images -- your complete dedication to images. I think I also have this devotion, in fact, I don't think, I know, because it's devoured me since I was an adolescent. There are many composers of whom I know that are film composers by default, simply because it's a job; it's a good occupation. I don't sense in them that love for images, and that inspiration films has given us. MJ: People who say to me, 'When you write the music for a film do you know whether the film will be a great success?' I tell them, 'No, I was mainly concerned about finishing the music in time.' Sam Spiegel (producer of ""Lawrence of Arabia) once said, 'You have a job like Superman!' That was true because I worked day and night. But, at that point, I had no idea I was working on probably one of the best films in the history of cinema. What is your favorite Maurice Jarre movie score? Tell us below in the SoundOff box . AD: This dedication to the cinema is all-encompassing. When one is a composer for films, it's day and night. One needs to be in great physical condition! MJ: Oh yes! [Jarre puts up fists, as though in a boxing match] Like an athlete... AD: I know that like me you must have worked 18 to 20 hours a day because there was no choice. Unless we are directing other people, having people work for us. In this case you'd probably have to do less. But as we're, I think, somewhat intelligent, and in love with details and in love with the timbre of the orchestration. MJ: That's why I was so disappointed that you lost the Oscar [Desplat was nominated for Best Score in 2006 for Stephen Frears' ""The Queen.""] The award is not that important, but it has sentimental value for you, because I respect your work. AD: I hope to one day achieve three Oscars like yourself Maurice. But you have to keep in mind that the rewards for the work are secondary. MJ: I was very disappointed with the people who won the Golden Globe and Oscar for Best Composition last year. For me, it should represent the real best film scores outside of, let's say, political factors. Watch video: 'Zhivago' composer dies . AD: What's essential is to have extremely talented directors who listen to you. That's the best reward, because your talent as a composer can express itself. You can search, you can invent something. With films where the directors aren't so great, it's much more difficult to write good music. MJ: You know, before I wrote the first electronic score for Peter Weir, for ""Year of Living Dangerously,"" nobody wanted to hear about a purely electronic score, but Peter Weir used it in an artistic manner. That's what was so great. AD: That is, for me, an example because after having done 70 or 80 film scores, I realize it is perhaps time for me to be careful not to repeat myself, and to find a new voice. I think that the path you took in the 1980s ... I find it extremely courageous to abandon the orchestra for electronic music. For me, it's an incredible example. What was for you, Maurice, the most beautiful experience, or the Oscar which you loved most? MJ: Of course, it's the first [for ""Lawrence of Arabia"" in 1963]. It's a sentimental one, because David Lean and I became good friends. With the good directors it was always an interesting experience -- and a difficult one -- because we always had slightly different visions at the outset. But, it always arranged itself. I never really had a 'bust-up' with a good director. A good director will always find an intellectual understanding. And that's what was great - I had an opportunity with all these people. I don't think I can say that I ever worked with a bad director. There were never any real problems; there were discussions ... a bit of diplomacy here and there.","Oscar-winning composer, Maurice Jarre wrote score for ""Lawrence of Arabia""

"(WIRED) -- Without more funding, NASA will not meet its goal of tracking 90 percent of all deadly asteroids by 2020, according to a report released today by the National Academy of Sciences. This NASA artist's rendering shows a massive asteroid belt orbiting the Earth. The agency is on track to soon be able to spot 90 percent of the potentially dangerous objects that are at least a kilometer (.6 miles) wide, a goal previously mandated by Congress. Asteroids of this size are estimated to strike Earth once every 500,000 years on average and could be capable of causing a global catastrophe if they hit Earth. In 2008, NASA's Near Earth Object Program spotted a total of 11,323 objects of all sizes. But without more money in the budget, NASA won't be able to keep up with a 2005 directive to track 90 percent of objects bigger than 460 feet across. An impact from an asteroid of this size could cause significant damage and be very deadly, particularly if it were to strike near a populated area. Meeting that goal ""may require the building of one or more additional observatories, possibly including a space-based observatory,"" according to the report. The committee that investigated the issue noted that the United States is getting little help from the rest of the world on this front, and isn't likely to any time soon. Another report is planned for release by the end of the year that will review what NASA plans to do if we spot a life-threatening asteroid headed our direction. A summary of the report's findings: . • Congress has mandated that NASA discover 90 percent of all near-Earth objects 140 meters in diameter or greater by 2020. The administration has not requested and Congress has not appropriated new funds to meet this objective. Only limited facilities are currently involved in this survey/discovery effort, funded by NASA's existing budget.  • The current near-Earth object surveys cannot meet the goals of the 2005 NASA Authorization Act directing NASA to discover 90 percent of all near-Earth objects 140 meters in diameter or greater by 2020.   • The orbit-fitting capabilities of the Minor Planet Center are more than capable of handling the observations of the congressionally mandated survey as long as staffing needs are met.   • The Arecibo Observatory telescope continues to play a unique role in characterization of NEOs, providing unmatched precision and accuracy in orbit determination and insight into size, shape, surface structure, multiplicity, and other physical properties for objects within its declination coverage and detection range.   • The United States is the only country that currently has an operating survey/detection program for discovering near-Earth objects; Canada and Germany are both building spacecraft that may contribute to the discovery of near-Earth objects. However, neither mission will detect fainter or smaller objects than ground-based telescopes. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"(CNN) -- A historic site in China's former capital that dates back more than 600 years to the Ming Dynasty was damaged Sunday after a Ferrari raced across it before a publicity event for the Italian carmaker, the official Xinhua news agency said. The Ferrari 458 Italia sped around the ramparts of the ancient city walls in Nanjing, leaving thick black tread marks that cleaners were unable to remove, an exhibition of driving that aired on state television before being circulated on the Internet. In a statement issued Tuesday, Ferrari China said the drive was taken unauthorized by staff from its Nanjing distributor Nanjing Kuaiyi Automobile Trading Co. Ltd, which was planning to hold a new car exhibition in the area. City authorities said the car was intended to be part of a ceremony on Monday to mark the 20th anniversary of the luxury car automaker's entry into China's luxury car market. Ferrari expressed ""deep regret"" for what it described as an ""accident,"" calling it ""unacceptable"" and saying it would take steps to prevent similar incidents from happening again. It stated it has ""always held great respect toward Chinese traditional culture and regards the protection of historical relics as of great importance."" Qinhuai district tourism bureau said its officials had been reprimanded, while the Nanjing Municipal Administration of Cultural Heritage said the use of the site was not approved by archeological authorities, Xinhua said. The incident also dismayed some Chinese netizens, who expressed their misgivings about the partnership between Ferrari and the city authorities. Weibo user Dayushenying called the incident ""shameful,"" off rumors that Ferrari had paid 80,000 yuan to use the city walls, without regard for cultural relics. Weibo user bobisaman commented wryly: ""Ferrari put out the cash, Nanjing put out the city walls. In the end, Nanjing won because Ferrari helped advertise it globally.""

"(CNN) -- Rather than getting ready to attract more tourists in its high season, Greece is headed toward the polls again on June 17. In the midst of domestic political uncertainty, more and more outside observers agree that ""Grexit"" -- the prospect of Greece leaving the euro -- has become inevitable. Yet to read the May 6 election results or the first polls for the June election as evidence of Greek opposition to the euro -- or even to public and private sector reform -- is both simplistic and misguided. Given the choice, Greeks would pick Europe over their own politicians. Two weeks ago, the electorate did not reject the European Union or the single currency. Rather, they rejected the political duopoly that has monopolized power in Athens since the last Junta collapsed in 1974. The Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) and New Democracy (ND) -- the so-called ""establishment"" supportive of the bailout -- are the same parties that built an unviable state with a bloated public payroll and enough red tape to wrap the Acropolis. For all the good George Papandreou did in late 2009 by coming clean about the lies of past administrations, it was his father who helped build this woefully inefficient and ultimately insolvent system. Papandreou the Younger changed tack only when credit markets woke up to the fact that Greek credit was not exactly of German quality (surprise!) Now his former Amherst roommate, Antonis Samaras, promises to ""save Greece."" But less than a year ago Samaras was busy sowing distrust throughout Europe by refusing to promise that his party would honor existing commitments. While the new PASOK leader Evangelinos Venizelos has acted more responsibly, he is also part of the same tainted elite. A last-ditch effort by the president to form a technocratic, unity government failed last week. Of course, technocracy has been tried in Greece before. But the reason the last supposedly technocratic administration of Lucas Papademos had a hard time passing meaningful reform was because it included PASOK and ND ministers, who carried on their internecine feud with an eye to the polls. Papademos's mistake was not to demand a fully technocratic administration like Monti's in Italy. The bottom line is that the ND-PASOK duopoly has now lost its legitimacy. The fragmentation of the Greek political scene was a predictable consequence of an economic depression voters rightly blamed on the political establishment. The good news is that the appeal of the far-right Golden Dawn seems to have peaked. The bad news is that the main beneficiary of public disillusionment is Alexis Tsipras, leader of the intransigent hard-left Syriza, who claims to ""listen to the people"" while rejecting the kind of unity government that more than 70% of Greeks said they wanted. Tsipras acts as if he commanded a majority, but he achieved less than 17% support on May 6 -- and for all the ink spilled about him he will not get a majority in June. Domestically, his party offers nothing more than a return to the old and miserably tested ways of hiring more public servants and reversing useful reform. Worse, his populist platform is openly contradictory on the euro: how can he seriously argue he wants to honor Greeks' hopes to remain in the single currency while simultaneously promising to burn all existing agreements with Europe? The game of chicken he is playing with Berlin and Brussels is reckless because the costs of Grexit would be devastating for Greece. For all his talk of ""listening to the Greeks"", Tsipras neglects to mention leaving the euro would require even more draconian austerity because Greece would have to close its primary budget deficit overnight. There would be little tradable sector to rely on. So Tsipras's party would then have to seize deposits like the Argentine government did in late 2001. Exit from the euro would then punish middle class depositors while rewarding those Greeks with their money in Geneva. And devaluation-induced competitiveness would be ephemeral as inflation ravaged a restored drachma. In short, Syriza offers a blast from the past: failed strategies to keep hiring public workers and to isolate itself internationally. Greeks know full well that this is the past from which they escaped through membership in the European Union, which is why the polls suggest that between 75-82% of them want to remain in the single currency. So what Greece urgently needs is a pro-European, pro-reform alliance, without too much PASOK and ND baggage, to take on Tsipras's shallow dream. Regardless of whether Chancellor Merkel suggested it or not, it may be time to revive the idea of a euro referendum. The electorate would then be able to make clear that they want to keep the benefits of EU integration. From the perspective of Brussels and Berlin, maddening though Athens may be, there is no alternative but to double down on Greece -- because a Greek exit would have huge ripple effects through all the Mediterranean economies (and their banking systems). More importantly, structural reform is still worth pursuing -- opening up the professions, reforming the public sector, and liberalizing an economy that only benefits insiders are laudable goals. There is no reason why the state should be paying salaries for people who have not shown up to work in decades or be hostage to a taxi union keen on maintaining their monopoly at the expense of tourism, which comprises almost the whole Greek export sector. But the Greeks need stronger incentives to endure the pain of fiscal consolidation. In the coming days, the new French President's Francois Hollande's ""growth compact"" and the calm credibility of Italy's Mario Monti may help change the outlook for European reform and consolidation. These leaders are tacit supporters of the idea of a ""quid pro quo"" for reforming governments. Humiliated in her own regional elections last weekend, Germany's Angela Merkel now has little option but to heed them. Starting with the informal summit this week, it is time for the next step down the long and winding road to joint and several liability of eurozone debt.","Greeks preparing for fresh election after inconclusive May vote .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of inmates in Mississippi whose fight among themselves spiraled into a riot were back in their cells Monday afternoon, leaving authorities to mourn the death of one guard and express thanks that things didn't turn out worse. ""When we first ... learned of the situation, I had a high degree of anxiety because there were so many guards who were unaccounted for,"" Adams County Sheriff Chuck Mayfield said, praising the efforts of law enforcement and those with the private company that runs the facility. ""I know it when I see it when something is handled correctly."" By Monday afternoon, all of the roughly 2,500 inmates at the Adams County Correctional Facility in Natchez were secure in their cells on lockdown, which Mayfield said will continue indefinitely as the investigation continues. Guard killed, several others injured in riot at Mississippi prison, officials say . It was a far different scene about 24 hours before. Mayfield said that, about 2:40 p.m. Sunday, a fight broke out either among members of one gang or between members of rival factions in a prison yard and soon ballooned out of control. With a core group of about 300 inmates involved -- meaning most others were simply caught up in the chaos -- the disturbance quickly spread through the grounds. ""It turned into a mob mentality, and ... it just expanded so quickly,"" the sheriff said. Sometime early in the riot, a guard was assaulted and ended up on the roof of a building, Mayfield said. That guard -- later identified as Catlin Carithers, 24 -- was brought out through the facility's gates within an hour, only to be later pronounced dead due to blunt head force trauma, according to the county coroner. The disturbance continued for hours more around the western Mississippi facility, which houses illegal immigrants from around the region who are serving time after convictions for both violent and nonviolent crimes. The Tennessee-based Corrections Corporation of America operates the facility and employs all those within. At one point, inmates pulled out some mattresses, rags and other materials into a prison yard and started a fire. Others used an array of weapons, such as mop and broom handles, in their fight. Meanwhile, the facility's employees at once tried to maintain order and take cover. Mayfield said earlier Monday that at least 24 or 25 hostages were being held at one point. County and state authorities were on site within an hour to maintain the perimeter and help the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) bring the situation under control, according to Mayfield, who noted that FBI agents were also there. No gunshots were ever fired, and Mayfield praised the ""restraint"" by law enforcement. Authorities did use ""pepper balls,"" which the sheriff said are shot from something akin to a paintball gun. ""The whole thing was probably over by 11 or 11:30 p.m. Sunday,"" at which point all the inmates had been forced out into a prison yard, Mayfield said. But it wasn't until 3:30 a.m. Monday that every prisoner had been searched and brought back to his housing unit. In addition to Carithers, about 10 workers at the facility were injured, including one who suffered head trauma and was transported about 100 miles northwest to the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, according to the sheriff. CCA, meanwhile, has reported that 16 of its staffers at the prison were treated and released from the hospital. Four inmates had to be taken to area emergency rooms for treatment -- for injuries such as a stab wound, a concussion and rib injuries -- though Mayfield said he didn't think any of them needed to be admitted. CCA had said three inmates received such treatment. The sheriff stressed that the public was never in danger, as the riot was confined within the facility and there were no breaches of its perimeter. While he didn't know what exactly caused the riot, Mayfield did say that, ""from the outside looking in, I can't see anything that would have prevented it."" He lavished praise on the decisions made by Corrections Corporation of America and law enforcement, saying, ""I don't think they could have handled it any better."" The sheriff added that the facility has ""not had anything of this magnitude at all"" since opening in 2009. ""This could have happened anywhere, anytime,"" Mayfield said. Yet the American Civil Liberties Union said the riot wasn't surprising because companies like the Corrections Corporation of America ""have incentives to cut corners even at the expense of decent and safe conditions""; they employ ""too often poorly paid and trained"" staff; and they run facilities with conditions that ""are often woefully inadequate."" ""This weekend's riot should make clear to Mississippi and every other state that for-profit incarceration must end,"" the advocacy group said in a statement. ""We need to save taxpayer money by ending the nation's addiction to incarceration, not give money to private companies whose profit depends on locking up as many people as possible.""","NEW: The ACLU blasts ""for-profit incarceration,"" says the riot wasn't surprising .

"Los Angeles and London (CNN) -- Can the roof of your house help you breathe easier by reducing the amount of harmful pollutants from urban air? ""Yes,"" claims John Renowden, vice president of technology at Boral Roofing, a U.S. company that has introduced a line of roof tiles that they say have pollution-busting properties. Based near Los Angeles, the most ozone-polluted city in the U.S., according to 2012 rankings by the American Lung Association, the company says its ""Smog-Eating Tiles"" improve air quality by neutralizing smog-forming nitrogen oxides released by most vehicles (read more about smog in our fact box). The tiles are coated with titanium dioxide, a photocalyst that can oxidize harmful air pollutants emitted in the burning of fossil fuels. When exposed to natural light, the titanium dioxide breaks down nitrogen oxides in the air and turns them into harmless calcium nitrate. ""Calcium nitrate ... washes off your roof with normal precipitation and is a regular garden fertilizer,"" said Renowden. He notes that the tiles typically add between $600-$1000 to the price of tiling an average roof. He adds that over a one-year period, the tiles on a 2,000 sq/ft house can oxidize nitrogen oxides ""equivalent to driving 10,000 miles a year in your car."" Read more: Ancient 'air-conditioning' cools building sustainably . Boral Roofing claims to be the first construction company in the U.S. to introduce titanium dioxide coatings to roofing products. The technology originates in Japan and has been adopted in Europe by a number of industries. In the last few years, it has been used in the production of several products, including eco-friendly cement, architectural panels and paints. The de-polluting properties of titanium dioxide, a compound commonly used as a white pigment in paints and plastics, were tested in a European Commission-backed project in 2005. ""Tests in urban settings determined that some pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides, which are a major pollutant contained in exhaust gases, could be reduced by 20-70%,"" according to the European Commission's Environmental Technologies Action Plan. Read more: The eco artists turning trash into treasure . Air pollution is one of today's biggest urban problems. It poses a serious threat to the health of city dwellers, according to experts. Air pollution -- outdoor and indoor -- is estimated to cause more than two million deaths a year worldwide, according to Maria Neira, director of health and environment at the World Health Organization. ""It is definitely one of the biggest health challenges we are confronted with today,"" she said. Exposure to urban air pollutants can increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases and cancer as well as trigger asthma attacks, she added. A recent study on the UK's air quality by MIT pollution experts Steve Yim and Steven Barrett found that traffic pollution is killing more people than road accidents per year, causing 13,000 premature deaths on an annual basis. A brief uptick in traffic-related air pollution may also be enough to increase a person's short-term risk of stroke, another report found in February this year. Four in 10 Americans live in counties with dangerous levels of either ozone or particle pollution, according to the American Lung Association. The organization's recent State of the Air 2012 report found that California is home to many of the country's most polluted cities, with Los Angeles continuing to top the list of ozone-polluted cities thanks to its heavy road traffic and trade ports. Renowden says that more sustainable solutions are needed in the fight against urban air pollution. ""We have to move past our oil dependence but it won't happen overnight,"" he said. Read more: Hacking the city for a greener future . Janice Nolen, national policy adviser at the American Lung Association, says that rather than dealing with the harmful effects of air pollution, the focus should be on tackling the problem at source. ""What we have found historically in any kind of pollution is that the best way to tackle the problem is to clean up the sources,"" she said, ""rather than trying cleaning it up afterwards when it's in the air."" ""If you can keep those raw ingredients that make up ozone from coming out of the tailpipes and the smokestacks, then you don't have to worry so much about cleaning it up later on,"" adds Nolen.

"(CNN) -- The first U.S. case of mad cow disease in six years sparked fears of illness that prompted two South Korean retailers to suspend the sale of American beef. However, public health officials said the risk of Americans contracting the disease is low, given that the affected dairy cow in central California never entered the human food chain and did not contract bovine spongiform encephalopathy through contaminated animal feed. ""It was never presented for slaughter for human consumption, so at no time presented a risk to the food supply or human health,"" said John Clifford, the Agriculture Department's chief veterinarian. What you need to know about mad cow disease . In South Korea, one of the world's largest importers of U.S. beef, the discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy led retailer LotteMart to remove American beef from store shelves. ""Currently, the sale of U.S. beef is temporarily suspended to ease our customers from anxiety,"" LotteMart said. The South Korean government said it will step up checks on U.S. beef imports but not halt them for now. In 2010, South Korea imported 125,000 tons of U.S. beef, a 97% increase from the year before, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. Sarah Klein, food safety attorney for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said there is no need for consumers to take precautions based on this case. ""A case of a single cow with bovine spongiform encephalopathy is not a reason for significant concern on the part of consumers, and there is no reason to believe the beef or milk supply is unsafe,"" she said. ""If the cow were exposed to the typical strain of BSE via animal feed -- and the government says that's not the case here -- that would have represented a significant failure,"" she said. She said the government would have had a difficult time tracking down other cattle that may have been eating the same feed because the nation lacks an effective animal identification program. Elisa Odabashian, the director of the West Coast office of Consumers Union, said the government's testing program is not sufficient to ensure that U.S. beef is safe. ""The USDA tests only about 40,000 of the 35 million cows that are killed every year,"" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""That's just a tiny fraction. ... They're not looking very hard for mad cow disease, and so they're not finding it very often."" In a statement issued to CNN in 2006, the USDA said it does not support 100% testing because the disease is difficult to detect in young cattle, the primary source of beef in the United States. ""Recognizing the international scientific consensus that BSE (Mad Cow Disease) is a disease that is not detected in young animals, there isn't any nation in the world that requires 100-percent testing for BSE,"" the statement said. But Odabashian said the agency has also vetoed efforts by private companies to carry out their own testing, at their own expense, and then labeling their product as BSE-free. ""Those companies in the United States that want to test their own meat have been prohibited from doing so by the USDA,"" she said. ""We think that's wrong."" The cow's carcass was at a Baker Commodities Inc. rendering facility in Hanford, California, according to company Executive Vice President Dennis Luckey. The company renders animal byproducts and had randomly selected the animal for testing on April 18, he said. ""We are in the business of removing dead animals from dairies in the Central Valley,"" he said. ""As part of that program, we participate in the BSE surveillance program."" The sample was sent to the University of California at Davis for initial testing, which came back inconclusive. It was then sent to the Department of Agriculture's laboratory in Ames, Iowa, where it tested positive, the agency said. The carcass was in quarantine Wednesday. ""We're waiting now for USDA to tell us how to dispose of it,"" Luckey said. A USDA spokesman, Larry Hawkins, said the agency was not releasing the name of the dairy ""because it's our policy not to when we are in the middle of the investigation."" But Rep. Devin Nunes, R-California, said it was from a dairy farm in Tulare County. ""We did trace it back to a farm,"" Nunes said, adding that the discovery ""demonstrates the strength of our surveillance system."" In a statement, California Department of Food and Agriculture Secretary Karen Ross said CDFA veterinarians were working with the USDA to determine whether other cows are at risk. ""Feed restrictions in place in California and around the country for the last 15 years minimize that risk to the greatest degree possible,"" she said. Eating contaminated meat or some other animal products from cattle that have BSE is thought to be the cause of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The fatal brain disease was blamed for the deaths of 150 people in Britain, where there was an outbreak in the 1980s and 1990s. Learn more about Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease . In people, symptoms of the disease include psychiatric and behavioral changes, movement deficits, memory disturbances and cognitive impairments. BSE can cause infected animals to display nervousness or aggression, difficulty in coordination and standing up, decreased milk production or weight loss. It is usually transmitted between cows through the practice of recycling bovine carcasses for meat and bone meal protein, which is fed to other cattle. In this case, the Agricultural Department reported that the cow had a rare form of BSE not likely carried by contaminated feed. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said Monday that he remains confident in the health of the national herd and the safety of beef and dairy products. ""This is an atypical case, which means it's not connected in any way, shape or form to feed. ... A very rare circumstance and situation,"" Vilsack said. ""It can just sort of come up and pop up -- sometimes it's genetic."" Since 2004, the USDA has removed the brain and the spinal column, the parts suspected of causing mad cow disease in humans, from the food system. Unlike most other meat-borne illnesses, such as those caused by E.-coli bacteria, cooking does not kill the infectious agent that causes mad cow disease. Consumers who wish to exercise extra caution can follow the advice presented by the Web-based consumer advocacy group Consumeraffairs.com, which advises the avoidance of brains, neck bones and beef cheeks, bone marrow and cuts of beef that are sold on the bone. The group also says to choose boneless cuts of meat and ground beef only if it has been ground in the store. ""Evidence shows that our systems and safeguards to prevent BSE are working, as are similar actions taken by countries around the world,"" said the USDA's Clifford. Last year, 29 cases of BSE were reported worldwide, down 99% from the peak of 37,311 cases in 1992. ""This is directly attributable to the impact and effectiveness of feed bans as a primary control measure for the disease,"" he said. The Agriculture Department confirmed the first case of mad cow disease in America on December 23, 2003, in a cow born in Alberta, Canada, in April 1997, only four months before the United States and Canada began banning the use of brain and spinal cord tissue in cattle feed. A second U.S. case was confirmed June 24, 2005, and a third on March 13, 2006. The infected California cow confirmed Tuesday was America's fourth case of mad cow disease.

"Buenos Aires (CNN) -- A premature baby who survived hours in a morgue refrigerator in Argentina was in ""very serious"" condition after doctors detected an infection, state media reported. The infection could compromise Luz Milagros Veron's neurological system and kidney function, the Telam news agency reported Thursday. The 9-day-old baby was being treated with antibiotics, said Diana Vesco, chief of neonatology at the Perrando Hospital in northeast Argentina, according to the state news agency. The baby's survival grabbed global headlines and prompted her parents to give her a new name: Luz Milagros, the Spanish words for light and miracles. Pronounced dead after her premature birth on April 3, she withstood more than 10 hours in a coffin inside a morgue refrigerator before being found alive. ""Today is the eighth day of my daughter's resurrection,"" the girl's father, Fabian Veron, told CNN Wednesday. Every, doctor, nurse and morgue worker who dealt with the baby at the hospital has been suspended as an investigation gets underway, officials said. ""There was an error of medical protocol. This is about human error,"" said Francisco Baquero, Chaco province's health minister, according to Telam. Provincial officials provided compensation to the family Thursday, Telam reported, including cell phones, an economic subsidy, a motorcycle and transportation assistance. Earlier this week, the hospital's director told CNN proper protocol had been followed. The baby had no vital signs when she was born, hospital director Dr. Jose Luis Meirino told CNN. The gynecologist on hand didn't find any signs of life, so he passed the baby to a neonatal doctor who also didn't find vital signs, Meirino said. The doctors observed the baby for a while, and only then, pronounced her dead. Two morgue workers then put her body inside a little wooden coffin and placed it in the morgue. ""Up to that point, there were still no vital signs,"" the hospital director said. That night, mother Analia Boutet insisted on seeing her dead daughter's body, Veron said. ""They put the coffin on top of a stretcher and we looked for a little crowbar to open it because it was nailed shut,"" Veron told a local television station. ""It was nailed shut. I put the crowbar in there and started prying. I took a breath and took the lid off."" Boutet approached the baby's body, touched her hand, and heard a cry, Veron told CNN. Veron's brother-in-law rushed the baby back to the neonatal ward. He clutched her close to his chest for warmth. She felt like an ice-cold bottle against his body, the relative told Veron. ""I can't explain what happened. Only that God has performed a miracle,"" Veron said. Related story: Did cold temperatures help 'miracle' baby survive? Meirino said it was the first time he had witnessed an incident like this, but that a nearly identical thing happened in Israel in 2008. In that case, a baby was found alive in a morgue refrigerator after having been declared dead. Some doctors at the time said that it was possible that the low temperatures inside the refrigerator had slowed down the baby's metabolism and helped her survive. However, that baby later died.

"(CNN) -- News that the New York Police Department has a man in custody who has implicated himself in the 1979 disappearance of Etan Patz raises the tantalizing possibility that this case might finally be solved. It's the latest in a long series of twists and turns as investigators try to unravel a mystery that has stymied them for 33 years: What happened to Etan Patz? Commissioner Ray Kelly of the New York Police Department says investigators will divulge more details later Thursday. Police: Man in custody in Patz case . In the meantime, the man's statements raise hopes that investigators might learn -- at last -- of what happened to the six-year-old boy who disappeared on his way to the school bus stop 33 years ago. There have been a series of such leads over the years in the case, which changed the nation's attitudes toward children's safety and helped launch the missing children's movement. One of those leads raised hopes last month of a break in the case -- but it did not pan out. First there was the drifter living in a drainage tunnel with pictures of boys who looked eerily similar to Etan. A rash of false leads that took investigators as far afield as Israel chasing look-alikes. Then, more recently, a cadaver dog picking up the scent of human remains in a basement near Etan's home, leading a team of investigators to tear it up. Each time, the result has been the same: sometimes a few answers, often more questions, and rarely anything resembling the full truth for Etan's parents, Stan and Julie Patz. The family has endured years of crank calls and far-fetched theories on the home telephone number they never changed in hope Etan might some day try to call. ""They exacted the biggest emotional cost, riding Stan and Julie on a steep vertical incline up the tracks, to plunge straight back down to hell every time,"" journalist Lisa Cohen writes in her definitive account of the case, ""After Etan: The Missing Child Case That Held America Captive."" Missing child case 'awakened America' Such dramatic ups and downs have long been part and parcel of the investigation into Etan's disappearance. In the days and weeks after he went missing in May, 1979, police, the family and neighborhood volunteers worked tirelessly tracking down leads, according to Cohen. In the two weeks following Etan's disappearance, police put in more than 4,000 hours on the case, interviewing some 500 people, Cohen writes in her book. Police cruisers swarmed the neighborhood as volunteers plastered the area with 10,000 posters, according to Cohen's account. Then came the first letdown. The police officers who'd camped in the Patz home, answering phones and dispatching detectives to follow up on possible leads, packed up and left, the emergency phase of the response over. In their place, they left a legal pad next to the phone and instructions to log each call. What had been a stream of calls slowed to a trickle, but kept coming, with their stories of boys matching Etan's description seen in places near and far. None panned out. Three years later, in 1982, the roller-coaster would start its climb again with reports that a man, Juan Antonio Ramos, had swiped a boy's book bag and tried to lure him and another boy into the drainage tunnel where he was living. Police found photos of young boys among the man's possessions, and took them to Etan's parents to see if their son was one of them. ""Almost three years into their ordeal, the half-formed scab covering their private life and private pain was being picked off yet again to ooze fresh blood,"" Cohen wrote in her book. ""They greeted the news with the now familiar mix of trepidation tinged with the faint hope, one that could never be discounted, that new exposure could yield new information."" The case didn't pan out, at least initially, and Ramos vanished. Interest moved on to other reports, Cohen wrote in her book: A photo in Israel, another in Massachusetts. A cab driver who said he picked up the boy the morning of his disappearance. Like the other leads, nothing came of them. In 1988, the cycle began turning again. Investigators turned their attention back to Ramos after locating him in a Pennsylvania prison -- where he was serving time on a molestation conviction. They brought Ramos back to New York for questioning, and got a bombshell, Cohen writes. Ramos acknowledged picking up a boy he believed was Etan and bringing him back to his apartment for sex, according to Cohen. But he said the boy declined his advances, so he took him to the subway and waved goodbye. Three years later, in 1991, after helping secure another conviction against Ramos, federal authorities visited the Patz family again. They were there to deliver the news the family had long dreaded -- that investigators believed their son was dead and they believed Ramos was responsible, Cohen writes. ""The words were not earth-shattering; they weren't saying anything that twelve years into the case both parents didn't already know,"" Cohen writes in her book. ""But now for the first time law enforcement was sitting across the table, telling them that the weight of evidence supported their worst fears."" At the same time, the federal authorities said they'd come to the end of their journey, saying only New York state prosecutors could take the case to court. They never have. There have been more milestones since that day in 1991. In the summer of 2000, New York investigators examined evidence from the basement of the apartment building where Ramos once lived. In 2001, Stan Patz had his son declared legally dead, and in 2004, a judge found Ramos liable for Etan's death in a wrongful death civil lawsuit. But none of those milestones brought them closer to what the family has long said it wants, barring the return of their son: a criminal conviction. In 2010, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance reopened the investigation after his election, something he had promised to do during his campaign. The promise that authorities were closer to mounting a criminal case seemed alluringly close last month, when investigators flooded the neighborhood and began dismantling the basement where handyman Othniel Miller once had a workshop. Etan knew the man and had sometimes helped him with odd jobs before he disappeared, Cohen said in an interview on CNN at the time. Authorities had looked at the basement workshop years ago, but never tore up the place as they were doing now, she noted. Investigators recently renewed their interest in Miller, 75, in part after interviewing him about his connection to the basement. During the interview, a source said he blurted out, ""What if the body was moved?"" A few weeks ago, a cadaver dog picked up the scent of human remains. Then investigators began to tear down drywall and cut through concrete in search of clues. ""It was a huge number of resources being thrown into this case,"" forensic scientist Lawrence Kobilinsky told CNN last month. ""It shows you that this case is still alive in the minds, (of) not only the public, but certainly, of law enforcement."" Mike Huff, a retired police detective and cold-case investigator in Tulsa, Oklahoma, who now heads the International Association of Cold Case Investigators, said last month that as he watched coverage of the case, the kinds of details that were emerging led him to believe investigators were confident they had finally come up with a solid line on hard physical evidence in the case. The big news came over the weekend, when it leaked out that investigators had recovered a chunk of concrete that appeared to be stained with blood. ""I thought, 'Man, this is going to be a slam dunk, they already know the answer to this story,'"" Huff said. Then, suddenly, once again, nothing. The blood wasn't blood, it turned out. No human remains had been found. Etan's family had to be told that the search had come up empty. Through his attorney and daughter, Miller has denied any role in Etan's disappearance. Cases as old as this one can be tough to crack, Huff said. ""The longer it gets away, the more you really have to have hopes and prayers for technology to come into it,"" he said. While investigators didn't get the answers they wanted -- again -- Huff says there's still some good to take out of the effort. ""It's a success that 33 years later, somebody is still looking at it,"" he said.","The 33-year-old Etan Patz case continues to stymie investigators .
Investigators recently concluded a search of a basement near where the boy disappeared .
Like other leads, it failed to definitively reveal what happened to Etan Patz .

"(CNN) -- The daughter of deposed Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi asked international prosecutors to begin investigating her father's and brother's deaths as possible war crimes in a letter submitted Wednesday to the United Nations Security Council. Aisha Gadhafi, who fled to Algeria in August 2011, asked International Criminal Court Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo last year to open an investigation. The letter said Moreno-Ocampo had earlier replied to the initial request, ""indicating that he would announce his strategy concerning such an investigation on the occasion of his next report to the Security Council in the month of May 2012 and after taking stock of the investigative activities of the Libyan authorities."" ""I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that the Rome Statute founding the International Criminal Court obliges the Prosecutor to investigate all aspects of the Libyan situation referred to him by the Security Council,"" she said in a statement delivered by her attorney, Nick Kaufman. The ICC initially demanded that Libya hand over Moammar Gadhafi for trial after his capture, but then opened the possibility that he could be tried in Libya. He was killed in October 2011, along with his son Mutassim. Aisha Gadhafi is a former U.N. goodwill ambassador, as well as a lawyer who assisted in the defense of deposed Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, who was hanged in 2006. Her father ruled Libya for nearly 42 years, but was killed October 20, 2011, by NATO-backed Libyan forces who had ousted him. Gadhafi was initially captured alive and unharmed as troops from the National Transitional Council overran his hometown of Sirte, according to Mahmoud Jibril, Libya's then interim prime minister. But a gunbattle erupted between transitional council fighters and Gadhafi's supporters as his captors attempted to load him into a vehicle, Jibril said, leaving Gadhafi with a wound to his right arm. More shooting erupted as the vehicle drove away, and Gadhafi was hit in the head, Jibril said. The former leader died moments before arriving at a hospital in Misrata, he added, citing the city's coroner. Grainy video broadcast on Arabic satellite networks captured some of the onetime Libyan strongman's last moments, as the bloodied but still-alive Gadhafi was being hauled onto a truck. Another video showed a dead Gadhafi with what appeared to be a head wound. Ali Aujali, Libya's ambassador to the United States, said the National Transitional Council and the Libyan people wanted Gadhafi to be taken alive to answer for his crimes. In one video from the scene, a voice can be heard shouting, ""No, no, we want him alive, we want him alive.""","She asked prosecutors to begin investigating her father's and brother's deaths .

"(CNN) -- It took less than 10 seconds to bring a steel, 345-ton relic of the Cold War era crashing to the ground in the Nevada desert Wednesday. The 1,527-foot-tall BREN tower was the tallest free-standing structure west of the Mississippi River. It was also the tallest structure of its kind ever demolished, according to the National Nuclear Safety Administration. The tower stood taller than the Empire State Building (1,454 feet) and the Eiffel Tower (1,063 feet). It was also taller than the iconic Stratosphere (1,148 feet) on the Las Vegas strip. Originally constructed in 1962, the BREN Tower took its name from the nuclear radiation experiment for which it was built: Bare Reactor Experiment - Nevada. BREN Tower was designed to provide a way for scientists to accurately estimate radiation doses received by survivors of the atomic bombs detonated over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. The tower stood 1,527 feet tall because that was the height at which ""Little Boy,"" the first atomic bomb used in warfare, was detonated over Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. To conduct research at the time, engineers mounted a small unshielded (bare) reactor on the tower and built a mock Japanese village near the base of the tower. The mock village was intended to simulate the shielding effects that rooftops and walls had on radiation, according to Dante Pistone, public affairs manager for the Nevada National Security Site. Scientists used the research to estimate radiation doses residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were subjected to when the bomb detonated. According to the Nevada National Security Site, the data became a cornerstone of modern radiation research. The tower stood in a rural area about 65 miles north of Las Vegas on the Nevada National Security Site. The enormous proving ground is larger than the state of Rhode Island. In 1992 the U.S. government stopped full-scale nuclear testing on the site. Despite its height, in 1966 the U.S. government decided to move the tower to a different location at a cost of $380,000. The move was made so scientists could conduct further experiments using BREN Tower while not disrupting underground nuclear testing in the area, according to the Nevada National Security Site. Last used for research in 1999, in recent years the tower fell into disrepair. The beacons used to alert commercial aviation at the top of the tower had failed, and the elevator used by workers to ascend to the top was no longer safely reliable. It would have cost close to $1 million to repair the tower to its original state. Wednesday's demolition cost about half of what it would have cost to repair the tower.","BREN was the tallest free-standing structure west of the Mississippi River .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge wants to see secret videotapes showing terror suspects forcibly removed from their cells at the Guantanamo Bay military prison. The sharply worded order from Judge John Bates, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, was issued late Wednesday in a lawsuit brought by relatives of Kuwaiti inmates being held at the overseas facility in Cuba. At issue is whether the Pentagon can withhold these kinds of government records -- including various media material -- that would be an invasion of privacy, or involve ""internal rules and practices of an agency."" The defendants in a lawsuit demanded access under a Freedom of Information Act request, claiming military guards have been mistreating the four prisoners, including the alleged ""forced cell extractions"" (FCEs). After three previous orders to speed up delivery of the material or justify withholding it, the judge appeared miffed at the government's latest efforts to hinder release of the 45 videotapes and one audiotape in question. A previous ""last chance"" admonition by the judge apparently was not met by the Justice Department. ""Attempts by the Department to 'correct' or supplement its prior submissions have resulted in further obfuscation,"" said Bates, who said he now needs to see the disputed tapes for himself. ""The written (descriptive) submissions provided by the Department simply do not allow the court meaningfully to assess whether the claimed exemptions actually apply."" Federal officials had said access to the tapes by the plaintiffs or to the public at large would violate the privacy, and perhaps endanger the safety, of the U.S. guards seen removing the foreign prisoners. But the court was skeptical such exemptions would apply. ""No argument has been made here that the videos relate to 'issues of employee relations and human resources' nor would such an argument be viable based on the record currently before the court,"" wrote Bates, who was nominated by former President George W. Bush just a week before the September 11, 2001 terror attacks. ""The court will order that a representative sample of the videorecordings be produced"" for review by the judge in private, in his chambers. Bates would then have the discretion to turn over the material to the defense, which could later be presented at any trial. The current lawsuit was filed four years ago, and is one of several brought by Gitmo detainees over their treatment and continued custody without charges or trial. The case is International Counsel Bureau v. U.S. Department of Defense (cv-08-1063).","Order was issued in a suit brought by relatives of Kuwaiti inmates at Gitmo .

"(CNN) -- With his health in question and speculation rampant about his future, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has named 10 Venezuelans to an influential commission. The Council of State, as it is known, is stipulated in the Venezuelan Constitution as the highest circle of advisers to the president, but has never actually been formed. Now in a battle with cancer, Chavez announced in January that it was time to constitute the council, and Wednesday named his appointments. Venezuelans and international observers alike are likely to scrutinize his choices for any signs of transition or succession should Chavez become incapacitated. Chavez's choices include a veteran of his administration, a military man and a writer, among others. The president of the council will be Vice President Elias Jaua, as the constitution stipulates. Chavez named five principal members. Among them are Jose Vincente Rangel, a journalist who came to hold a number of posts under Chavez, including foreign minister, defense minister and vice president. Venezuela's former ambassador to the Organization of American States and former foreign minister Roy Chaderton was also named to the council. German Mundarain was elected by the country's national assembly as ombudsman from 2000 to 2007. Rafael Giacopini is an active duty admiral who currently serves as secretary of the country's defense council. Chavez also named Luis Britto Garcia, a playwright and author, to the council. In addition, the president listed five others as alternate members. The timing of the appointments is significant, as speculation increases over who will succeed Chavez if he becomes too ill to govern, or if he dies. He has been reluctant to name a successor, but the Council of State, as envisioned in the constitution, stands to wield significant influence. The council is the ""highest body of advisers"" to the government, the constitution states. ""There are no surprising names here,"" said Javier Corrales, a professor of political science at Amherst College. With so much uncertainty surrounding Chavez's health and the upcoming elections, the appointments answer part of the puzzle of who is close to Chavez, he said. But it does not end the uncertainty, he added. Whether the group simply advises Chavez, or a successor, or takes up more powers of its own, ""anything is possible,"" Corrales said. He envisioned a hypothetical scenario in which Chavez remained president, but, too ill to make decisions, delegated power to the council. Chavez in January said the council was ""an institution that we lack and that is in the constitution but that we never activated. It's sowed here. The time to activate it has come."" The fact that Jaua, as vice president, will preside over the council elevates his status and could signal a victory for those supporting him as a potential successor to Chavez. Fidel and Raul Castro, who are trying to influence the succession, favor Jaua, said Roger Noriega, an analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute and former U.S. ambassador to the OAS. Analysts also say Chavez's brother, Adan Chavez, is also liked by the Cubans. But Chavez is not the only one with say on the council members. According to the constitution, the national assembly and the supreme court get to name one person each to the body. Both institutions are favorable to the president. The governors of all the states will also have to pick one governor to be part of the council, too. CNN's Arthur Brice contributed to this report.","Chavez named members for the Council of State .
The body will have influence over the government .

"(CNN) -- Relief expressed Sunday at the death of Pan Am 103 bomber Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi by relatives of some of his 270 victims was tempered by still-smoldering anger at his release from prison more than two years ago. ""Fine. He deserved to die,"" said Susan Cohen of Cape May Court House, New Jersey, whose daughter Theodora died in the December 1988 airplane bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. ""He was a mass murderer. I feel no pity around him. He got to die with his family around him. My daughter, at age 20, died a brutal, horrible death."" Al Megrahi was the only person convicted in connection with the bombing. In August 2009, he was released from a Scottish prison on the grounds that he was diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer and had only a few months to live. He was sent home to Libya on ""compassionate"" grounds, receiving a hero's welcome at the airport. 2011: Convicted Lockerbie bomber says truth will eventually come out . ""I think Megrahi exemplified the classic case that no matter how heinous the crime, that justice can be bought,"" said Victoria Cummock of Miami, who lost her husband John in the bombing and serves as co-president of the Families of Pan Am 103 group. ""His death is a relief,"" Cummock said. ""Finally Megrahi will be judged by the highest of authorities -- our maker, his maker."" Barbara Zwynenburg of West Nyack, New York, whose 29-year-old son Mark died aboard the plane, said, ""It's about time. I'm glad he's dead."" But she called the deal resulting in al Megrahi's release ""disgraceful."" ""He was supposed to be ill and was allegedly ready to die,"" Zwynenburg said. ""He went home to his family, and our son never came home."" At the time of al Megrahi's release, Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, son of then-Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, told Libyan channel Al Mutawassit that ""in all commercial contracts for oil and gas with Britain, (al Megrahi) was always on the negotiating table,"" adding that then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair raised al Megrahi's case each time he visited Libya. 2011: CNN's Nic Robertson tracks down Lockerbie bomber . Blair said that while Libya brought up al Megrahi, no deals were ever made when he was in power to arrange for his release. British authorities rejected that al Megrahi's release was tied to British business deals with Libya. However, victims' relatives expressed disbelief. ""That was a disgusting deal that involved oil and money,"" Cohen said. ""All of us,"" said Cummock, ""have been pawns in all of this."" Bert Ammerman of New Jersey, whose brother Tommy was aboard Pan Am 103, said Sunday he was ""pleased"" at Megrahi's death. Megrahi's 2009 release, he said, was ""when I was most angry in this 24-year journey."" Libya agreed in 2003 to pay $2.7 billion in compensation to the families of the bombing victims, though Gadhafi always remained cagey about admitting official Libyan involvement in the bombing. Gadhafi died in October following months of unrest in Libya. ""Gadhafi's death brought me a great deal of, the word is, pleasure,"" Cohen said. ""I was happy when he died because he was the primary villain in this."" Megrahi, she said, was ""sent to do the job."" Ammerman said Gadhafi's ouster and death also helped reduce some of his anger at al Megrahi's release. ""He was the big fish and Megrahi, as far as I'm concerned, became a minor actor once Gadhafi was killed,"" he said. But, he said, the release was ""a true act of betrayal by our government and the British government."" He felt the United States didn't do enough to keep al Megrahi behind bars. The full truth about the bombing may have died with al Megrahi, who never provided details. If Megrahi had not been released, Cohen said, he might have talked when the Gadhafi regime fell. But Cohen and Ammerman said they believe others still in Libya or former Gadhafi regime officials may also have been complicit in the bombing, and that U.S. and British officials should go into the country and conduct interviews in an effort to find them. ""He was not the only person taking orders,"" Cohen said of al Megrahi. ""... We really do need to know how these terrible things are done and who's involved in them ... The key is, where do we go from here?"" Cummock said she previously met with Blair, who told her the Scottish authorities were the ones who released al Megrahi. And she said in the fall, she met with Mustafa Abdul Jalil, chairman of Libya's Transitional National Council, who has said he has proof Gadhafi ordered the bombing. After the Gadhafi regime fell last year, U.S. officials renewed their call for al Megrahi's imprisonment. ""Once there's a government in place, we will renew our calls that Megrahi, who should never have been released in the first place, be returned to serve the rest of his sentence,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in October. However, Cummock said, ""I don't think the U.S. government or the U.K. government has the will to find out the truth about why Pan Am 103 was attacked and hold people involved accountable. We've seen (nearly) 24 years of turning the page."" ""Both the Scottish and British governments have not been forthcoming,"" said U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, on Sunday. ""The whole deal (regarding al Megrahi's release) smelled of a trade of oil for this man's freedom, and that was almost blasphemy given what a horrible person he was and the terrible destruction and tragedy he caused."" ""This is long overdue,"" Zwynenburg said of al Megrahi's death. ""It's been 23 years now, but you never get over losing your kid."" CNN's Miguel Susana contributed to this report.","Relatives of those who died are still angry about bomber's release .

"(CNN) -- The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation threatened legal action over the online sale of a vial purportedly containing dried blood from the former president following a 1981 assassination attempt. ""If indeed this story is true, it's a craven act and we will use every legal means to stop its sale or purchase,"" said a statement from John Heubusch, the foundation's executive director. Bidding for the vial topped 9,181 pounds (nearly $14,500) as of Tuesday, with two days left in the sale. The item is being offered by PFC Auctions, based on the island of Guernsey, a British dependency. ""Dried blood residue from President Reagan ... can be seen clearly in the vial with a quarter-inch ring of blood residue at the end of the inserted rubber stopper,"" the listing says. On March 30, 1981, John Hinckley fired six shots at Reagan as the president left the Washington Hilton after delivering a speech. Reagan was rushed to George Washington University Hospital for emergency surgery. The vial's seller, in a letter of provenance included in the sale, said it has been in his family's possession since the day of the assassination attempt. ""Back in the '70s and '80s, my mother worked for Bio Science Laboratories in Columbia, Maryland,"" the letter says. The lab was contracted with George Washington University Hospital to handle blood testing, and did Reagan's blood work and testing. ""The test tube and the lab slip that I have are for his blood work to be tested for lead on 03/30/1981,"" according to the letter. ""The testing was completed and the test tube was sitting on my mother's desk."" The seller says in the listing his mother asked the lab director if she could keep the paperwork and test tube, and was allowed to do so. The seller said his mother and father have both since died. ""We've spoken to GW Hospital and are assured an investigation as to how something like this could possibly happen is underway,"" Heubusch's statement said. ""Any individual, including a president of the United States, should feel confident that once they enter into the care of a medical system, their privacy and rights are held inviolable."" The hospital declined comment to CNN on Tuesday. The seller said he had contacted the Reagan National Library and spoke to its director, asking if the library would like to purchase the vial. The director said the library would accept the vial as a donation, the seller said, but the director also wanted to check with legal counsel, the National Archives and the FBI, among others. ""He called back in 25 minutes and said that everything was OK,"" the seller wrote. ""The National Archives was not interested in what I had, nor was the Secret Service, the FBI and other agencies. Since 30 years had passed by, he thought that it was simply something that was of no importance at this time and that I was free to do ... whatever I wanted with it."" The seller said he did not want to return the vial to Reagan's family, ""since I had served under Pres. Reagan when he was my Commander in Chief when I was in the Army from '87-'91 and that I was a real fan of Reaganomics and felt that Pres. Reagan himself would rather see me sell it rather than donating it."" A form also being sold with the vial contains Reagan's patient ID number at George Washington Hospital, the seller said. The form and a label on the vial contain the names of doctors at the hospital as well, according to the seller. Reagan served two terms as president. He died in June 2004 at age 93. Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the shooting, which also wounded then-press secretary James Brady, Secret Service Agent Timothy McCarthy and police officer Thomas Delahanty. Hinckley has been a patient at St. Elizabeths mental hospital in Washington for three decades. A hearing was held earlier this year on his request that he be allowed longer visits to his elderly mother's home in Virginia. A judge in February said he would rule on the matter later. CNN's Devon Sayers contributed to this report.","The Ronald Reagan Foundation calls the sale ""a craven act""

"(CNN) -- His fans are literally throwing money at him. The Chinese artist, activist and Internet sensation Ai Weiwei has collected hundreds of thousands of dollars from fans who want to help him pay back taxes of $2.3 million. Many are simply throwing the money into his Beijing compound. ""His supporters have folded 100 yuan notes -- the equivalent of $15.75 -- into paper airplanes that glided into the compound. Others wrapped the money around pieces of fruit and hurled it over the wall,"" the LA Times wrote on its World Now blog. ""Or more traditionally Chinese, they stuffed it into red envelopes."" Ai Weiwei pays $1.3M tax bond over jail fears . If you're not one of his 110,000 Twitter followers, you may never have heard of Ai. But the architect who designed the Bird's Nest stadium for the Beijing Olympics in 2008 has become one of China's most noted political dissidents and online activists. At the recent PopTech conference in Maine, CNN sat down with Alison Klayman, who spent several years following Ai for an upcoming documentary called ""Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry,"" to learn more about his fame in China and his mastery of the Internet. ""The truth is I don't believe it's his art -- in terms of what's shown in a museum -- that may have put him in the position that he's in,"" Klayman said, referring to Ai's three-month detention, which ended in June, and the fact that he's been targeted by Chinese authorities as a dissident. ""It's really about how his life is his art. It's about his activities, how he gives interviews very freely. He does not self-censor what he thinks,"" she said. ""It's also the organizing he's done online. Part of his art includes underground documentaries that he films with collaborators and posts online for free. They have to do with the questions and conversation that he curates online -- first on his blog, until it was shut down, and now on Twitter."" Ai was able to use the Internet, to a degree, to circumvent authorities, she said. ""In a society where all official media is subject to censorship -- from micro-blogs up to party papers -- that's also an incredibly subversive thing to be able to connect to people,"" Klayman said. ""And the truth is censorship cannot be an all-knowing eye, and people are having very interesting conversations even within the firewall -- and on Twitter, which is blocked in China, so people have to use technology to go outside the firewall."" Ai came late to technology but adopted it with gusto, she said. ""Ai Weiwei never used a computer -- never really knew how to type -- before 2005,"" she said. ""And in 2005 he was invited by Sina.com, which is a big Internet company in China, to have a celebrity blog. He was a well-known architect and artist, and he decided to take that on. His father was also a poet, so he was also interested in seeing how his writing chops or his literary chops were. And he immediately was drawn to the medium. He's always been looking for ways to communicate -- and suddenly he saw the Internet."" Last year, Klayman asked Ai about the biggest paradigm shift in his life. ""His answer to me was the Internet. 'The Internet is what affected me and has opened up so many doors and has ignited me.'"" she said. ""Now, as I'm completing the documentary ... I really understand what that means.""","Ai Weiwei is an artist and Internet activist in China .

"(CNN) -- European Union foreign ministers on Monday imposed new sanctions on the Syrian regime, urging it to adopt a U.N.-backed peace plan that so far has failed to stop the mounting carnage. At the same time, effects of the Syrian conflict are being felt in neighboring Lebanon, where clashes have killed at least seven people near Tripoli. The EU ministers froze the assets of two firms and imposed a travel ban and asset freeze on three people believed to provide funding for the regime, the European Council announced. It is the 15th time the European Union has imposed restrictions on Syria since a popular uprising began there early last year. ""The continuing violence is appalling,"" EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Monday, adding that the sanctions are aimed at the regime and not the civilian population. ""As long as the repression continues, we will continue to put pressure on those responsible for it,"" she said in Brussels. Inside Syria on Monday, regime forces suffered heavy casualties during clashes in Rastan, a city that has been pummeled by government forces, opposition activists said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it received ""preliminary information that three armored personnel carriers were destroyed and that at least 23 soldiers were killed."" Elsewhere in Syria, at least four people were killed Monday, said the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition network. The dead included a child struck by random gunfire from the regime's army in Deir Ezzor, the LCC said. The group also posted reports of the military aiming mortars and heavy artillery at the Homs village of Al-Burnhanieh. The Syrian government on Monday reported four deaths, including a colonel and lieutenant colonel killed by ""armed terrorist groups"" in Damascus and Daraa, according to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency. CNN cannot independently verify reports of deaths and violence because the Syrian government has severely restricted access by international media. The Syrian conflict is playing a role in clashes that broke out Sunday in neighboring Lebanon, where it has ignited historic divisions among residents of two Tripoli suburbs. The fighting in Lebanon pits residents of Bab al-Tebbaneh, a Sunni stronghold hostile to the Syrian regime, against Alawite residents of Jabal Mohsen, who support Syrian President and fellow Alawite Bashar al-Assad. At least seven people have been killed and 45 others hurt in the two days of fighting, Lebanon's National News Agency reported Monday. Islamists in northern Lebanon, specifically Tripoli, have opposed the Syrian regime for decades. But as Syria strengthened its control over Lebanon in the 1990s, it also strengthened elements of the Alawite community, a Shiite offshoot, in the north. The fighting in the Tripoli suburbs is part of the legacy of Syrian intervention in northern Lebanon, according to Nadim Shehadi, associate fellow of the Middle East and North Africa program at the London think tank Chatham House. It was the arrest of Islamist activist Chadi Mawlawi that sparked the current fighting. One of his cousins says Mawlawi was supporting the Syrian rebels and trying to help Syrian refugees by providing shelter and food. Though the Lebanese government accuses Mawlawi of being an operative in an al Qaeda-inspired group -- something his relatives deny -- it may have been Mawlawi's help to the refugees that got him in trouble. Helping Syrian refugees puts the Lebanese government in a difficult position as it tries to stay out of the Syrian conflict, Shehadi told CNN. ""The Lebanese government's aim is to maintain neutrality and avoid spillover from Syria to Lebanon, but that's an impossible objective to attain because if you help the refugees, you're supporting the revolution, and if you don't help the revolution, you're supporting the regime. So in both cases, neutrality is impossible to maintain,"" Shehadi said. A team of U.N. monitors is in Syria to see how well both sides are implementing a six-point peace plan brokered by former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Annan said last week that the observers are the last hope for success of the plan, which involves a cease-fire by all parties and the withdrawal of Syrian forces from populated areas. Since the cease-fire went into effect on April 12, the fighting and killing have continued, with the LCC reporting more than 1,000 deaths in the intervening weeks. The United Nations estimates that at least 9,000 people have died in the 14-month crisis, while opposition groups put the death toll at more than 11,000. Despite the ongoing chaos, Syrian state-run media announced that results from recent parliamentary elections will be announced Tuesday. More than 7,000 candidates vied for 250 parliamentary seats. But members of the opposition had urged Syrians to boycott the elections, saying a vote for any of the candidates amounted to a vote for al-Assad, whose family has ruled the country for 42 years. CNN's Saad Abedine, Laura Perez Maestro and Holly Yan contributed to this report.","Opposition: At least 23 regime soldiers were killed Monday in clashes at Rastan .

"Washington (CNN) -- After months of difficult talks, bipartisan House and Senate negotiators reached a tentative deal on a giant transportation funding bill Wednesday, multiple sources tell CNN. A formal announcement is expected late Wednesday night after the last details are hammered out and the final language is drafted, they said. Congressional leaders said they hoped to attach the $109 billion highway bill to a measure extending a rate cut on some student loans and legislation reauthorizing national flood insurance and pass them as one bill out of the House and Senate by Friday. Doing so would let Congress beat looming deadlines when these measures expire and also would allow lawmakers to escape town for their Fourth of July recess. Passage of the bill, which funds construction for highways, bridges and other transportation projects for two years in every state and congressional district in the nation, would be a significant accomplishment for lawmakers, who have spent much of this session mired in partisan gridlock. Senate passes huge farm bill . Aides predicted the final bill would get large bipartisan majorities although some Republicans are likely to oppose it because they think the measure costs too much. Both parties had to compromise on core issues. Republicans dropped language that would have approved the Keystone XL pipeline and prevented the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating harmful coal ash waste from power plants. New Keystone pipeline requires months of review . Democrats were forced to accept GOP demands to streamline and speed up the federal project review process of construction projects. Republicans said doing so would cut permitting times in half. Republicans also won reforms that would allow states to opt out of federal mandates to spend highway dollars on bike paths and highway beautification projects. Doing so, Republicans said, would allow states to spend more on critical infrastructure projects. ""I'm so glad House Republicans met Democrats half way, as Senate Republicans did months ago,"" said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California, the chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, who said the bill will ""protect and create 3 million jobs."" ""At the end of the day, Senate Democrats fought for red tape, while House Republicans fought for jobs -- and got some important wins,"" said a House GOP leadership aide. ""This bill is far from perfect, but it is a substantial improvement over the original Senate bill."" Although the agreement includes many of the reforms the House GOP pushed for, it falls far short of the broader transportation and energy bill that House Speaker John Boehner unveiled earlier this year. Boehner: Holder contempt vote will proceed . Boehner framed that proposal, which combined road and bridge projects with provisions promoting greater domestic energy production -- such as more drilling in public lands and approval of the Keystone XL pipeline -- as a major jobs bill. But internal GOP divisions forced House Republican leaders to pull the measure and it never got a floor vote. The energy portions of the bill did pass the House, but none of those were included in the final bill.","A formal announcement is expected late Wednesday night, multiple sources tell CNN .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- The leader of the socialist PASOK party in Greece is starting efforts to build a government, his party said, making him the third Greek politician since Sunday to try to do so. PASOK leader Evangelos Venizelos held meetings with the leader of the Democratic Left party, Fotis Kouvelis, in what Venizelos called a ""first step"" toward assembling a coalition of pro-European parties. He is scheduled to hold talks with head of the center-right New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, on Friday. Samaras and another potential coalition partner -- Alexis Tsipras of the leftist Syriza party -- have tried and failed to organize a government already. If no one can pull together a coalition, and no national unity government can be formed by May 17, Greece must call new elections. Venizelos, who has three days to cobble together a deal, said Sunday's fragmented results show voters don't trust ""any party on its own."" But he says he wants Greece to stay in the eurozone, the group of 17 European countries that use a common currency. ""It is a given that we want Greece in the euro,"" he said. ""We want something better, not something worse."" Read why Greece will muddle through crisis . Greece has been forced to impose punishing austerity measures to get international loans that have kept it from defaulting on debts. The election results were widely seen as a message to politicians to back away from the harsh economic austerity measures. Voters backed parties on the far left and right, withholding support from PASOK and New Democracy, the more moderate parties that made up the coalition that enacted the cuts. Seven parties won seats in parliament in Sunday's election, but no party captured more than 19% of the vote. As Tsipras began coalition talks Tuesday, he said PASOK and New Democracy ""don't have a majority any more to vote for the plundering of the Greek people."" PASOK placed third in the election, behind New Democracy and Syriza. The latest opinion poll, by Marc-Alpha TV, suggests that if new elections are held, Syriza would come out on top, with nearly 24% of the vote, followed by New Democracy with 17.4% and PASOK with just under 11%. A coalition would still need to be formed. Extreme-right party Golden Dawn would take a smaller share of a second vote than on Sunday, the poll suggests, but would still pass the threshold to have lawmakers in parliament. A European Commission spokeswoman said this week that Greece needs time to work through its political process, but she reminded the country's leaders that they would be expected to abide by the terms of a bailout program meant to avoid a crippling financial meltdown. ""The commission hopes and expects that the future government of Greece will respect the engagements that Greece has entered into,"" spokeswoman Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen told reporters. New Democracy ended up with 108 seats in Greece's 300-seat parliament. Voters also delivered a rebuke to PASOK, leaving it with 41 of the 160 seats it held before Sunday's vote. Together, the parties fell short of the 50% necessary to continue their coalition, requiring formation of a new government. Last year, Greece's debt threatened to force it to drop Europe's common currency, the euro, prompting the European Central Bank and other lenders to swoop in with emergency funding. In exchange, they demanded that the government slash spending. The resulting measures have led to tax increases and cuts in jobs, wages, pensions and benefits -- and significant public outcry. Read why Greece shouldn't be allowed to sink . The national unemployment rate for January, the latest month for which figures are available, was nearly 22%, prompting widespread protests and leading some young people to leave the country in search of work. Youth unemployment is even higher than the national average of one in five out of work. For two years, the country's massive amount of debt has threatened the stability of the eurozone. Greece pushed through a huge debt swap in March to save it from disorderly default and clear the way for it to receive a second bailout from the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, worth â‚¬130 billion ($171.5 billion). The debt restructuring deal gave some breathing space to the eurozone bloc, where fears that Greece might collapse had increased pressure on other debt-laden nations such as Spain and Italy.

"Washington (CNN) -- Federal prosecutors dropped the remaining charges against former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards on Wednesday, less than two weeks after his corruption trial ended in an acquittal and mistrial. The Justice Department had accused Edwards of using nearly $1 million in illegal campaign contributions to keep his pregnant mistress under wraps as he mounted a second presidential bid in 2008. But after more than 50 hours of deliberation, a North Carolina jury acquitted him on one of the six counts against him and deadlocked on the other five. Lanny Breuer, the head of the Justice Department's criminal division, said prosecutors respect the judgment of the jury and would not bring the case to trial again. ""We knew that this case -- like all campaign finance cases -- would be challenging,"" Breuer said in a written statement on the decision. ""But it is our duty to bring hard cases when we believe that the facts and the law support charging a candidate for high office with a crime."" Overheard on CNN.com: 'Being a slimy dirtbag doesn't equal being a criminal' Edwards' lawyers said in a statement, ""We are confident that the outcome of any new trial would have been the same."" ""While John has repeatedly admitted to his sins, he has also consistently asserted, as we demonstrated at the trial, that he did not violate any campaign law nor even imagined that any campaign laws could apply,"" they said. Edwards, 61, won a U.S. Senate seat from North Carolina in 1998. He ran for president in 2004, when he ended up as the Democrats' nominee for vice president, and again in 2008, when he dropped out of the reace after a poor showing in the early primaries. Jurors: Evidence elusive in Edwards case . In August 2008, he admitted to an affair with onetime campaign videographer Rielle Hunter, but denied paternity of the daughter she had given birth to six months earlier. He eventually acknowledged paternity, and after the May 31 mistrial, he talked about ""my precious Quinn, who I love more than any of you can ever imagine."" Prosecutors argued that Edwards took $925,000 from two high-powered donors to pay for Hunter's living and medical expenses, travel and other costs to keep her out of sight while he sought the presidency -- contributions that amounted to illegal, undisclosed campaign donations. Former Edwards aide Andrew Young testified that he allowed Hunter to move in with him and his wife at Edwards' request after newspapers began looking into a possible affair within the Edwards campaign. Edwards' lawyers argued he was guilty of being a bad husband to his wife, Elizabeth, who died of cancer in 2010, but had committed no crime. They also told jurors that Young, the government's star witness, used the contributions for his own gain. Edwards charges: The rundown . ""As we stated in our motions and arguments,"" his lawyers said Wednesday. ""It should be addressed, if at all, by the Federal Election Commission, which our evidence showed seems to have agreed with our views on the law.""

"(CNN) -- The City of Fullerton, California, has reached a $1 million settlement with the mother of a mentally ill homeless man who died last year after a beating he received at the hands of police officers. The settlement comes a week after a California judge ordered that two Fullerton police officers stand trial in the beating death of Kelly Thomas. The city council unanimously approved the award during a closed-door session Tuesday. ""To lose a son at the hands of rogue police officers is an indescribable horror,"" said Brian Gurwitz, the attorney representing Cathy Thomas, Kelly's mother. ""There is nothing this council could ever do to compensate her for the loss she's suffered."" The city and Cathy Thomas said in a joint statement that Thomas agreed to drop any potential legal claims against the city in exchange for the $1 million. ""Resolution of Ms. Thomas' claim at this time allows her to begin the healing process and avoid what would likely be protracted, expensive and difficult litigation,"" the statement says. The city noted in a separate statement that the city did not admit responsibility for Kelly Thomas' death as part of the settlement. The settlement will not affect a separate wrongful death suit filed by Thomas' father. ""I'm not in the money game, whatever money ... I will get ... is going to go to the foundation that I started for Kelly,"" the father, Ron Thomas, told CNN affiliate KCAL-TV. Officer Manuel Ramos is charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter, and Cpl. Jay Patrick Cicinelli is charged with involuntary manslaughter and felony use of excessive force in the July 5 incident. They have pleaded not guilty to the charges. Kelly Thomas was shirtless and wearing a backpack when Ramos first approached him in response to a call about a homeless man looking into car windows and pulling on handles of parked cars. A graphic 16-minute video of the incident begins with Thomas -- a 37-year-old homeless man with schizophrenia -- sitting and being told by Ramos to put his feet out and hands on his knees. When Thomas is slow to cooperate, Ramos then tells him: ""You see my fists? They're getting ready to f--- you up."" Thomas, who is unarmed and shirtless, stands and another officer walks over. They hit him with their batons and hold him on the ground as he begs for help. ""OK, I'm sorry, dude. I'm sorry!"" he screams. At one point, Thomas says he can't breathe. The officers tell him to lie on his stomach, put his hands behind his back and relax. ""OK, here, here, dude, please!"" he says. Other officers arrive. At times, trees block the view of the camera, and it's not always clear who is doing what as officers pile on top of Thomas. One uses a stun gun. Thomas cries out for help and, toward the end of the beating, starts calling for his father: ""Dad! Help me. Help me. Help me, Dad."" His voice gets softer and trails off. By the end of the video, he is lying in a pool of blood as the officers wonder out loud what to do next. One can be heard saying: ""We ran out of options, so I got to the end of my Taser and I ... smashed his face to hell."" Thomas died five days after the incident. The FBI is investigating civil rights violations in the case, as well. Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas has said that Thomas suffered brain injuries, facial fractures, rib fractures and extensive bruising and abrasions. The county coroner listed his manner of death as a homicide and said he died because he was unable to breathe after having his chest compressed. Ramos, 37, a 10-year veteran of the police department, would face a maximum sentence of 15 years to life if convicted, authorities said. Cicinelli, 39, a 12-year Fullerton police veteran, would face a maximum of four years in prison if convicted. Six Fullerton officers, including Ramos and Cicinelli, were put on paid leave after Thomas' death. The case drew widespread attention to the police department of Fullerton, a city about 25 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. CNN's Michael Martinez, Stan Wilson and Irving Last contributed to this report.","A wrongful death suit is pending against the city .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A group of Catholic activists gathered in front of a Manhattan cathedral Tuesday for the latest protest over a Vatican reprimand of America's largest organization of Catholic nuns. About two dozen parishioners and former clergy gathered in front of St. Patrick's Cathedral, protesting last month's controversial report from the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith, the church's doctrinal watchdog. Following a years-long ""doctrinal assessment"" investigation of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious -- which represents 80% of the Catholic nuns in United States -- the report found ""serious doctrinal problems"" and called for major reforms. It accused the LCWR of sponsoring ""certain radical feminist themes incompatible with the Catholic faith in some of the programs and presentations."" ""The sisters are wonderful people who work very hard, and yes, they do care about the poor, and they do care about social concerns, and the congregation of the dogma of the faith has come down on them really hard,"" said Eileen Sammon, one of the protesters gathered outside St. Patrick's. ""It is unfair, unjust, unconscionable, and I'm here to support them."" Sheila Peiffer, with The Nun Justice Project, a Catholic activist organization, organized a petition to rally support for sisters nationwide. ""I would like to see the Vatican rescind the mandate, but i think that would be doubtful judging from past actions,"" she said, ""but we always believe in the power of the Holy Spirit and peace. Peace and reconciliation is everyone's goal."" Last week, crowds gathered in Cincinnati in a similar protest. While praising the group's work on social justice issues, the Holy See blamed it for remaining ""silent on the right to life from conception to natural death, a question that is part of the lively public debate about abortion and euthanasia in the United States."" ""Further, issues of crucial importance to the life of Church and society, such as the Church's Biblical view of family life and human sexuality, are not part of the LCWR agenda in a way that promotes Church teaching,"" the report said. It also noted public statements from nuns that opposed Catholic bishops. The LCWR disagreed with the bishops' conference's position on the Affordable Care Act, which they supported and the bishops did not. The church called the LCWR's position ""grave and a matter of serious concern. "" CNN's Chris Boyette, Eric Marrapodi and Patrick Feeney contributed to this report.","Catholic activists gathered in front of a Manhattan cathedral Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Shortly after President Barack Obama was inaugurated, he said that his re-election effort will be judged largely on the economy. The overall unemployment rate is above 8%; fewer than 150,000 jobs were created the last month; student loan debt has hit $1 trillion; consumer personal credit card debt is on the rise; gas prices look like a yo-yo; the housing industry continues to be stuck in the mud; and Americans still are unsure what the future holds economically. For Mitt Romney's team, that should look like fertile ground to lay a serious line of attack against the incumbent president, especially in hard hit states like Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Nevada. Yet for a band of GOP strategists, they somehow think trying to replay a bunch of old sermons by the president's former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, will result in electoral gold. Sounds more like fool's gold. When I opened up Thursday's New York Times and saw a story at the top of the page about a proposal calling on Chicago billionaire Joe Ricketts to spend upwards of $10 million on a vicious attack on Obama with Wright at the center of it, I frankly laughed. In fact, even President Reagan came to mind and one of the all-time classic debate lines he used on Walter Mondale: ""There you go again."" It's as if the butt-whippin' the GOP got in 2008 wasn't enough. Now they want to try to go to the well a second time. D-U-M-B. When Sen. John McCain declared tying Obama to Wright was off limits in 2008, GOP stalwarts seethed, angry that they couldn't portray the then-senator as an acolyte of someone they considered to be a crazed, deranged pastor who hated America. The revelations of Wright's sermons caused a ruckus in the Democratic primary in 2008, dominating the news cycle for weeks. The only way Obama could quell the raging inferno was to deliver his speech on race in Philadelphia, which was hailed by some commentators as momentous. Ever since then, some in the GOP believe that had McCain bludgeoned Obama with Wright, he could have stood a better shot at winning. To all of you who love and adore the Republican Party, I'll play your political priest and absolve you of all of your sins -- said and unsaid -- on this issue. Making Wright a central campaign theme would have done nothing to keep Obama from beating McCain. And while Republicans like Sarah Palin and countless mouthpieces on the right swear that Obama wasn't properly vetted, just deal with the reality that your party lost in 2008. Trying to dredge up Wright in 2012 simply won't do it. It's silly, childish, and frankly, shows a sign of desperation. And this has nothing to do with riling Obama's African-American base or ticking off independent voters. It just doesn't make sense because what it does is remove the core message of Romney -- the economy -- and makes it about sermons from 20 years ago. Obama's weakness in 2012 isn't a sermon by Wright called ""Confusing God and Government"" -- that's the one he was ripped for saying ""goddamn America"" -- it's the weak economy and him as its chief steward. When things are going well a president gets the credit, and when they're not going so good, he gets the blame. And right now, he's shouldering lots of blame for the economy. Romney's team was quick to disavow the plan, and even Ricketts had to come out and say that it was one of many proposals that he was presented, and rejected. Now, Ricketts didn't become a billionaire by making dumb decisions. But even allowing this plan to cross his desk is about as dumb as J.P Morgan continuing to employ the folks that lost the firm more than $2 billion in a colossal trading screw up. Maybe we can just chalk up the Obama-Wright proposal as an attempt by these GOP strategists to pull a fast one on Ricketts and make a quick buck off of an unsuspecting billionaire. Even that thought has me laughing.","GOP considered airing sermons by the Rev. Jeremiah Wright to attack President Obama .

"Inside Syria (CNN) -- Sa'er is a self-described assassin for the Syrian government. He says he has fired on unarmed protesters, killed as many as 70 people and once slit a man's throat. It was kill or be killed, he says; Sa'er says he was simply carrying out orders. He says he worked at an Interior Ministry prison, and ""we would go out with the officers from the prisons. ... They gave us guns with scopes and you see the body as if you're looking at yourself in the mirror."" Sa'er agreed to be filmed by CNN as his wounds were treated by opposition activists. He said he was on a bus that was ambushed by unknown assailants. He asked that his identify be obscured enough so that the government can't recognize him but said he wanted his friends to know that he is alive -- and a changed man. Out of fear, his captors keep Sa'er blindfolded. Members of the opposition intend to trade him for other men in custody, and they don't want him to be able to identify them down the road. He is a bargaining chip. CNN could not independently confirm the man's story, nor was it possible to know whether he had been coerced into telling it. ""I can't untie your eyes because I am afraid of you,"" Mounir, a member of the opposition, tells Sa'er. ""Why are you doing this? Why are you killing us?"" Mounir demands, his gun nearby. Sa'er tells Mounir about a time two police officers captured a man. A major put a gun to Sa'er's head and ordered him to kill the prisoner, he says. ""He said, 'I am going to count to 10.' He cocked the gun, fired into the air and put it to my head again. I slaughtered him,"" Sa'er says. The government turned him and others like him into monsters who would have killed their own fathers, he claims. They were promised wealth and told they were helping to fight terrorists, he says. For close to a year, the Syrian government has sustained a brutal crackdown on protesters seeking to oust President Bashar al-Assad. The government claims its security forces are battling terrorists. The United Nations estimates that at least 5,400 people have been killed, while an opposition group says more than 7,000 people have died. Each side is fighting for the future of Syria, and with each death, is growing more and more entrenched. Still, perhaps, there is a space for change -- or maybe, just an apparent change of heart for a man being held against his will.

"Washington (CNN) -- A U.S. investigation into the controversial fatal shooting of a 15-year-old Mexican boy by a U.S. Border Patrol agent has been closed without prosecution because of ""insufficient evidence to pursue federal criminal charges,"" the Justice Department announced Friday. The decision was immediately denounced by the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Mexico said it ""deeply regrets and strongly rejects the decision by the Department of Justice."" The Mexican Embassy said it was sending a note of protest to the U.S. government to underscore its concern. The incident on the border in June 2010 had prompted criticism by the parents of Sergio Hernandez-Guereca. The family and supporters filed suit against the U.S. government, but the complaint was thrown out by a U.S. judge in August. The court, however, allowed the family to pursue possible charges against the agent, Jesus Mesa Jr. In its decision announced Friday, the Justice Department and the U.S. attorney for western Texas said their investigation showed that Hernandez and others threw rocks at close range at the agent, who was attempting to detain a suspect in a human-smuggling operation at the border. The Civil Rights Division said there was no evidence that the agent had ""deliberate and specific intent"" to deprive Hernandez of his civil rights. Officials said they had reviewed both ""civilian and surveillance"" video in their investigation but did not comment other than to say the evidence was not sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the agent violated federal homicide laws. At the time of the shooting, the Mexican government said it appeared to be an excessive response to the rock throwing. On Friday, Mexico said efforts against Mesa will continue in U.S. civil courts and in Mexican courts. Hernandez's parents said he was a straight-A student, but U.S. authorities described him as a repeat juvenile offender who had a history of ties to human smuggling.","The decision was denounced by the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- A lawyer breaks down sobbing in court. The president's children sit in the public gallery. The secretary general of the ruling party, the African National Congress, sits behind them. Outside, military veterans and riot police hold back crowds dancing in support of the president. This is no normal high court case hearing. At issue is ""The Spear,"" a piece of artwork depicting the president of South Africa as a Lenin figure with his genitals exposed, accused of offending the dignity of Jacob Zuma. The painting has pitched culture and tradition against constitutional rights. It has polarized a nation: Those who believe it is offensive to depict the President -- and in fact any black person -- in this way against those who believe in the freedom of expression. South Africa is the custodian of one of the most progressive constitutions in the world, held up as a model state when it comes to protecting freedoms and rights. The furor began nearly two weeks ago when an exhibition entitled ""Hail to the Thief"" went up in a small suburban gallery in Johannesburg. It was the artist Brett Murray's interpretation of what has become of South Africa's young democracy. And it was not kind. Through his art he portrayed the ruling party, the ANC, as corrupt, selfish and full of broken promises. But it was the one painting of Zuma that got the nation hot under the collar. For a few days it sat there largely unnoticed, quietly minding its own business, until the ANC woke up and saw the picture in a Sunday newspaper. The party demanded it be taken down. The gallery refused. And so the legal battle ensued. Then, this week, along came the protesters, one white, one black, both working independently of each other, who calmly walked into the gallery and smeared the painting with red and black paint. Both claimed the painting was an insult to the honor of the president. The two were arrested, the painting was taken down and the gallery closed. The image of the painting, however, remains on City Press' website. The defacing of the painting was not going to stop this battle. Foes of painting plan march to gallery . Today was the first day of the hearing in the High Court of Johannesburg. Outside, the ANC had erected a stage and struggle songs burst out into the streets. Throngs of people gathered with posters demanding Zuma's dignity be restored and the painting destroyed. Former ANC armed-wing veterans dressed in full military uniform held the crowds back from the court. Riot police looked on. Reporters filmed their pieces to camera. Inside the court an air of calm reigned despite being full to capacity. Rows of journalists tweeted incessantly, ANC bigwigs greeted each other fondly, and a handful of the President's 21 children looked on. Sitting on the bench were three highly respected judges, one white Afrikaaner male, one Indian female and one black female: A true reflection of this country's diversity and equality. The leading lawyer, Gcina Malindi, began by arguing for the removal of the painting and the image on the basis that no one deserves such indignity whoever they are. The judges retorted that it was an impossible feat to take it out of public circulation. The image is everywhere: On social networks, Twitter and the internet -- it even has its own Wikipedia page. One judge then asked how dignity could be restored by removing the picture from websites. The senior lawyer began his answer. He took the court back to South Africa's fight for freedom and human rights. They were now free and had been vindicated. His last line was, ""The struggle was a just struggle."" It was then that the sobs rang out across the courtroom. The lawyer had broken down crying. As he began to talk of the struggle, he held back the tears, trying desperately to contain himself, but it was no use. The impact of his breakdown was made all the worse by the fact that he was hooked up to the microphones. His sobs were loud and clear for all to hear. With his head in his hands he fell to the desk. The judges looked awkward, adjourned the case and scuttled off into their chambers leaving a stunned courtroom to work out exactly what had just happened. Malindi had been imprisoned and tortured on Robben Island during apartheid. He was a freedom fighter and is now a highly regarded lawyer. He simply could not contain his emotions when talking about the freedom that he and many other black people in South Africa had fought for. He later said his line of argument had brought up many emotions that he had felt 25 years ago. He added that he should have had more self-control, but ""unfortunately I did not'. When the court returned, Malindi calmly walked back into the courtroom and requested a postponement. Both the complainants and respondents agreed as did the judges. It was not to be a cut-and-dried case. Three days have been set aside to hear the case in full at a date yet to be decided. So the nation awaits the final verdict as the court balances the president's dignity against freedom of expression . And in the meantime, the ANC has called for further protests and the boycotting of City Press. The battle rages on.","Painting by Brett Murray, ""The Spear of the Nation"" shows Jacob Zuma's genitals .

"London (CNN) -- It was a rare sight for media watchers on Wednesday: Rupert Murdoch, the indomitable head of the News Corp. empire, called before a judicial inquiry to explain how his influence has shaped Britain's media and political landscape. Still, it's not the first time the 81-year-old chairman of News Corp. has been grilled in the United Kingdom. He also appeared before lawmakers last summer to answer questions on alleged phone hacking at the News of the World. But the focus in the Leveson Inquiry hearing was on Murdoch's dealings with a succession of British prime ministers going back decades and whether these cozy relationships worked to his personal advantage. The awkward questions come as News Corp. also faces investigation in the United States over alleged phone hacking and increased scrutiny in Australia following an inquiry into media standards. On the stand in London, Murdoch insisted that his newspapers did not lobby for his commercial interests and he had ""never asked a prime minister for anything."" ""You would wish to point out that no express favors were offered to you by Mrs. Thatcher; is that right?"" he was asked by Leveson Inquiry lawyer Robert Jay, referring to former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. ""And none asked,"" responded Murdoch. Murdoch denies political influence . The question of influence is key because of the concerns raised over the impartiality of Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt in considering a takeover bid by News Corp. for British satellite broadcaster BSkyB. Hunt's aide resigned Wednesday over communications with News Corp. that suggested the global media giant was getting inside information, although Hunt denied any improper dealings on his own part. 'This is a man who has held power ...' And it's significant in part because of the sheer scale of News Corp.'s operations in the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and elsewhere. With some 48,000 employees worldwide, the company ""had total assets of approximately U.S. $60 billion, total annual revenues of approximately U.S. $34 billion and in excess of 260,000 shareholders"" as of the end of last year, Murdoch said in written testimony. ""This is a man who has held power far greater and far longer than anyone else in our time,"" said Michael Wolff, a media commentator, founder of Newser.com and author of ""The Man Who Owns the News: Inside the Secret World of Rupert Murdoch."" For 60 years, Murdoch has been both a powerful private citizen in the United Kingdom, United States and Australia, and a businessman wielding huge influence, Wolff said. ""He is so powerful that he doesn't have to ask for anything ... it just comes to him,"" he said. News Corp., through its British arm News International, commands some 37% of national newspaper circulation in Britain. It publishes the Times, Sunday Times, Sun and Sun on Sunday newspapers . Given that about 60% of the UK population reads a national newspaper, Murdoch's influence is hard to overstate, said Steven Barnett, professor of communications at the University of Westminster in London. His attitudes on issues including the Europe Union, opposition to a single currency, taxation and immigration have percolated down to the UK population through his titles, as they shape the news agenda, Barnett said. And the Sun readership matters more than most in political terms because it has six to seven million readers, Barnett said, and polling shows many of these are floating voters. Murdoch critic: Publisher's claims are 'pretty ludicrous' Against this backdrop, Murdoch's claims never to have sought to capitalize on that reach for his own benefit are disingenuous at best, Barnett said. ""Time after time, Murdoch insisted on denying that he ever used his newspapers either for commercial advantage or for political advantage, which is quite extraordinary -- and frankly as a claim is pretty ludicrous,"" said Barnett, who attended the hearing in London. ""When you look at the history of the way in which he increased his empire and the legislative and regulatory decisions that have been made in his favor, it just doesn't stand up to scrutiny."" In his role as chief executive of a multinational media giant, it would have been remiss of Murdoch not to seek the ear of power if it would benefit his shareholders, Barnett said, and his claim that he never did is ""frankly beyond belief."" At the same time as Murdoch was testifying, Prime Minister David Cameron told the House of Commons: ""I think we all, on both sides of this house, did a bit too much cozying up to Mr. Murdoch."" Going back to the Thatcher era, Barnett points to the government's decision not to refer Murdoch's acquisition of the Times and Sunday Times to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, despite his ownership of other titles, as a prime example of things working in the press baron's favor. Secret lunch with Margaret Thatcher . The Leveson Inquiry heard how Murdoch had a secret lunch with Thatcher -- revealed in March this year -- before his successful bid for the Times newspapers. Questioned over his relations with other British leaders, Murdoch recounted falling out with former Prime Minister Gordon Brown after he told Brown his papers would not support Labour in the 2010 election. But he insisted strongly that there had been no quid pro quo with Tony Blair as Murdoch's papers switched support from the Conservative Party to Blair's Labour Party in 1997 -- not long before Blair swept into power as prime minister. ""I, in 10 years in his power there, never asked Tony Blair for any favors and never received any,"" Murdoch said. Nonetheless, the relationship with News Corp. has been key to Britain's politicians, Barnett said. ""It was incredibly important for Tony Blair when they decided to support Labour, Blair in 1997, and also when they supported David Cameron and the Conservatives."" While News Corp.'s dominance in the UK media market is indisputable, it accounts for only 8% of the company's overall revenue. Murdoch owns 70% of the newspapers in his native Australia, Wolff said, where his News Ltd. division owns the only national daily paper and daily titles in several big cities. ""He has an overwhelming share of power there. It became such an easy game there that he left, it was a boring game,"" Wolff said. United States -- where the real money is . But the real money is in the United States, where News Corp. controls The Wall Street Journal, New York Post, Fox News and Harper Collins publishers, among other interests. ""He has more power than any other private citizen in the United States,"" said Wolff. News Corp.'s outlets in America are a kind of throwback to the 19th century, when nearly every newspaper had an overt political affiliation, Harvard University sociologist Theda Skocpol said. When the tea party movement began to coalesce in opposition to President Barack Obama in 2009, Murdoch's Fox News in particular helped boost it to national prominence, she said. ""Fox was overtly orchestrating enthusiasm for big events and passing along information along with bloggers and radio hosts,"" said Skocpol, co-author of a 2011 book on the movement. ""They didn't create the tea party -- the people who were upset about Obama and Democrats and not happy with the Republican Party, either, were out there. But you can have people out there who don't necessarily get that much help that quickly."" The network drew fire from the Obama administration in 2009, when then-communications director Anita Dunn called it ""the communications arm of the Republican Party."" Fox shot back that it keeps its conservative-leaning opinion programming separate from its ""fair and balanced"" news coverage. While News Corp.'s American organs have a more consistently conservative conservative cast than in Britain, Skocpol said, ""They're a commercial entity, and they're trying to do things that sell."" ""We're in an era now where flamboyant commentators, particularly on the right, have a great deal of leverage in American politics, and sometimes you wonder whether they're in politics or they're just selling themselves,"" Skocpol said. Their only weakness, she said, is that Fox News viewers tend to be older -- a minus for advertisers. Andrew Neil, a former editor of the Sunday Times under Murdoch, said the media baron -- who became a U.S. citizen in 1985 -- had been heavily coached by his New York lawyers on how not to jeopardize those vital American interests through intemperate outbursts in London. ""He mustn't do anything in the United States, where his real money is and where he is under investigation by the FBI, Department of Justice and SEC,"" Neil said. As a result, little new came out of the Leveson Inquiry hearing, Neil said, only a kind of ""false modesty"" as Murdoch sought to downplay his influence. 'I don't think they laid a glove on him' For Wolff, the only surprise from the Leveson Inquiry was that ""at 81 years old, (Murdoch) can still be as indominable as ever"" under questioning. ""I don't think they laid a glove on him. At the end of the day, they looked like schoolchildren, and he looked like the master."" That said, the fact Murdoch was before the Leveson Inquiry at all reveals a significant lessening of his power in Britain, Wolff said. ""His UK enterprise is imploding. It is over for Rupert Murdoch in the United Kingdom. I think he knows that he can salvage nothing, but he would like his son not to go to jail."" The son in question, James Murdoch, a senior News Corp. executive who was chairman of News International at the time of the alleged phone hacking but has since resigned from that role, testified before the inquiry Tuesday. He denies knowing about the extent of wrongdoing at the News of the World. As for his father, he will be back on the stand Thursday. No doubt every media watcher will be glued to Rupert Murdoch's words once again, waiting to see if the man synonymous with ruthless journalism and tough business practice lets his guard drop and tells all.

"(CNN) -- The Chicago City Council approved a measure on Wednesday that allows police to issue citations for those carrying small amounts of marijuana rather than make arrests. It's the latest follow through by U.S. officials to decrease penalties associated with the drug. The ordinance, which was modified from a 2011 plan, would afford city police officers the discretion to issue a citation for those carrying up to 15 grams of marijuana. Offenders would face a fine that ranges from $250 to $500. ""The result is an ordinance that allows us to observe the law, while reducing the processing time for minor possession of marijuana -- ultimately freeing up police officers for the street,"" Mayor Rahm Emanuel said in a statement. The measure will take effect on August 4, though it wouldn't apply on school grounds, in parks or among offenders 16 and younger, according to mayoral spokeswoman Jennifer Martinez. Police officers are expected to undergo training on the new policy in the next two weeks. Earlier this month, Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee signed a similar measure into law, allowing law enforcement to issue civil fines for the small amounts of possession, rather than arrests. Also in June, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo asked legislators to reduce penalties for possession of small amounts of the drug that are in public view. Saying the aim was to avoid unnecessary misdemeanor charges against thousands of New Yorkers -- ""disproportionately black and Hispanic youth"" -- the proposed legislation ""brings consistency and fairness"" to New York's marijuana laws, the governor's office said. In 1977, New York's legislature reduced the penalty for possessing 25 grams or less of marijuana to a noncriminal violation carrying a fine of no more than $100 for first-time offenders -- as long as the marijuana was in private possession and not in public view. If the marijuana is out and viewable in public, it becomes a Class B misdemeanor. NY pot plan: Right step or bad message?

"(CNN) -- Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher is a veteran of nearly 300 Formula One races, but he still felt a rush of excitement on Tuesday as Mercedes unveiled their car for the 2012 season. The motorsport legend was joined by fellow German Nico Rosberg and team principal Ross Brawn as Mercedes showed off the new F1 W03 at a preseason test event in Barcelona, Spain. The 43-year-old, who has won more drivers' titles than anyone else in history, is enjoying a second spell in the sport after initially retiring in 2006 -- only to return again in 2010. Despite being unable to replicate the form he showed prior to his first retirement, Schumacher said he is still hungry for success as he prepares for a 19th season in the elite division of motorsport. ""I have done quite a few roll-outs and launches of new cars, but even after all these years I must say it still feels special,"" Schumacher, who won two championships with Benetton in 1994 and 1995 and five with Ferrari between 2000 and 2004, told the sport's official website. ""Days like this are precious moments, as they are always filled with hope and anticipation."" Schumacher, who has started 287 grands prix since making his debut in 1991, has failed to finish on the podium since returning to the grid and only registered one top-four finish last year, at June's rain-affected Canadian Grand Prix. Despite disappointing results, he vowed to fight for the hardworking staff at the team's British factories. ""I can say already that the guys and girls back in the factories at Brackley and Brixworth were brilliant in putting in so much effort, and we can only say a big thank you them,"" he said. ""I know which reward they would like, and we will definitely try to deliver it. For my part, I am eager to fight again, looking forward to the new season, and I can't wait for it to begin."" Rosberg was the first driver to get behind the wheel of the F1 W03 at Silverstone last week. The former Williams pilot was looking forward to learning more about the new car ahead of the season getting under way in Australia next month. ""We have had a good start to our 2012 testing program, and it was a great feeling to drive the first laps in the new F1 W03,"" the 26-year-old said. ""The car looks good, and is very nicely packaged under the bodywork. ""All the parts are in harmony, which reflects how well the different departments of our team are working together. From the beginning of our running, we have been able to focus on understanding the car and making good progress with our test program.

"(CNN) -- Many said he only left Barcelona for the money. After all, he reportedly earns more than $300,000 a week in England. Why else would you leave the world's most successful club? Yaya Toure, however, insists that he came to Manchester City in 2010 for one reason -- to make history. He could be proved right on Sunday, when City's expensively-assembled squad have the chance to win a first English league title in 44 years. Such a success is but a small part of the dream held by the Premier League club's Abu Dhabi owners, and Toure -- who last season ended City's 35-year wait for a trophy by scoring the only goal of the FA Cup final -- is a key figure in their master plan. ""When City wanted to sign me from Barcelona, they were thinking about bringing a good player to try to add to the club and make history in four years,"" the Ivory Coast international told CNN. ""I think this is very interesting for me and for the club because I think they've made the right choice. We gained a couple of fantastic players, this year we're doing fantastically well. We have one more game, a very difficult game against QPR, although we hope we will win this game because it is very important."" ""Important"" perhaps does not do justice to Sunday's home match against a Queens Park Rangers team battling to avoid relegation. City top the table from defending champions and fierce local rivals Manchester United by goal difference alone. If both teams have the same result this weekend then it will be the closest finish to an English season since Arsenal pipped Liverpool to the title in 1989 on number of goals scored. But perhaps even more crucially, it will tip the balance of power away from United -- a club seeking a record-extending 20th league crown. ""If you want to make history you have to win,"" Toure said. ""Last year we did it when we won the FA Cup, and this year with the signings we have I think we have to win something for this club. ""The fans were amazing this year, incredible, and they helped us a lot in difficult moments and good moments, so I think we've done everything for them. If we can win this title I think it will be for the fans and for the club."" City thrashed United 6-1 at Old Trafford in October as Roberto Mancini's men led the table by five points, but Alex Ferguson's side bounced back to move eight points clear at the top with six games to go. City struggled in the wake of Carlos Tevez's fallout with Mancini, a controversy that saw the club's former captain and top scorer go missing for three months. Just as crucially, Toure was away for six weeks at the African Nations Cup, depriving City's midfield of its driving force. Add to that the on and off-field indiscretions of Mario Balotelli, and it appeared that City's stars were shooting themselves in the foot. ""Sometimes it's difficult because when you have an important, quality player like that and they make something wrong, sometimes it's difficult because football is a game for all the group,"" Toure said. ""It's 11 players, 45 players who live together, you see each other more than you see your family, and you have to be careful because when one of your teammates is wrong it can affect almost all the other players. ""But I think this year we dealt with everything. Carlos is a fantastic player who we always hoped would come back because he is a really important player for us. Yeah he made a mistake but he's apologized to everyone and he's showed to the fans he's there to fight for his friends for the title."" Mancini has been criticized for his management methods since coming to England from Italian champions Inter Milan in mid-2009, but Toure credits him for inspiring belief that the title race was not over. ""When I was coming to City, it was Mancini taking me there. He believes in me ... when I was playing with Monaco he sent someone to look at me because last time he wanted to bring me to Inter because he was there,"" Toure said. ""I think the key was when Mancini started making a speech in the dressing room and said, 'Guys we don't have to give up because the Premier League is like that and maybe they can drop some points and we can come back. We have to believe to the end because we're in the most competitive competition in the world and most importantly we have to keep going, keep winning and maybe we'll be close to them.' ""I think Mancini was totally right because we never gave up and we continued to fight to the final, and now we have the same points, it's unbelievable."" Next season City will play in the Champions League for the second successive time. Their introduction this season will always be remembered for Tevez's clash with Mancini in Munich, which precipitated a group-stage exit from Europe's premier club tournament. Toure has already held that trophy aloft, in 2009 when Barcelona completed a treble of trophies also including the Spanish league and cup crowns. ""The Champions League is one of the biggest competitions in the world, it's very tough and all the best teams in the world play in this competition,"" Toure said. ""Yes I've already won it but I've said I came to City to make history and most importantly I have to keep working hard and make me believe I can be part of history at this amazing club. ""It's going to be tough but I think we're on a good way to being a big team."" Bayern Munich won City's group and went on to reach the May 19 final, which will be held at the German team's home stadium. England will be represented by Chelsea, who overcame considerable odds to beat defending champions Barca in the semis. ""It's going to be tough because Bayern is a fantastic team. Two years ago they lost (the final) against Inter Milan, but I think Chelsea are doing extremely well, they are fighting together,"" Toure said. ""It's going to be tough for them because Bayern Munich have not stopped winning. But I hope an English team can win and the guys can say the Premier League is one of the toughest competitions in the world.""","Manchester City seeking to win first English title in 44 years this weekend .

"(CNN) -- Animal print is as classic to fashion as the little black dress. But this spring, the orange-and-black look of leopard is heading to the back of the closet in exchange for cuddly kitten faces. Animals are shaping what we wear, from high-fashion runways to big retail stores to resale shops -- and it has nothing to do with fur, or even zebra print. No, fashion is trying to re-chic the old sweater of a wolf howling at the bright yellow moon or a T-shirt of an iguana going for a snack. The animal illustrations growing popular now are a departure from the sophisticated animal prints that designers used a few years ago. Pets, specifically cats, are the most popular animals within the trend, fashion watchers said. ""Pets are a language of international happiness,"" Susan Cernek, Glamour magazine's fashion development director said. ""You can hop on YouTube and see a cute puppy video and have comments come from all over the world. There is a universal appeal."" Cernek said animal motifs cycled into trendiness about 2006. The use of animal prints like leopard and zebra took off during the recession, when designers were trying to find a luxe substitute for pricier bejeweled clothing. ""It is the kind of print that scales well,"" Cernek said. ""You can have a great print in a $30 shoe or in a $3,000 dress."" Leah Chernikoff, the editor of Fashionista, an online fashion blog, said the graphics' transition from tacky to stylish can be attributed to designers like Riccardo Tisci and his Givenchy men's line, which prominently features Rottweiler prints. Rapper Kayne West donned a Givenchy Rottweiler shirt during a celebrity- and media-studded event. It exposed the public to the rising trend, Chernikoff said. She also points to celebrities like Liv Tyler and lines like Burberry that brought animals like the owl to the center of fashion. Chernikoff said city street fashion culture helped to pioneer animal fashion before it showed up in magazines. ""We were seeing people wearing these cheesy animal sweaters in an ironic way,"" Chernikoff said. ""There is something cool about the cheekiness. Hipsters are reclaiming things... you would buy [animal prints] at souvenir shops, but there was this hipster appropriation in fall 2011."" It's the nature of the fashion industry, Glamour's Cernek said -- it's cyclical and reactive, always looking to rethink what's out there to create a different effect. ""More fashion-forward designers try to do the opposite, and do something that is more fun, like the cheeky animal prints,"" Cernek said. The tongue-in-cheek animal graphics are showing up on runways, and among the work of artists like Kelly Eident. Eident owns an Etsy store, I'm Your Present, where she sells clothes created with vintage fabrics and repurposed clothes she finds at thrift stores. One of her best-selling items is a form-fitted dress adorned sheer sleeves and a large graphic illustration of animals like wolves or cats. She describes her clothes as fun -- with a sense of humor. ""I think animals are always in style,"" she said. ""Everyone loves them."" Everyone -- including designers like Victoria Beckham, who came out with a line that features cat prints on dresses and blouses, and Roberto Cavalli, whose line Just Cavalli features strands of earth-tone feathers and desert sand snake print. ""Fashion went through a phase of being very serious and had a heavy vision,"" Cernek said. ""But the best designers epitomize this sense of whimsy and they take leopard print, luxurious and serious, and do something more fun with it."""" That universal appeal has driven the trend from the street to the store. Target spokesman Joshua Carter said this season's animal fashions are well-received by customers. The store sells a Jason Wu for Target T-shirt featuring a black cat, men's shirts with large prints of huskies, pugs and beagles, plus items like snake-print skirts, faded leopard skinny jeans and cheetah-print flats. ""We have seen animal print as a growing trend and continue to incorporate it into our apparel and accessories as either a full print or an embellishment on a solid style,"" Carter wrote in an e-mail. Target's success with the trend demonstrates that it is making impressions on mainstream fashion and consumerism. Whimsy is a really important aspect to Berene Campbell when it comes to design and fashion. The Vancouver resident grew up in South Africa, where animals were incorporated in everything from fashion to dÃ©cor. Campbell is now a graphic designer who crafts unconventional fabric patterns for handbags inspired by animals. She created a handbag in the shape of an owl, merging ""geek"" appeal with a colorful palette. ""I like things that are fun and whimsical and entertaining,"" she said. ""Something that you look at and you go 'Aww,' something that makes a person turn up the creases on the side of their mouth."" Eva Kischel crafts her clothing by outfitting T-shirt sleeves with minimalist cat face designs. Kischel, who runs the Etsy shop The Petite Chouette, said she gravitates toward the animal trend not because of ironic appeal or Vogue magazine, but because of its eco-friendly appeal. ""I think wearing animal-themed clothes also demonstrates that you are against fur or other animal skin in fashion, which is a good thing,"" she said. ""I personally like this trend because it simply makes me happy to 'wear' my favorite animals without hurting them."" Whatever the reasons, animals cute and fierce have clawed through many layers of fashion because it makes people happy, fashionistas said. ""It is joy and whimsy,"" Cernek said. ""Why not have something like that is your clothes?""","Graphic animal prints are a fashion trend this spring .

"(CNN) -- The image of Jerry Sandusky, once emblazoned across a renowned bookstore mural near the Penn State campus, has been replaced -- a move that the artist says he'd been waiting to make until the end of a child sexual abuse trial that's still fresh in the minds of many. ""I just couldn't have it up there,"" said Michael Pilato, who replaced Sandusky's picture with that of Dora McQuaid, a Penn State graduate, poet and advocate for sexual abuse victims. ""It's Happy Valley, but there's definitely a cloud over this town these days,"" Pilato said Tuesday, having painted two red handprints beside McQuaid's image on Sunday. A blue ribbon was added to the rendering a day later, two months ahead of the fall school semester and just as the drumbeat for Nittany Lions football begins. The university announced Friday that it had already sold out the student section of Beaver Stadium, with students purchasing more than 21,000 season football tickets. Attorney: Sandusky to appeal child sex abuse convictions . The team's home opener against Ohio is scheduled for September 1, leaving the program with the likely distraction of a Sandusky sentence just as the first post-Paterno season gets under way. Following Friday's verdict, Judge John Cleland ordered the former defensive coordinator to a county jail to await sentencing for about 90 days. Sandusky was convicted on 45 counts related to child sex abuse. He continues to maintain his innocence. But as Penn State grapples with the trial's aftermath, it still faces the related prosecution of two former university officials: Vice President Gary Schultz and Athletic Director Tim Curley. ""Until the Schultz and Curley part gets taken care of, it won't be over,"" said Michael Rowe, a 27-year-old Penn State alumnus. ""It's a huge scar."" Court proceedings involving the two ex-administrators are expected to begin in mid-July, according to Nils Frederiksen, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania attorney general's office. Last year, the scandal led to the November firing of iconic head coach Joe Paterno and university President Graham Spanier and brought charges against Schultz and Curley for perjury and failing to report the abuse. Paterno -- who died on January 22 after a storied career that brought Penn State football to national prominence -- reported to his superiors a child sex abuse incident in a university shower that involved Sandusky, but did not inform police. Photos: Paterno through the years . ""We determined that his decision to do his minimum legal duty and not to do more to follow up constituted a failure of leadership by Coach Paterno,"" the board of trustees said in a report that explained his firing. That decision prompted rioting by Penn State students, overturning a news van and clashing with police, who used tear gas to break up throngs of angry protesters. Months later, the loss of Paterno -- often referred to as ""JoPa"" -- still resonated with students when asked Tuesday about the lingering effects of the scandal. ""JoPa was kind of an idol for everyone,"" said Seth Cornwall, 19, a Penn State sophomore. ""Without him there, people are going to feel differently"" about the program. ""I think the community is just trying to move on now,"" he added. Pilato, the muralist, recalled a conversation he had with Paterno shortly before his death. Pilato said the former head coach told him that ""if he knew what he knew now, he would have done things differently."" ""I think the one positive out of all this is that if anything like this ever happens again, people will go directly to the police,"" Pilato said. The Pennsylvania muralist added that he'd received dozens of e-mails from survivors of sexual abuse, asking him to paint over Sandusky's picture on his mural. The image of the former assistant coach had been erased from the rendering in November, but was only replaced with McQuaid's picture on Sunday. Those e-mails ""really made me think about the young people looking at the mural, and the young men"" who had accused him of abuse, he said. Following Sandusky's November indictment, Penn State says it has since required all university employees to complete training on recognizing and reporting suspected child abuse, and has revised its policy on the oversight of minors on campus. Sex abusers prey on kids' trust, thrive on shame and fear, experts say . ""The University now requires two or more authorized adults must be present during activities where minors are present,"" said school spokesman David La Torre in a written statement. The board of trustees also commissioned an independent investigation led by former FBI Director Louis Freeh to investigate ""what failures occurred and what changes we must make to ensure this doesn't happen again,"" the statement said. Freeh's group has since interviewed more than 400 university employees. Meanwhile, Matt Sandusky -- one of Jerry Sandusky's six adopted children -- said through his attorney that he was also sexually abused by his adoptive father, and that he had been prepared to testify against him. The announcement could ultimately bring additional charges against the former coach. Addressing reporters Friday night, Jerry Sandusky's attorney said the defense had learned from prosecutors that the younger Sandusky -- who sat with his family on the first day of the trial -- could have testified as a rebuttal witness if his adoptive father had taken the stand. Attorney Joe Amendola said his client, who denied sexually abusing Matt, ""still wanted to testify,"" but reluctantly agreed not to for fear that his son's testimony ""would destroy any chance of an acquittal.""

"(CNN) -- A judge on Saturday postponed the tax evasion court hearing of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who is serving a seven-year prison sentence following last year's conviction of abuse of authority. Judge Konstantin Sadovsky postponed the hearing until May 21, ruling that Tymoshenko could not be tried in absentia, the Ukrainian State News Agency reported. Tymoshenko did not attend the hearing because of ""massive back pain,"" according to the news agency. The judge's ruling follows reports that Tymoshenko was roughed up in prison. The two-time prime minister said Tuesday she was beaten unconscious in prison last week, but the prosecutor said his office investigated her claim and found no proof to substantiate her allegations. But EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Tymoshenko's claim had been confirmed by the Ukrainian Ombudsperson's Office. Tymoshenko was ""subjected to physical violence during the transfer from her cell to a hospital on 20 April,"" read a statement released Thursday by Ashton's office . Ashton called on Ukraine ""to examine promptly and impartially any complaints of torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment,"" according to the statement. Tymoshenko went on a hunger strike after the beating to draw attention to ""violence and lack of rights"" in her country. Ashton's statement said she is ""seriously concerned"" about Tymoshenko's hunger strike. She asked Ukraine to allow the EU ambassador and independent medical specialists to visit the former prime minister in prison. Tymoshenko said she was discussing with officials a transfer to a hospital for health reasons before the beating. In a statement, Tymoshenko said that after her cell mate left the cell, ""three sturdy men"" entered, threw a bed sheet over her, dragged her off the bed and applied ""brutal force."" ""In pain and despair, I started to defend myself as I could and got a strong blow in my stomach through the bed sheet,"" she said in a statement. Tymoshenko was dragged ""into the street,"" she said. ""I thought these were the last minutes of my life. In unbearable pain and fear I started to cry and call out for help, but no help came."" She fell unconscious, and when she came to, she was in a hospital ward, she said. Last October, a Ukrainian court found Tymoshenko guilty of abuse of authority for signing overpriced gas contracts with Russia and sentenced her to the seven-year prison term. The prosecutor said the gas deals inflicted damages to the country amounting to more than 1.5 billion hryvnas (almost $190 million at the current exchange rate). The court ruled she must repay the money. Amnesty International has slammed the verdict as ""politically motivated"" and called for the release of Tymoshenko, who was prime minister from January to September 2005 and December 2007 to March 2010.

"(CNN) -- A coalition of top musicians, including R.E.M. and Pearl Jam, want to know if their music was used by the U.S. military as part of controversial interrogation methods at the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Ruhal Ahmed, left, shown at a 2007 news conference, says he had to listen to hours of music at Guantanamo. The artists have endorsed a series of Freedom of Information Act requests, which were filed Thursday morning, asking the U.S. government to declassify documents that would reveal which artists' work was used on detainees at U.S. prison facilities and military detention centers, including the one at Guantanamo Bay. The National Security Archive, a Washington-based independent research institute that advocates ""for the right to know,"" filed the requests on behalf of the Close Gitmo Now campaign, which launched this week, the archive's senior analyst Kate Doyle said. The multimillion-dollar national grassroots Close Gitmo Now campaign is aimed at pressuring members of Congress to support President Obama's endeavor to close the Guantanamo Bay prison. It is supported by a coalition of retired generals and liberal activists. The requests are based on the testimony of former Guantanamo prisoners and guards, as well as declassified documents, that identified music from 35 artists -- ranging from AC/DC tunes to the theme from Sesame Street -- used in the interrogations of detainees, Doyle said. See a list of bands and songs involved (PDF) ""We do know that songs and bands' work has been used to abuse detainees, we know that,"" she said. She added that any information that the National Security Archive obtains ""will add to the profile of this case."" The requests are being filed with ""a dozen different agencies and components of the Department of Defense,"" Doyle said. They ask for any documents ""concerning the use of loud music during detention and/or as a technique to interrogate detainees at U.S.-operated prison facilities used in its War on Terror at Guantanamo, Iraq and Afghanistan during 2002-the present,"" according to a copy of the FOIA request obtained by CNN. It is unclear if any of the artists plan to pursue legal action, but Doyle said she'd be ""surprised if some of them weren't thinking about it."" Many of the artists supporting the campaign are no strangers to political activism, but this cause has hit close to home for some of them. ""We have spent the past 30 years supporting causes related to peace and justice. To now learn that some of our friends' music may have been used as part of the torture tactics without their consent or knowledge is horrific,"" the American rock band R.E.M. said in a statement posted on CloseGitmoNow.org. ""It's anti-American, period."" Several former Guantanamo detainees have filed lawsuits against the U.S. government, saying they were tortured with numerous techniques, including loud music. ""It's very scary to think that you might go crazy because of the music, because of the loud noise,"" said Ruhal Ahmed, one of the former detainees who has filed a lawsuit. He said he had to listen to hours of headbanging music while held prisoner at Guantanamo in 2003. The Pentagon has not responded directly to the allegations of torture involving music, but it has said that its policy has always been to treat detainees humanely. Loud music has not been used at Guantanamo since the fall of 2003, following a Department of Defense review of detention operations and interrogation techniques, according to Maj. Diana Haynie, a Joint Task Force Guantanamo spokeswoman. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has asked a federal prosecutor to examine whether the interrogations violated the law, and the White House said Obama will leave any decision on charges to the Justice Department. And the Obama administration announced it would put the FBI in charge of a special unit set up to question suspected terrorists under White House oversight.

"(CNN) -- A federal appeals court on Monday affirmed a previous injunction of Arizona's controversial immigration law, another setback for legislation that has drawn sharp opposition from President Barack Obama's administration. In its ruling, a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit sided with the U.S. Justice Department and against Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who signed the measure known as SB 1070 into law last year. Among other things, this legislation would have required local law enforcement in Arizona to apprehend and help deport illegal immigrants. The Obama administration sued, arguing that only the federal government has that authority. That lawsuit led to U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton's decision last July, which temporarily blocked the law's most contested parts just a day before they were scheduled to go into effect. That included the requirement that local police officers should check a person's immigration status while enforcing other laws. Monday's decision came more than five months after both sides presented their cases in San Francisco to the federal appeals court judges. The ruling was written by federal Judge Richard Anthony Paez and supported in full by Judge John Noonan. Judge Carlos Bea partially concurred and partially dissented from the ruling opinion. ""We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion,"" the ruling states. ""Therefore, we affirm the district court's preliminary injunction order enjoining these certain provisions of SB 1070."" Arizona's governor and attorney general will now consider ""their legal options,"" according to a statement, including possibly an immediate petition to the U.S. Supreme Court. Brewer claimed Monday in this statement that the latest decision ""does harm to the safety and well-being of Arizonans who suffer the negative effects of illegal immigration."" ""For decades, the federal government has neglected its constitutional duty to American citizens by failing to secure the border,"" she said. ""States like Arizona have borne the brunt of that failure."" Those on the other side of the issue, including key figures in Arizona's immigrant community, applauded the ruling. 'What this decision says is that Governor Brewer is wrong,"" Lydia Guzman of Somos America, an activist group focused on promoting social justice and equal rights for immigrant communities in Arizona, told reporters Monday. ""This decision shows a victory on the side of justice and it shows that civil rights prevails."" The ruling is the biproduct of a lawsuit filed by the Justice Department that challenged six of the Arizona law's provisions, meaning other parts of the law went into effect in July. That includes a ban on ""sanctuary cities"": municipalities with laws or policies that render them relatively safe for undocumented immigrants. Bolton's ruling also allowed a provision making it illegal to hire day laborers if doing so impedes traffic. In addition, the ruling allowed parts of the law dealing with sanctions for employers who hire illegal immigrants. Republican lawmakers, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio and other state governments were among those filing briefs with the appeals court supporting Arizona's argument. The Mexican government, the Anti-Defamation League, the American Immigration Lawyers Association and the city of Tucson, Arizona, were among those filing briefs supporting the Justice Department's side. In its lawsuit, the Justice Department challenged only six of the Arizona law's provisions, meaning others went into effect in July. That includes a ban on ""sanctuary cities"": municipalities with laws or policies that render them relatively safe for undocumented immigrants. Bolton's ruling also allowed a provision making it illegal to hire day laborers if doing so impedes traffic. In addition, the ruling allowed parts of the law dealing with sanctions for employers who hire illegal immigrants. The decision Monday sides with the U.S. Justice Department, largely on the argument that federal immigration policy would be greatly undermined -- as might America's standing in the world -- if individual states adopted their own separate immigration laws. Doing so, the ruling contends, equates to a given state adopting its own foreign policy, one that may be in opposition to national policy. ""That 50 individual states or one individual state should have a foreign policy is absurdity too gross to be entertained. In matters affecting the intercourse of the federal nation with other nations, the federal nation must speak with one voice,"" the ruling says. Brewer, along with Attorney General Tom Horne, on Monday said the appeals court relied too much on testimony from ""foreign governments,"" calling it wrong to give such nations ""the de facto right to veto the duly-enacted laws of a sovereign state of the United States."" In his partial dissent -- which represents his opinion, but does not equate to law -- Bea contended that local and state officers do have a role in addressing federal immigration laws. ""Congress intended that state officers be free to inquire of the federal officers into the immigration status of any person, without any direction or supervision of such federal officers -- and the federal officers 'shall respond' to any such inquiry,"" he writes. In February, Brewer announced that Arizona had filed a countersuit against the federal government, seeking the authority to implement its own border security efforts. At that time, Homeland Security Department spokesman Matt Chandler called Arizona's court claim a ""meritless"" one that ""does nothing to secure the border.""","NEW: An immigrant activist says, ""This decisions says ...

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Wednesday warned that he could call for early elections, following a string of political crises since the U.S. withdrawal in the war-torn Middle Eastern nation. ""When the other side refuses to sit at the table of dialogue and insists on the policy of provoking successive crises in a way that causes severe damages to the supreme interests of Iraqi people, the prime minister found himself obliged to call for early elections,"" the statement said. The next parliamentary elections are not scheduled until 2014, but al-Maliki's critics are threatening a no-confidence vote against the Shiite prime minister. It is not clear if there is enough support for the vote to be held. Following the December U.S. troop withdrawal, the country has been confronted with an increasingly fractious legislature, which includes Iraq's Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish political blocs. The Iraqi Constitution allows for a prime minister to formally ask the president to dissolve parliament, which -- if approved -- would set in motion a process that could prompt early elections within 60 days. Al-Maliki in recent months has struggled to forge a lasting power-sharing deal, and has yet to fill key Cabinet positions, including the ministers of defense, interior, and national security, while his backers have also shown signs of wobbling support. On Sunday, the powerful Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr -- whose political bloc last year won 39 parliamentary seats and has backed the prime minister -- called for more political reforms, saying he would support a no-confidence vote should al-Maliki fail to usher in effective change. On Wednesday, Iraq's deputy parliament speaker, Arif Tayfur, met with Joshua Harris, acting political counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, to discuss the crisis, according to the parliament website. The meeting is considered a sign of the seriousness of the burgeoning problems within the already fragile coalition. ""We will not comment on specific diplomatic exchanges,"" said U.S. Embassy spokesman Michael McClellan when asked about reports of a meeting. ""However, we continue to encourage senior Iraqi politicians to work toward a solution that represents the interests of all Iraqis."" McClellan said U.S. officials ""urge Iraqi leaders to move quickly to alleviate current tensions in order to refocus energy on critical state-building challenges."" Last year, the Sunni-majority Iraqiya bloc temporarily suspended its participation in parliament over claims that it was apparently being cut out of the political process. Soon after, an arrest warrant was issued for Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, the leader of the Iraqiya bloc, accusing him of running a death squad. His party has since ended its boycott, though al-Hashimi remains a fugitive in Turkey and is still wanted by Iraq's central government. Al-Hashimi has denied the charges, calling them politically motivated. Meanwhile, relations between the Kurdistan regional government and the central government have also deteriorated. Masoud al-Barzani, president of the Kurdistan region, in March blasted the government, calling the power-sharing deal between the various political groups ""completely nonexistent"" and saying it has ""become meaningless."" ""The Iraqi Constitution is constantly violated and the Erbil agreement, which was the basis upon which the current government was formed, has been completely ignored,"" al-Barzani said in a statement on the eve of Kurdish New Year. ""As soon as they came to power, they disregarded the Constitution, the previous agreements that we had, and the principle of power-sharing."" The unfolding crisis also comes amid a string of deadly attacks across the country, including a pair of bomb blasts that rocked the capital and killed at least eight people on Wednesday. A series of attacks in June has left nearly 180 people dead, including one bombing that led to the country's deadliest day since the U.S. withdrawal. On June 13, a bomb targeted pilgrims headed to Baghdad, killing at least 93 people. An additional 312 people were injured in the attacks, mostly aimed at Shiite pilgrims who had trekked to a shrine in the Iraqi capital.","NEW: Al-Maliki's critics are threatening to hold a no-confidence vote against him .

"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- A judge fined six Zimbabwean human rights activists $500 each on Wednesday for watching footage of the Arab Spring protests and threatened to send them to prison for 10 months if they fail to pay up by Monday. The defendants were among dozens arrested in February 2011 during an academic meeting in which a video was shown about last year's revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt. Prosecutors argued that they were plotting a similar uprising in the southern African nation, and the six were convicted of conspiring to commit public violence. The fine is more than than a year's pay for the average worker in impoverished Zimbabwe, where unemployment runs at 85%. The defendants were also ordered to perform 420 hours of community service and warned that they would face a two-year prison term if found guilty of a similar offense within five years. ""The court has chosen a compassion approach against these accused who had strayed from the correct path,"" Magistrate Kudakwashe Jarabini told the defendants in a packed hearing. The activists, who could have been sentenced to up to 10 years in prison, remained motionless, gazing into the roof of the courtroom as the magistrate read the sentence for about 30 minutes. A few people who gathered outside the court demonstrating against the ruling were arrested. Prosecutors argued that the activists wanted to incite Zimbabweans to demand the resignation of 88-year-old President Robert Mugabe, who has ruled the southern African nation for 32 years. Critics have said the charges, which initially included treason, were politically motivated. ""Obviously, we are aggrieved by the sentence as well as the conviction,"" defense attorney Alec Muchadehama said. ""We are going to appeal against both the conviction and sentence. In our view, this is too harsh."" The defendants were among 46 activists arrested while attending a lecture about the popular uprising that forced Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak to resign after almost 30 years in power. Most were released. But among those charged was Munyaradzi Gwisai, a university lecturer and former lawmaker from Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai's party, who called his conviction a ""shame"" for Zimbabwe's courts. ""The dictatorship is shaking. It is not yet fallen,"" Gwisai said. ""This is a temporary reprieve. We are going back into the trenches. We are in the trenches. Their real aim was to put us in as an example ahead of their clear objective of stealing yet another election."" Mugabe's ZANU-PF party is in a troubled unity government with Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change, which has called the arrests ""an abuse of state machinery by ZANU-PF to suppress the people's views."" Mugabe has called for new elections, but Tsvangirai has threatened to boycott the poll if a referendum on a new constitution is not held. Tsvangirai called the convictions ""very, very unfortunate. One thing I would say is, it's totally uncalled for."" But asked whether an Arab Spring-type movement is needed in Zimbabwe, he said, ""Now we are on another path of negotiation and setting up a transitional government and having elections; there's no need for it.""","The activists were jailed for watching a video about the Egypt and Tunisia revolts .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A woman filed a battery complaint against Lindsay Lohan on Saturday, accusing the actress of shoving her at a West Hollywood nightclub two nights earlier, according to a Los Angeles County sheriff's official. Lohan publicist Steve Honig told CNN that the actress did not go to the Standard Hotel's club, where the incident allegedly happened, that night. He also questioned why the woman waited until Saturday to file a complaint at the sheriff department's West Hollywood Station. ""You have to wonder about someone who calls the media before the police,"" Honig said. Sgt. Chris Bowman said a detective has the report and will check the story's validity. ""It's just an allegation,"" Bowman said. If the allegation had been made last month, before Lohan was released from the strict rules of supervised probation, it might have had more serious implications for her. Any arrest then could become a probation violation leading to jail time. A judge gave Lohan, 25, a fresh start on getting her life together two weeks ago by ending her supervised probation. She will remain on probation for a misdemeanor shoplifting conviction, but without the strict reporting requirements of the two felony drunken driving convictions. It culminated five years of legal troubles for Lohan, which included 250 days in rehab, 35 days in home confinement, 67 days on community service, 19 days in court and six trips to jail. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner warned Lohan that avoiding future trouble could be a challenge. ""I know it's hard when people are following you all over the place, but that's the life you chose,"" Sautner told Lohan, advising her to ""live your life in a more mature way, stop the nightclubbing and focus on your work."" Lohan is preparing to portray Elizabeth Taylor in a Lifetime movie, which starts filming next month. She also has a role in an upcoming episode of the hit Fox TV show ""Glee."" Her recent hosting job on NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" earned high ratings, and her spread in Playboy's January issue set sales records for the magazine.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court's decision upholding a piece of Arizona's controversial immigration law portends such a ""huge"" increase in policing for one department that the chief wondered Tuesday if his agency will be able to handle the workload. At a time when the Tucson Police Department is down 160 officers because of a weakened economy, the agency now must make up to 50,000 additional phone calls a year to federal officials to verify the immigration status of persons whom officers have stopped and have reason to believe are in the country illegally, Police Chief Roberto Villaseñor said Tuesday. Other law agencies in Arizona, however, reported ""business as usual"" a day after the Supreme Court ruling. Just 70 miles from the Mexican border, the Tucson department may have to spend more than $10 million a year to book and jail up to 36,000 arrestees also suspected of being illegal immigrants -- a more than 7% increase to the agency's $130 million budget, Villaseñor said. The police chief said he wonders if his 950-officer agency has been dealt an ""impossible mandate."" The state law, SB 1070, allows citizens to sue his department or others if they fail to enforce federal immigration laws, the chief said. Romney, GOP struggle with immigration issue . ""Just for my agency, it will be a huge workload, just making the calls and waiting for a response on what to do,"" the police chief of Arizona's second-largest city said. ""I'm not sure the federal government is capable of handling all the requests that they will be receiving,"" Villaseñor added. ""I don't know what effect it will have on my agency."" Tuesday marked the first 24 hours that state and local law agencies began enforcing the state immigration law since Monday's court ruling, and law agencies were either engaged in training or rolling out the mandatory immigration checks, said Amy Rezzonico, a spokeswoman for Arizona attorney general's office. ""I'm pretty sure it will be business as usual to some degree,"" Rezzonico said. Analysis: Five things learned from high court ruling . That was the case for the more than 3,100 police officers in Phoenix, the state's largest city, located 180 miles from the border. A police department spokesman said Tuesday he had no immediate feedback from officers or U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on the progress or results of the day's immigration checks. ""We're really not attempting a big shift from what we're doing now,"" said spokesman Sgt. Tommy Thompson. ""I think there's a misconception that police officers in Arizona are going to go out and hunt down people who are illegally in the United States. ""I am mandated to make a reasonable attempt to contact ICE,"" Thompson said. ""It's 107 in Phoenix today. How long am I going to stand on the side of the road with someone (awaiting an ICE response)? It's a matter of minutes -- 20 minutes maybe, 30 minutes maybe."" Groups say immigration fight is changing Arizona . Concerns by lawmen such as Villaseñor unfolded as President Barack Obama and Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer squared off about the impact of Monday's U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld the ""show-me-your-papers"" provision -- but struck down other portions of the state law intended to deter illegal immigration. Already, the Obama administration has indicated it won't allow Arizona's immigration priorities to become federal priorities. The administration has ended the so-called 287(g) agreements with Arizona, under which state and local law agencies entered into a partnership with the Department of Homeland Security and were delegated authority for immigration enforcement within their jurisdictions. Also, the administration recently halted deportations of DREAM Act-eligible immigrants -- young adult undocumented immigrants -- as it will redirect resources to deporting those who are deemed a greater threat, such as criminals. The White House highlighted its tougher approach on criminals in announcing a record number of deportations last year. In denouncing some of those Obama measures, Arizona's Brewer said further lawsuits lay ahead on the immigration status checks, and pledged, ""This certainly is not the end of our journey."" The portion of the state law validated by the high court is potent, one expert said. ""If you read the statute carefully, it literally creates an obligation for all law enforcement agencies to determine status of individuals,"" said Marc Miller, a vice dean and law professor at the University of Arizona. ""By making it a mandate and lining it up against the warnings of the Supreme Court, it's created an impossibly difficult question for police and sheriffs. Are we concerned about racial profiling? Absolutely."" But how police will apply the law -- requiring immigration checks while enforcing other laws if ""reasonable suspicion"" of illegal immigration exists -- is ""confusing,"" CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. ""What does it look like in the real world to have reasonable suspicion that someone is here illegally? What is a police officer supposed to do?"" Toobin asked. ""How to apply that in the real world is kind of mysterious to me."" At least two sheriffs in Arizona said that the law won't result in great change for their departments. A changing national mood on immigration? Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik said his deputies will continue to call the Border Patrol to determine a person's immigration status if a deputy suspects that person is in the country illegally. That will result in about 100 referrals a month to the Border Patrol, he said. ""We're continuing to do business as usual,"" said Dupnik, who's been sheriff for 32 years. Dupnik said he opposed SB 1070 because if the entire law had been upheld by the federal courts, it would have resulted in overcrowded jails and overburdened state courts. ""The more important thing is how the chief of a law enforcement agency chooses to enforce the law,"" Dupnik said. For example, other counties do immigration sweeps, but not his, he said. ""Law enforcement did not ask for this law,"" Dupnik said. ""Law enforcement did not need this law."" Santa Cruz County Sheriff Tony Estrada said the validated portion of the law marked ""very little change"" for his department. His county shares a 50-mile border with Mexico and is a major corridor for smuggling of drugs and illegal migrants. His 39 officers will continue to call any of the 1,000 U.S. Border Patrol agents in his county to conduct immigration checks, he said. ""Our concern is the public perception of what we are doing,"" he said. He fears Latinos won't ask for help and witnesses won't come forward, he said. ""The Hispanics will look at us a little differently, and that concerns me,"" Estrada said. Merchants and residents of the Latino community reported anxiety and fear among clientele and neighbors. Phoenix taqueria owner Hector Manrique said Tuesday that business has been dropping since the law was proposed in 2010; he predicted it will get worse now that the Supreme Court has ruled. ""It's bad for the Hispanic community,"" said Manrique, a native of Mexico who has been in Phoenix since 1990 and has run the Taqueria Guadalajara since 2003. ""It seemed like everybody kind of forgot about it for a little bit and now, all of a sudden, I've got friends who were talking to me yesterday, and they're pretty scared because they've got kids, they've got family to support."" Kelly Ramirez, 31, of Tucson, a real estate broker and business owner, said many Latino immigrants don't know the details of the law, but they do know something has changed. ""They can't really look into it, so what they'll do is they'll hide,"" she said. ""There's going to be less conversation, less help from individuals that maybe aren't doing anything wrong but know of somebody that is."" Russell Pearce, the former Republican state senator who authored SB 1070 and then was ousted from office in a recall election in his suburban Phoenix district last year, told CNN Tuesday that accusations of possible racial profiling were ""demeaning to law enforcement."" ""An officer is trained to pay attention to things that don't fit. All this bill does is allow them to ask the questions they need to ask,"" Pearce said.

"(CNN) -- There are guy movies and girl movies, the latter of which the guys label ""chick flicks"" and often only ever see under protest. In ""Sleepless in Seattle"" the late Nora Ephron had fun with the idea that for a typical guy, the definition of a tearjerker would be ""The Dirty Dozen"" (because that's about as emotional as we fellas want to get). Is ""Magic Mike"" a chick flick? If it is, it may the first of a new breed. It's a crisp, unsentimental story, with none of those lingering sunset shots you find in Nicholas Sparks' adaptations (well, OK, almost none), and a heroine who spends most of the movie tutting her disapproval on the sidelines. But for sure, women are going to be this film's primary audience. Why? Because Magic Mike (Channing Tatum) is a stripper, and so is his mentor, club owner Dallas (Matthew McConaughey), and his 19-year-old protÃ©gÃ©, Adam (Alex Pettyfer). Just a hunch, but I reckon a lot of guys are going to hold out for ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" next week. Director Steven Soderbergh's last movie was the female action film ""Haywire,"" which didn't click with audiences of either sex. But he may be on to something this time. It's a good year to be Channing Tatum . From the opening shots of a buff, naughty McConaughey teasing the audience in tight leather trousers (""What can't you touch?""), it's clear that Soderbergh has the measure of what his audience wants. He's going to give it to them, too, but not too much, too soon because the tease is as important as the strip. A college dropout who draws the line at taking any job that requires him to wear a tie, Adam is living with his big sister Brooke (Cody Horn) when his new buddy Mike ushers him into the delights of the Xquisite Male Dance Revue. In time-honored backstage musical tradition, ""the kid"" gets thrown on stage when one of the stars can't go on. Next thing he knows, Adam is shopping for a stars and stripes thong for the Fourth of July special. Scripted by Reid Carolin and inspired by Channing Tatum's own experiences as a Tampa stripper in the 1990s, ""Magic Mike"" is honest about the attractions of the job (money, girls, fun) without pretending it's a smart choice in the long run (too much fun, too many girls, not enough money). I liked the brightly lit, casual camaraderie of the dressing room scenes, while on stage the routines here are sexy, playful and (I'm guessing) much better choreographed than you're likely to see downtown on a Saturday night. Brawny and bruised, Tatum doesn't look like it but he is a heck of a dancer. If the movie was in 3-D you'd probably be stuffing bills into his briefs, bills like the ones we see Mike flattening under a heavy book in one of the film's numerous truthful touches. Less interesting is Mike's haphazard courtship of Brooke. Is it a coincidence that Cody Horn is the daughter of Warner Bros. President Alan Horn? I have no idea, but she's a bland performer and the weak link here (Olivia Munn blows her away as a slumming psychology student who is Mike's substitute girl).","Channing Tatum plays a stripper and Matthew McConaughey a club owner in ""Magic Mike""

"(CNN) -- A failed terrorist attack in a central Stockholm district full of Christmas shoppers could have been catastrophic, Swedish authorities said late Saturday. Police are investigating whether two explosions in Stockholm, an e-mail threat sent shortly before the attack that mentions Afghanistan and the body of a man who was apparently killed in one of the explosions are related. ""Most worrying attempt at terrorist attack in crowded part of central Stockholm. Failed -- but could have been truly catastrophic,"" Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said in a Twitter message on Saturday. A Swedish news agency and police said they received e-mail threats against the Swedish people 10 minutes before the explosions, which killed one person and injured two others on Saturday. ""We have not taken any decision to increase the terror threat level,"" said Swedish Security Police spokesman Mikael Gunnarsson. ""And apart from the e-mail we didn't have any other indications or threats that this would happen,"" Gunnarsson added. The writer of the e-mail mentions the presence of Swedish troops in Afghanistan and a Swedish cartoonist who depicted the Prophet Mohammed, according to TT, a Swedish news wire. The e-mails contained sound files featuring a person speaking in Swedish and Arabic, TT reported. The sender referred to Swedish silence regarding the Afghanistan troops and the controversial cartoon by Lars Vilks that depicted Mohammed as having the body of a dog. ""Now your children, daughters and sisters will die like our brothers and sisters and children are dying,"" the e-mail states, according to TT. ""Our actions will speak for themselves,"" the person said in an audio recording attached to the email. ""As long as you don't end your war against Islam and the humiliation against the prophet and with your stupid support to Lars Vilks the pig."" Swedish terrorism expert Magnus Ranstorp told CNN that he did not believe the attacker acted alone. ""This was not something where he just woke up and thought that he would blow himself up,"" said Ranstorp, a professor at the Swedish military academy and a former professor in terrorism studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. Police said the explosions were in a popular pedestrian shopping area. ""One explosion happened at the intersection of Drottninggatan and Olof Palmes Gata,"" two busy streets in central Stockholm, said police spokeswoman Petra Sjolander. ""This was the car that exploded multiple times."" A second explosion occurred about five minutes later, at the intersection of Drottninggatan and Bryggargatan streets, Sjolander said. An unidentified man was found dead at the scene of the second blast. ""We don't know at this point what caused the second explosion,"" Sjolander said, describing it as suspicious. A bag was found near the body, she said. ""We had bomb technicians on site, but I can't give you any details of what they did,"" Sjolander told CNN. A bomb robot rolled up to the body and removed the bag for examination, according to the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter. In the first incident, multiple blasts went off in a car, according to Sjolander. ""It is likely that this was some kind of gas tubes that have caused the car to explode multiple times,"" she said. Two people at the site of the car explosion were taken to the hospital with minor injuries, she said. Video on Sweden's TV4 showed flames spewing from the car, which was parked behind several others. The e-mail writer ended the message with a call for action ""to all Mujahadeen in Europe and Sweden,"" TT said. ""Now is the time to strike, don't wait any longer,"" the message read, according to TT. ""Step up with whatever you have, even if it is a knife, and I know you have more than a knife. Fear no one, fear not prison, fear not death."" TT said that it was not clear from the e-mail or the audio files if the person belongs to any specific organization. The person claimed to have been to the Middle East and asked family for forgiveness for lying to them. ""I didn't go to the middle east to work,"" the writer wrote. ""I went there for jihad.""","NEW: Dead man has not been formally identified .

"(CNN) -- He's brash, bold and has the skills to back it up. 19-year-old phenom Bryce Harper is less than a month into his baseball career with the Washington Nationals, and he's already making his presence felt in the nation's capital. With high-profile magazine covers and international baseball experience already on his resume, the Nationals are looking to Harper to be one of their building blocks as they try to put Washington baseball on the map. Even though he's only batting .227, he's hit two home runs and has displayed a rocket for an arm. ""He seems to have been born to be this baseball player,"" said Thom Loverro, a columnist for the Washington Examiner and a radio show host on ESPN 980 in Washington. ""He takes the game so seriously when he's on the field."" Harper's attention to detail and approach to the game even has baseball icons taking notice. ""Bryce obviously has the skills to play in the big leagues,"" said baseball Hall of Famer Cal Ripken Jr., ""But I am amazed with his poise and his patience at the plate. And I love his aggressiveness on the base paths. He is going to be a good all-around player."" Former Washington Senators slugger Frank Howard says he's seen enough already. ""You might suppress that young talent for a week, a month, maybe two months,"" he said. ""He can beat you five ways. Bat contact, bat power, glove, arm strength and running speed."" Harper, a Las Vegas native, has always shown talent beyond his years. When he was 12 he was playing in out-of-state tournaments and once went 12-for-12 with 11 homers. When kids his age were playing high school baseball he was playing in tournaments around the world. Now, while most of the top players his age are playing college ball or working their way through the minors, he is already in the major leagues. Playing in the majors hasn't curtailed the 6-foot-3-inch, 210-pound Harper's confidence. Barely a week into his big league career, Harper was hit in the back by Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Cole Hamels in a nationally televised game. Harper said nothing and jogged to first base. He ended up stealing home. ""I liked the way he handled the whole situation,"" said Ripken ""He downplayed getting hit but you could see in his eyes that he was determined to pay back the Phillies where it matters most... by doing something in the game. In this case it was stealing home."" SI: Bryce Harper photo gallery . Bold plays like that and winning baseball haven't been a big part of Washington baseball history. The Nationals have never finished with a winning record since moving from Montreal (they were formerly the Expos) in 2005. Poor play and embarrassing moments were the norm. In one game then-first baseman Adam Dunn and third baseman Ryan Zimmerman trotted out on the field wearing a Nationals jersey that had been misspelled and read ""Natinals."" The Nationals are actually the third incarnation of baseball in Washington. The original Washington Senators were there from 1901-1960, before leaving for Minnesota and becoming the Twins. Baseball gave the city another Senators franchise in 1961 and that team left for Texas in 1971 to become the Rangers. Washington hasn't seen a World Series since 1933. This generation of Washington baseball fans are looking ahead and like their team. ""Who hasn't suffered from growing pains?"" asked Brendan Hurley, a native of the Washington area and a season ticket holder. ""The best way to ensure they don't become a punch line again is to win,"" he said. So far they are winning. They open an interleague series tonight against the Baltimore Orioles, who play less than an hour up Interstate 95 from Washington. They are just a half-game out of first place in the National League East, and, to give the series more life than Washington-area baseball fans are used to, the Orioles are also surprisingly in first place after years as American League East doormats. Harper has been preparing for this stage all his life. He not only has honed his skills on the field but off the field as well. ""He respects the history of the game,"" said Loverro. ""When he's on the field he plays the game and knows the game like he's a 10-year veteran... and that's pretty amazing for a 19-year-old kid."" Harper idolizes old-school baseball players, and he's been compared to all-time great Willie Mays, who also debuted at 19. When Harper joined a softball game being played by the Washington Monument, it evoked memories of a young Mays playing stickball on the streets of New York in the 1950's. Casual softball games, YouTube clips and magazine covers will only go so far in the major leagues though. ""The American people love winners,"" Howard said, ""If you win you're gonna draw. If you don't win, you're gonna struggle putting fannies in the seats.""","Bryce Harper is less than a month into his baseball career with the Washington Nationals .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan said Wednesday that it had conducted a test launch of a medium-range ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, just days after its arch-rival India tested a longer-range missile. The Pakistani military said in a statement that the launch of the improved version of the Shaheen-1 missile was successful and that its impact point was at sea. The new version of the missile ""will further consolidate and strengthen Pakistan's deterrence abilities,"" the statement said, citing Lt. Gen. Khalid Ahmed Kidwai, head of the military's Strategic Plans Division. India said last week that it had successfully carried out the maiden test flight of its longest-range nuclear-capable missile, which can apparently travel more than 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles). The Pakistani military's statement did not give details on the range of the missile that it fired Wednesday. The Shaheen-1 missile that it tested in 2010 was able to hit a target about 650 kilometers (403 miles) away. There have been positive signs in the relationship between Islamabad and New Delhi recently. President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan met with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India during a private trip to India earlier this month. It was the first visit to India by a Pakistani head of state in seven years, and Singh said at the time that he would be willing to make a reciprocal trip to Pakistan in the future. But distrust remains deep between the two nations. The South Asian neighbors have fought three wars, two of them over the Himalayan territory of Kashmir, since the 1947 partition of the subcontinent into Islamic Pakistan and Hindu-majority, secular India after independence from Britain. Last year, both countries pledged not to let their fragile peace process unravel again over the range of thorny issues that put them at odds. In 2004, they agreed to negotiations that cover eight issues, including Kashmir, terrorism and Pakistan's concerns over river dams on the Indian side of the border, which it sees as a threat to its water supplies. After that, successive governments held talks in an effort to end the historical acrimony. But engagements were suspended in November 2008 after the terrorist assault on Mumbai, which left more than 160 people dead. India said Pakistani-based groups were behind that attack. Over the past two years, India and Pakistan have held a series of high-level meetings in their bid to put their peace dialogue back on track, a process considered crucial to regional stability ahead of the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. In 2011, New Delhi and Islamabad agreed to resume talks. The two nations' possession of nuclear weapons adds a worrying dimension to the tensions between them. The International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War on Wednesday laid out a hypothetical scenario of what a nuclear conflict between two countries like India and Pakistan would mean for the world. ""A limited regional nuclear weapons exchange"" between two such countries ""would cause major worldwide climate disruption, driving down food production in China, the U.S. and other nations,"" the physicians group said in a statement previewing a new report on the subject. That scenario would leave more than one billion people around the world facing starvation, according to the group, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985 . CNN's Shaan Khan and Aliza Kassim contributed to this report.","India carried out a test flight of a long-range nuclear-capable missile last week .

"Washington (CNN) -- When a scuffle broke out at a candidate forum in Nevada last week between supporters of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Republican rival Sharron Angle, the fight didn't end after tempers cooled. It simply moved over to the social media website Twitter, where the war of words in this nasty race continued. One of Angle's campaign managers, Jordan Gehrke, posted a tweet, a short message on Twitter, that accused Reid supporters of starting the fight. ""Check out the video here of Reidbots screaming and heckling,"" the tweet said. The message included a link to a video that appears to show audience members at the forum shouting down Angle. That same tweet also included a hashtag -- #dumpreid -- made by attaching the # symbol to the message ""dumpreid."" Twitter users who clicked on the #dumpreid link were taken to a feed of anti-Reid tweets. Welcome to the new media world of hashtag politics, where the character attack is compressed into 140 characters -- the website's limit for tweets -- and instantly blasted out to a campaign's long list of ""followers."" ""It was inevitable that negative politics would transform itself into social media. That's exactly what's happened,"" said Larry Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. ""You don't even need a complete sentence to change a campaign -- just a phrase can change a campaign,"" Sabato added. Why pay for an attack ad when you can post a free attack tweet? One recent Reid attack tweet -- ""Sharron Angle's mocks health coverage for 'autism'"" -- includes a link to a video that shows the Republican Senate candidate attacking mandates in the new health care law. Is it the tweet or the video that went viral? Answer: both. Another Angle tweet, ""Harry Reid's plan to save the Nevada economy: coked-up stimulus monkeys,"" was both acidic and inventive. Not only did it mock the real use of stimulus money to study the effects of illicit drugs on primates. The buzzworthy phrase ""coked-up stimulus monkeys"" was picked up by political writers across the country. Campaign staffers are throwing mud via Twitter too. A tweet from an Angle campaign staffer refers to Reid's handlers as ""13 y/o girls."" And on it goes. Michael Patrick Leahy, a Tea Party activist and co-creator of the hashtag #TCOT (or Top Conservatives on Twitter) said, ""I think we're about to enter a new era of American political history."" Leahy's ""Tweeps"" (Twitter slang for his followers) who click on #TCOT are transported to a virtual Tea Party, a nonstop feed where visitors tweet back and forth on the latest news in the conservative movement. Leary's website, tcotreport.com, ranks the top conservatives by number of followers on Twitter. One of those ""top conservatives,"" former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, has more than 250,000 followers on Twitter. Her tweets go out not only to her legions of fans, but also to the nation's top political journalists, who are following Palin's every tweet. ""She can just put out a tweet and generate headlines in the traditional media,"" Sabato said. Those journalists, many of whom are also prolific Twitter users, often ""retweet"" or redistribute Palin's tweets to their own lists of followers. ""The retweeting is how it really gets out there,"" Sabato added, noting that last weekend marked the 50th anniversary of the first debate in the epic 1960 presidential race between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon. #timeshavechanged .","Scuffle at Reid-Angle forum moved from the campaign event to Twitter .

"(CNN) -- The National Football League announced Monday it will not overturn the penalty it previously imposed against the New Orleans Saints and members of its coaching staff for the team's bounty program. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell did not alter the lengths of the suspensions he had levied last month. But he left open the possibility that fine amounts could be reduced and a draft pick could be restored if the team and its coaching staff ""embrace the opportunity"" to help develop and implement player safety programs. The unprecedented punishment was handed down in March after an NFL investigation found the team had an ""active bounty program"" during the 2009, 2010 and 2011 seasons. During this time, players were purportedly offered ""bounty"" payments if they managed to hurt opposing players and knock them out of a game. The NFL found evidence that bounties were put on quarterbacks Brett Favre of the Minnesota Vikings, Cam Newton of the Carolina Panthers, Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers and Kurt Warner of the Arizona Cardinals. The stiffest penalty that the NFL handed down -- an indefinite ban -- was given to Gregg Williams, the Saints defensive coordinator who, in this past offseason, moved over to take that same position with the St. Louis Rams. Head coach Sean Payton suspension for the entire 2012-2013 season will begin April 16, the league said Monday. General manager Mickey Loomis was suspended without pay for that season's first eight regular-season games, and assistant head coach Joe Vitt was suspended without pay for the first six regular-season games. Their suspensions will begin at the end of the preseason, according to Monday's NFL statement. ""At the conclusion of their suspensions, the commissioner will review the status of each of the three individuals to determine their eligibility for reinstatement,"" the league said, referring to Payton, Loomis and Vitt. The team was also fined $500,000 and ordered to forfeit its second-round draft picks in 2012 and 2013, the NFL has said. The league added Monday that it may consider ""modifying the forfeiture"" of the 2013 draft pick, assuming other conditions are met. Goodell has said he's also considering imposing penalties against players involved in the bounty program, but he hasn't given a timetable and has insisted he'll first consult with the NFL Players Association before doing so. In its ruling, the NFL singled out Payton -- who led the Saints to its first ever Super Bowl victory in February 2010, after a season in which the bounty program was in place -- by saying that violations for the bounty program ""were compounded by the failure of Coach Payton to supervise the players and coaches."" The league said that Payton didn't look further into the ""pay-for-performance/bounty program"" despite the NFL's inquiries about it in 2010 and 2012, ""falsely (denied) that the program existed"" and encouraged ""the false denials by instructing assistants to 'make sure our ducks are in a row.'"" In public remarks, Payton has not admitted he lied to the NFL and insisted that no one was injured as a result of the bounty program. But he did say in late March, shortly after his suspension was announced, that he was ""disappointed"" in himself and regretted not being more involved in the team's defense. ""As the head coach, anything that happens within the framework of your team and your program you're responsible for. And that's a lesson I've learned,"" he said.","NEW: After the suspensions' end, the commissioner will ""review"" the cases .

"(CNN) -- European champions Spain were drawn with 2004 semifinalists the Czech Republic as they begin the defense of their title this year in qualifiers for the 2012 tournament in Poland and Ukraine. Vicente del Bosque's team were placed in one of three five-nation groups on Sunday, being the last out of the hat, with the other six pools featuring six teams. The nine group winners qualify automatically along with the best runner-up and the two hosts, with the other eight second-placed sides facing playoffs in November 2011. Spain and the Czechs, the 1996 runners-up, are in Group I along with Scotland, Lithuania and minnows Liechtenstein, with the first qualifiers to be held in September this year. In the other five-nation pools, England are the top seed in Group G and will have to get past 2008 co-hosts Switzerland, the unpredictable but talented Bulgaria, Wales and Montenegro. Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal, quarterfinalists in 2008 and losing finalists at home in 2004, were drawn in Group H with 1992 champions Denmark, Norway, Cyprus and Iceland. World champions Italy also face a testing time in six-nation Group C after being drawn with Serbia and Slovenia, who have both qualified for this year's World Cup finals and will be seeking to continue that progress. Three-time champions Germany were drawn in Group A with Turkey, who they beat in the 2008 semifinals before losing to Spain. Neighbors and that year's co-hosts Austria are also in the same group along with Belgium, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan.

"(CNN) -- Jeff Parness, a native New Yorker, was inspired by the help his hometown received from other cities in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Today, he honors that support through his organization, New York Says Thank You, which sends volunteers to a different community each year to help them rebuild from its own disaster. What started as a small group of volunteers from New York has grown into a nationwide movement of ""paying it forward."" Since 2004, more than 7,000 people have participated in the group's projects. Parness recently spoke with CNN's Brittany Stahl about the rebuilding project his group is planning for the 10th anniversary of 9/11. Brittany Stahl: What are your plans for the next project? Jeff Parness: We're hoping to rebuild a barn in a small town in Georgia that was destroyed a few weeks ago in a tornado. There's a very special woman that lives in the barn. Her name is Susan Littlejohn, and she cares for 65 rescue animals in the barn. She and two of her volunteers were feeding all 65 of the animals, and a tornado literally dropped down on the barn and the barn exploded. Luckily, Susan and the volunteers were fine and all the animals were fine. But she lost everything. So this year, we're going to bring about 300 volunteers from around the country and do a barn-raising in Ellijay, Georgia. Stahl: What is special about this project? Parness: Susan's group is called Build An Ark Foundation, and she's dedicated her life and sacrificed so much for caring for animals and using them as a way to inspire other people and inspire volunteerism. She uses the animals to inspire disabled kids and seniors. Troubled youth volunteer at her stables to care for the animals. There are so many elements to what she does with her Build An Ark Foundation that we realized it's more than just building a barn, it's really helping her to make a greater impact on the world and in her community. You can't help but be attracted to her sense of faith and her sense of humanity. Stahl: How is rebuilding the barn symbolic for the community? Parness: Our greatest hope for Susan, aside from rebuilding the barn, is strengthening her ability to sustain Build An Ark Foundation and to continue to care for the animals. I think using the 9/11 anniversary as a backdrop, and using all these survivors from New York and around the country, we're going to bring so many people together that I think are going to come to know and come to love Susan. Our greatest hope is the relationships we create for her will sustain her long after we've gone and finished putting the barn back up. Stahl: What can people do if they want to contribute to your upcoming project in July? Parness: In terms of helping, I think we're going to be pretty blessed with a lot of volunteers. We always need sponsorship. So if somebody wanted to sponsor one of our New York City firefighters or other first responders to go help rebuild the barn as something positive to do on the 9/11 anniversary, they can go to our website and contribute and we'd be honored to have their support.

"Buenos Aires (CNN) -- Police defused a bomb at a Buenos Aires theater Tuesday, a day before a former Colombian president was scheduled to speak there. Authorities offered different assessments of the danger the explosive posed, and when it was set to go off. A judge who investigated the Gran Rex theater said the bomb was set to be detonated around 4:30 p.m. Wednesday afternoon, when former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe is scheduled to speak. ""It was a simple apparatus, but one that could have caused the death of people closest to it,"" Judge Norberto Oyarbide told reporters. Later Tuesday, federal police said the bomb was designed more to cause commotion than serious damage, and had been set to go off on Tuesday afternoon, according to the state-run Telam news agency. ""It was designed to produce shocking sounds,"" police spokesman Commissioner Nestor Rodriguez said. A theater employee alerted authorities after finding the device, Oyarbide said. ""Undoubtedly it looked like a bomb. You could see two pieces, and a cell phone, and it was connected in the middle,"" said Hector Fernandez, a theater employee. Authorities were investigating to determine who placed it in the theater. Colombia's defense minister condemned the apparent attack attempt and called for an investigation. Last week, a former top official from Uribe's administration survived an assassination attempt -- a daylight bombing in Colombia's capital. Uribe was Colombia's president from 2002-2010, and was known for his focus on improving security and his tough stance on leftist guerrillas. Uribe is scheduled to speak on at an international entrepreneurs conference Wednesday at the Gran Rex, one of the largest theaters in Buenos Aires. A description of the event on the WOM Leadership Symposium's website said Uribe would be discussing his role in ""the transformation of Colombia."" ""In 2002, he found a country beset by guerrillas and overcome by uncertainty and despair. Eight years later, he handed over a country that was safe, thriving and respected by the international community as one of the most attractive countries for foreign investment,"" the website says. A statement on the website said the conference would continue as scheduled Wednesday. Human rights groups are planning a demonstration Wednesday afternoon near the theater to protest the former Colombian president's participation in the symposium. An announcement of the protest describes Uribe as a ""true threat to the region,"" arguing that ""in the name of the fight against 'terrorism' he committed the most atrocious crimes against the Colombian people."" CNN's Jose Manuel Rodriguez and journalist Fernando Ramos contributed to this report.","NEW: Police say the bomb was designed to cause commotion .

"(CNN) -- Ten hostages held by a leftist rebel group in Colombia for more than a decade were freed on Monday in a move that might help push peace talks forward, but was also met with some skepticism in a country home to Latin American's oldest insurgency. The leftist guerrilla group known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC, had pledged to hand over what it says were the last of its government hostages, four soldiers and six police officers. It kept its word. The former captives arrived in the central city of Villavicencio, where they stepped off a helicopter and walked across the tarmac into the arms of their loved ones, video from CNN affiliate Caracol TV showed. One of the former captives jumped joyfully, hoisting the Colombian flag. Others walked with the assistance of what looked to be nurses or doctors. The hostages were flown later to Bogota, the country's capital, Caracol reported. ""Welcome to freedom!"" President Juan Manuel Santos said in a speech late Monday, addressing the former hostages. He welcomed their release as a step in the right direction, but said it was not sufficient. He demanded the FARC release of all its hostages. Hundreds of civilians remain prisoners of the guerrilla group throughout Colombia, according to the nonprofit Free Country Foundation. The FARC announced plans to release the 10 hostages in February and said it would stop kidnapping civilians for money. The rebels did not address the fate of its civilian captives then, nor did it renounce kidnapping for political purposes. ""It's not enough to stop kidnapping. They must free the civilian captives -- the hostages that remain under their control,"" said Santos. Kidnapping government forces and civilians has been a key strategy of the rebel group in its war against the Colombian government. Dramatic rescues, escapes and hostage hand-overs have revealed harsh conditions in jungle camps, including stories of prisoners chained to trees, grueling marches between hideouts, torrential rain and blistering sun. Among the highest profile rescues in recent years was that of Ingrid Betancourt, who was kidnapped in 2002 during her campaign for the presidency. She was freed in a helicopter rescue mission in 2008. Colombian commandos posed as humanitarian aid workers to liberate the group, which included three U.S. military contractors and 11 Colombian police and military members. Monday's rescue began when two Brazilian helicopters arrived in Villavicencio for the scheduled hand-over. Hours later, delayed by heavy morning rains, one of the choppers took off toward an unspecified location provided by the rebels. The team of intermediaries onboard included Red Cross officials and a former Colombian senator who wiped away tears and waved as the helicopter left. ""We are extremely pleased with the success of the operation, which in a single day allowed for the reunion of 10 families,"" said Jordi Raich, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross delegation. He promised continued support. ""After so many years of separation, there is still a lot to do to help them overcome the trauma of this period of time that they have not been together, without news, to help them reintegrate into society,"" Raich said. The leftist rebels have been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s. While severely weakened in recent years, the group has continued to carry out kidnappings and attack security forces. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Marilia Brocchetto, Luisa Calad and journalists Fernando Ramos and Toby Muse contributed to this report.","NEW: The former captives arrive in Bogota .

"(CNN) -- A Chinese court on Friday sentenced Lai Changxing, a tycoon who spent more than a decade as a fugitive in Canada, to life in prison for smuggling and bribery, the state-run news agency Xinhua reported. Lai, 53, was sentenced by a court in the southeastern port city of Xiamen in Fujian Province, where the Chinese authorities say he ran a multi-billion dollar smuggling operation in the late 1990s. Born into a peasant family, Lai received little in the way of education. He nonetheless rose to become one of China's richest and most flamboyant businessmen. His company's interests included products as varied as cigarettes, cars, luxury goods and oil. But in a crackdown on corruption, the Chinese government said Lai's business was trading the goods illegally. It accused him of bribing dozens of government officials and telling his staff to do the same. Lai evaded the authorities and fled to Canada in 1999. He was subsequently detained and spent years fighting extradition back to China. He lost that battle last year and was returned to China in July. His lawyers had said they feared he may face the death penalty in China like others convicted of profiting from the smuggling operation. But the extradition deal with Canada appeared to have prevented that outcome. Under Canadian law, nobody can be deported if they will face the death penalty.","Lai Changxing became one of China's businessmen in the 1990s .

"(CNN) -- Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher is hoping to repay his Chinese fans with a win in Shanghai next weekend -- despite admitting he's ""never had much luck"" at the Formula One circuit. The 43-year-old driver has had a disappointing start to the year despite his Mercedes team's promising pace in qualifying and pre-race practice sessions. He was forced to pull out of the season-opening Australian Grand Prix in March after suffering a gearbox failure, then finished 10th in Malaysia. The German, who has struggled since coming back from retirement in 2010, finished eighth in China last year. ""As for the race itself, I've never had much luck in Shanghai, apart from my win in 2006,"" he told reporters in Shanghai.

"(CNN) -- The charge is rather routine -- an Iowa man was arrested over the weekend, accused of operating a vehicle while intoxicated, according to a police report.

I also observed a zebra in the back seat of the vehicle and a parrot on the driver's shoulder."" Leitzen then conducted a breathalyzer test that he said Reiter subsequently failed with a blood alcohol content of .148.

"(CNN) -- Mercedes' Nico Rosberg has secured the first pole position of his career at the qualifying session for Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai. The German driver snatched top spot on Saturday with a superb lap of one minute 35.121 seconds, over half a second faster than his nearest rival Lewis Hamilton of McLaren. Mercedes teammate Michael Schumacher finished qualifying in third place. But the seven-time world champion will start from second place in Sunday's race after the Hamilton incurred a penalty for changing a gearbox which sees him drop down to seventh. Rosber's emphatic drive is the first time in 110 attempts that the 26-year-old has claimed pole and is the first time since the 1955 Italian Grand Prix that two Mercedes drivers have claimed to the top two qualifying positions. ""It went really well and it's a very special feeling. It's fantastic, it all came together. It's perfect till now so I am very happy. It shows that we are moving forward,"" Rosberg said. ""We are not quite where we want to be in the races, but we are progressing. The first two races of the season have not gone too well. We've not been as good in races as qualifying lately,"" he added. Bahrain GP gets green light from FIA . But there was little joy for his compatriot and reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel who will start from 11th after failing to make the final qualifying session. The Red Bull driver is struggling to make an impact this season, starting the first two races of the season from seventh which were converted into finishes of 12th and 13th in Australia and Malaysia respectively. His teammate Australia's Mark Webber fared a bit better in qualifying claiming sixth place on the starting grid. Lewis Hamilton's demotion means Sauber's Kamui Kobayashi moves up to third on the grid, ahead of Lotus driver Kimi Raikkonen. McLaren's Jenson Button will start Sunday's race from fifth. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso, winner in Malaysia three weeks ago, had a disappointing qualifying session finishing down in ninth with teammate Felipe Massa three places further back.","Nico Rosberg secures first pole position of career at qualifying for Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix .

"(CNN) -- From supermarkets to the office supply store, it's hard to miss those tiny bottles of 5-hour Energy. The makers of 5-Hour Energy call it a ""no-nonsense drink."" ""It would be easier for me to tell you where we didn't sell them in the U.S. than list all the places we do,"" said Carl Sperber, spokesman for Living Essentials, the Detroit, Michigan-based manufacturer of 5-hour Energy shot. The small, shot-glass size bottles promise to provide energy and alertness without jitters to fatigued Americans. Unlike other popular energy drinks that market to college students, 5-Hour Energy's audience is multitasking, working professionals. The market demand has skyrocketed since the product hit store shelves in 2004. The company expects to move more than 350 million shots this year, Sperber said, up from 174 million in 2008. ""This is a no-nonsense drink,"" Sperber said. ""It is not a fashion statement. It doesn't have a cool name; it is just a simple grab-and-go product to help busy adults when they can't afford a letdown."" Each 2-ounce bottle contains zero grams of sugar, 4 calories and about the same amount of caffeine as a small coffee. It also contains about a dozen ingredients that are broken down into B vitamins (B3, B6, B9, B12) and what the manufacturer lists as an ""energy blend."" But don't expect superhuman results, one expert said. ""The B vitamins are given at extraordinarily high levels, and people need to know they are not some magic potion that's going to immediately raise your energy level,"" said Dr. Brent Bauer, Mayo Clinic director of complementary and integrative medicine. ""There is no data that show that."" The overall health impact of the shots' energy blend is a little fuzzy, according to some experts, because little data has been collected about the effectiveness or safety of the natural compounds. The blend contains: citicoline, tyrosine, phenylalanine, taurine, malic acid, glucuronolactone and caffeine. Phenylalanine, taurine, tyrosine are all amino acids our bodies naturally produce. Malic acid is a natural chemical substance found in food. Glucuronolactone is a byproduct of glucose produced in the liver. Citicoline is a natural compound that produces a chemical in the brain. ""These energy shots have over a dozen ingredients all together, and consumers are ingesting them at very high doses but there is no research of how the ingredients react all together,"" Bauer said. ""It's plausible if you put these 12 things together you will get a good result but it's also possible for them to cause major interactions to medications, or have a negative impact on the liver or kidney. We just don't know at this point.""  Watch Dr. Gupta talk about the the safety of 5-hour Energy » . Consumers of 5-hour Energy probably won't ever drink enough shots to reach toxic levels of the B vitamins, experts said, but side effects can occur. The maker notes on its Web site the potential ""niacin flush reaction"" from vitamin B3. It would be noticeable but temporary, one expert said. ""If you have too much B3 it can cause tingling in your whole body. You will turn red, flush, but it would only last for about 30 minutes,"" said Jim White, spokesman for the American Dietetic Association. ""Research also shows high doses of vitamin B6 can cause nerve spasm, also temporary trouble with muscle coordination."" 5-hour Energy's spokesman says that his company doesn't have safety data on the specific blend of ingredients in its product, but believes that side effects are ""rare."" ""None of our ingredients are synthetic drugs,"" Sperber said. 5-hour Energy also advises consumers to check with their health care provider before taking the booster. Medical experts acknowledged that if taken modestly, the products are unlikely to have a negative impact on health. ""In moderation, it can give you energy. But the problem is people drink coffee, then take these energy shots, then down Red Bull, take Hydroxycut, and it is just too much in the body at one time,"" White said. The makers of 5-hour Energy agree. ""There is no law against stupidity and there is always that person out there that is going to push the envelope and consume too many of them or combine our product with others, but we can't really control that,"" Sperber said.","5-Hour Energy promises energy, alertness without jitters to fatigued Americans .

"(CNN) -- An 87th minute header from beleaguered striker Andy Carroll handed Liverpool a 2-1 victory over Merseyside rivals Everton in the semifinal of the English FA Cup on Saturday. Carroll's effort compounded a miserable second half for David Moyes' team after a promising opening to the match played at Wembley Stadium. Nikica Jelavic pounced on a mix up between Liverpool defender's Jamie Carragher and Daniel Agger in the 24th minute to side-foot past goalkeeper Brad Jones to hand Everton the lead. It stayed that way until the 62nd minute when Sylvain Distin's sloppy back-pass gifted Liverpool a way back into the game. Luis Suarez raced onto the mistake before comfortably beating Tim Howard with the outside of his right boot to level the scores. Liverpool perhaps should have been ahead earlier in the half when Andy Carroll missed a gilt-edged chance to equalize but somehow directed his header wide. But the $55 million man made amends rising above Everton's Marouane Fellaini to nod home the winner from a Craig Bellamy free-kick. ""It's the best feeling ever. We worked hard and getting the goal right there at the end was great,"" Carroll told ESPN afterwards. ""I had a few chances and should have probably scored earlier. But I kept at it and it was a great ball in by Craig (Bellamy), and I just had to score with that one and I did. ""It's a great feeling. I've had some criticism but I've just kept on going,"" Carroll added. His manager Kenny Dalglish, who has also been the subject of criticism after Liverpool's poor league form in recent weeks, was delighted with the effort of his team. ""I think it was fantastic and although it's not been too good in the league recently, that's two cup finals -- one we've won and won we're looking forward to,"" Dalglish told ESPN. FA Cup gives Dalglish opportunity to repay owners' faith . Chelsea take on Tottenham Hotspur in the second semifinal on Sunday. The final will be played on Saturday May 5. Meanwhile in the English Premier League, Carlos Tevez scored a hat-trick for Manchester City on Saturday in the English Premier League as Manchester City thrashed Norwich City 6-1 at Carrow Road. The win closes the gap on leaders Manchester United to just two points who play Aston Villa at Old Trafford on Sunday. The Argentine put City ahead in the 18th minute, before his compatriot Sergio Aguero added a second nine minutes later. Andrew Surman's goal for Norwich six minutes after the break gave home fans hope of a comeback but four goals from City in the final quarter of the match killed off the game. Tevez bagged his second in the 73rd minute as did Aguero two minutes later to make the game safe. Tevez, who was starting only his second league game since last September, claimed his hat-trick ten minutes from the end, with Adam Johnson completing the rout in injury time to boost City's goal difference to plus 58, eight ahead of United. In the other three Premier League fixtures played Saturday, the teams struggling at the foot of the table all had days to forget. Wolverhampton Wanderers played out a goalless draw against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light -- a result that does little to alleviate their plight at the bottom of the league.

"Yangon, Myanmar (CNN) -- Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi said Friday that elections taking place this weekend would not be ""free and fair"" but that her party still hoped to win as many parliamentary seats as possible. Suu Kyi, who was released in 2010 by Myanmar's military rulers after years under house arrest, said that she believed there had been voting irregularities, illegal activities and intimidation either committed or encouraged by official entities. But Suu Kyi, a pro-democracy figure and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said at a news conference outside her residence in Yangon that she did not ""at all regret having taken part"" because the election campaign had raised political awareness among Myanmar's population. Worldwide attention is focused on the April elections, which are seen as a test of the Myanmar government's commitment to removing the fear and paranoia of citizens silenced by nearly five decades of military rule. The government has invited in hundreds of foreign journalists and election observers to witness the voting. The vote, in which credible alternatives to the ruling party will appear on the ballot, was called to fill seats vacated by the promotion of parliamentarians to the Cabinet and other posts last year. Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), is in competition for 44 of the 45 seats up for grabs in the by-elections. It had boycotted previous elections. Its candidate in one constituency has been rejected by the election commission because his parents had taken up foreign residency, Suu Kyi said, adding that the party planned to challenge the candidate's exclusion later. The international community has applauded recent steps toward greater openness in Myanmar, also known as Burma, long secluded from the rest of the world after a military junta grabbed power in 1962. The generals are loosening their grip after international sanctions and criticism over their regime's human rights record. So far this year, the regime has agreed to negotiate with an ethnic rebel group and pardoned hundreds of political prisoners. Top diplomats from the United States, Britain and France have made recent visits to the country after decades of shunning it. Suu Kyi said she believed President Thein Sein, a former general who has taken civilian office, wished for democratic reform, but that she was uncertain how much support he had, notably from the military. She told the hundreds of journalists gathered outside her residence Friday that she didn't plan on becoming a minister in the military-backed civilian government, if a position was offered to her. Under Myanmar's constitution, lawmakers can't hold ministerial office. Asked where she would place Myanmar's democracy on a scale of one to 10, Suu Kyi quipped, ""We're trying to get to one."" She mentioned two recent physical attacks against NLD candidates, which she said she thought were actions of individuals rather than state-sponsored acts. In one of the attacks, somebody used a catapult to fire betel nuts at a candidate's car, she said. Some people in Southeast Asia chew betel nuts as a mild stimulant. The daughter of Gen. Aung San, a hero of Burmese independence, Suu Kyi herself became an inspiration with her long struggle for democracy in the country. She quietly defied Myanmar's military junta for years from from the prison of her crumbling Inya Lake villa in the former capital, Yangon. Suu Kyi, 66, is now a candidate for the parliamentary seat in Kawhmu, a contest analysts say she is all but certain to win. Results are expected about a week after the voting. Suu Kyi has been crisscrossing the country to attend election rallies where she is often greeted like a rock star. But her busy schedule has taken its toll: earlier this week she had to suspend campaigning after falling ill. On Friday, she said she felt somewhat ""delicate,"" but was in good enough spirits to joke about her health. She told the reporters at the news conference that if they asked ""any tough questions, I'll faint straight away."" CNN's Paula Hancocks reported from Yangon, and Jethro Mullen from Hong Kong.","Worldwide attention is trained on by-elections in Myanmar over the weekend .

"(CNN) -- Emilee Neagle and her family had just 26 minutes to leave their house the night a tornado hit her town of Woodward, Oklahoma. ""The wind was blowing and it woke me up,"" Neagle said of the moments before she fled. She heard that severe weather was heading for Woodward, but it wasn't until she turned on the television Saturday night to watch the local news that she realized her home was in the path of the devastation. A tornado barreled through Woodward -- a community of about 12,000 people -- just after midnight Sunday, killing six people. While the powerful system hit a hospital, blew truckers off highways and shredded buildings in several states, Woodward was the only place where fatalities were reported over the weekend.

In the chaos of trying to get out before the storm, she knew they had forgotten a lot, but at the time she didn't realize how much. ""Honestly, it really didn't pop into my head until the next day,"" Neagle said of the wedding ring she left on the bathroom counter. They also left behind the family dog, she said. ""I know he's not a human or anything like that, but our dog, my daughter's dog ... has been with her from the very beginning,"" she said of, Ted, the dog. ""We were in such a hurry we left him here. I just thought he was gone."" Neagle is a third-grade teacher and a beloved member of the Woodward community. So much so, that when neighbors and parents of her students heard about what she had left behind, they teamed up to help her look for the ""needle in the haystack,"" she said. ""I started walking down the street, looking for my friends wondering if they were alive and ... the neighbor down the street ... I saw these two little ears (come) up in his pickup. A little boy had found him and picked him up for me,"" Neagle said about her dog. Storm hits Iowa hospital . But Ted wasn't all she found. Armed with a metal detector and the tenacity needed for an all-day search, Neagle and her friends also found her ring -- after nearly eight hours of digging through the debris. ""I've got my girls, my family, I'm fine. This can be replaced,"" she said, speaking near the wreckage that used to be her home. ""It's material things, but it's just the thought of losing your wedding ring."" For now, that's one less thought Neagle has to worry about.

"(CNN) -- U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur suffered another early Wimbledon exit as she crashed out to unseeded Dutch player Arantxa Rus on Wednesday. The fifth seed's surprise exit means there are no Australian players remaining in either singles championships at the grass-court grand slam. Defeats for Lleyton Hewitt, Bernard Tomic, Matthew Ebden and Marinko Matosevic meant Australia were left without a player in the men's second round for the first time in 1938. Rus's 6-2 0-6 6-4 win meant Stosur joined Casey Dellacqua, Ashleigh Barty, Anastasia Rodionova and Jarmila Gajdosova in making a hasty exit from the women's draw. Rus, ranked 72nd in the world, had never won a match in the main draw before this year's championships. She will next face China's Peng Shuai, who reached the fourth round last year. ""I'm very happy with this win, especially on the grass,"" said the 21-year-old, who beat former world No. 1 Kim Clijsters at the French Open last year and reached the fourth round in Paris this year. Chinese 11th seed Li Na was another grand slam winner to exit early, losing 6-3 6-4 to Sorana Cirstea. The Romanian's reward for beating the 2011 French Open champion was a third-round clash with Russian 17th seed Maria Kirilenko. Meanwhile, Heather Watson became the first UK woman to reach the third round for 10 years. The 20-year-old walked on to Centre Court wearing headphones and deep in thought, but was soon tuned into the home crowd's enthusiasm for a British player. She cruised to a 6-1 6-4 win over American Jamie Lee Hampton to move past the second-round stage of a grand slam event for the first time and set up a clash with Polish third seed Agnieszka Radwanska. ""I always knew I could play this well, that l'd get far in these tournaments, but it's different playing like that in practice from bringing it onto the match court at big occasions with pressure,"" said Watson, who lost in the first round last year and in 2010. Radwanska went through with a 6-2 6-1 demolition of Russia's Elena Vesnina, who knocked out five-time champion Venus Williams in the opening round. German 15th seed Sabine Lisicki lost the first set to Serbia's Bojana Jovanovski before recovering to win 3-6 6-2 8-6. A semifinalist last year, Lisicki will next face American debutant Sloane Stephens. The 19-year-old Stephens, who reached the fourth round at the French Open, followed up her opening win over Karolina Pliskova by beating another Czech, 23rd seed Petra Cetovska, in three sets. Japan's Kimiko Date-Krumm, the oldest player at the tournament at 41, lost 5-7 6-3 6-3 to Ukraine's Kateryna Bondarenko in her first-round match. Bondarenko will next play Serbia's former world No. 1 Ana Ivanovic, the 14th seed. But French Open finalist Sara Errani made it through to the second round without having to hit a ball on Wednesday. Her match with Coco Vandeweghe was halted by rain on Tuesday, with Errani standing at match point. When they resumed on Wednesday, the American twice served into the net to double fault and secure a 6-1 6-3 victory for Errani. Top seed Maria Sharapova, who beat Errani in the Paris final, will resume her second-round match against Bulgaria's Tsvetana Pironkova on Thursday. The Russian battled back from 5-2 down against the 2010 semifinalist to lead 7-6 (7-3) 3-1 when play was halted due to bad light.","U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur loses to unseeded Dutch player Arantxa Rus at Wimbledon .

"(CNN) -- The floral, serene surrounds of London's Chelsea Flower Show seem a million miles from the screeching, full-throttle action of Formula One. But the two worlds have merged in a unique and award-winning way thanks to the Williams F1 team and a British tree nursery. ""The Williams Story"" is a topiary display which depicts the history of the nine-time constructors' champions, from their origins in 1977 to Pastor Maldonado's historic victory at the Spanish Grand Prix earlier this month. And, in keeping with the green shoots of recovery which were visible during Williams' first race win in eight years, the piece features a life-sized topiary Formula One car. The eye-catching display, which also boasts a pit crew sculpted from living trees, has been handed a gold medal at the prestigious annual British horticultural event. ""Winning the gold medal is a fantastic achievement,"" Williams founder and team principal Frank Williams said. ""I saw it for the first time (this week) and was taken aback by its scale and attention to detail. ""The Chelsea Flower Show is a uniquely British occasion and to be successful at this illustrious event is a great honor. I hope the public enjoy the display as much as the judges."" The topiary took over three years to complete and was sculpted using a fast-growing plant native to south-west China. The honor provides Williams with a timely boost ahead of this weekend's Monaco Grand Prix, with the team looking to build on Maldonado's win -- the first by a Venezuelan in the history of the sport. Williams' celebrations were cut short by a fire in the team garage, a blaze which left seven people in hospital. The incident also resulted in Williams losing vital parts and equipment, but the team's chief operations engineer Mark Gillan moved to thank the other F1 manufacturers for the support they have shown. ""The team's preparations for Monaco have been somewhat hampered by last Sunday's garage fire,"" Gillan said on the official F1 website. ""But the impact of the fire has been mitigated by what can only be described as a Herculean effort by the factory and our suppliers to restock both the damaged equipment and car parts. ""We would also like to thank the generous offers of help from the other teams, highlighting once more the excellent sportsmanship that exists in Formula One and high levels of camaraderie throughout the pit lane.""","Williams the subject of a topiary display at the Chelsea Flower Show .

"(CNN) -- The infiltration of a Middle Eastern terror network by a mole who helped foil a plot to blow up a U.S.-bound plane was a ""phenomenal,"" ""brilliant"" and ""powerful"" success, experts said Wednesday. It's unclear how much of the credit should go to the United States or to Saudi Arabia, for whom sources say the mole was working, but both countries have delivered a practical and psychological setback to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, analysts on the region said. Western officials describe that affiliate as al Qaeda's most dangerous. ""It's a devastating blow to al Qaeda, though not a fatal one,"" said Juan Zarate, who was deputy national security adviser for combating terrorism under President George W. Bush. ""What this demonstrates is that we have the ability to get on the inside."" And the plot, by the same group that launched a failed attempt to bomb a U.S.-bound airliner on Christmas 2009, demonstrates the continued ""rise of the affiliates,"" he said. ""We have a decimated al Qaeda core -- the al Qaeda of 2001 that we have battled and really dismantled in many ways has metastasized and is now presenting itself in this regional form."" This latest intelligence success marks the deepest known penetration into al Qaeda, said Ali Soufan, a former FBI official who oversaw highly sensitive international terrorism cases. But he noted many intelligence efforts remain secret. ""It's a major success for the CIA and for the intelligence community,"" he said. And, he noted, as in this case with Saudi Arabia, ""overseas most of our work is done in cooperation with friendly services."" Of the al Qaeda affiliate groups trying to carry out terrorist operations today, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is the closest version to the network Osama bin Laden led, Soufan said. Bruce Riedel, who spent 30 years in the CIA and was a senior adviser on the Middle East to four presidents, said thwarting the bomb plot is ""primarily a Saudi success story"" -- and not their first. ""They foiled the AQAP plot in October 2010 to send bombs to the U.S. on FedEx and UPS planes,"" he noted. That plot was foiled by an informant. Some details remain unknown. This time, Riedel said, Saudi intelligence managed to ""get access to AQAP's plot and actually get the bomb."" Still, thwarting this attack doesn't damage the organization substantially in the big picture, analysts said. ""While this is a good technical success, the harsh reality is that in Yemen, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is growing, getting more powerful, recruiting more assets and taking advantage of the fact that Yemen is essentially the Humpty Dumpty of the Arabian Peninsula -- it's falling apart, broken,"" said Riedel, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank added that while it is a ""big intelligence success"" for the United States and Saudi Arabia, ""there's a limit to their success as well."" The operation did not lead intelligence services to Ibrahim al-Asiri, the chief bomb maker for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or to the location where he makes the bombs. ""They were able to take out Fahd al-Quso, who's a senior operational planner in the group, but they were not able to take out this very dangerous bomb maker who's ingenious at making bombs,"" Cruickshank noted. Information from the mole led to a CIA drone strike Sunday in Yemen that killed al-Quso, 37, a senior operative of the al Qaeda affiliate. He was a suspect in the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen. He was convicted in a Yemeni court but escaped from jail. All the analysts who spoke to CNN expressed concern that a mole's involvement was leaked to the media. ""I think authorities, particularly the CIA, would rather not talk about this right now,"" said Zarate, now a senior adviser on counterterrorism for the Center for Strategic and International Studies. These kinds of sources ""can lead to additional counterterrorism successes or insights,"" he said. ""So the fact that this is now front page news certainly doesn't help."" Soufan, who runs a consultancy group on security issues, said, ""When you're doing operations like this, you have to do whatever you can do to protect sources and methods -- not only of the CIA but also of the other intelligence services that were involved in this. Because down the road they will be hesitant to cooperate with us."" However, Zarate said, there may be a bit of a silver lining in the leak. ""I think what this will do is it will increase the amount of vigilance and mistrust within al Qaeda circles to outsiders. They need outsiders to supplement their ranks and allow them to plot against the West. ... It will create layers of distrust and will create inefficiencies,"" Zarate said.","Analyst: The intelligence success on bomb plot shows ""the ability to get on the inside""

"(CNN) -- At least eight people were killed, including one suicide bomber, and dozens were wounded in three bomb blasts in central and northern Nigeria on Thursday, the Red Cross said. The targets of the first two bombs were newspaper offices, the country's president said. The third blast, in the northern state of Kaduna, was confirmed by emergency management officials, but no information on casualties or damage was available. In the first incident in Kaduna, a man drove a vehicle into a two-story building that houses three national newspapers: ThisDay, The Moment and The Sun. According to a reporter at one of the dailies, when the car hit the wall, passers-by and newspaper staff ran to the site to see what happened. According to the Red Cross, the bomb did not explode on impact, and the bystanders tried to get the suspected bomber out of the car. Once that was accomplished, the suspect threw a bomb at the bystanders, killing four and wounding 19, then tried to flee, the Red Cross said. Other bystanders caught the suspected bomber and turned him over to police. Within 30 minutes of the first blast in Kaduna, a suicide bomber in the central city of Abuja detonated a bomb that killed four people, including himself, said the Red Cross, which described the explosions as ""the first direct attack on the media by (an) unknown armed group."" Seven people were wounded, it said. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan condemned the attacks on the newspaper offices, calling them ""ignoble, misguided, horrendous and wicked.""

"(CNN) -- Myanmar plans to release 651 prisoners starting Friday, state television reported, one day after the country's leadership announced a cease-fire with an ethnic rebel group that has waged a bitter, decades-long insurgency for greater autonomy. Democracy activists are expected to be among those released throughout the day. On Thursday, a cease-fire deal with the Karen National Union (KNU) was widely seen as another attempt by the nominally civilian government to gain greater international credibility. The Karen will now be permitted to travel throughout the country, but without weapons, a government official said. Karen leaders and activists said it was too early to gauge whether peace would take hold. ""We have to begin with a cease-fire and then proceed to negotiations, with political dialogue taking place later,"" KNU Vice President Saw David Thakabaw told the United Nations news service earlier. KNU leaders said a key problem remains security for civilians living in camps for the internally displaced. They said the government was still sending supplies and troops into Karen areas. One of eight prominent ethnic groups in Myanmar, the largely Christian Karen have been fighting in the country's eastern jungles for greater rights since Burmese independence from Britain in 1948. Myra Dahgaypaw, a Washington-based Karen activist with the U.S. Campaign for Burma, said there are no precise numbers on how many people have suffered in the long-running conflict. Just since 1996, she said, government troops have burned down 4,000 Karen villages. According to the CIA Factbook, about 140,000 mostly Karen refugees fleeing civil strife, political upheaval and economic stagnation live in remote camps in Thailand near the border. Many have found new homes in other countries -- about 30,000 are in the United States. Dahgaypaw, 35, who spent 17 years in a Thailand camp for the displaced, said Myanmar's leadership in Napidaw had not yet put its stamp of approval on the agreement. She was not ready to celebrate peace just yet. But if it really does take hold, she said, it will mean that many people will be able to finally go back home. ""Since independence, we have never experienced basic freedom,"" she said, adding that the Karen have had to fight to preserve their culture. ""If we don't fight for it, we will get killed."" National reconciliation has been a key demand of democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi as well as Western powers, including the United States. The cease-fire agreement came on the same day Suu Kyi's party said it will participate in upcoming elections. Ruled by a military junta since 1962, Myanmar is now under President Thein Sein, a former general elected in March, 2011. The new government has instituted rapid reforms but the verdict is still out on whether they are genuine, or merely moves to appease critics. In October, it granted a mass amnesty, which authorities say will eventually free 6,300 prisoners. ""The government is striving for emerging good governance and clean government, flourishing of democratic practices, ensuring rule of law, making economic reform and motivating environmental conservation in building a new peaceful, modern, and developed discipline-flourishing democratic nation,"" the president said then. The opposition website Mizzima reported Thursday that state-run television had announced another amnesty Friday involving 651 prisoners. The Obama administration cautiously says it finds the changes encouraging as well as promising. Hillary Clinton visited Myanmar last month, the first visit by a secretary of state in more than a half-century. And last week, Suu Kyi met with William Hague, the first British foreign secretary to visit Myanmar in more than 50 years. He called the peace deal ""good news"" after 63 years of fighting. ""It has been a longstanding goal of the international community to see a ceasefire, and indeed it was one of the key issues on which I urged the Burmese government to make progress during my visit last week when I also met with Karen representatives,"" he said. ""There is still a long way to go fully to rebuild trust between the parties after so many years of conflict, but this is an important step in the right direction."" Myanmar, also known as Burma, has historically blamed the ethnic rebels for waging attacks to destabilize the government. Thursday's announcement coincides with a meeting between U.S. diplomats and Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and the face of democracy in Myanmar. The U.S. delegation arrived in the country Monday and has since met with top government officials. Meanwhile Thursday, Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy said it will announce a roster of 23 candidates, including Suu Kyi, with 48 seats up for grabs. The NLD won more than 80% of the legislative seats in 1990 -- the first free elections in the country in nearly 30 years -- but the ruling military junta refused to recognize the results. Suu Kyi has lived most of the past two decades under house detention.She was released in 2010.

"(CNN) -- South Korea's In-Kyung Kim had the Kraft Nabisco golf tournament at Mission Hills in California all but won on the final hole Sunday -- all she needed to do was tap in for par from about a foot out and she was virtually guaranteed the win. But her putt rimmed out for a bogey forcing a sudden death playoff that she lost on the first hole. Her compatriot Yoo Sun-young rolled in a 15-feet birdie to take the first women's major of the year. ""I'm speechless right now. I played pretty solid today,"" the 25-year-old Yoo said in a television interview by the green. Her win was in stark contrast to Kim's heartbreaking loss. After sinking the putt, she covered her ears with her hands and looked skyward in despair before going back to the 18th tee for the play-off. Both players were tied at nine-under-par 279 after 72 holes. Yoo easily took the play-off after Kim drove her ball deep into the left rough. ""I didn't think about winning today because I didn't want to expect too much, and I didn't want to let myself down,"" Yoo told reporters after becoming the second South Korean to win the event, following Grace Park in 2004. Yoo climbed five places to 16th in the world rankings after claiming her second victory on the LPGA Tour, having also triumphed at the 2010 Sybase Match Play Championship. Kim has won three times on the LPGA Tour, but is still waiting for her first major title. ""Sometimes things happen, and it's kind of tough because it's the Nabisco, and hopefully I'll have better or more chances,"" the 23-year-old said. World No. 1 Yani Tseng had begun the day tied for the lead with Sweden's Karin Sjodin, but narrowly missed going to the the playoff when she missed a long birdie putt at the 18th hole to finish one shot behind the leaders. ""I was totally shocked that I couldn't make that,"" said the 23-year-old from Taiwan, who was seeking to become the youngest player to win six major titles. ""But I tried my best again. I finished strong. It was a day I really don't want, but I gave my 100% effort out there."" Tseng also led going into the final round of last year's tournament, but finished three shots behind Stacy Lewis. ""Last year when I finished I was crying so hard, but this year I was happy, smiling, enjoy the crowd, enjoy walking on the 18 holes, and I think it's because I do my best every shot,"" she said. ""And I said maybe God just wanted another player to win and give me something to learn more and improve myself."" On Saturday, Sjodin fired a four-under 68 to join Tseng on nine-under at the top of the leaderboard. However, she eventually tied for fourth at 281 with Lewis (66) and Koreans Amy Yang (69) and Seo Hee-kyung (71). She was unable to hold her three-shot lead gained early in the final round after an eagle at the second hole, while Seo took a three-shot edge in the back nine before sliding back.","In-Kyung Kim misses tournament-winning birdie at women's opening major .

"(CNN) -- The mother of one of two men accused of shooting and killing three African-Americans in Tulsa, Oklahoma, earlier this month said Tuesday her son was ""a very good kid."" ""I'm still devastated from the news. I can't wrap my head around that,"" Teri Alexander told CNN from the Mabel Bassett Correctional Center in McCloud, Oklahoma. She's serving an 18-year sentence on an arson conviction. Alexander's son, Jake England, and his friend, Alvin Watts, are accused of first-degree murder and other charges in the April 6 shooting spree, which came a day after he posted a message lamenting his father's death two years earlier ""at the hands of a f--king n----r."" A judge on Monday entered not guilty pleas for the men and ordered them held without bond pending a May 30 preliminary hearing. England's attorney, Clark Brewster, reiterated Tuesday that England, 19, is not a racist, despite the posting. ""The fact that he uses that term and is comfortable in using that term in describing in a real derogatory fashion one person does not make him a racist,"" Brewster said. ""He used the most derogatory term he could in describing the person who shot his dad in the heart."" Brewster took the case after England's mother wrote an impassioned plea for her son's defense from prison. His office released a jailhouse interview Monday recorded by the legal team in which England spoke of the trauma of seeing his father killed and his girlfriend commit suicide in front of him, as well as troubles with depression. In the video, England also talked of growing up and living in North Tulsa, which has a large African-American community, and said he had friends of all races. ""I always got along with everybody,"" he said in the video, which was recorded last Friday. ""It didn't matter what color he was."" The language in the Facebook post was used ""just to express how I was upset at the guy who shot my dad,"" England said in the interview, adding that was the only time he had used the derogatory term to describe someone. That view is starkly different from the portrayal of England and Watts, 33, that has been offered by authorities. Authorities say the two went into a largely African-American section of Tulsa after midnight April 6, killing three people and wounding two others. Police have said the two confessed to the killings shortly after their arrest. All the shooting victims were black. Police have identified Watts and England as white, though the probable cause affidavit released Friday noted England was a co-owner of a truck that had Cherokee Nation license plates. Three Crime Stoppers tips helped lead authorities to the men, according to the affidavit. In the first, made last Saturday, a caller described England as ""a racist (who) hates black males"" and said he had ""bragged about other shootings."" Another person phoned to say that England had gone off to burn his truck, which was similar to the vehicle seen by several people -- including one of the survivors -- in and around the area where the shootings took place. Sheriff deputies soon after found a 1989 Chevy truck with the Cherokee Nation tag on fire in North Tulsa. The third caller to contact Crime Stoppers on April 7 said England had ""made several comments about killing black people"" and wanted ""justice"" for his father's killing. This person added that England ""uses drugs and will not go down without a fight."" In addition to the first-degree murder charges, Watts and England also face two counts of shooting with intent to kill and five counts of malicious harassment -- the equivalent of a hate crime under Oklahoma law. The law makes it illegal to ""maliciously and with the specific intent to intimidate or harass another person because of that person's race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin or disability."" Prosecutors have not yet announced if they plan to seek the death penalty on the murder charges. The Justice Department is investigating the shootings to determine if federal civil rights laws were violated.

"(CNN) -- An 11th suspect linked to a central Florida white supremacist group has been arrested and another individual was being sought, authorities said Thursday. Verlin C. Lewis, 40, was charged with unlawfully committing paramilitary training, attempting to shoot into an occupied dwelling and evidence to prejudice while committing an offense, said Twis Lizasuain, a spokeswoman with the Osceola County Sheriff's Office. Lewis was released Tuesday on $50,000 bond from the Washington County jail in northern Florida. Authorities were searching for Dylan J. Rettenmaier, 25, a convicted felon. According to authorities, members of American Front -- a white supremacist group -- trained in hand-to-hand combat and drilled in breaking down weapons and practiced shooting them. Authorities: What went on at the American Front . On Monday, authorities said they had arrested Marcus and Patricia Faella and five other members of the group, which is also known by its initials AF, on charges of illegal paramilitary training, attempting to shoot into an occupied dwelling and evidence of prejudice while committing a crime. ""Faella views himself and the other members of the AF as the protectors of the white race,"" investigators wrote in an affidavit. ""Faella has stated his intent during the race war is to kill Jews, immigrants and other minorities."" More immediately, according to police, Faella was planning to stage provocative disruptions at the Orlando City Hall and at a Melbourne, Florida, anti-racism gathering. Faella, the police documents say, wanted to stir up media attention to help gain new recruits for American Front, which hate-tracking groups says has been faltering since the death of its leader, David Lynch, in California. Nationally, American Front has had a long and violent history, including the beating death of a Salt Lake City man and a string of 1993 bombings in California, according to hate-tracking groups. The 25-year-old group enjoyed a resurgence in 2007 under Lynch, described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a charismatic leader who helped form it in 1987. But Lynch was shot to death in his home in March 2011, leaving the group with no clear leader, according to the Anti-Defamation League. It has shrunk significantly in the past year, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Most of the group's 50 or so members appear to live in Florida, according to the ADL. Authorities identified the other members arrested last week as Christopher Brooks, Richard Stockdale, Kent McLellan, Jennifer McGowan, Mark McGowan, Diane Stevens, Paul Jackson and Dustin Perry. Marcus Faella bonded out of jail on Saturday, according to Osceola County officials. His wife was released on Sunday, they said. The Faella compound is situated on the edge of a wildlife management area marketed by tourism officials as a good spot for hikers, campers and bird watchers. According to police, Faella's group watched videos training them in fighting and the use of AK-47s and other weapons at the compound, which the affidavit said is ringed with barbed wire and protected by pit bulls and firing positions facing the driveway. The property was meant to become a refuge for white supremacists after the fall of the U.S. government during a race war, investigators wrote in the affidavit. The group was making body armor and sniper suits and stocking up on supplies in preparation, according to police. CNN's John Couwels and Kim Segal contributed to this report.","11th suspected member of white supremacist group charged, released .

"The Hague, Netherlands (CNN) -- Seventeen years after the end of the war, Ratko Mladic gives the impression he is still on the battlefield in what was once Yugoslavia, staring down his enemy, glowering across the courtroom. Even gesticulating death threats. What the former Bosnian Serb military commander hopes to gain and exactly what he is trying to defend are unclear. He may be the only one who expects an outcome other than guilty. He seems almost eager to fight all comers to the bitter end. The women of Srebrenica are in the Hague too. All these years later, they stand before him, with international justice on their side. These women -- the widows, mothers, victims of one of the worst atrocities since World War II -- occupy the moral high ground. They will not be moved. Mladic shows no remorse . But they have sunk so low in despair and desolation that even a bone unearthed in a mass grave raises spirits -- maybe something tangible from a loved one, something to cling to, a hint that truth and justice may not escape them. Almost 1,000 miles away, most of Bosnia goes about its business with little talk of the war; life goes on. If a question is unwittingly asked by an outsider, it is met with grace, but it hangs awkwardly over the conversation, like an unwanted guest at a dinner table everyone would rather not be there. So back here, in a courtroom in the Netherlands, it is the women of Srebrenica who have the moral weight to slug it out. Eight thousand murders in Srebrenica alone. This is what gives their families such power: There are so many of them. They've become a force Mladic must reckon with, by proxy of course. The international community, in the form of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), controls this courtroom battlefield. They are such a force, in fact, that the whole country must listen, too, awkward or not. No amount of reconciliation -- not that there is a lot -- can really happen until the women of Srebrenica and their families get the justice they are looking for. Can their moral high ground be shared with other Bosnians? Can the country untether itself from the weight of this anchor on progress? If so, then a bigger battle will have been won in the Hague. Ratko Mladic: Villain to many, hero to others . Will a guilty verdict in the battle still playing out in the courtroom here be enough to win -- Mladic vanquished to jail, banished from the battlefield by a long sentence? If not, then no prison sentence will bring back the dead, rectify the wrongs, and Bosnians hopeful of a better future will be hostage to their history and to those who more than anyone deserve a better future, the families of Srebrenica.","Ratko Mladic seems almost eager to fight all comers to the bitter end, says Nic Robertson .

"(CNN) -- At 25-years-old, Fatima Bhutto is eligible to become prime minister of Pakistan. Outspoken critic of President Musharraf, a life free of politics is unlikely for Fatima Bhutto. But the writer and poet, whose family name carries so much weight in Pakistan doesn't feel the burden of continuing the family's political dynasty. Instead that fate has befallen her cousin Bilawal, who will have to wait 6 years before being able to run for office. The 19-year-old son of Benazir Bhutto was thrust into a political life when he was nominated as leader of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) after his mother's murder last December. For Fatima Bhutto, adding to the Bhutto family legacy is neither in her interest, nor her country's. ""I'm not interested in being a symbol for anyone,"" she has said emphatically. ""And I'm not interested in perpetuating a really ineffectual form of politics simply because of my name."" As outspoken about the current political climate in her homeland as she is committed to staying out of mainstream politics, Fatima Bhutto has had to deflect calls from many in Pakistan to enter into the political fray in the aftermath of her aunt Benazir Bhutto's death. Many there who have partisan views on the Bhutto family dynasty see her as ""the real Bhutto"" as opposed to Bilawal Bhutto Zardari. Despite some physical resemblances to Benazir, Fatima is making her own name for herself in order to live her life outside of the shadow of her famous aunt. Shunning Oxford University she was an undergraduate at Columbia University in the U.S. where she read Middle Eastern studies before doing a masters degree in London at the School of Oriental and Asian Studies. While there she wrote her dissertation on the resistance movements to General Zia ul-Haq. Having spent time in Lebanon and traveling extensively, she writes a regular column for Pakistan's The News International newspaper. Working as a writer and poet, she has already published two books - a volume of poetry at the age of 15 after her father's death and a book on the 2005 earthquake in Kashmir from which the proceeds went to survivors of the disaster. Party politics might not be a part of her life at the moment, but politics is an undeniable part of her life. She was born in Kabul in 1982, and after her parents divorced she moved with her father, Murtaza, to Syria where he married a Lebanese ballet teacher. Murtaza had left Pakistan when General Zia al-Huq hanged Fatima's grandfather and the former prime minister of Pakistan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. From then on there was a rift between siblings Murtaza and Benazir that persisted even when he and Fatima returned to Pakistan in 1993 after Benazir became prime minister for the second time. With division between the two growing, Murtaza formed an unsuccessful splinter party to the PPP. In 1996 tragedy struck when Murtaza was shot and killed by police, an incident for which Fatima has said she held Benazir ""morally responsible."" However, after Benazir's murder, Fatima put aside the family feud and attended her funeral. In her column in The News International, while restating her differences with her estranged aunt, she called for a moment of calm in Pakistan's politics. She may resist the call to enter mainstream politics for now, but with such a family history and strong opinions, politics will always have a part to play in her future. In a previous interview with CNN she gave her thoughts on the political culture in Pakistan: ""It has to stop being this autocratic, dynastic environment... When that day comes and this happens -- that we have an open field -- if there's a way for me to serve this country, then I would be proud to.""","Niece of Benazir Bhutto a strong critic of Pakistan's political culture .

"(CNN) -- A rejuvenated Fernando Torres scored a hat-trick on Sunday in the English Premier League as Chelsea thrashed Queens Park Rangers 6-1 at Stamford Bridge. The performance capped a remarkable return to form for the Spanish striker who has struggled to make an impact since his Â£50 million ($81 million) move to West London from Liverpool in January last year. Chelsea were 2-0 up before Torres was on the score sheet with Daniel Sturridge blasting home inside the first minute and John Terry heading a second 12 minutes later. Torres entered the fray in the 19th minute, receiving a inch-perfect pass from Saloman Kalou before rounding QPR keeper Paddy Kenny to score. The 28-year-old, who sealed Chelsea's famous 3-2 aggregate win in midweek against Barcelona, added his second five minutes later driving home after a mix up between Kenny and defender Nedum Onuoha. The Spaniard was on target again in the 64th minute side-footing past Kenny with ease to complete his first hat-trick since 2009 when Liverpool beat Hull 6-1. Florent Malouda added a sixth 10 minutes from the end before Djibril Cisse scored a consolation goal for QPR in the 84th minute. The result capped a wonderful week for Chelsea whose heroics at the Nou Camp on Tuesday earned them a place in the Champions League final against Bayern Munich on May 19. Chelsea stay in sixth place with 61 points, just one point behind Newcastle and Tottenham Hotspur with three games remaining. QPR stay one place above the relegation zone but only on goal difference. ""Reaching the Champions League final was important, but we also want to finish in the top four and we showed we were focused today from the first minute after Daniel Sturridge's goal,"" Torres said. Torres' return to form also adds spice to next weekend's English FA Cup final where Chelsea take on his old club Liverpool at Wembley Stadium. Tottenham moved back into fourth place on Sunday with a 2-0 win over Blackburn Rovers at White Hart Lane. Goals from Rafael Van der Vaart, who bundled home from close range in the 22nd minute, and a stunning Kyle Walker free-kick 15 minutes from the end all but condemn Blackburn Rovers to Championship football next season. With two games left, Steve Kean's team will need to beat both Wigan and Chelsea in their final match to keep their slim chances alive.

"(CNN) -- He stood before judges Wednesday not as the first former head of state convicted of war crimes since World War II but as a leader convinced he was wronged by corruption and a hypocritical hand of justice. In his last stand at a special court for Sierra Leone, his last chance to address the world before he is locked behind bars, former Liberian President Charles Taylor made a plea for why he should be spared the harshest sentence for his conviction on aiding and abetting war crimes. He said he was saddened by last month's guilty verdict, in which the court said he had assisted Revolutionary United Front rebels who fueled Sierra Leone's long and bloody civil war that ultimately left 50,000 dead or missing. Taylor insisted his intent was far from what had been portrayed by prosecutors and that he, himself, was a victim. ""What I did to bring peace to Sierra Leone was done with honor,"" said Taylor, standing before the tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, dressed immaculately in suit and tie as he has been all throughout his trial. He delivered a 30-minute defense of his actions in a calm voice, his demeanor the opposite of the combative Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander whose war crimes trial opened Wednesday in another special tribunal, one for the former Yugoslavia, in The Hague. Not once, however, did he express remorse. ""I pushed the peace process hard, contrary to how I have been portrayed in this court,"" Taylor said. He blamed money for an unfair trial. ""Money played a corrupting, influential, significant and dominant role in this trial,"" he said. ""Money, in this case, prejudiced my rights and interests in a irrevocable way."" He said prosecutors received millions of dollars from the United States government and witnesses were paid off. He compared the charges against him to what he called U.S. abuses but said President George W. Bush would never have to stand trial. ""President George W. Bush ordered torture and admitted to doing so,"" Taylor said. ""Torture is a crime against humanity. The United States has refused to prosecute him. Is he above the law? Where is the fairness?"" He warned that other African leaders could receive similar unjust fates. ""I never stood a chance,"" Taylor said. ""Only time will tell how many other African heads of state will be destroyed."" Last month's landmark ruling by the international tribunal against Taylor was the first war crimes conviction of a former head of state by an international court since the Nuremberg trials after World War II that convicted Adm. Karl Doenitz, who became president of Germany briefly after Adolf Hitler's suicide. Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was tried by an international tribunal, but he died before a judgment was issued. Taylor, 64, was found guilty of all 11 counts of aiding and abetting rebel forces in Sierra Leone in a campaign of terror that involved murder, rape, sexual slavery, conscripting children younger than 15 and mining diamonds to pay for guns. The prosecutors failed, however, to prove that Taylor assumed direct command over the rebels who committed the atrocities. He has been a pivotal figure in Liberian politics for decades and was forced out of office under international pressure in 2003. He fled to Nigeria, where border guards arrested him three years later as he was attempting to cross into Chad. The United Nations and the Sierra Leone government jointly set up the special tribunal to try those who played the biggest role in the atrocities. The court was moved to Netherlands from Sierra Leone, where emotions about the civil war still run high. In closing, Taylor reminded the court that he was a father and a grandfather, and a man of genuine actions. At 64, he is not young anymore, he said. He is a man who favors peace and reconciliation, a man, he said, who is the opposite of the monster that the court said he really was. ""I am no threat to society,"" Taylor said. Few, however, are likely to agree. The judges' guilty verdict last month was unanimous and prosecutors have said Taylor deserves a stiff prison sentence to reflect the gravity of the crimes. There is no death penalty in international criminal law. Brenda Hollis, chief prosecutor for the Special Court for Sierra Leone, has said an 80-year sentence would be appropriate. ""But for Charles Taylor's criminal conduct, thousands of people would not have had limbs amputated, would not have been raped, would not have been killed,"" Hollis said in a statement released earlier. ""The recommended sentence provides fair and adequate response to the outrage these crimes caused in victims, their families and relatives."" Taylor will find out his fate on May 30 when the special tribunal delivers its sentence.","NEW: Taylor delivers a 30-minute defense of his actions in Sierra Leone .

"(CNN) -- Kentucky Derby winner I'll Have Another surged to a surprise win Saturday at the 137th running of the Preakness Stakes, keeping its hopes for the coveted Triple Crown alive. I'll Have Another went into the race with 3-1 odds, behind Bodemeister, the favorite with odds at 2-1. Bodemeister took an early lead and stayed in front for most of the race. But on the home stretch, I'll Have Another broke loose, charging up the side and past Bodemeister to score a dramatic win. Bodemeister came in second and Creative Cause took third. Photos: Kentucky Derby hats . ""I have to say there was a point where I didn't think we were going to get there,"" I'll Have Another owner J. Paul Reddam told NBC.

The 3-year-old colt, with odds at 15-1 going into the Kentucky Derby, stunned the racing world by dashing past favorite Bodemeister to win. Like at the Preakness, Bodemeister led for most of that race before being overtaken at the wire by I'll Have Another. ""I'm just numb; it's incredible,"" said I'll Have Another trainer Doug O'Neill, moments after Saturday's race. ""We're thinking Triple Crown, baby!"" The Preakness, the second of three races that make up the storied U.S. Triple Crown, is run at the Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore. No horse has swept the Triple Crown -- the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes -- in 34 years. Only 11 horses have won the Triple Crown. The last was Affirmed in 1978. Since 1990, just seven horses have won the first two of the three legs of the Triple Crown. Big Brown was the last horse, in 2008. The Belmont Stakes is scheduled to be run on June 9. ""It's not me.

Earlier, the build-up to the race was hit by controversy as the jockey who rode Big Brown to victory in the 2008 Preakness was ruled out of the Preakness after failing a breathalyzer test in New York. Hall of Fame jockey Kent Desormeaux was replaced by Ramon Dominguez on long-shot Tiger Walk. The 42-year-old failed the test at Belmont Park and was taken off all three of his scheduled mounts. Although he has not been suspended, the New York State Racing and Wagering Board is conducting an investigation.

That's when a group investigating the atrocities of Argentina's so-called Dirty War from 1976 to 1983 told Montenegro that her real parents were among ""the disappeared ones,"" as the war victims are hauntingly called. What happened to the thousands of disappeared ones -- mainly leftists -- is an enduring agony of the war's horrors. Montenegro felt betrayed -- and shocked to realize that the couple who raised her were part of the military regime responsible for her parents' disappearance. ""I was 'appropriated,'"" Montenegro said, using the term given to children whose parents were killed or disappeared during the Dirty War and were given to other couples. ""It took me several years to assimilate my new identity and find peace about my true background."" Now a 36-year-old mother of three children, Montenegro learned another truth this week: One of eight unidentified bodies found across the border in Uruguay in 2002 was confirmed to be the remains of her father. Roque Orlando Montenegro, who disappeared at age 20 in 1976 when Victoria was just a few days old, was an apparent victim of the war's barbaric ""death flights,"" a series of military airplane rides in which political prisoners were thrown alive into the sea, forensic investigators said. His body probably washed ashore on the Uruguayan coast, and someone buried him in a nameless grave. ""I personally feel that there is no word for so many feelings,"" she told reporters this week, describing her country as ""a genocidal state"" that threw her father into the ocean. Today, Victoria Montenegro feels disconnected from her military father -- who died in 2003 -- because he was part of the regime targeting liberals like her real parents. Her adoptive mother died recently. Affection for the adoptive couple has dissipated: They had been good parents who raised her well. She feels no hate or animosity -- just betrayal, she told CNN this week. She felt ""peace"" knowing the truth about her father's fate. But now she wonders about what happened to her mother. The group investigating the war's legacy, Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo (May Square Grandmothers), which determined her father's fate through DNA testing, is now continuing to help Montenegro about the mystery of her mother -- as well as thousands of others who were taken away from their politically persecuted parents as children. Guillermo Wulff, a spokesman with Abuelas, said that for Montenegro, learning the truth about her parents wasn't easy. ""It took a long time for her to accept it; but when she did, she was then ready for the next step, which was finding out how her parents died,"" Wulff said. The Argentinian Forensic Anthropology Team (EAAF by its Spanish acronym) announced this week that forensic and DNA tests prove that human remains found in a Uruguayan cemetery are those of Roque Orlando Montenegro, known as ""Toti."" Said Victoria Montenegro: ""It is a miracle that the EEAF, with a drop of my blood, has succeeded in identifying the remains of my father that were in Uruguay since May '76."" Luis Fondevrider, president of EAAF, said that identifying the remains of Montenegro was a process that started 10 years ago in Colonia, Uruguay, across the Rio de La Plata from Buenos Aires. ""In 2002 we exhumed eight unidentified bodies from the cemetery in Colonia. At that time, we had no hypothesis as to how the bodies ended up there,"" said Fondevrider. EAAF took DNA and forensic samples from the bodies. In 2007, the independent organization started taking blood and DNA samples from people in Argentina with missing relatives. Victoria Montenegro was one of 8,500 people who left samples over the following four years. Finally, a match was made this year. But how did the body of a man kidnapped in Buenos Aires end up in a different country? Fondevrider believes Montenegro was killed during the so-called ""death flights."" Montenegro's body probably washed ashore on the Uruguayan coast. A nameless tombstone was placed over his grave in Colonia. For Victoria Montenegro, seeking the truth about her origins has been a slow and painful process, but she says knowing what truly happened has given her some closure. ""Recovering my true identity was paramount,"" Montenegro said. ""Having a true identity is a human right. Recovering the remains of my father has been important not only to understand how he died, but also to bring some justice to Argentina and the victims of the regime."" Montenegro said her rendezvous with her past is only halfway done. She has no knowledge or clues about what happened to her mother. Now with a son who, at 20, is as old as her father was when he disappeared, Montenegro said she hopes the episode shines a little more light on a dark past. ""As painful as it may be, we need to find the truth about our history,"" she said. ""By exhuming and identifying our loved ones after all these years, we give them back their dignity.""","Victoria Montenegro, 36, learned of her real father just 12 years ago .

"(CNN) -- The captain and second officer of a container ship that ran aground last year, resulting in New Zealand's worst maritime environmental disaster, have been jailed for seven months. Maritime New Zealand (MNZ) said in a statement Friday that skipper Mauro Balomaga and Navigator Leonil Relon -- both Philippines nationals -- were found guilty of a total of 11 offences, including operating a vessel in a manner causing unnecessary danger or risk, discharging harmful substances, and willfully attempting to pervert the course of justice by altering ship's documents subsequent to the grounding. The cargo vessel, Rena, hit a reef off Tauranga in clear conditions on October 5 last year. At least 350 tons of fuel oil spewed into the sea, killing thousands of sea birds and contaminating the pristine beaches of Tauranga's Bay of Plenty. After a passage plan for the vessel's journey had been plotted, the captain gave approval for the second officer to deviate from the plan to save time, MNZ said. The subsequent changes to the ship's course, which were not verified using appropriate navigational methods, put the vessel directly on target to hit the Astrolabe Reef. About 10 minutes before the grounding, the reef appeared as an echo on Rena's radar. At this stage, there was still sufficient time to make an effective alteration of course and avoid the reef, the MNZ statement said. The captain saw the echo and assumed it was a small vessel -- but when he could not find it, he dismissed it as a false echo. These two senior officers, who were responsible for the safe navigation of the ship, had failed in their duty, MNZ director Keith Manch said. Click here for latest on the clean-up operation . ""In this case, the master and the second officer have breached the most basic fundamental principles of safe navigation,"" he said. ""If there is a need to deviate from a prepared passage plan, the alterations must be plotted and the new projected path carefully assessed to ensure all potential navigational hazards are identified."" Manch added that both officers also admitted making alterations after the grounding to the ship's GPS log, its passage plan and its computer to mislead investigating authorities. ""This offending is also very serious in that it caused genuine confusion for investigators trying to piece together the events that led to the grounding,"" he added. ""It is vital that when these types of events do take place, we can find out how and why they have happened to help prevent such an event happening again."" Earlier this week, MNZ said ""excellent progress"" has been made on container removal from the wreck site over the past week, with 21 containers removed from the bow section of the vessel on Monday -- the highest number of containers removed in a single day since the break up of the wreck. It said 815 of the 1,368 containers on board have now been recovered. It added that tons of debris, such as timber and plastic continues to be removed from the Bay of Plenty coastline on New Zealand's North Island.","Captain, second officer given seven months for offenses including operating a vessel in dangerous manner .

"(CNN) -- Two of South America's most famous clubs reached the semifinals of the Copa Libertadores after late drama in their last-eight matches on Wednesday. Argentina's Boca Juniors, six-time winners of the continent's premier club competition, snatched a 2-1 aggregate win over Brazil's Fluminense thanks to a 90th-minute goal from Uruguayan Santiago Silva. Having lost the first leg 1-0 in Buenos Aires, Fluminense leveled the tie in front of their own fans when Thiago Carleta's deflected shot found its way past Boca goalkeeper Agustin Orion. But Silva's late strike sealed a 2-1 aggregate win for Boca and Julio Cesar Falconi's team will play Chile's Universidad de Chile or Paraguay's Libertad in the semifinals.

"(CNN) -- Kenny Dalglish's name is synonymous with Liverpool, one of England's most successful football teams, but after a disappointing second spell in charge as manager he has been sacked by the club's American owners. Liverpool confirmed Wednesday Dalglish has been relieved of his duties by Fenway Sports Group, headed by John W. Henry, who also owns baseball's Boston Red Sox. Dalglish won the English League Cup in February but despite huge outlay on players before the start of this season, his side struggled in the Premier League, finishing in eighth place -- their worst return for 18 years. A statement on the club's official website read: ""Fenway Sports Group (FSG) and Liverpool Football Club announced that Kenny Dalglish is to leave his post today as manager after having his contract terminated. CNN blog: Why Liverpool must sack Kenny Dalglish . ""After a careful and deliberative review of the season, the club came to the decision that a change was appropriate. It is not a decision that was reached lightly or hastily. ""The search for a new manager will begin immediately."" Liverpool's 2011-12 campaign was punctuated by controversy. Striker Luis Suarez was handed an eight-game ban by the English Football Association for racially abusing Manchester United's French defender Patrice Evra. Dalglish and Liverpool's players wore t-shirts in support of the Uruguayan, who maintained his innocence, but the club were forced to apologize when the striker refused to shake Evra's hand before Liverpool's game at Old Trafford in February. The Scot's relationship with the media became increasingly fractious and he walked out of several post-match interviews towards the end of the season. Liverpool narrowly failed to secure a cup double earlier this month, losing 2-1 in the FA Cup final at Wembley by Chelsea, and then lost the final game of the season at Swansea. Despite his sacking, Dalglish said it had been an ""honor and a privilege"" to manage the club again. He said: ""Of course I am disappointed with results in the league, but I would not have swapped the Carling Cup win for anything as I know how much it meant to our fans and the club to be back winning trophies. FA Cup success primes Chelsea for Champions League final . ""Whilst I am obviously disappointed to be leaving the football club, I can say that the matter has been handled by the owners and all concerned in an honorable, respectful and dignified way and reflects on the quality of the people involved and their continued desire to move the football club forward in the same way as when they arrived here. ""I would like to thank all of the staff at the club for their effort and loyalty. I said when first approached about coming back as manager that I would always be of help if I can at any time and that offer remains the same. ""Finally, I want to put on record my heartfelt gratitude to Liverpool's fans, who have always given me and the club their unwavering support. Without them neither the club nor I would have achieved anything."" Dalglish first joined Liverpool as a player in 1977, winning six league titles and three European Cups. He became player manager in 1985 and led the club to a league and FA Cup double in his first season. Two more league championships followed before he resigned in 1991, two years after the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 Liverpool fans were killed at an FA Cup semifinal. He returned as an ambassador in 2009 and helped coach Liverpool's young players. He was appointed manager for the second time when the club removed Roy Hodgson, now the England manager, in January 2011. Dalglish oversaw an sharp upturn in fortunes as he led Liverpool away from the lower reaches of the Premier League, eventually finishing sixth, having spent big on striker Andy Carroll in January. Several more players arrived in expensive deals over the summer but have failed to make their mark at Anfield. Winger Stewart Downing, signed for a reported $31 million, failed to score or provide an assist in 36 Premier League games -- but has still been named in England's squad for Euro 2012. Liverpool's owner John Henry said: ""Kenny will always be more than a championship-winning manager, more than a championship-winning star player. ""He is in many ways the heart and soul of the club. He personifies everything that is good about Liverpool Football Club. He has always put the club and its supporters first. Kenny will always be a part of the family at Anfield. ""Our job now is to identify and recruit the right person to take this club forward and build on the strong foundations put in place during the last 18 months.""","Kenny Dalglish has been sacked as manager of Premier League club Liverpool .

"(CNN) -- On Saturday, the ""let's make ourselves feel better"" club will convene in Geneva to try to figure out what to do about Syria. The motives of those gathering in Geneva at the invitation of U.N. Special Envoy Kofi Annan -- the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council (United States, France, China, Britain and Russia), plus Turkey and a number of Arab league members including Iraq and Qatar -- are well-intentioned. Their concern over the continued killing, more than 12,000 dead with thousands more wounded and imprisoned, is understandable. But sadly, the results of the Geneva meeting, even with some added wind at its back (the Turks are madder than ever at Syria for downing a Turkish reconnaissance plane earlier this week), are not likely to produce much new. The purpose of the meeting is to gain agreement on a new Annan plan for a national unity government and a political transition to stop the conflict. But this is unlikely to work any more effectively than Annan's earlier six point cease-fire approach. Chances are the conflict in Syria is going to get worse before it gets worse. The core problem is that the options on Syria are all bad, and nobody wants to assume responsibility for a conflict that pits a regime that still has tremendous firepower against an opposition that is growing stronger but still isn't in a position to bring that regime down. There has been too much blood for diplomatic compromise, and military solutions are risky and too uncertain. The other challenge is that the international community is fundamentally divided. Instead of a coalition of the willing and the determined, the group that will gather Saturday resembles a group of the unwilling, the uncooperative and the disabled. Their motives and agendas diverge even while on the surface they all know that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad must go and that the current situation could harm all their interests. Still, the risks of changing the status quo through using force against the regime is still greater than maintaining it. At the meeting, all will express that concern and try to come up with new ways to support and organize the Syrian opposition and pressure the regime. There may even be a notional agreement on the new Annan plan. But here's what the three main players -- the United States, Russia and Turkey -- are really thinking. United States: The United States is appalled by the violence and would like to do more. But President Obama is really much more focused on domestic issues; he knows there is no will or stomach for new foreign commitments or for risky military adventures in the wake of Afghanistan and Iraq. The United States fears an open-ended military commitment and won't act alone. Nor does it want to see an outcome that leaves elements of the old regime in place. At the same time it has been wary of half-measures: safe zones and arming the Syrian opposition. Washington is too conflicted to lead. The Russians: The fact is Russia's Vladimir Putin knows al-Assad is done, but he isn't going to let the Americans dictate the outcome as they did in Libya. The Russians have seen all their clients -- Saddam Hussein, Moammar Gadhafi and now al-Assad under pressure -- one way or another removed by the Americans. As a great power, Russia is determined to preserve its influence in Syria; it sells arms and uses the Syrian port of Tartus as a key naval facility (Russia's only base outside the former Soviet Union). Putin also doesn't want to see a Saudi-backed Sunni regime in Damascus. He resents the Saudis for supporting Muslims in Chechnya and in the North Caucasus. So he'll push for a solution that preserves some of the old regime and the Alawi minority, and of course a major Russian role in the outcome Russia is too suspicious to help broker. Turkey: The Turks are angry and embarrassed at the Syrian downing of one of their planes, which made them look weak. But if Ankara really wanted to play a leadership role, it could have used this incident as an excuse to push for military action. There's no real stomach among the Turkish public for a war with Syria, however. Turkey also is worried about Syrian support for the Kurdish PKK and its own Alevis minority. The fact is unless the refugee flows from Syria to Turkey get a whole lot worse or the killing reaches new levels, Turkey will be very careful about taking too high a profile on Syria. The Turks are too tentative to lead. And so it goes. The contact group in Geneva may show new resolve, issue tough statements and make contingency plans. It could even endorse Annan's plan for a national unity government. But even if some new measure is announced, the meeting will be marked far more by what's not said than by what is. The Syrian situation is a tragedy, but it's a tragedy nobody is yet prepared to take responsibility for. The costs of bringing down the Assads would be considerable, but the price of rebuilding the new Syria will be greater. The Geneva group should start planning. Sooner or later the al-Assad regime will break. And when it does, the international community must be willing to step in with thousands of peacekeepers on the ground and billions in cash to reconstruct and keep the country running. If it doesn't, an even greater Syrian tragedy will begin to unfold with a heightened level of violence, sectarian killing and perhaps even the fragmentation of the country. The international community may be too divided to bring down the Assads, but it must gear itself up to be united to avert an even greater catastrophe when they fall. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron David Miller.","Aaron Miller: World leaders will meet in Geneva to discuss what to do about Syria conflict .

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- Severely burned 3-year-old Isabella ""Pippi"" Kruger has experienced a level of horror and pain that would test the nerves of a soldier. Her survival alone is miraculous and the procedure being undertaken to save her is a first of its kind in South Africa. Doctors will get a first look at how successful that procedure might be this week, when reconstructive surgeon Dr. Ridwan Mia will carefully peel away layers of bandages around Pippi's tiny torso. Her ordeal began on New Year's Eve. Pippi played outside as her father, Erwin Kruger, prepared a barbeque using a highly flammable liquid gel. As he lit the gel, its container exploded and covered Pippi's small body. She screamed as her skin burned and ""bubbled"" according to her mother, Anice Kruger. The toddler sustained third-degree burns on 80% of her body. Afterward, she was struck with four cardiac arrests, kidney failures, collapsed lungs and multiple infections. Her critical condition eventually stabilized under the care of Mia and others at the Netcare Garden City Hopsital in Johannesburg. But the Krugers were uncomfortable with their options for healing her skin: temporarily use skin from a cadaver or from a pig, or take her small portion of undamaged skin and graft it elsewhere. ""Please don't take the perfect skin, just give me a week to find something else,"" begged Anice of Mia. After days on the Internet and hours reaching out to reconstructive specialists in the United States, Pippi's mother discovered a company in Boston called Genzyme whose specialty is growing layers of human skin by cloning a 2-square-centimeter sample from a patient. The process, called a cultured epidermal autograft, was done more than 100 times in the United States last year, according to Genzyme. However, because the ""new"" skin must be administered within 24 hours of leaving the lab, it hasn't been attempted much farther away -- never before in South Africa -- and it's not cheap. ""The only lab is in the U.S., it is extremely expensive to set up with special technicians and very specialized equipment. It took years to get the technology there, but I think the big problem is cost,"" Genzyme's Dr. Alan Barrett said. He explained that in Pippi's case, the price tag of new skin is $82,000. Only through local medical coverage and generous online donations have the Krugers been able to consider such a modern solution with no guarantee it will work. Even when the skin does make it to the patient within 24 hours -- as it did for Pippi last Monday after a trans-Atlantic flight -- potential risks are many. The grafted skin could tear, and infection is possible from the trace amounts of murine cells, which come from lab rats or mice, used to aid skin growth. In fact, Mia won't know if Pippi's new skin is attaching itself properly until he gently pulls back her bandages on Monday and each following day. For Pippi's mother, the uncertainty is worth the cost and the risk even if it offers nothing more than further hope. ""I can't bear to see her like this again,"" she said. ""I know it's for the best... she will heal in God's perfect time.""","3-year-old Isabella ""Pippi"" Kruger has third-degree burns over 80% of her body .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- The downing of a Turkish jet over the Mediterranean last Friday by a Syrian missile took Turkish-Syrian tensions to a new level. Though the Turkish government did not declare war as some expected, and others feared, it did declare Syria a ""clear and present danger"" and raised its rules of engagement to an alert level. How we came to this point is an interesting story. The 550-mile long border with Syria, Turkey's longest, has often been tense. During the Cold War, Syria was a Soviet ally, Turkey was a NATO member (as it still is) and the border was heavily mined. Moreover, Hafez Assad, the father and predecessor of Syria's current dictator, Bashar al-Assad, supported and hosted the PKK, the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, which has led a guerrilla war against Turkey since the early '80s. (PKK is defined by Turkey and the United States as a terrorist group.) Turkey had come close to waging a war against Syria in 1999 because of this PKK connection. Turkey moves forces to Syrian border amid tensions, official says . However, the relations surprisingly changed for the better in the first decade of the new century. Bashar al-Assad, who replaced his father in 2000, seemed to promise a more open and friendly Syria. In Turkey, the Justice and Development Party of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, which came to power in 2002, initiated a foreign policy of ""zero problems with neighbors."" This led to a fruitful Turkish-Syrian rapprochment: Erdogan and Assad became friends, trade between the two countries was boosted, and borders were opened for visa-free travel. Just two years ago, the two countries looked like the core states of a would-be Middle Eastern Union modeled after the EU. But this honeymoon came to an abrupt end with the Arab Spring. The Erdogan government, whose claims include democratizing Turkey by saving it from the tutelage of the country's overbearing military, intuitively sympathized with and announced support for this democratic wave in the region. Yet while this proved to be a winning game in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, Syria turned out to be a tougher case. Throughout the initial months of the demonstrations in Syria, which began in March 2011, the Turkish government hoped and tried to persuade al-Assad's regime to allow a peaceful transition to democracy. This hope was gradually replaced by frustration, however, and Erdogan soon began to condemn the ""barbarism"" and ""savagery"" of the Syrian regime. The trouble for him, as it usually is, was also personal: As he said in the Turkish Parliament on June 21, Assad had promised him change and reform but proved to be a liar instead. Consequently, Turkey rapidly emerged as one of the boldest supporters of the Syrian opposition, and the Syrian National Council, formed as the dissidents' umbrella group, found a base in Turkey. Meanwhile, at least 15,000 refugees from Syria, both dissidents and their families, were given shelter on the Turkish side of the Syrian border. Moreover, the Free Syrian Army, a rebel group formed by the Syrian soldiers who deserted to the opposition's side, not only operated from Turkey but, according to some reports, were helped with arms and other supplies as well. The Syrian response was to add Turkey to its own version of the axis of evil -- the United States, NATO, Saudi Arabia and in fact much of the rest of the world -- in its official propaganda. Inside Turkey, this engagement in the Syrian crisis has supporters and critics. The supporters are mostly Sunni conservatives who strongly identify with the Syrian opposition, which include the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood. (The massacre of thousands of Sunnis in Hama in 1982 by Hafez Assad had been a tragic memory in the minds of these conservative Turks, who now believe that the Syrian leopard has simply not changed its spots.) Other voices in Turkey, ranging from hardcore secularists to pro-Iranian marginal Islamists, accuse the government for being naively involved in a conflict cooked up by ""Western imperialists."" The plane incident came on top of all this. The downed jet was apparently an unarmed but military aircraft which, according to the Turkish government, was on a peaceful mission to test the NATO radar system based in eastern Turkey. Syrians said the plane violated Syrian airspace and was shot within it. The Turkish government said the plane violated the Syrian airspace ""mistakenly and very briefly"" but was hit by a Syrian missile despite immediately having reverted to international airspace. The plane's two pilots, who apparently fell to the sea, are missing. The Turkish reaction to the incident was outlined by Erdogan in an address in the parliament that came four days after the incident. In a very strident tone against the ""bloody dictator of Syria,"" Erdogan announced that Turkey now sees its southern neighbor as a ""clear and present danger"" and will change its rules of engagement: ""Any military element that approaches the Turkish border from Syria by posing a security risk will be regarded as a threat, and will be treated as a military target."" The very same day, some Turkish tanks on the Syrian border were repositioned, implying that Ankara meant business. Yet almost no one in Turkey seems enthusiastic for war. Many here point out that Turkey's ascendance in the past decade has been thanks to its ""soft power."" That mainly rested on the country's economic boom and democratic reforms, which seemed to present a synthesis of Islam, free-market capitalism and political liberalism. Photos: In Syrian hospital, no escape from war . But should Turkey now consider putting some ""hard power"" on the table, without which it might become ineffective in its region? This is a question that Turks are passionately discussing these days, and the answer seems to matter a lot for the Syrians as well.

"New York (CNN) -- More than 30 years after six-year-old Etan Patz disappeared in New York City on his way to the bus stop, police and federal authorities were tearing apart a Lower Manhattan basement Thursday in search of clues as to what happened to the boy who became the face of missing children in America. Etan Patz disappeared May 25, 1979, a block from his home in the city's SoHo neighborhood. It was the first time he walked to the bus stop by himself. Authorities said both new and old information led them to a carpenter and part-time handyman who met Etan the day before he disappeared and gave the boy a dollar. It was interest in the carpenter that prompted authorities to bring a cadaver dog to a SoHo basement, where Etan apparently encountered the 42-year-old carpenter, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. The dogs picked up the scent of human remains, the source said. Late Thursday, authorities set up a grid in the basement and were using jackhammers to rip up the concrete floor. They also took out part of the back wall of the basement, an unoccupied area beneath what was once a restaurant. ""We're looking for human remains, clothing or other personal effects of Etan Patz,"" New York Police Department spokesman Paul Browne said of the current investigation. ""It's a very painstaking process."" In 2010, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said his office decided to take another look at the decades-old mystery. FBI leads were then culled from that case file, sources said. The investigation, which has often been described as a milestone case that helped draw the plight of missing children into the national consciousness, garnered headlines as authorities splashed the child's image on the sides of milk cartons in the hopes of gathering more information. It's thought to be the first time that step was taken for a missing child. Etan was officially declared dead in 2001 as part of a civil lawsuit filed by his family against a drifter, Jose Antonio Ramos, a convicted child molester acquainted with Etan's babysitter. A judge found Ramos responsible for the death and ordered him to pay the family $2 million. He never paid the money. Though Ramos has been considered a key focus of the probe for years, he has never been charged in the case. He is serving a 20-year sentence in a Pennsylvania prison for molesting another boy and is set to be released later this year. A source said investigators now also want to expand the pool of possible suspects beyond Ramos. The carpenter, now 75, is not in custody, though authorities say they know where he is and are currently in contact with him. CNN is not naming the man because he has not been charged with a crime. Dozens of police and federal agents gathered outside the building on Manhattan's Prince Street on Thursday and are expected to continue their search over the next five days. FBI Special Agent Peter Donald said the bureau's Evidence Recovery Team is at the scene. ""We are cautiously optimistic"" that the search will be helpful,"" FBI Special Agent Tim Flannelly told CNN. Forensic evidence uncovered at the scene will be analyzed at the FBI laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, the sources said. It is not clear whether authorities searched the basement in 1979, though a source said it ""figured into"" the investigation. Authorities have reason to think the new search could lead to the discovery of the boy's remains at that location, though they remain wary after past leads in the case failed to pan out, according to two sources familiar with the probe. ""I hope they find something,"" said resident Sean Sweeney, who says he's lived in the neighborhood since 1976. SoHo, a lower Manhattan neighborhood now known for its boutique shops, art galleries and loft apartments, at the time was considered a grittier locale, where abandoned storefronts dotted the city streets. Sweeney said he remembers the initial investigation into Etan's disappearance when police first knocked on his door in search of clues. ""That's odd, isn't it,"" he said, referring to the fact that 33 years later, police are again in his neighborhood searching for the boy. On the day of his disappearance, Etan's mother, Julie Patz, learned after her son failed to return home from school that he hadn't been in classes that day. She called the school, then called the homes of all his friends. When she found no one who had seen her son, she called police and filed a missing person report. By evening, more than 100 police officers and searchers had gathered with bloodhounds. The search continued for weeks, but no clues to Etan's whereabouts were found. The boy's disappearance was thought to raise awareness of child abductions and led to new ways to search for missing children. President Ronald Reagan named May 25, the day Etan went missing, National Missing Children's Day.

"(CNN)  -- A controversial extra-time goal by William Gallas saw France reach the World Cup finals after a 1-1 home draw against the Republic of Ireland in Paris on Wednesday night. France were trailing 1-0 in the second leg, with the scores tied 1-1 on aggregate, when Arsenal central defender Gallas forced the ball home for the decisive goal. But TV replays showed that his former club teammate Thierry Henry had clearly handled the ball twice before passing to him to head home. Irish goalkeeper Shay Given frantically gestured to the referee and Damien Duff was booked for his protests, but the goal stood and Raymond Domenech's men eventually went through after surviving late pressure in the Stade de France. Robbie Keane had given the Republic a deserved first half lead as he scored after a fine cutback by Duff. The pair both had chances in the second half to put the game out of France's reach, but home keeper Hugo Lloris blocked Duff's effort after he was clean through and forced Tottenham star Keane wide from a similar position. Cristiano Ronaldo will be going to World Cup after his Portugal side won 1-0 in Bosnia-Herzegovina to claim it 2-0 on aggregate in their European playoff match in Zenica. Real Madrid star Ronaldo sat out both legs of the decider through injury, but despite his absence Portugal qualified for the World Cup for the third time in a row. Raul Meireles' second-half goal in the second leg gave them a comfortable victory in a tie deemed awkward after a slender victory in the first leg secured though a goal by Bruno Alves. A pass from Nan found Meireles, whose low shot found the net and sent the Portuguese, who reached the semifinals in 2006, through. Slovenia upset Russia to qualify for the World Cup finals for only the second time with a 1-0 home win in Maribor. Slovenia trailed 2-1 from the first leg and go through on the away goals rule with the aggregate score tied 2-2. Striker Zlatko Dedic, who plays for Bochum in the Bundesliga, scored on the stroke of halftime. He reacted first to a Valter Birsa cross from the right to grab the crucial goal. Guus Hiddink's men suffered a further setback when substitute striker Alexander Kerzhakov was shown the red card in the 68th minute. Andrei Arshavin set up substitute Pavel Pogrebnyak for a late chance as Russia forced for an equalizer which would have put them through, but Dedic should have scored a  second for Slovenia late on. 2004 European champions Greece are also through as they beat Ukraine 1-0 in Donetsk with Dimitrios Salpigidis scoring the only goal for the visitors on the half hour mark. The Panathinaikos striker beat the offside trap after a superb pass from Celtic's Georgios Samaras and slotted home. The teams played out a 0-0 draw on Saturday in the first leg in Athens. Ukraine pressed desperately for an equalizer in the second half but to no avail.","France through after controversial equalizer against Ireland in Stade de France .

"(CNN) -- Brazilian legend Pele once called soccer the ""beautiful game"" and at its best it showcases the very pinnacle of human endeavor as nations and communities are united in the common goal of supporting their teams and heroes. But on the flip side, some of the worst of aspects of human behavior are on show for all to see and then subjected to immense media scrutiny to highlight the fallibility of our sporting icons. So in celebration of the ""dark side"" CNN has compiled its First XI of soccer villains of the last decade. Three of them, Zinedine Zidane, Thierry Henry and Luis Figo, are worthy members of our nominated XI of soccer heroes, which just shows that triumph and disaster are twin imposters. See our First XI of soccer heroes. Do you agree? Perhaps they can be excused because of the pressure of the modern game, while the rewards for victory or transferring to a rival club -- in Figo's case one of the great ""betrayals"" of all time -- are riches beyond ordinary fans' dreams. Here is the Fanzone select eleven of Noughties soccer villains -- let Fanzone know what you think by adding your comment at the bottom of this page. 1. Zinedine Zidane: Midfield supremo Zidane features at the very top of our football heroes of the decade but he also heads the list of villains for his infamous headbutt on Italy's Marco Materazzi in extra time of the 2006 World Cup final. It was his final match and after he was sent off France lost the penalty shootout. A sorry end to a glittering career at club and international level. 2. Thierry Henry:  Henry went into France's World Cup qualifying playoff against Ireland as one of the most respected footballers on the planet but by the end of the tie his reputation was in tatters. A deliberate handball set up the winning goal for France and sparked a worldwide debate on sporting ethics. Henry's reputation has been tainted and he can expect a less-than-warm reception at South Africa 2010. 3. Rivaldo: Brazil midfielder Rivaldo was the driving force of their 2002 World Cup team with his much-admired cultured midfield play. Less admired was his blatant dive to feign injury at a critical stage of a group match against Turkey. Hakan Unsal was sent off as Brazil won the match and eventually went on to lift the trophy. Rivaldo's play acting was rightly condemned and forever replayed as the worst example of its kind. 4. Luis Figo: Portuguese international Figo was a hero with Barcelona's fanatical fans during his five years with the Catalan giants, but when he defected to hated rivals Real Madrid for a world record fee in 2000 their vitriol was unmatched. In a derby match two years later the severed head of a pig was even thrown onto the pitch in his direction. He was never forgiven and spent the final years of career with Inter Milan in Serie A. 5. Roy Keane: Manchester United hardman Keane felled Alfe-Inge Haaland of neighbors City in a 2001 derby in the final act of a feud dating back four years. The outspoken Irishman, who even walked out on his country's 2002 World Cup bid, later admitted he had deliberately ""hurt"" Haaland in revenge for an earlier incident. He received a lengthy ban but showed little remorse. 6. Adrian Mutu: Star striker Mutu was promptly sacked by Chelsea when he gave a positive test for cocaine and many thought that was the end of the matter. Not so. The Premier League club promptly successfully sued the Romanian international for breach of contract for a record $25 million. Two legal appeals, with another in the pipeline, have so far failed, leaving Mutu heavily out of pocket for a few moments of indiscretion. 7. Robert Hoyzer: German referee Hoyzer is another unworthy member of our hall of shame and rightly so after the former amateur player with Hertha Berlin admitted to working in tandem with an international betting ring to fix games, including a German Cup match involving SV Hamburg. Hoyzer was jailed for over two years and his revelations left a stain on Bundesliga football. 8. Joey Barton: Newcastle's Barton appeared to have the world at his feet when he made an appearance for England, but there was a darker side to the combative midfielder with reports of fights with fellow players and even fans. It came to a head in January 2008 when Barton was jailed for six months for what the judge said was a ""cowardly"" assault in his native Liverpool. 9. Zheng Zhi: Chinese captain Zheng Zhi has proved a popular performer in English fooball, but his contributions elsewhere are more questionable. He received a six-month ban from the AFC Champions League for spitting at a match official and during the 2006 World Cup his tackle left France's Djibril Cisse with a broken leg. 10. Rene Higuita: The former Colombian international goalkeeper became famous for his ""Scorpion Kick"" clearance against England but in recent years he has cut a more controversial figure and was banned from Ecuadorean club football after testing positive for cocaine. He is good friends with the final member of our XI, Diego Maradona. 11. Diego Maradona: By the standards of the 90s, this was a quiet decade for the Argentine soccer legend and the world held its collective breath as medical problems, almost certainly linked to his colorful past, caught up with him. Now the Argentina national coach, he took them to the World Cup finals with a last-gasp qualification and then promptly spoilt it all by earning a temporary worldwide ban from FIFA for abusing reporters after the crucial game.","Fanzone reflects on some of the most controversial and unsavory incidents of the last decade .

"(CNN) -- PlayStation Network users are still waiting for an extra life. Five days after a hacker invaded Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation Network resulting in a lengthy outage, the video game giant has yet to offer a comprehensive explanation. PlayStation internet services went offline on Wednesday and have remained down. In several public statements, with one as recent as Monday, Sony has said the persistent downtime was due to an ""external intrusion,"" but has not provided a target date for when services will return. Sony previously said it was rebuilding its framework to ensure proper security measures are put in place. ""Unfortunately, I don't have an update or timeframe to share at this point in time,"" PlayStation spokesman Patrick Seybold said in a statement on Monday. ""As we previously noted, this is a time intensive process, and we're working to get them back online quickly."" The PlayStation Network is a free utility that lets gamers communicate and play with each other, as well as download games and movies. Sony also offers subscription programs called PlayStation Plus, which provides access to exclusive games, and Qriocity, which offers on-demand music and movies over the internet. Those services also remain unavailable. A Sony spokesman in Tokyo, where the company is headquartered, said investigations haven't uncovered whether the intruders gained access to personal information or credit card numbers, according to a report from technology news service IDG. The spokesman reportedly said Sony would contact those affected if investigators discover that info was leaked. CNN's request for comment was not returned by a Sony spokeswoman. The network failure was apparently more severe than originally thought. Sony released a statement on Thursday saying, ""It may be a full day or two before we're able to get the service completely back up and running."" Gamers are livid. The timing is especially frustrating because it comes on the heels of three blockbuster launches for the PlayStation 3. Sony's ""SOCOM 4"" is the latest in a third-person shooter series about Navy SEAL operatives, which heavily promotes its online-play component. The new ""Mortal Kombat"" game is also supposed to let gamers play online. ""Portal 2,"" the critically acclaimed shooter-puzzle game, debuted alongside a much-anticipated game-download service called Steam. All these launched in the United States on Tuesday, one day before the outage.","The PlayStation Network has been offline for five days .

"(CNN) -- Chengdu police are investigating the death of a Foxconn employee, whose body was found outside his residence earlier this week. The man, whose surname is Xi, fell to his death, according to Chengdu authorities. The death is being reported by Reuters and other news agencies as a suicide, which CNN cannot independently confirm. ""We were informed by local law enforcement authorities in the city of Chengdu that [Wednesday] afternoon, a 23 year-old male Foxconn employee was found dead outside his off-campus residence in Chengdu,"" Foxconn Technology Group said in a statement. ""Chengdu law enforcement authorities are conducting a thorough investigation into this matter and Foxconn is cooperating with that process. We have extended our condolences to the family of this employee and we are working with the Foxconn Labor Union and others to provide the family with the support they need at this very sad time."" Apple and Foxconn -- a major manufacturer of iPhones and iPads -- agreed to improve labor conditions at the Chinese plants earlier this year. Foxconn, a subsidiary of Taiwan-based electronics supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. -- which also makes electronic goods for Sony, Microsoft, Nokia and other household brands -- came under intense scrutiny by CNN and other media outlets in 2010 after a series of suicides by workers at its Chinese plants raised questions about living and working conditions. Though Foxconn maintains its workers are treated well, Chairman Terry Gou made an unprecedented public apology in the wake of the suicides. Foxconn then released a statement saying it had introduced counselors, started a 24-hour phone counseling service and opened a stress room where workers can take out their frustration on mannequins with bats. Apple joined the Fair Labor Association earlier this year -- the first technology company to do so -- and authorized the group to audit Foxconn operations. A March 29 report found several violations, especially regarding excessive work hours of more than 60 hours a week. Apple and Foxconn have pledged to reduce working hours.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- A racially charged demonstration against the Israeli government's handling of immigration from Africa turned violent Wednesday night as protesters attacked foreign workers, shattered car windows and vandalized a shop owned by a Sudanese migrant. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said 17 men were arrested in the event and brought to a Tel Aviv court Thursday morning. They are charged with attacking residents and Israeli police and damaging property. The demonstrators carried signs with the slogans ""Infiltrators get out of our houses"" and ""Tel Aviv -- a refugee camp."" They were accompanied by three members of the Knesset, Israel's parliament. Miri Regev, a Knesset member from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party, referred to illegal immigrants as ""a cancer in our society"" and promised to do anything possible to send them back to their home countries. But Netanyahu denounced the attacks in a special statement Thursday. ""The problem of infiltrators must be resolved, and we will resolve it,"" he said. ""We will complete the construction of the security fence in several months and soon will start the process of sending the migrants back to their home countries. ""Yet, I would like to stress that the expressions and acts that we have viewed last night are unacceptable,"" he continued. ""We will solve the problem and will do so responsibly."" And Knesset speaker Reuven Rivlin criticized the members who took part in the march, saying politicians must help restrain public anger and come up with solutions rather than fan racially-charged flames. ""We must not be dragged into incitement and the language used by anti-Semites against Jewish people,"" Rivlin said. The migrants and security problems in the Sinai Peninsula has prompted Israel to step up construction of a steel fence that will run the 260-kilometer (162-mile) border with Egypt. An estimated 60,000 Africans have crossed illegally into Israel thorough its southern border with Egypt in recent years -- about 700 a week, according to Israeli police. Tensions between local residents of Tel Aviv's working class neighborhoods and illegal African immigrants have seen new highs this month following a couple of highly publicized cases in which Sudanese migrants were arrested on charges of sexual assault against young Israeli women. Sigal Rosen, a spokeswoman for a hotline for migrant workers, says she can't understand the demonstrators' actions -- ""but I certainly understand their hysteria."" ""Objectively, they are right,"" Rosen said. ""The load on the infrastructures is intolerable, and the city does nothing to improve their condition."" But Rosen blames a government that refuses to legalize their status and allow them to work freely across the country. ""The only way to prevent these immigrants from coming here is by physically shooting at them as they cross the border, as is done by the Egyptians,"" she said. ""It is clear to me that Israel would not do such a thing and therefore nothing would prevent them from continuing to arrive. Even imprisonment is better than what they experience in their home country.""","Protesters smashed windows and attacked foreign workers during the protest .

"(CNN) -- Does ""Fifty Shades of Grey's"" love affair between a dominant man and vulnerable young woman feel a tad bit familiar? It might if you're a tried and true fan of the ""Twilight"" series. Welcome to the world of fan fiction, where fans tweak or add to existing series, novels and characters -- oftentimes with a steamy twist. By now you've probably heard about the best-selling e-book ""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" which was released in paperback Tuesday and will soon come to life on the big screen. The novel has readers, primarily grown women, clutching their e-readers under the covers, among other places. ""Fifty Shades"" has been such a hit that Universal Pictures and Focus Features reportedly shelled out $5 million for the rights to E L James' titillating trilogy, which many sites are referring to as ""mommy porn."" And while the early ""Twilight"" novels were decidedly chaste (at first, anyway), writers of fan fiction will tell you there's a huge desire for erotic novels. Fan fiction grew popular in the 1960s thanks to ""Star Trek"" as fans developed their own story lines to swap with other devotees. And the genre has flourished, allowing fans to adapt beloved stories and tailor existing literature to fit their own preferences, said Francesca Coppa, an English professor at Muhlenberg College and founding board member of the Organization for Transformative Works. That's exactly what James did with ""Fifty Shades,"" which drew inspiration from the insanely popular series by Stephenie Meyer. Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele are loosely based on ""Twilight's"" Edward and Bella. 'Mommy porn' novel has retro message . James, a TV executive, wife and mother based in London, took a young adult novel and spiced it up, said Sarah Weir, a contributing editor at Yahoo! Shine. Weir said that since a lot of young adult novels have such broad fan bases now, the success of ""Fifty Shades"" will probably be replicated more and more. As both a writer and a reader, Coppa said she appreciates the freedom fan fiction offers. ""Typically I'm happier to write stories that have sex in them than stories that have violence in them,"" she said. ""I like the custom-madeness of it. It's not just the same story with sex in it. But, often, the characters have changed in many ways."" ""Star Trek"" fans familiar with ""Kirk/Spock"" fan fiction, in which the two male characters engage in a homoerotic relationship, can attest. ""A lot of erotic (fan fiction) is actually queer,"" Coppa said. ""A lot of people were writing gay and lesbian scenes at a time when there wasn't much out there."" It made sense to write these scenes around ""Star Trek,"" she said, which featured a ""very consciously diverse group of people. ... The one conspicuous absence was gays and lesbians. Fans rewrote those stories to put queer people at the table."" Coppa added, ""The wonderful thing about fandom is that you realize you're not alone."" Erotic novel 'Fifty Shades of Grey' goes viral ... for good reason . So many mainstream stories now are about women who have children and balance exciting careers. But if the buzz surrounding ""Fifty Shades"" is any indication, there are women out there who just want to feel like desired, sexual subjects, Coppa said. James' novel puts them there, providing an outlet for a sort of creativity that hasn't been considered mainstream. Sexual content is often shunned by the publishing world, said Los Angeles Times staff writer Carolyn Kellogg. ""People have been really turned on by this book. It's so interesting that something considered dirty and second-rate is being embraced by the industry."" However, not all fan fiction is erotic. Erotic book gains popularity in suburbs . ""Sometimes fan fiction is about seeing more of a character,"" Coppa said. ""Saying, I want to see her in different environments, or see her in a different time. ... That has a happened a lot with Sherlock Holmes, whether he's in the 1890s or ... contemporary London."" But not all authors are on board with fan fiction. ""The Wolf Gift"" author Anne Rice wrote about the genre on her website: ""I do not allow fan fiction. The characters are copyrighted. It upsets me terribly to even think about fan fiction with my characters. I advise my readers to write your own original stories with your own characters. It is absolutely essential that you respect my wishes."" However, other writers have embraced it, allowing such stories to expand the demographic of their original work. HLN: 10 things to know about 'Fifty Shades of Grey' Take Pottermore for example. J.K. Rowling's website is a space for Harry Potter fans who don't want those adventures to end. ""With Pottermore, (Rowling) has said, 'Yes, you can come in and tell those stories the way you want to,"" Kellogg said. ""I'm not sure there will be a lot of other 'Fifty Shades of Grey,' but the way people deal with fan fiction may be shifting in a real and significant way.""","Best-selling e-book ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is now out in paperback .

"(CNN) -- They say a week is a long time in politics. In today's febrile world of finance, it's a lifetime. Europe's leaders may soon learn that lesson the hard way if they continue to dodge the question on everyone's lips: What to do if Greece is pushed out of the eurozone? No stranger to unfortunate soubriquets herself, Angela Merkel has repeatedly refused to address the matter of a Greek exit -- or ""Grexit,"" as it has been dubbed. This week, she cited ""political correctness"" as her logic for skirting the issue. Either way, the bosses of some of the eurozone's biggest companies have decided they can't afford the luxury of being caught short. With a staff of more than 90,000 to consider and operations in more than 80 countries to oversee, Shell CEO Peter Voser has admitted that he must plan for what the markets say is an increasingly plausible outcome to a tragedy well into its third year. Speaking on CNN's ""World Business Today,"" Voser said that ""one obviously has made provisions"" at this stage. ""I still see it as a low likelihood scenario, but we have done our work over the last few months to prepare ourselves,"" he said. As high as the stakes are for one of the world's biggest oil companies, the stakes for heads of government, like Merkel, are even higher. About 320 million people use the euro daily, and as the German chancellor knows, the integrity of the union is crucial for confidence in its economy -- an economy that just flatlined in the first quarter. This invites the question: If it's so obvious to business leaders, why do Europe's elected leaders still shy away from the subject? Charles Proctor, partner at the law firm Edwards Wildman, thinks he knows the answer. Having spent the past two years pondering the possibility of a eurozone member dropping out, Proctor says the existing legal framework doesn't offer a formal escape route. The European Union treaty does give Greece the extreme option of backing out of the EU but not out of its monetary system in itself. This means any negotiations would have to be kept quiet. ""One assumes that a certain amount of contingency work has been done,"" Proctor said, ""just that it has been kept secret against the political backdrop that the eurozone must hold together."" Greeks set election date amid possibility of bank panic . That view is echoed by former EU Commissioner and one-time UK Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson. ""I think it would be better to discuss this behind closed doors. Otherwise, it would create yet more uncertainty,"" he said. ""In theory you might say: 'Its face doesn't fit, it's not performing in the way that others need it to do, its politics are falling apart, its people are miserable ... so why not let it go out?' But the consequences of that would shake Greece for many, many years to come."" Since Greece went to the polls May 6, as many as six rate-setters from the European Central Bank have openly debated the pros and cons of a common currency minus one troublesome member. The word ""Grexit"" has made the front page of tabloids and broadsheets in non-eurozone nations like Britain for two straight days. But bookmaker Paddy Power has cut the odds it is offering on Greece being the first out of the eurozone to 1-in-10 from 1-in-8. Lex van Dam, co-founder of Hampstead Capital, says it's a ""really tough call."" He says Greece's chances of keeping the euro are 50-50 and hinge less on political goodwill than financial support from the European Central Bank. ""Saving Greece means throwing good money after bad, but not saving Greece means possible huge and fatal capital outflows from the periphery as well,"" he said. If that's the case, van Dam said, the losses incurred by the central bank could threaten the very institutions set up to safeguard the euro. Which means keeping Greece inside the eurozone could mean a ""no euros zone"" for its neighbors further down the line. So can the tide be turned? Proctor reckons the dam has burst. ""For many years it used to be taboo, but so many people are talking about it, it's not a possibility that can be ignored anymore,"" he said. Either way, lawyers, hedge fund managers and chief executives are discussing the euro area's monetary fate, even if those in charge of its member nations are not.","The eurozone's biggest companies make contingency plans for Greece's exit .
""I still see it as a low likelihood scenario, but we have done our work,"" Shell's CEO says .

"(CNN) -- Mitt Romney spoke this weekend to the students at Liberty University, a hotbed of conservative studies,and he has been forced to think about his ties to the right. He is facing a difficult challenge in determining what his relationship should be with the tea party Republicans who helped revitalize the GOP after the doldrums of 2008. Although there are more conservative Republicans grudgingly endorsing Romney and polls show that more tea party activists are coming to accept Romney as their candidate, there is strong evidence that there remains a great deal of distrust, which could dampen enthusiasm on the campaign trail and create tensions if mishandled. According to Congressional Quarterly, Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert told reporters, ""I am not as excited as I am desperate"" to elect someone other than Obama. Any misstep could cost Romney the election. If Romney is seen as too close to the tea party, he could easily undercut his ability to win independent votes in the swing states that will determine the outcome of the election. If Romney distances himself too much from the right wing of the party, he might dampen the enthusiasm that he needs to organize, to raise money and to make certain that people come out on Election Day in what promises to be a close election. The challenge facing Romney is not new to Republican candidates. Indeed, every Republican who has won office since the middle of the 20th century has confronted this dilemma. Each successful candidate has handled the challenge in a different way. One model has been for candidates to completely distance themselves from the right and to instead allow the vice presidential candidate to focus on appealing to the base, to act as an ""attack dog."" This is what the military hero Dwight Eisenhower did in 1952 when he avoided associating with the McCarthyite wing of the party that was ramping up Cold War rhetoric. Instead, Gen. Eisenhower let Richard Nixon do the dirty work, calling Democratic candidate Adlai Stevenson ""Adlai the Appeaser"" and tagging liberal Democrats as being a step away from communism. The Eisenhower model would be difficult for Mitt Romney to follow. In the modern media age, especially after the Sarah Palin fiasco, there will be immense attention on whoever runs with Romney. If he selects a right-wing nominee, the kind of scrutiny he or she will receive could easily overshadow Romney's campaign and any effort he hopes to make to appeal the center. The second model is Barry Goldwater's full embrace of extremism in 1964. Taking on President Lyndon Johnson, Goldwater ran as a true conservative who espoused right-wing values and had no interest in compromise. Goldwater used bold rhetoric, taking on programs like Social Security and the Tennessee Valley Authority, demanding radical cuts in government. When liberal Republican Nelson Rockefeller spoke at the Republican convention, the delegates booed and jeered. When Goldwater spoke, defending extremism, they burst out in applause. Goldwater doubled down with his vice presidential running mate, New York Rep. William Miller, who further solidified Goldwater's image as the candidate who was far to the right. This model would certainly not work for Romney, who would come off as disingenuous. Romney has spent too much time positioning himself as a pragmatist and moderate to make this kind of move. Trying to pull a Goldwater would only play into the accusations that he is a candidate without a core. The third option is the George H.W. Bush model. In 1991, Bush, who was not at all comfortable with the right wing of the party and never got the ""vision thing,"" ran a slash and burn campaign in 1988 that focused on devastating the record of Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. Without fully embracing conservative ideals, Bush's campaign revolved around the depiction of his opponent as unpatriotic, as an extreme liberal and as someone not fit to be in office. While the strategy worked for Bush, it could be insufficient for Romney, who faces a much tougher opponent in President Obama, whose personal favorability ratings remain high and who has much stronger backing from his own party. The president won't be as easy to tear down. If Romney simply goes negative as a way to avoid dealing with the right wing of his party, his campaign could fail. The final model is the one used by Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. Each of these candidates did send clear signals to the right that they would be an integral part of the coalition. None of these candidates fully distanced themselves from right-wing forces, yet their campaigns focused on broader themes that were attractive to a much bigger part of the population. Nixon spoke of law and order in 1968, Reagan talked about anti-communism and private markets in 1980, while Bush emphasized ""compassionate conservatism"" in 2000. This final strategy is the best path available to Romney, because it will allow him to send signals to the right that he understands what they are about and will be part of their coalition, while offering themes that can win over the rest of the GOP and perhaps even disaffected Democrats. The problem is that thus far Romney has struggled to find those themes. Thus far he has focused mostly on castigating President Obama. In the next few months leading into the Republican convention, he will have to lay out one or two broad themes that can extend his reach well beyond the right without alienating them. This is a difficult task and one that has been challenging to many Republicans. But doing so will be essential to handling the tea party Republicans, who pose a massive challenge to his campaign. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Romney faces a big challenge in trying to win enthusiastic tea party support .

"(CNN) -- Lebanon has released Chadi Mawlawi, an activist who was helping Syrian refugees and whose arrest sparked fighting in Lebanon. The military investigating judge approved Mawlawi's release on bail, the Lebanese state-run news agency NNA reported Tuesday. Fighting has been under way in parts of Lebanon, including suburbs of Tripoli, in what analysts describe as an extension of the unrest in neighboring Syria. Mawlawi, an Islamist activist, was supporting Syrian rebels and trying to help refugees in Lebanon by providing shelter and food when he was arrested, one of his cousins said. Lebanon accused Mawlawi of being an operative in an al Qaeda-inspired group -- something his relatives deny. Nadim Shehadi, associate fellow of the Middle East and North Africa program at the London think tank Chatham House, said Lebanon is seeking neutrality and wants to avoid spillover from the Syrian violence. But ""that's an impossible objective to attain because if you help the refugees, you're supporting the revolution, and if you don't help the revolution, you're supporting the regime."" Violence in Lebanon has spread in recent days. Two clerics opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad were killed Monday at a military checkpoint in northern Lebanon. The deaths sparked clashes between rival political parties -- one supporting al-Assad and the other opposing him -- that left two other people dead and 18 wounded in Beirut, according to the state-run news agency. Derek Plumbly, the United Nations' special coordinator for Lebanon, called for an end to the violence and said the incidents must be ""thoroughly investigated.""

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- A priest who assisted Monsignor William Lynn investigate clergy sex abuse claims testified Tuesday that it was not the archdiocese's policy to contact law enforcement or other victims of abuse. ""Our legal counsel said there was not a requirement to report,"" Monsignor Michael McCulken told jurors. The defense called its first three witnesses Tuesday in the child sexual abuse and conspiracy trial of two Philadelphia priests, after the prosecution rested last week. On trial are the Rev. James Brennan, who is accused of the attempted rape of a 14-year-old, and Monsignor William Lynn, who is accused of knowingly allowing dangerous priests to continue in the ministry in roles in which they had access to children. Lynn is the first high-ranking church figure charged with child endangerment for allegedly shuffling predator priests from parish to parish. Defrocked priest Edward Avery was due to also go on trial with Brennan and Lynn, but pleaded guilty in March to involuntary sexual deviate sexual intercourse after admitting to sexually assaulting a 10-year-old altar boy during the 1998-1999 school year at St. Jerome Parish. Lynn, who was the secretary for clergy under former Philadelphia Archbishop Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, is accused of knowingly allowing Avery and Brennan access to children despite allegations of sexual abuse of minors. From 1992 until 2004, Lynn was responsible for investigating reports that priests had sexually abused children. Both Brennan and Lynn have pleaded not guilty. Also taking the witness stand was Monsignor William Beisel, who was Lynn's assistant from 1993-1994. Beisel and Lynn drafted an infamous list of 35 priests suspected of sexually abusing children . Beisel told jurors that he and Lynn reviewed the files of priests accused of sexual misconduct to draft the list. ""We did this after 5 o'clock. It seemed like forever, but took about two weeks,"" he said. ""I was happy the project was over."" The list was later found inside a locked safe that was drilled open in 2006. Still, the list of 35 Catholic priests accused or found guilty of sexual misconduct, plus a memo ordering the shredding of the list of priests plus other personnel documents, did not come to light until February. Although Beisel remembered penning the list, he confirmed for jurors that he told the grand jury in 2004, ""I don't recall seeing a priest that was guilty of sexual misconduct."" Included on the list was defrocked priest Avery, categorized as ""guilty of sexual misconduct with a minor."" Avery, 69, was sentenced to two-and-a-half to five years in prison after his guilty plea. ""Are you trying to help your friend?"" Assistant District Attorney Patrick Blessington asked Beisel. ""Am I trying to help my friend? No. I'm trying to help get to the truth,"" Beisel said, adding that he left his position as Lynn's assistant because he ""did not like the job."" Two separate grand jury reports accused the archdiocese of failing to investigate claims of sexual abuse of children by priests. A 2011 report led the Philadelphia district attorney's office to criminally charge four Philadelphia priests and a parochial school teacher with raping and assaulting boys in their care, while Lynn was accused of allowing the abusive priests to have access to children. On May 4, Archbishop Charles J. Chaput announced resolutions to eight of the 26 cases of priests on administrative leave as a result of the February 2011 grand jury report. Yet, the archdiocese announced Sunday it ousted two priests -- not connected to those cases -- due to allegations of sexual abuse of minors. The trial represents the first time that U.S. prosecutors have charged not just the priests who allegedly committed the abuses, but an official who stands accused of failing to stop the assaults. Lynn had been responsible from 1992 until 2004 for investigating reports that priests had sexually abused children. A gag order barring all parties involved in the criminal case from talking to the media imposed by a Philadelphia judge remains in effect.","""Our legal counsel said there was not a requirement to report,"" priest tells jurors .

"(CNN) -- Ten years ago, Blair and Estelle Hunt entered the wine business with nothing more than a bare plot of land. Blair and Estelle Hunt with their wine awards. Both were approaching 60 and, while they were familiar with what made a good bottle of red, they had no idea how to make it. That didn't stop them. This year, industry experts judged their 2005 Bald Hills pinot noir the best red wine in the world. It beat 4,760 other entries to take the Champion Red award in the International Wine Challenge, the world's biggest blind tasting. And, it was the first time a vineyard outside France took Decanter magazine's top prize for best pinot noir over £10. ""We were amazed,"" said Blair Hunt. ""It's impeccable timing for a small vineyard in the face of such extensive competition."" Success has come rather suddenly for Blair and Estelle. After 45 years of marriage, three children and varied careers in management, real estate and teaching, they had been looking to wind down. They sold their house in Sydney and moved to rural New Zealand to search for something to keep them occupied in later life. ""I'm really wary about the word retirement,"" Blair says. ""I don't quite understand it, although the reality is that it is our income so you could say it's our retirement."" They had been considering entering the dairy industry, but as they criss-crossed the country searching for a place to settle down, the stunning landscape of Central Otago in New Zealand's South Island won them over. ""Just the sheer beauty of the place led us to say right let's give it a go,"" says Blair Hunt. As it turns out, Bannockburn, one hour outside Queenstown, was an ideal place to grow grapes. ""We knew that from research on record we had good soil types and in relative proximity we could see grapes growing. The plot was just a bare 11 hectares, or 27 acres. It had a nice slope to the north, north-west, so you've got that sun bearing down on it all of the day. Everything seemed to be lined up and, as it turns out, it has been."" They planted their first vines in 1997. Back then it was a part-time job. Every weekend they'd drive up into the hills from their home in Balclutha, South Otago to tend their vines. They built a house on the site and moved there in 2001. Even then it didn't demand their full attention. Until June, Blair Hunt was working full-time as the Chief Executive of the local hospital. ""Not bad for an old fella,"" he laughs. He is 69. Estelle, 68, shares his passion for a day's hard work washed down with a glass of fine wine each night. ""Some people just are energetic and love what they're doing. That's a huge help,"" she says. ""We're avid learners really. We used to spend a lot more time in the vineyard but as time went by we discovered that there was more and more paperwork to be done."" ""Blair still loves to get out and do the mowing up and down the rows and have a good look to see what's actually going on out there. From time to time we've both got out and done some picking."" Blair is quick to correct the suggestion that their success is anything other than the result of hard work by a dedicated viticulturalist and his team, as well as an expert winemaker. Renowned New Zealand winemaker Grant Taylor started working with them before the first grapes were picked. He has his own label and is very selective about to whom he lends his expertise. ""I have worked with many, many grape growers in 28 years of winemaking. I never try to push my thoughts on them because usually they will cost the grower money, but simply say what I think and let them make the decision,"" he says. ""Blair and Estelle have listened, then acted. They have been fine tuning their viticulture, I have been fine tuning the winemaking, and the vines have been getting older and doing their job better. But underneath it all is a shared philosophy, which is to do everything in the vineyard and winemaking to make the best wine possible. There are no shortcuts aimed at saving money."" Pinot noir grapes are notoriously difficult to nurture. They're thin-skinned, susceptible to rot and are really only successfully grown in three locations: Burgundy in France, Oregon in the U.S., and New Zealand's Central Otago region. There, growers go to great lengths to ward off winter frosts in the cold mountain ranges. Some fly helicopters low over the vines to stir up the icy air. At Bald Hills, there are two wind-machines on standby if the temperature starts to plummet. The rest of the season, the vines are pruned and tended by hand, the grapes individually picked. Strangely, the vineyard's ""spare no expense"" philosophy hasn't produced a hideously expensive wine. Visitors to the cellar door can buy a bottle for 38 New Zealand dollars, or less than U.S.$30. And, despite the scarcity of the product -- there are only 100 ""uncommitted"" cases left -- the Hunts have not put up the price -- yet. ""We're contemplating that, and the consequences of doing that in the longer term. At the end of the day you're talking about long term viability and sustainability rather than short-term gains,"" Blair says. This couple, although approaching 70, is in it for the long haul. The judges called their 2005 pinot noir well integrated, harmonious and impeccably balanced. The same might be said about them.

"London (CNN) -- Like many other 18-year-olds, Nina Siren is on the point of graduating from high school. Unlike her peers, she has spent more than half her short life fighting to prevent the destruction of her home, culture and indigenous community in the interests of oil exploration. Zimbabwean women's rights activist Jenni Williams, 50, has been arrested 43 times in the course of peaceful protest activities and now faces criminal charges she says are trumped up by the authorities. Omar Assil, who took part in protests in Damascus last year before leaving his homeland for the UK, now works with other young Syrians to give nonviolent support for the pro-democracy movement. They are just three of the protesters who through their actions have helped make 2011 a ""truly tumultuous year,"" in the words of Amnesty International's 50th annual report on the state of global human rights, released Thursday. The dramatic scenes of the Arab Spring have kept protesters in the Middle East and North Africa in the headlines, especially as voters in Egypt take part in a landmark presidential election this week. But Amnesty also lauds the often unseen efforts of demonstrators elsewhere in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas last year. At the same time, the rights group is scathing in its criticism of a ""failure of leadership"" at local and international level, saying those in power have left protest movements to fend for themselves as they take on tyranny and injustice. ""Failed leadership has gone global in the last year, with politicians responding to protests with brutality or indifference,"" said Salil Shetty, Amnesty International Secretary General, launching the report in London. ""Governments must show legitimate leadership and reject injustice by protecting the powerless and restraining the powerful. It is time to put people before corporations and rights before profits."" Shetty singled out the U.N. Security Council for its failure to act effectively in both Syria and Sri Lanka, saying it left the body seeming ""tired, out of step and increasingly unfit for purpose."" ""In the last year it has all too often become clear that opportunistic alliances and financial interests have trumped human rights as global powers jockey for influence in the Middle East and North Africa,"" said Shetty. ""The language of human rights is adopted when it serves political or corporate agendas, and shelved when inconvenient or standing in the way of profit."" Forced to move from a remote corner of the Ecuadorian Amazon to Sweden four years ago amid death threats following her community's opposition to the planned oil project, Nina Siren has been part of the fight to preserve the way of life of the indigenous Kichwa people of Sarayaku since she was 7 or 8 years old. That was when she heard a representative of the oil company that wants to develop their community's pristine land -- a project Amnesty says is backed by the government -- offer just $60,000 in return, or roughly $15 per person. ""I was just a child but I understood that I would never give up my land,"" Siren said. ""I wanted to ask him why he was trying to give me $15 to destroy my land and drive me out of there. I think that was the first moment when I realized that this was going to be a very long struggle."" For four years after they fled to Sweden, it was too dangerous for the family to return to their homeland. ""To know we couldn't go back to see my family, my village -- it was horrible, horrible,"" said Siren, who is now able to travel home once or twice a year. But despite the obstacles they have faced, Siren and her mother, Noemi Gualinga, have helped take their community's decade-long battle all the way to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in Costa Rica. Now they are anxiously awaiting its judgment, expected in the coming months. That verdict could impact on thousands of indigenous communities in Ecuador and beyond who want their governments to adhere to international human rights law that requires them to consult with indigenous peoples before giving developments on their land the go-ahead. Gualinga said the arrival of oil companies on their land would have meant ""the end of our culture and our way of life."" The indigenous community has used the Internet to get its message out to the international community, Siren said, in an echo of protest movements elsewhere. And witnessing the Arab Spring movement has helped the Sarayaku people in their struggle. Young upstarts plotting Mid East art revolution . ""I feel very inspired when I see in the news other people doing similar things to us,"" said Gualinga. ""Before we used to feel very alone ... and now we can see that we are not the only ones, so that definitely brings hope."" For Jenni Williams, the revolutions of the Arab Spring have been both an inspiration and a driver for the Zimbabwean government's increasingly harsh crackdown on protests at home. As executive director and founding member of Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA), she leads a movement of 80,000 human rights activists who seek to improve the everyday lives of the southern African nation's women. She accuses the authorities under President Robert Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe for 32 years, of misusing their powers to suppress protest and hold onto power, through arrests and intimidation. ""That's how these dictators are entrenching themselves, and we, the activists, have to find a response to that,"" Williams said. ""How do you dodge a bullet and make a ballot count?"" Amnesty International's report highlights the arrests, detention and torture of human rights defenders by a partisan police force who, it says, failed to take action against members of Mugabe's ZANU-PF party when they ""harassed, intimidated or beat up perceived political opponents."" ""The Arab Spring has been an inspiration, but since that we've been viewed as a national security threat,"" Williams said. ""We are a women's movement using peaceful protests but it has (led to) increased monitoring, surveillance and charges against us."" Nonetheless, she and others will continue to make a stand for justice and equality for women, she said. Omar Assil of the Syrian Non Violence Movement is similarly determined, despite the unrest that continues to wrack Syria more than a year after the government's crackdown on protest first began. ""We see that people are still demonstrating, they still have hope for change, and they still insist on going out in the streets regardless of all the danger they face,"" he said. Amnesty International says ""inaction over crimes against humanity in Syria"" -- owing in large part to the vetoes wielded by Russia and China -- has left the U.N. Security Council"" looking redundant as a guardian of global peace."" And it challenges the United Nations to do better when it meets to agree an Arms Trade Treaty in July, saying this is the ""acid test for politicians to place rights over self-interest and profit."" Millions of people around the world have marched in defense of human rights, Amnesty says, and it's time for the world's leaders to step up to the plate. ""Protesters have shown that change is possible. They have thrown down a gauntlet demanding that governments stand up for justice, equality and dignity,"" said Shetty, Amnesty's secretary general. ""They have shown that leaders who don't meet these expectations will no longer be accepted. After an inauspicious start 2012 must become the year of action.""","Amnesty International's annual report on global human rights lauds the courage of protesters .

"(CNN) -- Frank Williams has been a integral part of one of Formula One's most successful teams since forming it 35 years ago, but he is now starting to pass on his legacy. The Williams F1 boss, who turns 70 this month, announced on Friday that he is standing down from the British team's board and that he will be replaced by his daughter Claire. Williams, who is tetraplegic and has been confined to a wheelchair since a car accident in 1986, said the time had come for him to hand control over to the next generation. However, he will remain as team principal and keep his majority shareholding. ""I have decided to signal the next stage in the gradual but inevitable process of handing over the reins to the next generation by stepping down from the board at the end of this month,"" he said in a statement on Williams' website. ""It is no secret that Claire is my daughter but I am proud to say that she has fought hard to earn this appointment and, of all the battles she has had to fight, the prejudices of her father were not the least challenging. ""I shall be looking to Claire to represent the Williams family on the board and I know that she will work tirelessly.""

"(CNN) -- Didier Drogba scored the winner in a dramatic penalty shoot out as Chelsea beat Bayern Munich on Saturday to win the European Champions League for the first time. The Ivorian striker coolly slotted home his kick to spark frenzied celebrations among his teammates and the Chelsea fans in Bayern's Allianz Arena. Manuel Neuer had saved Juan Mata's first penalty for Chelsea to give Bayern the early advantage in the shootout, but Petr Cech saved a weak Ivica Olic effort before Bastian Schweinsteiger saw his penalty hit the post. The match had finished 1-1 after extra time, with Thomas Mueller putting Bayern ahead in the 83rd minute before Drogba dramatically leveled with two minutes remaining. Arjen Robben then missed a penalty in the first half of extra time, setting up the dramatic shootout finale where the home side fluffed their lines to leave the Bavarian fans stunned. Chelsea's victory capped a remarkable spell for Roberto Di Matteo since taking over as interim manager after the sacking of Andre Villas-Boas. Abramovich triumphant . He has led the west London side to the English FA Cup and finally fulfilled the ambitions of the club's Russian owner Roman Abramovich in lifting Europe's top club prize. Abramovich has ploughed an estimated $1 billion into buying the players to turn Chelsea into a European power since buying the club in 2003 and gone through eight managers in that time, but the closest he had come to the Champions League was a penalty shoot out loss to Manchester United in 2008. In the end, it was temporary option Di Matteo who delivered the famous trophy, and despite also guiding the team to FA Cup glory, the Italian coach must wait to find out if he will be appointed on a permanent basis. John Terry, suspended for the final after being sent off in the semifinal win over Barcelona, changed into his kit after the final whistle and collected the trophy from UEFA president Michel Platini with Frank Lampard, who was captain on the night. Lampard paid tribute to Drogba, whose goal rescued them in normal time before he applied the finishing touches to their triumph. ""I can't believe it. The determination we've shown... we didn't play fantastic but the main man Didier dug us out of trouble there,"" he told ITV Sport. ""He's a hero. Without him we're not here. He scores the goals in the big games."" That could be the Ivorian's last big goal for the club though. Drogba, an early arrival under Abramovich's ownership for Â£24 million ($38 million), is out of contract this summer and rumored to be considering a move to Chinese club. Threatening Bayern . Playing in front of a crowd of 66,000, Bayern had always been the more threatening side throughout the match without carving out a string of clear cut chances. Their best opportunities in the first half saw a shot from Robben deflected on to his own woodwork by Cech while Bayern's top scorer Mario Gomez fired over just before the interval. Salomon Kalou's effort, pushed aside by Manuel Neuer, was the sole Chelsea effort of note. The second half followed the same pattern and just after the break Bayern had the ball in the net through Franck Ribery, but it was ruled out for offside. Fans v Oligarch: Battle for Football's soul . Bayern's pressure finally paid off with seven minutes to go as Toni Kroos crossed for German international midfielder Mueller to head past Cech. It looked all over for Chelsea but their never say die attitude, so evident in the semifinal win over Barcelona, came to the fore again. Winning their first corner with only two minutes of normal time remaining, Mata's perfect delivery was met by Drogba to head home at the near post. It was his 34th goal in the Champions League and surely never more crucial. Dramatic twist . Into extra time and another dramatic twist as goal hero Drogba tripped Ribery to concede a penalty, injuring the French international who played no further part in the final. Robben, playing against his old club, stepped up after a considerable delay and his weak effort was saved by Cech. Ribery's replacement Olic wasted another glorious opportunity in the second half of extra time, caught in two minds after a Philipp Lahm cross. It summed up a frustrating night for Bayern and their coach Jupp Heynckes, who said they paid for their failure to kill off Chelsea. ""We missed too many chances,"" Heynckes told AFP. ""We played well overall and had the majority of possession. ""But we didn't know how to exploit our many opportunities and you have to use them or you will be punished."" Bayern had been bidding to win the Champions League for the fifth time.","Chelsea beat Bayern in penalty shoot out to win Champions League .

"(CNN) -- Four past or present New Orleans Saints players were suspended Wednesday by the National Football League for their roles in the ""bountygate"" scandal involving bonuses for trying to hurt opponents. The league announced that Scott Fujita, Anthony Hargrove, Will Smith and Jonathan Vilma were suspended without pay for varying lengths of time. The NFL previously suspended Saints coach Sean Payton for the 2012 season while levying an indefinite suspension on former Saints defensive coordinator Gregg Williams, who was accused of masterminding the bonus program. Vilma, a linebacker who is still with the Saints, got suspended for a year, and teammate Smith, a defensive end, got a four-game suspension. Fujita, a linebacker with the Cleveland Browns, was suspended for three games while Hargrove, a defensive lineman now with the Green Bay Packers, got an eight-game suspension. ""It is the obligation of everyone, including the players on the field, to ensure that rules designed to promote player safety, fair play, and the integrity of the game are adhered to and effectively and consistently enforced,"" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement announcing the suspensions. ""Respect for the men that play the game starts with the way players conduct themselves with each other on the field."" The statement said evidence reviewed by the league ""demonstrated that from 2009-11 Saints players of their own accord pledged significant amounts of their own money toward bounties, that players accepted payments for 'cart-offs' and 'knockouts' of injured opposing players, and that the payout amounts doubled and tripled for playoff games."" Vilma was a captain of the defensive unit under Williams and assisted in creating and funding the bounty program, the NFL statement said. ""Multiple independent sources also confirmed that Vilma offered a specific bounty -- $10,000 in cash -- to any player who knocked Arizona quarterback Kurt Warner out of the 2009 Divisional Playoff Game and later pledged the same amount to anyone who knocked Minnesota quarterback Brett Favre out of the 2009 NFC Championship Game the following week,"" the statement said. Hargrove ""actively participated in the program"" as a Saint and obstructed the league's investigation by ""being untruthful,"" the statement said, while Fujita pledged ""a significant amount of money"" to the program. Smith, a captain of the defensive unit, helped Williams with the program and pledged money for it, according to the statement. All four players can appeal the suspensions and would be entitled to a hearing and representation by counsel, the statement said. DeMaurice Smith, executive director of the NFL Players Association, said the organization would help the players fight the suspensions. ""After seeing the NFL's decision letters, the NFLPA has still not received any detailed or specific evidence from the league of these specific players' involvement in an alleged pay-to-injure program,"" Smith said in a statement. ""We have made it clear that punishment without evidence is not fair.

The program involved as many as 27 players and at least one assistant coach, the league concluded after an investigation. Players regularly contributed cash to a pool, which may have topped $50,000 at its peak. The players were paid $1,500 for a ""knockout,"" when an opposing player was not able to return to the game, and $1,000 for a ""cart-off,"" when an opposing player had to be carried off the field.

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo grabbed his seventh hat-trick of the season as Real Madrid won the capital derby against Atletico 4-1 Wednesday. The emphatic victory restored Real's four-point lead over Barcelona, who had closed up with a 4-0 drubbing of Getafe the previous night. Ronaldo's incredible scoring season continued as he put Jose Mourinho's men ahead on 25 minutes with a thunderous free kick from 25 meters out that dipped over the wall and left goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois stranded. Karim Benzema wasted a great chance to put Real further ahead before Colombia striker Radamel Falcao's fine header on 55 minutes drew Atletico level in the Bernabeu. But Ronaldo proved the inspiration again as he turned in the penalty area before shooting home on 68 minutes with another swerving, dipping shot. Gonzalo Higuain was pulled down to win Real a penalty and Ronaldo struck it home for his 52nd goal this season with seven minutes left -- the 40th in 32 league games for the Portugal star, equaling the record he set last year with six matches still to play. He moved one ahead of Lionel Messi's La Liga tally, though Barcelona's three-time world player of the year has reached 61 goals in total this season. Ronaldo, the world's most expensive player, then set up substitute Jose Callejon to complete the home scoring as Real secured their second 4-1 win of the season over Atletico. ""We were a little tense because Barcelona won yesterday and we were forced to win, so mission accomplished. We have to win our remaining games to increase our chances of winning the title,"" Ronaldo said after the match. ""The team is in good form, confident and ready for its next game. I've been one booking short of a suspension for two months, but I'm behaving myself."" In the English Premier League title race, leaders Manchester United were stunned 1-0 at struggling Wigan Wednesday to give chasing Manchester City a glimmer of hope. Defending champions United had gone into the night's fixtures with an eight-point lead and with the title all but conceded by their city rivals. But Shaun Maloney's 50th-minute winner for Roberto Martinez's battlers breathed new life into the race. City thrashed West Bromwich Albion 4-0 at the Etihad Stadium to cut United's lead to five points with five games to go. One of those fixtures sees City host United on April 30, a likely title decider. United took until deep into the second half to conjure up a shot on goal against Wigan, who moved out of the relegation zone at the expense of Bolton. Maloney curled a superb shot past De Gea to seal a deserved three points. ""It was a disappointing night for us, we were second to every ball in the first half and we were completely dominated by Wigan,"" said United manager Alex Ferguson. City boss Roberto Mancini, beaten 1-0 by Arsenal on Sunday, gave Carlos Tevez his first start since returning to the squad after a three-month absence and the striker rewarded him with a goal. Sergio Aguero had already scored twice before halftime, then Tevez struck on the hour after being set up by his fellow Argentine. David Silva scored the fourth. In other action, Arsenal continued their superb late run with a 3-0 win at rock bottom Wolves to tighten their grip on third place. Robin van Persie opened the scoring from the penalty spot, his league-leading 27th goal this season, after on-loan Tottenham defender Sebastien Bassong was sent off for pulling the Dutchman down. England forward Theo Walcott and Israel midfielder Yossi Benayoun grabbed the other goals. In the relegation battle, Queens Park Rangers improved their hopes of EPL survival with a 3-0 win over Swansea at Loftus Road.","Real Madrid win city derby against Atletico 4-1 .

"(CNN) -- Formal trial proceedings against the alleged planners of the 9/11 atrocities have finally begun. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four co-defendants were arraigned on capital charges before a military judge in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on Saturday. The Obama administration claims that its improved military commission rules ensure a fair and credible trial. But outside the United States, who will view a U.S. military trial and potential execution of our enemies as credible? Doubters will have ample reason for skepticism: If there is indeed sufficient evidence of the defendants' guilt, why not try them before the same civilian courts that try homegrown terrorists like Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh? Resorting to trial by military commission amounts to an admission that the government is unwilling to take the risk of proving the 9/11 defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, under the same rules that apply to trials of heinous criminals. If we want to hand al Qaeda a re-energizing martyrdom, this may be a good way to do it. Doubts will be magnified by the fact that the Obama administration initially planned to try the defendants in federal court in New York City. It backed down only under intense political pressure. So the decision to try one of the most important crimes in American history before a military commission was made for reasons of politics, not justice. The Pentagon's military commissions web site is headlined, ""Fairness, Transparency, Justice."" All three are dubious. The rules overlook forests of unfairness for trees of trivia. For example, after the government held the 9/11 defendants incommunicado in CIA ""black sites"" for years, without access to lawyers, family or the Red Cross, and then imprisoned them without trial for five more years at Guantanamo, it seems ludicrous that it had to arraign them in an unusual Saturday session, in order to comply with a rule requiring their arraignment within 30 days of being charged. Transparency also took a hit on Saturday. During their long imprisonment, the 9/11 defendants say, they were repeatedly tortured or otherwise abused. Mohammed, for example, was subjected to ""water board"" torture 183 times, according to a former CIA official. Yet none of this could be mentioned at the arraignment. One defendant refused to enter the courtroom voluntarily and so was brought in shackled to a chair. When his military defense counsel, Capt. Michael Schwartz, explained that his client was reacting to longstanding abuse, the audio feed to press observers in the U.S. was cut. Apparently Schwartz had dared to say the word ""torture."" The military judge admonished him not to cross over the line of what could be said in open court. So much for transparency. Finally, and above all, justice will be cheated at this trial. For example, although the rules now prohibit admission of statements obtained by torture or by cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, the rules still allow admission of evidence derived from statements made under torture, so long as a military judge concludes that admission is ""consistent with the interests of justice."" It did not have to be this way. There are better ways to reconcile the competing demands of justice for 9/11 victims and their families, versus justice for defendants who have been detained and allegedly brutalized for years in violation of standards recognized by international law. One way might have been to let the defendants pursue their torture claims through separate lawsuits against the Bush administration officials who authorized their alleged mistreatment. But U.S. courts have blocked these lawsuits on the ground that the officials enjoy immunity from such suits. Another way might have been to refer the 9/11 prosecutions to an international criminal court whose judgments would have more credibility in the world in general, and in the Muslim world in particular. U.S. officials have raised objections to the International Criminal Court. But the ICC is not the only such court. The U.S. has supported the Special Court for Sierra Leone, where former Liberian tyrant Charles Taylor was recently convicted, and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, which has indicted individuals for the assassination in 2005 of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Granted, every approach has its drawbacks. But the U.S. has settled on the worst alternative of all: military trials. As a former lawyer in the Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps, I know that military trials -- of American service personnel -- can be scrupulously fair. However, as the common law maxim states, justice must not only be done, it must be seen to be done. In the long view of history, and around the world, justice will not be seen to be done if convictions and death sentences are imposed on our alleged enemies by a U.S. military court. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglass Cassel.","Military trial of the alleged planners of the 9/11 attacks on America began on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Los Angeles Lakers forward Metta World Peace has been suspended for seven games without pay over an elbow blow he delivered to the head of an opposing player, the National Basketball Association said Tuesday. One-time basketball bad boy Ron Artest, who changed his name to Metta World Peace, was ejected Sunday from a Los Angeles Lakers-Oklahoma City Thunder game for striking James Harden. ""The concussion suffered by James Harden demonstrates the danger posed by violent acts of this kind, particularly when they are directed at the head area,"" said NBA Commissioner David Stern, to announce the suspension. ""We remain committed to taking necessary measures to protect the safety of NBA players, including the imposition of appropriate penalties for players with a history of on-court altercations."" World Peace could miss at least six playoff games as a result of the suspension, the NBA said. He apologized Tuesday to Thunder fans and the Oklahoma organization. ""I look forward to getting back on the floor with my teammates and competing for the Lakers fans,"" he said. After scoring against the Thunder in the second quarter, World Peace was cheering his own shot when he hit the Oklahoma City guard in the back of the head, knocking him down. Harden was on the floor for several minutes, and did not return to the game after being diagnosed with a concussion, according to the Thunder. World Peace was ejected from the game. The Lakers won 114-106 over the Thunder in double overtime. ""During that play I just dunked on (Kevin Durant) and (Serge) Ibaka, and I got really emotional and excited. It was unfortunate that James had to get hit with an unintentional elbow,"" World Peace told reporters after the game. Lakers General Manager Mitch Kupchak criticized his player's actions in a statement Tuesday, but said the team will continue to support him. ""Metta has for the most part been a model citizen both on and off the court since joining the Lakers. Still, his most recent lapse in judgment is not to be condoned or accepted,"" he said in a statement. ""His actions could have seriously injured another player, and his absence during this suspension will hurt our team as well. While we accept the league's decision, we will be supportive of Metta and try to help him be more professional on the court,"" Kupchak said. Back when World Peace was still Artest and playing for the Indiana Pacers, he made headlines in 2004 for his role in a brawl between players and fans at a Pacers-Pistons game after somebody threw a drink on him. For that incident, the NBA suspended Artest for 86 games.","NEW: Metta World Peace apologizes to Oklahoma City Thunder fans .

"Beijing (CNN) -- China will punish 54 people for their roles in a July train crash that killed 40 people, the government said Wednesday. The announcement followed what the government described as a months-long investigation into the causes of the crash and what many in the country saw as a delayed, inadequate response. In the wake of the July collision of two high-speed trains, which also injured 172 people according to government figures, many in China expressed fury at the government, particularly in posts online. Some alleged corruption and efforts to cover up the tragedy -- charges the government denied. In a report released Wednesday, the Chinese government cited multiple problems that led to the crash and the initial emergency response. A lightning strike July 23 caused a high-speed train to lose power near Wenzhou in eastern China, and a signaling failure led the next train to rear-end it, according to the final report. ""According to a final investigation report, the train crash was caused by major design flaws in train operating equipment, relaxed safety controls and poor emergency response to equipment failure,"" the state-run Xinhua news agency said. The government has finished a safety overhaul on its high-speed rail lines, the report said. The probe ""exposed that the Ministry of Railway and the Shanghai Railway Bureau had failed to act properly after the accident and were unable to disclose relevant information on issues of social concern, leaving a negative social influence,"" Xinhua said. The Ministry of Railways will pay 915,000 yuan ($145,000 ) in compensation for each victim, the news agency said. China's Cabinet agreed at an executive meeting on Wednesday that the country will take disciplinary action against dozens of officials . Among those named are Liu Zhijun, the country's former railway minister, and Zhang Shuguang, the railway ministry's deputy chief engineer, who were fired over an alleged ""severe violation of discipline"" earlier this year, Xinhua reported. ""Liu and Zhang, together with Ma Cheng, chairman of board at China Railway Signal and Communication Corp., producer of the the railway signaling system, were chiefly responsible for the crash, according to the State Council,"" Xinhua reported. A government report posted online also said three top railway officials were dismissed -- Guangzhou Railway Group Chairman Xu Xiaoming, China Railway Signal & Communication (CRSC) Deputy General Manager Miao Weizhong, and Railway Signal Design Institute Chairman Zhang Haifeng. The report blamed them for violations linked to the incident. Other officials could also face punishment, and some investigations are ongoing, the government report said. Authorities are still looking into whether to charge anyone criminally, the report added. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao oversaw the meeting with investigators who revealed results of the probe. The government found that the CRSC's ""chaotic management at its research institute has caused the design flaws and major safety loopholes,"" Xinhua reported. In addition to the payments to families of victims, the government has also signed agreements with 101 of the injured passengers that provide compensation of more 7.5 billion yuan ($1.2 billion), Xinhua said. Current Railway Minister Sheng Guangzu ""is required to make a thorough self-criticism"" and present it to the council, Xinhua said. ""Sheng said that the ministry has failed the nation and its people, and he expressed deep condolences to victims of the accident and sincere apologies to the injured,"" Xinhua said. CNN's Chi-Chi Zhang and Josh Levs contributed to this report.","The government will pay $145,000 in compensation for each victim .

"(CNN) -- President Obama faces a delicate balancing act in trying to contain Israel from launching a military strike while compelling Iran to halt its nuclear ambition. How he plays his hand will be a true test of his ability to pull a rabbit out of a hat. Meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel recently, President Obama emphasized his strong preference for using sanctions and diplomacy, but he's not ruling out military force as an option. For war to be avoided, Iran or Israel will have to back down from its current position. For the Obama administration, the outcome of Iran's parliamentary elections provides an opportunity for furthering negotiations. Seen as a major test for the regime, the March elections resulted in a victory for the ultraconservative factions of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose supporters did not fare well at the polls, was weakened. After several years of internal division, the repudiation of Ahmadinejad consolidates Khamenei's claims of unified support, giving him a freer hand to act and his parties a majority control in the parliament. However, many reformists boycotted the elections and candidates supporting Ahmadinejad were disqualified. Turnout was likely much lower than the 64% that the government claimed. By most independent accounts, the election turnout was among the lowest in Iran's history, signaling ebbing support for the hardline leadership. Iran's election results, along with the strong rhetoric of the hawks from Tel Aviv, provide the Obama administration with a new but narrow opening to nudge Khamenei toward a compromise. While Iranian leaders remain defiant about their nuclear program, believing that a latent nuclear capacity is essential to the survival of the state, and hoping that the crippling impact of international sanctions would rally support to their cause, they do care about public opinion. They will be sensitive to the public's resentment of sanctions. By reiterating U.S. commitment to non-interference in Iran's domestic affairs (read: no regime change) and providing political and economic incentives for cooperation, the Obama administration could compel Khamenei to retreat from his pursuit of nuclear weapons. At the same time, the rise in President Obama's electoral prospects in November puts him in a much stronger position vis-a-vis Netanyahu. With the Republican candidates in mutually assured destruction mode, and a slowly reviving economy, President Obama's re-election chance has surged. It was an open secret that Netanyahu was strategizing with Republican heavyweights for regime change in the United States. Now it is more likely that Netanyahu is going to have to live with President Obama for another five years. While Netanyahu has no love for the president, the Israeli public knows that, in the end, they depend on the goodwill and support of the United States. As Time magazine reported on March 8, 58% of Israelis oppose a military strike on Iran without the support of the United States. Moving forward, the challenge for the Obama administration is to manage Israeli misgivings about the utility of an aggressive diplomatic approach toward Iran while simultaneously offering Iran a face-saving exit out of its defiant posture. Much like high-stakes diplomatic crises of previous eras involving nuclear weapons, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, averting war depends as much on decisions made in Tel Aviv and Tehran, as it does on the ingenuity of American policymakers. If President Obama plays his hand well, he may be able to succeed at containing Israel's military threat and compelling Iran to back down on its nuclear program. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nina Tannenwald and Hussein Banai.","Nina Tannenwald and Hussein Banai: President Obama faces a delicate balancing act .

"(CNN) -- Spain remain on course to retain their European Championship crown after seeing off a lackluster France 2-0 in the third Euro 2012 quarterfinal at the Donbass Arena, Donetsk on Saturday. Xabi Alonso celebrated his 100th appearance for his country with two goals in either half to seal a convincing win for the world champions. ""There's a lot of personal satisfaction in getting to 100 caps and of course getting on the scoresheet,"" Alonso said. ""We are now in the semis and of course all the games at this stage are life and death. We didn't have that many chances but we had the match totally under control,"" he added. Victory over France sets up a showdown with arch rivals Portugal next Wednesday. Germany crush Greece Euro dream . With coach Vicente Del Bosque once again opting to pack the midfield and leave striker Fernando Torres on the bench, Spain quickly assumed control of the game. It fell to Andres Iniesta to unlock the opposition defense in the 19th minute. Barcelona's midfield maestro threaded a pass through to Jordi Alba who jinked past a flailing Mathieu Debuchy before squaring a cross which Alonso headed home with power and accuracy. For the remainder of the half, France offered little in reply. Franck Ribery's industry down the left came to nothing. Yohan Cabaye's 31st minute free kick was turned over the bar by Iker Casillas and Karim Bezema's shooting remained frustratingly errant. Spain resumed the second half where they finished the first -- controlling the game at a canter with France chasing the game. Debuchy went close with a header in the 60th minute, but France couldn't capitalize on the few openings they created in the second period. Coach Laurent Blanc sent on substitute's Samir Nasri, Jeremy Menez and Olivier Giroud but it failed to turn the tide in favor of the three-time European champions. Anthony Reveillere's foul on substitute Pedro in the 90th minute handed Spain a late penalty and a chance to put the result beyond doubt. Alonso stepped up to take the spot kick, sent goalkeeper Hugo Lloris the wrong way and keep Spain marching on in their bid to land a third consecutive major trophy.","Xabi Alonso scores a brace as Spain beat France 2-0 in Donetsk in Euro 2012 quarterfinal .

"(CNN) -- India has overtaken China as the world's biggest importer of weapons, with Asian nations the most aggressive consumers of military hardware, a new report says. Between 2007 and 2011, India's business accounted for 10% of the global arms market, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). South Korea was next, accounting for 6% of sales, followed by Pakistan and China (5%) and Singapore (4%). Siemon Wezeman, a senior analyst with SIPRI, said India's defense spending reflects its regional security concerns and Delhi's global aspirations. ""India procures arms in relation to its tense relationship with Pakistan and increasingly sees China as a potential threat,"" he told CNN. ""It also wants to assert itself as a major regional or even global power."" Much of this expenditure has focused on the modernization of its armed forces with the purchase of fighter jets and warships, according to The Hindu. Meanwhile, China's relative decline as an arms importer comes at a time when it is increasing its overall defense budget, investing in major projects such as the development of a stealth fighter jet and an aircraft carrier program. Many of these weapons are instead produced domestically. At the National People's Congress earlier this month, Beijing announced plans to increase its military spending by 11.2%, a move some analysts suspect is in response to U.S. plans to increase its military presence in the Pacific -- an assertion it has rejected, saying its spending is in proportion to its economy. China increases defense spending . ""The Chinese government has maintained reasonable and appropriate growth in defense spending on the strength of rapid economic and social development and the steady increase of fiscal revenues,"" NPC spokesman Li Zhaoxing told reporters in March. But China's announcement is sure to stoke concerns among some its neighbors. China regards Taiwan as part of its territory and has vowed to use force against the island if it ever formally sought independence. Beijing has also claimed a significant portion of the South China Sea as its own territorial waters, putting it in conflict with other nations that have made claims on portions of the region. Wezeman said China has gradually modernized its armed forces and arms industry in the past two decades. He said development of the latter was mainly influenced by an embargo on arms sales to China imposed by European Union nations and the United States after the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. This, he said, forced China to look to other sources such as Russia for new equipment and licenses to produce weapons itself, which in turn helped to improve its own indigenous arms production capability. As a result, China has become a major exporter of arms. According to SIPRI, it is now the world's sixth largest seller behind the U.S., Russia, Germany, France and Britain -- with India's long-time foe Pakistan chief among its clients. Russia's defense industry has been the chief beneficiary of India's custom, according to SIPRI, though France has recently muscled in with new deals to supply submarines in addition to Mirage and Rafale combat aircraft from Dassault. SIPRI estimates India is likely to spend more than $100 billion on weapons in the next 15 years.","India's business accounted for 10% of the global arms market between 2007-2011 .

"(CNN) -- A hard-line Iranian lawmaker has mockingly suggested that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad open up a nightclub, according to Iran's Fars News Agency. Lawmaker Ali Motaheri took the sarcastic poke at Ahmadinejad during a speech to parliament where he said the president's soft stance on Iran's Islamic dress code was to blame for an increase in young Iranian women wearing sexually provocative clothing, Fars News reported. Motaheri has long been a fierce critic of Ahmadinejad. ""The state of the dress code today has created addictions in society, so Ahmadinejad should think about starting a nightclub or a cabaret,"" Fars News quoted Motaheri as saying. Iran's dress code requires women to cover their hair and bodies, but many push the envelope with tight clothes and head scarves that barely cover their hair. Often, the result is a cat-and-mouse game between young, defiant women who want to wear what they choose and Iran's morality police, who patrol the streets on foot and marked cars to enforce the code. Ahmadinejad's hard-line political opponents started attacking the president about his views on the dress code in 2010 after he criticized morality police for taking excessive measures against alleged offenders. Journalist Farbod Jamali contributed to this report.","In parliament, hard-line lawmaker says Iranian president's stand on dress code is too lax .

"(CNN) -- ""It's a long-time habit I've got to try to conquer,"" admits rising star Keegan Bradley, as he confesses to breaking one of golf's biggest taboos. He's not talking about overcoming a problem with drugs, gambling or alcohol, nor is the American going through a personal or professional crisis. No, the 25-year-old, who won his first major title in 2011, has a big issue building up in the back of his throat. ""I'd like to apologize for my spitting,"" the PGA Championship winner wrote on micro-blogging site Twitter. ""It's like a reflex; I don't even know I'm doing it."" In some cultures, expectoration is not uncommon. But on the golf course, it's a massive no-no and such behavior often sparks outrage. Tiger Woods was fined for a similar transgression in a European Tour event in 2011, and golf coach and broadcaster Denis Pugh took exception to Bradley's repeated hocking during last weekend's Northern Trust Open. Winner Haas skips friend's wedding for fourth Tour triumph . The tension seemed to get to the 25-year-old, who spat repeatedly during his pre-shot routine while engaged in a three-man playoff eventually won by Bill Haas. ""Perhaps it's a cultural thing, OK to spit in USA? If so how did you let that happen America?"" Pugh wrote on Twitter. ""In USA where&when is spitting not appropriate?Church? Dinner table? Ladies present? Full view of hd tv camera? There must be a time not 2do?"" Pugh orchestrated a campaign directed at one of Bradley's sponsors, equipment maker Cleveland Golf, who at first defended their player. ""We support Keegan whether he spits or not!"" the company countered, before explaining that the player chews sunflower seeds ""and they have to go somewhere."" Then they got light-hearted about it: ""We don't have the licensing agreement for his saliva!"" However, the public pressure told as Cleveland subsequently issued a statement on Facebook admitting that maybe Bradley had some improvements to make. ""We proudly stand by Keegan, as we have since he was on the Hooters Tour,"" the world No. 19's sponsor said. ""We know that he has a few quirks during his pre-shot routine, just like a lot of us, and he's working very hard to overcome the spitting.

Pugh, who once coached former European No. 1 Colin Montgomerie, accepted the apologies and called Bradley ""classy"" for admitting his behavior was wrong. ""He's actually a good man, his coach & I are good pals,"" wrote Pugh, who now works with European Ryder Cup players Edoardo and Francesco Molinari of Italy. After watching the conclusion to Sunday's tournament, Pugh tweeted: ""Pro golf has some serious issues at moment and PGA Tour is turning a blind eye."" ""(PGA Tour commissioner) Tim Fincham must do something about slow play and spitting."" But his was not a view shared by all golf lovers. Cleveland's Facebook post also attracted a host of comments supporting Bradley, with one saying: ""Spitting is not a big deal. His pre-shot routine is quite quirky, but it works for him. He's won on Tour and will continue to win for quite some time."" Other users agreed. ""Don't fix what's not broken, it works,"" read one comment, while another said, ""He's a heck of a young player and conducts himself with grace."" Woods, arguably still golf's biggest star despite his fall from grace in the past two years, fell foul of the sport's disfavor for phlegm in February 2011 during a frustrating final day at the Dubai Desert Classic. The 14-time major champion was fined for a breach of conduct after being spotted spitting on the 12th green. ""The Euro Tour is right,"" said Woods, who also used Twitter to express his regret 12 months ago. ""It was inconsiderate to spit like that and I know better.

"(EW.com) -- More than any year in recent memory, the survival of shows this season did not hinge on ratings. You had Fox's ""Fringe"" getting renewed for a final GTFO season with only 4.2 million viewers and slight 1.6 average rating. Then you had ""Terra Nova"" getting axed with 10.8 million viewers and a 3.6 rating. The biggest mitigating factor was a show's cost -- which usually rises along with its age -- along with the difficulty of a time period, who owns the program, how intensely critics and fans feel about the series and, believe it or not, whether a network's executives like the show. Here are the top nine highest-rated canceled shows this season: . 1. ""Rob"" (CBS: 12 million viewers, 3.7 adults 18-49 rating): A 3.7? If NBC had a freshman comedy with a 3.7 average, it would run the show five nights a week this fall (""Community"" was renewed with almost half this rating). Bully for CBS that their table scraps have these kind of numbers. The issue here was Rob Schneider's comedy was shedding too much of its massive ""Big Bang Theory"" lead-in, and was trending the wrong direction. CBS suspects the time slot can do better. 2. ""Terra Nova"" (Fox: 10.1 million, 3.6): Some in the industry feel Fox made a mistake not picking up this ambitious drama for a second season. I agree. ""Terra Nova"" managed the rare feat of delivering a sizable family audience to a broadcast drama, found its legs creatively in its final hours and there was nothing else like it on TV. Cost was a factor, but so was the network's belief that midseason addition ""Touch"" would be the network's next big hit (it wasn't). 3. ""Alcatraz"" (Fox: 9.6 million, 3.4): The ratings on ""Alcatraz"" keep sinking while the show, unlike other J.J. Abrams-produced dramas, wasn't hugely engaging for viewers. A second season would have likely seen a ratings drop into serious red-line territory. 4. & 5. ""House""/""Desperate Housewives"" (Fox: 8.7 million, 3.3 / ABC 10.4 million, 3.5): I almost didn't put these two on the list because their conclusions were more like dignified retirements than cancellations. Both respected long-serving solid veterans of the broadcast game whose cost/benefit scale finally tipped. Both were given time to craft series-ending storylines. Still, some dramas do manage to last longer, like ""Miami"" below. 6. ""How to Be a Gentleman"" (CBS: 8.7 million, 2.8): Short-lived. Critics didn't like it, and it didn't pull its weight. 7. ""GCB"" (ABC: 7.4 million, 2.6): Diving in the ratings, and ABC has several similarly soapy dramas like ""Nashville"" and ""Mistresses"" ordered for next season (ABC's new trailers here) that could improve on these numbers. 8. ""CSI: Miami"" (CBS: 10.8 million, 2.5): Viewers don't really crave and holler for a real ending on procedural crime dramas like they do for serialized shows like ""Fringe."" Personally, if I watched any TV show for a decade, I'd want a final episode that gave a sense of resolution, some acknowledgement that a story is being told and not just a perpetual weekly reset. So I'm bummed on behalf of those ""Miami"" fans who expected a true series finale. Hopefully CBS won't shortchange flagship ""CSI"" or ""The Mentalist"" when their time comes. (And, yes, ""Miami"" cut for age/expense/ratings; ""CSI: NY"" is slightly younger, and helping hold the fort on tough Friday night). 9. ""Unforgettable"" (CBS: 12 million, 2.5): Maybe it was the title. Maybe the somewhat generic format. But this series was one of the most, well, forgettable on TV. Its ratings weren't terrible, but few viewers seemed terribly upset when it was axed. See the full story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi has been dragged into the row about racism in football, but his club Barcelona insists that accusations against the three-time world player of the year are ""well wide of the mark."" Messi is said to have frequently directed a racial term at Real Madrid's Royston Drenthe during matches in the Spanish top flight. Drenthe, who has spent this season on loan at English Premier League club Everton, claimed in an interview with a Dutch magazine that Messi repeatedly called him ""negro"" (meaning black). It is the same word that caused huge controversy in English football this season when Manchester United's black defender Patrice Evra accused Liverpool striker Luis Suarez of using the term several times during a Premier League match between the teams. Suarez was banned for eight matches and fined £40,000 ($64,330). He maintained that the word ""negro"" is used commonly in his native Uruguay and is not a form of racial abuse. But Barcelona strongly rejected any suggestion that Argentine forward Messi would have used the same term. ""The player has always shown a maximum respect and sportsmanship towards his rivals, something which has been recognized by his fellow professionals many times, and we are sure that any accusations to the contrary are well wide of the mark,"" a spokesman said. ""His behavior throughout his career has always been exemplary."" Messi has had another outstanding season individually, scoring an unprecedented 72 goals in all competitions and a record 50 in La Liga alone ahead of Saturday's final match at Real Betis. However, his team have fallen short of their usual high standards, losing out in the Spanish title race to Real Madrid and suffering a shock loss to Chelsea in the Champions League semifinals when Messi hit the bar with a crucial penalty in the second leg. Drenthe's spell at Everton has ended miserably. The 25-year-old hasn't been picked since he was dropped from the FA Cup semifinal against Liverpool on April 14 for unspecified disciplinary reasons. The Dutch midfielder joined Real Madrid for a reported €14 million ($18.1 million) in 2007 but has spent the last two seasons out on loan. He has been quoted as saying he wants to return to Feyenoord, where he played before joining Madrid.","Royston Drenthe accuses Lionel Messi of calling him ""negro"" during matches .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Syrian opposition is blaming pro-government militia members for the slaying of a prominent Palestinian militant in his house outside Damascus. He was Hamas member Kamal Hosni Ghanaja, a former deputy of Mahmoud Mabhouh, who was slain in Dubai in 2010, a death many observers blame on the Israeli spy agency Mossad. Mabhouh was one of the founders of Hamas' military wing. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria, which opposes the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, said the pro-government Shabiha militia tortured Ghanaja to death and ""set his house on fire to destroy the evidence of their heinous crime."" The killing comes amid tensions between Syria and Hamas and sectarian strife inside Syria. Ghanaja, also known as Nizar Abu Mujahid, was killed Wednesday by an ""unknown group of men,"" Hamas said in a statement Thursday. It is investigating the killing and hopes to ""expose the perpetrators involved in this heinous crime."" Hamas official Ahmad Yousef said Israel could be behind the attack. ""Because of the political and security vacuum on the ground, it will be for Israel's interest to take advantage and conduct something to that extent,"" he said. ""The only party benefiting is Israel by the assassination of Hamas officials,"" he said. But Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said, ""it is possible that not only Israel was on the lookout for him."" ""He was not one of the greatest saints of our generation,"" he said. It is expected that Ghanaja will be buried in Jordan, Hamas sources said. ""The brother Abu Mujahid served his lifetime devoting himself for the path of God in the ranks of the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, and in the service of the Palestinian cause and his people,"" the group said. Hamas, which controls the territory of Gaza and opposes the existence of Israel, had long based its political wing in Damascus. But the movement's senior officials decided to leave Syria as the 15-month-long uprising against the al-Assad regime intensified, leaving a ""security vacuum,"" Hamas' Yousef said. The Hamas offices remain open in Damascus, and lower-level officials -- some of whom have ties to Syria, such as family -- handle daily business, he said. Syrian government officials and supporters have resented the forging of closer ties between Hamas senior leaders and other regional rivals, such as Qatar, which is supporting the anti-al-Assad opposition, and Jordan, which has a peace treaty with Israel. Hamas leaders have discussed setting up its political wing in Jordan. Jordan's King Abdullah II met with Hamas Politburo Chief Khaled Mashaal and his delegation on Thursday to discuss a range of issues, Jordan's state-run news agency Petra said. The Local Coordination Committees said the Ghanaja ""assassination"" is the latest example of Syrian-Palestinian sectarian violence fomented by the government. The pro-regime militia called Shabiha has been entering Palestinian refugee camps under the guise of ""safeguarding the camps"" but they ""commit murder and engage in kidnapping,"" the Local Coordination Committees said. It said the regime is recruiting ""drug dealers, drug users, and other criminals"" into the militia. The group said the Syria's ""rejectionist policies"" toward Israel ""have only been attempts to enslave the people."" ""The Palestinian experiences in the past demonstrate that the Syrian regime views the Palestinian people as mere cards with which to gamble, regionally and internationally. A regime that kills its own people will not shy away from spilling Palestinian blood for the sake of its own survival,"" the Local Coordination Committees said. Some estimates say as many as 15,000 people have died in Syria in more than 15 months. CNN's Saad Abedine, Kareem Khadder and Guy Azriel contributed to this report.","Kamal Hosni Ghanaja was a former deputy of a top Hamas figure .

"(CNN) -- King of Clay Rafael Nadal began his defense of his Monte Carlo Masters title Wednesday with a routine 6-4, 6-3 victory against the Finnish player Jarkko Nieminen. Nadal, whose incredible form on clay has seen him go unbeaten at the tournament since 2003, showed little discomfort in dispatching Nieminen despite suffering persistent injury problems with his left knee. The Spaniard had pulled out of the Sony Ericsson Open semifinal against Andy Murray to receive treatment and also missed several tournaments after the Australian Open. ""I need practice, and today was a good practice,"" Nadal told AFP. ""Tomorrow (is) going to be another tough match against a player who is dangerous."" That ""tough match"" will be against Kazakhstan's Mikhail Kukushkin. If Nadal wins it will be his 39th straight win in the tournament and put him on course for a record eighth title. ""It was the first match on clay after a long time, and the first match after 15 days without touching a racquet,"" said Nadal. ""The important thing was that I won in straight sets. Tomorrow I have another chance to keep improving, and that's what I'm going to try."" But Nadal isn't the favorite to win. Top seed and world number one Novak Djokovic looked impressive after beating Italian Andreas Seppi 6-1, 6-4. ""I was really focused first set and played it well against a tough, quality opponent who plays good on clay,"" explained Djokovic. ""For the first official match since [the French Open at] Roland Garros last year, it was satisfying."" Djokovic will play the Ukrainian Alexandr Dolgopolov in the second round in the hope he can finally break Nadal's clay court stranglehold in Monte Carlo and beyond. ""We've played already here finals in 2009, good match, but Nadal is the ultimate challenge on clay,"" Djokovic said on Monday. ""He's the king of clay. He's the best tennis player ever to play on this surface and one of the best tennis players ever, so that says enough. ""Obviously, knowing in 2011 I won Rome and Madrid and winning against Rafa in finals back-to-back gives me a lot of confidence for coming into the clay court season now.""","Rafael Nadal beats Jarkko Nieminen in first round of Monte Carlo Masters .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A one-of-a-kind bicycle belonging to U.S. cycling legend Lance Armstrong was stolen from a team truck in California just hours after he rode it Saturday on the first day of a nine-day race. Lance Armstrong's bike was stolen after he competed  in the first day of the Amgen Tour of California. Cancer survivor and seven-time Tour de France champion Armstrong is racing in the Amgen Tour of California this week as he attempts another comeback after retiring from the sport in 2005. Armstrong's first comeback came in 1998, two years after he was diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs and brain. Doctors gave him a less than 50 percent chance of survival. Armstrong announced the bike theft on his Twitter account Sunday morning and posted a photograph. ""There is only one like it in the world therefore hard to pawn it off. Reward being offered,"" he wrote. The bicycle that was stolen is not the one Armstrong rides every day during the race. The stolen bike is used only for time trials, a race in which cyclists ride individually at staggered intervals over a set distance and try to get the best time. The thieves took four bicycles from a truck Armstrong's Astana team had parked behind a hotel in Sacramento. The other three bicycles belonged to team members Janez Brajkovic, Steve Morabito and Yaroslav Popovych, Astana said. Armstrong, 37, won the Tour de France, considered the premier bicycle race in the world, a record seven times from 1999-2005. The 750-mile Amgen Tour of California ends Sunday. It is the second major race in which Armstrong has participated since announcing his comeback in September. He raced last month in the Tour Down Under in Australia, finishing 29th. Armstrong said he is aiming for another Tour de France victory this summer and was not expected to contend in the Australian race, which he used to gauge his fitness level after more than three years out of the saddle.","One-of-a-kind bicycle taken from team truck in California .

"(CNN) -- A dramatic injury-time goal by Juan Mata handed Chelsea a 2-1 victory over Wigan in the English Premier League on Saturday to boost their chances of qualifying for next season's Champions League. All three goals came in the second half with Branislav Ivanovic opening the scoring Chelsea in the 62nd minute. Wigan's French midfielder Mohamed Diame looked to have salvaged a point for the second-from-bottom side when he scored in the 82nd minute. But Juan Mata's goal which came after Fernando Torres' shot hit the post saw the Blues rise to fifth, now two points behind fourth-placed Arsenal. Tottenham Hotspur moved up to third place with a 0-0 draw against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light but Arsenal can overtake them again if they get a result against Manchester City at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. League leaders Manchester United are also in action Sunday as they host Queens Park Rangers. Liverpool's lacklustre form continues as they drew 1-1 at Anfield against Aston Villa. Should Liverpool sack Kenny Dalglish? Chris Herd gave the visitors the lead in the 10th minute before Luis Suarez rescued a point for Kenny Dalglish's side eight minutes from the end. The point lifts Liverpool to eighth with 43 points. Villa remain in 15th place with 34 points. Blackburn Rovers went down to West Bromwich Albion 3-0 at The Hawthorns to remain in the bottom three. The win sees West Brom climb to 12th. Norwich City and Everton drew 2-2 at Carrow Road while Bolton Wanderers suffered a heavy home defeat going down 3-0 to Fulham. Wolverhampton Wanderers now look certain to be relegated after a 2-1 defeat to Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium. Peter Crouch claimed the winner which sees Stoke rise to 11th. Wolves remain bottom, six points from safety with just six games remaining.","Chelsea snatch a 2-1 win against Wigan to boost bid for a fourth-place finish .

"(CNN) -- Saying they will not tolerate interference with the right to worship, federal prosecutors announced Thursday that a Texas man has been charged with calling in a bomb threat to an Islamic center that is building a mosque in Tennessee. Javier Alan Correa, 24, of Corpus Christi was indicted on two charges, including a civil rights violation, by a federal grand jury in Nashville, according to U.S. Attorney Jerry E. Martin. According to the indictment, Correa, who had not surrendered, called the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro and left a voice message on September 5 saying, among other things, ""On September 11, 2011, there's going to be a bomb in the building."" That date was the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Imam Ossama Bahloul of the Islamic center said the indictment showed that the United States is a ""nation of law."" Tennessee mosque's fate up in the air after court ruling . ""We are used to messages of 'go back home' and 'you worship a false God,' "" Bahloul said. ""This message is different."" Bahloul turned the phone recording over to authorities. ""Today's indictment should send a message loud and clear,"" Martin said. ""The Department of Justice will not tolerate violence or threat of violence against the Muslim community here in Murfreesboro. If you engage in this type of illegal conduct, we will come after you. The right to worship and assemble is a bedrock guarantee of this great nation."" The construction site for the mosque has been vandalized multiple times, Martin said. Federal agencies offered a $20,000 reward in their investigation of an August 2010 arson that damaged construction equipment at the site. The Islamic Center of Murfreesboro has existed for more than a decade, but the fight over the new mosque erupted when planning commissioners approved the 52,960-square-foot building on Veals Road. The backlash was stinging and included lawsuits and the arson. A sign announcing the mosque was spray-painted with the words ""Not Welcome."" A Rutherford County judge ruled last month that plans for the building are now ""void and of no effect."" Opinion: Muslims in America, it's time to demand justice . Chancellor Robert Corlew said the planning commission violated state law by not providing proper public notice. The county has since been blocked from granting an occupancy permit. Construction on the mosque has continued. It might be completed by July 20, in time to observe Ramadan, Islam's holy month, if the Islamic center receives the permit. Bahloul said the majority of people in Rutherford County are accepting of the Muslim community. Correa is charged with one count of intentionally obstructing by threat of force the free exercise of religious beliefs and one count of using an instrument of interstate commerce to communicate a threat to destroy a building by means of an explosive device. He faces a maximum penalty of 20 years for one count and 10 years for the second, as well as a fine of up to $250,000 for each offense, officials said. David Boling, spokesman for Martin, the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, said he could not comment on the specifics of the case against Correa. A Corpus Christi phone number for Correa was not operating Thursday afternoon. A message left with the federal public defender's office was not immediately returned. Bahloul said he had mixed feelings over the charges. ""I feel that American values prevailed, but I feel bad for his family,"" he said. CNN's Moni Basu and Lateef Mungin contributed to this report.","Charges show U.S. is a ""nation of law,"" imam says .

"(CNN) -- New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft would rather make a donation to charity than invest millions of dollars in a top European soccer club because the economics of football make no business sense. Analzying football's business model, Kraft insisted he would not follow the example of Abu-Dhabi owned English Premier League winners Manchester City, which has ran up huge losses -- $300 million for the last financial year (the highest figure in English football history) -- to assemble a championship team. ""Manchester City won the championship this year and I hear they're going to lose $156 million. I would rather give that money to charity if I had it. I want every business to stand on its own,"" the 71-year-old, told CNN. In the U.S. team sports such as American football, basketball and baseball are governed by a salary cap, which limits the amount of money a team can spend on players' wages. It was the absence of such a salary cap in the Premier League that deterred Kraft from investing in Liverpool, which was ultimately purchased in October 2010 by the Kraft Group chairman and CEO's compatriot John W Henry -- the owner of the Boston Red Sox baseball franchise -- from Americans Tom Hicks and George Gillett. Football culture: Warrior or tika taka technician? ""I would only do it, if there was a salary cap. It's the same thing I said three years ago,"" said Kraft, who completed a then record purchase of NFL franchise the Patriots in 1994. ""We could have bought Liverpool before the two ownership groups who preceded us and in the end I don't want to compete in a business where people throw money at something. ""I want to be able to compete,"" added Kraft. ""The fans in Liverpool are awesome and they are expecting to win every year, and if you are competing with people who have different rules then it makes it difficult."" Drogba deal: China's vanity project? The former Patriots season-ticket holder argued that the lack of a salary cap combined with other clubs' decisions to run up significant levels of debt ensured that there was not a level playing field in English football. ""We have the resources to do it, it's just I choose not to do it.,"" said Kraft, who was speaking in London, where he is taking in the tennis at Wimbledon for the 38th consecutive year. ""I don't want to be in a business that does not stand on its own, I want every business to stand on its own, and for ego reasons I'm not willing to lose that kind of money. ""The only way I would go into a sports business is to win. And, I don't think I can compete on an equal footing so I choose not to do it.

"Washington (CNN) -- The parents of missing U.S. serviceman Bowe Bergdahl led the Rolling Thunder ride in Washington on Sunday, trailed by the roar of what was estimated to be hundreds of thousands of motorcycles. The annual Memorial Day weekend ride, now in its 25th year, is held in remembrance of prisoners of war and those missing in action. Bergdahl, a 26-year-old army sergeant, was captured in Afghanistan in 2009 after he finished his guard shift at a combat outpost in southeastern Paktika province. Security Clearance: Parents reveal secret talks with Taliban . ""Bowe, your family has not forgotten you, your hometown has not forgotten you. Your state of Idaho has not forgotten you, and thanks to all of you here today, Washington D.C. has not forgotten you,"" his father, Robert Bergdahl, told a cheering crowd. ""We love you, we are proud of you. Stay strong, never give up. We pray for the day that we welcome you home,"" he said. Flanked by riders wanting to offer support for the safe return of his son, Bergdahl spoke separately to CNN. He sported a long beard and wore a bandana imprinted with ""POW."" His son's official status is listed as ""missing/captured."" ""The beard is a chronology,"" Bergdahl said, ""of my son's captivity since June 30, 2009."" Since his capture by Taliban militants, four videos of the Idaho native have been released, living proof of his well-being. But the last video was sent in February 2011, and it's unclear where Bergdahl is being held now, according to John Wagner, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command. ""We are still searching for him,"" said Wagner. ""We are actively looking for leads and information on his whereabouts and his condition."" Bergdahl's parents have spoken infrequently to the public to prevent comprising any negotiations that may be taking place. People participating in Sunday's rally expressed support and encouragement for the Bergdahl family. Retired army Sgt. Kevin Coffey rode in on his Ultra Classic copper pearl Harley Davidson from North Carolina with the Rolling Thunder Chapter 7, the group that sponsored the Bergdahl's participation this year. ""I would hope that he would know that he is not forgotten, that somebody is looking for him now,"" said Coffey. Wayne Daniels, retired from the Army, outfitted his handcrafted Model T car in honor of soldiers lost in action and missing. He choked up when describing the moment his NC7 Rolling Thunder chapter asked him to drive Bergdahl's parents in the lead vehicle. His three children and girlfriend didn't hesitate to give up their usual seats and stand on the sidelines and watch this year.

"(CNN) -- Starbucks Coffee Company is the leading retailer, roaster and brand of specialty coffee in the world, with more than 6,000 retail locations in North America, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and the Pacific Rim. The first Starbucks opened in 1971, in Seattle, Washington. The name comes from Herman Melville's Moby Dick, a classic American novel about the 19th century whaling industry. The seafaring name seems appropriate for a store that imports the world's finest coffees to the cold, thirsty people of Seattle. Howard Schultz joined Starbucks in 1982. While on a business trip in Italy, he visited Milan's famous espresso bars and was impressed with their popularity and culture. In the 1990s the demand for high quality coffee allowed Starbucks to expand beyond Seattle, first to the rest of the U.S., then further afield. After becoming one of the first companies to offer stock options to its part-time employees, Starbucks became a publicly traded company.

"(CNN) -- Canadian authorities are investigating reports that debris fell Monday from a troubled airliner and caused damage to vehicles in southern Ontario. The incident centers on Air Canada Flight 001, which took off from Toronto at 2:10 p.m. ET, destined for Tokyo's Narita Airport, with 318 passengers and 16 crew members aboard. One of the Boeing 777 aircraft's engines shut down after takeoff, prompting the flight crew to follow ""standard procedure"" and return to Toronto Pearson International Airport, said Air Canada spokesman Peter Fitzpatrick. The crew requested an emergency landing, which Fitzpatrick said was standard because it gives certain planes first priority, though he also noted the aircraft involved is designed to run on a single engine if necessary. The plane landed normally, and passengers returned to the gate, according to Fitzpatrick. Constable George Tudos, spokesman for police in the regional municipality of Peel, said the aircraft returned to Toronto's airport at 3:53 p.m. Yet more than an hour before that, around 2:30 p.m., people began reporting seeing smoke, and one spotted what may have been debris coming from a large airliner, according to the spokesman. Peel Regional Police ended up receiving several calls from people reporting vehicles had been damaged by things that plunged from the sky, said Tudos. As of about 4:30 p.m., three to five such vehicles were being investigated for damage. Sarabjit Sandhu told CNN affiliate CP24 that she and her husband had just gotten gas at a Petro-Canada station in Mississauga when they ""heard a big noise, a bump, like boom."" ""The first thing I said (was), 'Oh my God, what is this?' "" Sandhu said. A number of vehicles around the parking lot were damaged, including a Nissan Altima with its back window shattered to pieces while its owner was inside the gas station's convenience store. Pieces of gray, heavy material littered the scene, according to CP24. ""It was so hot you couldn't even touch it,"" Sandhu said of the material. No injuries have been reported on the plane or on the ground, added the spokesman. Fitzpatrick, the Air Canada spokesman, noted around 5 p.m. that there had been ""no confirmation at this time"" that debris had fallen from his company's plane. ""There will be a full investigation into this incident, as there always is, and that will determine what happened,"" said Fitzpatrick. Tudos, the Peel police spokesman, said officials from the national transportation agency Transport Canada are investigating. ""Transport Canada will follow up with the company to ensure compliance with safety regulations,"" agency spokesman Kelly James told CNN on Monday by e-mail. ""The department will not hesitate to take immediate action if safety issues are identified.""

"(CNN) -- At Sepideh's home in the Iranian capital, the television is more often switched to ""America's Next Top Model"" and ""American Idol"" than the news. Not that the 22-year-old college student wants anyone to think her superficial, but it's her way of coping with the ominous -- the heated rhetoric of war with Israel and the United States. ""My friends and I don't talk about politics or the thought of a war,"" she says, laughing. ""I stopped watching the news all together. It's too depressing."" Sepideh is not unlike millions of Iranians who, like their neighboring Iraqis did in early 2003, fear war is looming. Israel would face challenge in bombing Iran nuclear sites, experts say . Some are less worried than others -- a Tehran fast food worker says Israel has been threatening Iran for years and this time is more of the same bluster. Still, all the bellicose talk from national leaders and punishing international sanctions trickling down to average Iranians who are paying higher prices for food and basic commodities, has cast an uneasy pall over life's routine. Israel has threatened to bomb Iran to end or at least set back Iran's nuclear ambitions. Iran insists its nuclear program is strictly for energy purposes and has said it will not hesitate to strike back at its enemies. U.S. President Barack Obama has stated Iran developing nuclear weapons is not acceptable and that Washington ""will always have Israel's back."" That sort of talk is unsettling to Sepideh, who like others in this story did not want their full names used for fear of repercussion. She tries to go about life focusing on her education and hanging out with friends in tony Tehran coffee shops. She buys Hollywood at the local bazaar and swoons over Johnny Depp. In many ways she is not unlike her American counterparts except that Sepideh lives in the Islamic Republic and her government is considered an enemy of Washington. She thinks longingly about moving to America one day. In her country, she feels, she will never be able to freely express herself or her passion for art, music, films. She cannot fathom why the United States would consider an attack Iran. Opinion: Israel's 'Iron Dome' system isn't enough protection . ""I understand why America doesn't like our government. They don't agree that they should impose Islam on our society but that should not give them a reason for war,"" she says. Her parents worry that the bombing of Iran would create another situation like Iraq in 2003. They are especially concerned because Sepideh's brother is 17 and because of Iran's mandatory conscription, he will have to serve in the military after high school. ""If there were a war, no doubt my brother would be in danger,"" she says. The family has applied for visas through Sepideh's aunt in California. Sepideh prays every night that they will be granted. ""I have faith in (Barack) Obama's policies,"" she says. ""I think he is a smart man who in the end will make the right decision to not start a war with Iran."" Nevertheless, a sense of panic is on the rise in cities and towns across Iran over the prospect of guns and no butter. Tighter sanctions drove down the Iranian currency, the rial, and Iranians gobbled up gold, American dollars and even real estate in order to protect their savings. Food prices have soared, too, prompting some to stockpile basic items in case an even darker day looms over the horizon. This week the strangling of Iran's finances got tighter. SWIFT, the world's largest electronic banking system, agreed to cut off Iranian banks and individuals on the European Union's sanctions list. Starting at noon Saturday, Iran will be severed from the main vehicle for monetary transactions. Iran's business partners, including vital crude oil customers who account for half of the government's revenues, will have to find an alternative way to pay. Beyond staggering inflation and a plunging national currency, analysts fear Iranians now could face shortages of essential goods like food and medicine. Retired elementary school teacher Shikoufeh, 67, lives in the city of Isfahan, just south of Natanz, an uranium enrichment facility for power plants or potentially for bombs. In her modest two-bedroom apartment, she cares for her two grandchildren because her daughter was forced to go back to work to make ends meet. She takes the children for walks in a nearby park and wonders what would happen if Israel conducted military strikes against Iran's nuclear plants and military installations. ""Iranians are educated, fun-loving people,"" she says. ""We are against war and against aggression."" She wishes Americans knew more about the rich history of her country -- art, music, poetry -- and about the turmoil Iranians have survived. ""I honestly think they look at us as terrorists, like the ones that are portrayed in the movies,' she says. ""They think we wear burkas like they do in Afghanistan, and don't allow women to drive like in Saudi Arabia. Iran is different, we are different. We want peace like anyone else in this world."" Shikoufeh's anxiety is heightened on Sundays when she heads to the fruit and vegetable market. Last week, the price of tomatoes went up so much that she could not justify buying them. The butcher told her he hadn't seen profit in two months -- who can afford to buy meat anymore? She tried to buy U.S. dollars recently but the bank informed her of limits on how much she could exchange. ""I always like to save some dollars in my house, just in case,"" she says. Nowruz, the Persian new year, is coming up March 20, but Shikoufeh says this year, the traditional meals and large get togethers will be a lot simpler. ""I'm worried that our beautiful country will become similar to what the Americans did to Iraq,"" she says. ""I pray to God they don't. I love America and love Americans. They are lovely people. But I don't understand the need to meddle in our country's issues."" She says she is willing to live with Iran's problems, if only she could have a guarantee of no war. ""That would be the end to our livelihoods and the little freedom we have now,"" she says. Back in Tehran, Amir, 39, says he is more concerned about facing economic hardship than dodging missiles and rockets. ""It's all bluffing and political nonsense,"" says the university English instructor about threats from Israel and the West. ""This happens every few years between Iran, Israel and the U.S. This is normal,"" he says. ""In a month it will quiet down again and in two years it will flare up again. This is the political wheel, always spinning. Obama has said he doesn't want a war with Iran, and we all know Israel cannot proceed with a war alone."" Amir sees money as his number one problem. He resents having to rely on his parents for support but he, his wife and child are forced to stay in an extra apartment at his parents' home. Even though he has a degree and good job, his salary is no match for the prices at the market. ""My advice to my country is to open our doors to the world,"" he says. ""Let's show them that we have a right to nuclear technology, and that we are not making nuclear weapons. The Western nations always want to have their hands in other countries. I'm pretty sure unemployment and crime is high in America. Shouldn't they be focusing on that?"" The tension within Iran is affecting people outside its borders, too. Tina, 36, and Shermineh, 34, fled Iran with their mother after the 1979 revolution and have not been back since. They have not seen their grandparents since they were babies. Tina says her grandmother weeps on the phone every week when they speak over the continents and oceans. To see her granddaughters again would help her die a ""blessed old woman."" The sisters, who live in Los Angeles, planned to return to their homeland for the very first time for the Persian new year. They booked their tickets and arranged their trip to Tabriz, the city where her family used to live. ""I was most excited about seeing all the places my mom talks about,"" Tina says. That included the house where her mother was born. But a few weeks ago, once news broke of Israel possibly planning a spring strike, Tina's mother canceled the trip for her daughters. ""I understand its for our safety, but I am really disappointed,"" Tina says. ""I hope one day this political mess will clear up and we can go. I'm not giving up, but when I turn on the news, it doesn't seem like things are getting better."" For now all that Tina and her sister will have to wait to see what the future bodes. As will all of Iran.","Tehran college student Sepideh refuses to watch the news .

"Koro, Uganda (CNN) -- One of the abducted boys featured in the viral video demanding the capture of infamous warlord Joseph Kony is now a man and says the time for justice has arrived. Jacob Acaye, now 21, revisited the village where he was abducted by Kony's Lord's Resistance Army to tell why Kony's crimes should not be forgotten. His story has touched millions since it was featured in ""Kony 2012,"" a video from the Invisible Children charity that created a global online buzz and renewed public interest in capturing Kony. Critics have questioned the film's accuracy and warned that it oversimplified the situation in Uganda. Kony first unleashed his fury in eastern Africa more than two decades ago and is wanted for crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. The LRA terrorized Uganda in a brutal campaign against the government and civilian population. Since 2006, when it was pushed out of northern Uganda, it has largely operated in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Central African Republic. Invisible Children aimed to make Kony a household name and drum up global support to end the murders, rapes, abductions and other abuses committed by the LRA. Acaye -- sitting a few meters from where he was abducted -- told CNN: ""Whenever a brother is in a problem, whenever anybody is in a problem, it should get the attention of everyone in the world. ""It has been going on for the last 26 years. It shows that we are failing to solve it. And if there are any means that someone can help and it goes to end, then why not Americans get involved. ""For me the criticism [of ""Kony 2012""] is unfair, because if I am to say it is fair then I wouldn't be here. Right now I wouldn't have been able to go to school. You wouldn't have been able to speak to me right now because I had no hope in my life. I reached even a point when I said, 'I can even die now' because I thought it would be the immediate resolution of my suffering, you know."" Acaye's home was Koro, a small dusty village -- a handful of circular huts off the main north-south road. There is little more than a track through the village and the occasional cockerel wanders from hut to hut. As Acaye squatted down on the edge of Koro he said he has watched an earlier version of the Kony film, but added ""It brings [back] a lot of memories. Sometimes I get sad when I watch it."" LRA rebels raided Koro in the middle of the night, smashing down the door in the hut where he was sleeping. He says they took 40 children that night. Acaye said his brother tried to escape the LRA but was captured and executed. It was the sight of his brother being killed that made Acaye realize he had no choice but to try to escape. He managed to reach the town of Gulu, about 11 kilometers (7 miles) from his village, and a shelter where he found safety. Now, after more than five years of peace in Northern Uganda many wonder if the online movie highlighting Kony's crimes is too late. Acaye is now chasing the childhood ambition he thought was lost forever -- studying law in Uganda's capital, Kampala. He says the LRA has left his village but justice must be done.","A man abducted as a boy by the Lord's Resistance Army says it's time to bring its leader Joseph Kony to justice .

"(CNN) -- David Nalbandian is under police investigation for an alleged assault after a line judge was injured when the Argentine tennis star kicked over an advertising board in Sunday's Queen's Club final. London's Metropolitan Police confirmed to CNN Monday that a complaint had been received following the incident, which led to Nalbandian's disqualification, with Croatian Marin Cilic awarded the title. ""We are aware of an incident which took place at the Aegon Championships on June 17,"" said a police spokesman. ""A complaint of assault has been made and the Metropolitan Police Service is now investigating."" Nalbandian was a set up, but trailing in the second when his frustrations boiled over after failing to return a Cilic service. He lashed out at a court side advertising board, behind which line judge Andrew McDougall was sitting. The force of the kick dislodged the display, which hit McDougall and left him a nasty gash to his left leg. McDougall was seen to angrily remonstrate with Nalbandian, who was defaulted for ""unsportsmanlike conduct."" ATP supervisor Tom Barnes confirmed that he had been left with no other choice, much to the disappointment of a capacity crowd who had been enjoying a closely contested final. ""Once I saw the injury it was not a judgment call. I didn't have any other option,"" he told the official ATP Tour website. Nalbandian forfeited the $56,802 prize money and the 150 ranking points he would have received and later Monday was fined $12,564 by the ATP for his actions. Nalbandian, who was defaulted for insulting a linesman at tournament in Chile in 2002, said he regretted the latest incident. ""I made a mistake and I apologize,"" the 30-year-old told the official ATP Tour website. ""I feel very sorry to the guy. I didn't want to do that. This is a bad situation for everybody that I really apologize for."" The official tournament website said McDougall had been tended to by St John's Ambulance and ATP medical staff but did not need any further treatment.","London's Metropolitan Police to investigate assault allegation against David Nalbandian .

"(CNN) -- Travel to Shekou, a port city in Shenzhen, and you will find the stirrings of something unexpected: entrepreneurial capitalism. This part of China, home to many mega-factories like those of Foxconn (which makes Apple's iPads) is known as the world's workshop. But if you visit Microport, a startup firm funded by venture capital, you will find a group of tech entrepreneurs with a global mindset trying to disrupt an overpriced, legacy-ridden industry (in their case, the one for medical diagnostics equipment). In the staff canteen hangs a portrait of the late Steve Jobs uttering his motto, ""Stay hungry, stay foolish."" Microport's dynamic founder says his dream is for China to become an innovation powerhouse that produces its own homegrown Apple. Much has been made about Chinese sweatshops sucking away American jobs, of currency manipulation and unfair trade practices. In fact, there's a bigger threat to American competitiveness. Cheap China is fading fast, and innovative China is emerging. The Chinese government is investing tens of billions of dollars into science and engineering research and education, and lavishing tax breaks and subsidies on technology firms and clusters, in an effort to leapfrog the country to the cutting edge of innovation. How should America and other developed economies respond and stay on top in the 21st century's ideas economy? For a start, do no harm. Politicians should remember that global innovation is not a zero-sum game: China's rise does not have to come at America's expense. Three decades ago, many Cassandras wailed that Japan, with its centrally planned innovation investments and its superior cultural values, would crush the West. In fact, Japan's peaceful rise went hand in hand with America's entrepreneurs forging the new industries of the digital age. That is why bashing China and using it as an excuse for industrial policies that subsidize uncompetitive domestic companies is a folly. This applies as much to Solyndra, a bankrupt American solar firm that got taxpayer subsidies, as it does to the lagging French toymaking industry, which has been declared ""strategic."" An even more dangerous prospect is a trade war, something that might happen as a result of Western governments ganging up on China at the World Trade Organization over its policies on rare Earth minerals. Top-down efforts to pick technology winners are bound to waste taxpayers' money. And forcing a trade war would actually hurt America, since its economy benefits the most from an open global flow of goods, people and ideas. America's leaders should see China's inexorable surge as a rising tide that can lift all boatsâ€”providing, of course, that you patch the holes in your vessel first. That means shoring up the things that made America the world's innovation powerhouse in the first place. First, America needs to reverse its policies that, since 9/11, have turned hostile toward talented immigrants. For decades, the American economy benefited from the gift of the world's brightest and most enterprising. Studies have shown that more than a third of the start-ups in Silicon Valley have at least one founder born in India or China. Bill Gates points out the absurdity of today's immigration policies. Brilliant Chinese students make up much of the graduate program in computer science at the University of California at Berkeley, benefiting from a subsidized education. When they graduate and want to start companies that would hire many Americans, they are refused visas. So, as Gates notes, they go home and start companies there that compete with America instead. Another hole that needs to be patched is in research funding. America's funding for research, measured as a percent of national output, has stagnated even as the rising giants of the developing world are investing heavily. It is wise to invest during economic recessions in those few thingsâ€”like education, smart infrastructure and researchâ€”that are the essential enablers of longer term innovation, productivity and higher economic growth. Finally, America can make it easier for young firms, which have created almost all the net new jobs the last few decades, to find capital. Banks usually refuse to fund start-ups, and even many venture capitalists have turned risk averse. Typically, entrepreneurs rely on friends, family and fools. But an important bill in Congress now that has support from both parties and the White House would make it easier to tap wider networks through ""crowdfunding."" Congress should pass this bill quickly, and help entrepreneurial energy to kick-start growth. The surest path from stagnation to rejuvenation lies in innovation. If America wants to stay at the top, it needs to gear up on innovation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Vijay V. Vaitheeswaran.","Vijay Vaitheeswaran: Cheap China is fading fast, and innovative China is emerging .

"(CNN) -- Peru's president arrived Tuesday night at a mine in southern Peru, where he was expected to lead an operation to reach nine trapped miners. ""We have been able to talk with the miners. Their spirits are quite high,"" President Ollanta Humala told reporters outside the mine. But more work needs to be done before the rescue begins, Humala said. Engineers were working to make sure the mine was secure ""so there are no victims,"" he said. ""Those same engineers tell us that we have to wait a few hours. They haven't said how many,"" the president said. The miners have been stuck since Thursday in the wildcat Cabeza de Negro mine in southern Peru. Earlier Tuesday, one of the mining engineers in charge of the rescue declined to give a specific time frame for the operation. ""We can't say how long it will take right now to get them out, but I can guarantee that they are alive, that they are in good health, and that ultimately they are going to be freed alive,"" engineer Carlos Bejarano said. A cave-in over the weekend complicated efforts. ""It's very complicated work. We're taking into account all the necessary security measures to avoid risks among the rescuers themselves,"" said Cesar Chonate, a regional head of Peru's civil defense agency, the state-run Andina news agency reported. Video from state-run TV Peru showed workers, wearing hard hats and headlamps, loading rocks into a pushcart by hand. It was not clear what caused the initial collapse. The miners have been getting oxygen, food and water through a tube, which has also allowed them to stay in contact with people above ground, Andina reported. Peruvian Mining Minister Jorge Merino was also in the area and appealed to mining companies for their expertise, according to a statement from his office. Mining is big business in Peru, which is a major world producer of copper, silver, gold and other minerals. ""The important thing is that the nine people are alive. We won't abandon them,"" Merino said. The ordeal stirred memories of a 2010 Chilean mine collapse in which 33 men were trapped underground for 69 days. All those miners were rescued, pulled one by one from hundreds of meters beneath the Earth's surface with a specially designed capsule.","NEW: Peru's president says it will be ""a few hours"" before the rescue begins .

"(CNN) -- Mario Gomez gave Bayern Munich a precious 2-1 advantage in their Champions League tie against Real Madrid with an 90th minute winner in the first leg in the Allianz Arena Tuesday. The match looked headed for a draw until the prolific striker connected with Philipp Lahm's right wing cross to give Bayern a deserved victory. They had gone ahead through Franck Ribery in the first half with Mesut Ozil leveling in a rare Real Madrid attack just after the break. Gomez had endured a frustrating night, wasting an earlier gilt-edged chance to put them ahead for a second time when he shot over from close range. But he was rewarded for his persistence with his 40th goal of the season to give the Bavarian giants real hope of reaching the final which will be played in their home stadium next month. English Premier League Chelsea entertain reigning champions Barcelona in the second semifinal first leg Wednesday. La Liga leaders Real had gone into their away tie as favorites to progress, but from the early moments it was clear Bayern would be a difficult proposition. Ribery felt he should have had a penalty when his shirt was tugged by Sergio Ramos, but English referee Howard Webb waved away the protests. The French international did not have long to wait to be celebrating as he latched on to a loose ball in the Real penalty area from a corner and lashed his shot past Iker Casillas. Gomez had the first of his chances before halftime as Casillas turned behind his shot and it looked to be costly as Real equalized in the 53rd minute. Cristiano Ronaldo wasted the first chance as his weak shot was saved by Manuel Neuer. But Karim Benzema picked up the rebound and his shot across the goal came to Ronaldo, who cut it back for Ozil to shoot home from close range. It was the precursor for a good spell for Real but Bayern regrouped and began to create opportunities again. Gomez lifted his effort over in the 71st minute and then headed straight at Casillas. He also had penalty appeals waved away before striking late in typical fashion after superb work from the tireless Lahm. Real boss Jose Mourinho, whose team face an El Clasico showdown with Barcelona Saturday, is still confident his team will progress. ""We have the second leg to come and it's not like we have to make a historical comeback, what we have to do is very achievable,"" he told gathered reporters. ""If we win at home, we are there. I am optimistic we can return here to play the final.""","Bayern Munich beat Real Madrid 2-1 in Champions League semifinal first leg .

"(CNN) -- After a gut-wrenching collapse on the final day of the 2011 Masters, questions were asked about Rory McIlroy's mental fortitude and his ability to compete for golf's major honors. But two months later, at June's U.S. Open, the Northern Irishman produced a resounding response to his doubters by romping to a record-breaking eight-shot victory at Congressional. When the eyes of the golfing world fall on Augusta next month for the first major of 2012, it will offer the world No. 2 a chance to reflect on how he turned a soul-crushing low into a redemptive high. ""Last year's Masters was definitely a defining moment for me,"" the 22-year-old told the European Tour's website when asked about the tournament eventually won by South African Charl Schwartzel. Can Tiger cap comeback with Masters triumph? ""It could have been a crossroads in my career. I could have done what I did on Sunday at Augusta and let it affect me and let it get to me, and maybe go into a slump, or get down or feel sorry for myself."" But far from wallowing in self pity, McIlroy excelled at the next major. His 16-under-par total of 268 bettered a record previously held by 14-time championship winner Tiger Woods at Pebble Beach in 2000. After clinching a first major in 2011, McIlroy reached another career landmark early in the 2012 season. He became the youngest world No. 1 since Woods with victory at Palm Beach earlier this month, usurping Ryder Cup teammate Luke Donald. ""It was a big crossroads for me in my career,"" he said. ""I was able to go down the right path and put things right by winning the next major. ""All I wanted to do was put myself in that position again just to see if I could handle it better -- and I proved to myself that I could."" McIlroy admitted one of the biggest mistakes he made during the final round of last year's Masters was to become preoccupied with his rivals, rather than focusing on his own game. It is an error he is keen to avoid on his fourth visit to the Augusta National Golf Club. ""One of the worst things I did was just trying to stay ahead of everyone else. Instead, I maybe should have had a number in my head, like getting to 15 under. That way, you have a target, and that's all you're thinking about. ""You're not thinking about all these guys you're trying to keep ahead of. All you're thinking about is that target of 15 under ... You can't let your mind wander and start thinking about what anyone else is doing."" Donald regained the No.1 spot with victory at the recent Transitions Championships. Nevertheless, McIlroy's profile in the U.S. remains high. Partly, it is due to his contrasting experiences at the Masters and then the U.S. Open. But his romance with former world No. 1 tennis ace Caroline Wozniacki has also ensured he is firmly in the media spotlight. ""It will be very different this year,"" he said after of the tournament getting under way on April 5. ""I wasn't necessarily under the radar last year, but I'll be going there with a lot more attention. ""I'll try to take the same approach to the tournament as I did last year. The week before, I'll go up to Augusta for a couple of days, do what I usually do . ""Speaking about it makes me excited about going back there, and I can't wait for it to start now.""","Rory McIlroy spurned a four-shot lead on the final day of the 2011 Masters .

"(CNN) -- As the Los Angeles Lakers take to the court Tuesday for Game 2 of the NBA playoffs, a key question is whether the team's forward Jordan Hill will square off against the Denver Nuggets. Authorities in Texas have charged Hill, 24, with assaulting a family member, a felony that could yield up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 if he is convicted. Donna Hawkins, the assistant district attorney in Harris County, said Monday an arrest warrant for Hill will be issued once the magistrate has signed the paperwork -- unless the player turns himself in first. After a lengthy training session Monday, Hill issued a statement apologizing to fans ""for the untimeliness of these accusations."" Hill, who scored 10 points and 10 rebounds in the Lakers' 103-88 win over the Nuggets on Sunday, told reporters he did not expect to miss any games. ""I'll be here,"" he said. The charge stems from an incident on February 29 when Hill allegedly choked his girlfriend of two years at his home in Houston after the two got into an argument about their ""future,"" authorities said. According to the probable cause affidavit, Hill became angry when the 28-year-old girlfriend tossed his two cell phones to the floor. He struck her legs with his fist, pulled her off the couch, dragged her to where the phones were and threw her against a wall, the affidavit said. He demanded she pick up his phones, and put her into a chokehold, the affidavit said. ""She stated that she pulled at the Defendant's forearm to stop the suffocation. Complainant stated she was unable to breathe and gasping for air,"" it said. Hawkins said the victim has requested a protective order. The charge of assaulting a family member applies even when the person is someone the defendant is dating, she said. In his statement, Hill said his lawyers were gathering facts and that he planned to cooperate with authorities. ""I'm saddened to learn of the accusations that were filed against me today,"" Hill said. ""I promise to keep my focus and attention on the playoffs during this time and to helping my team with another championship,"" he added. Hill was traded to the Lakers on March 15, and made seven regular-season appearances. At the time of the incident, he was a member of the Houston Rockets. Last week, another Laker forward, Metta World Peace, was suspended for seven games without pay over an elbow blow he delivered to the head of Oklahoma City Thunder's James Harden. CNN's Carma Hassan contributed to this report.","A conviction can yield up to 10 years in prison .

"(CNN) -- The Golden Gate Bridge got its chance to shine Sunday, with people around the Bay Area flocking to the iconic span to celebrate its 75th birthday. Festivities that began in the morning and continued into the evening along San Francisco's northern waterfront within sight of the two legendary orange towers included musical and dance performances on stages in Crissy Field and Marina Green plus a historic watercraft parade. The aircraft carrier USS Nimitz passed under the bridge during the day, with its sailors saluting as sailboats flanked the ship. And there were less expected tributes as well, like the skywriter who spelled out ""Happy 75th"" above San Francisco Bay. Beacon in the bay: Golden Gate turns 75 . Twitter was abuzz Sunday with people offering ""feliz cumpleanos"" (""happy birthday"" in Spanish) and other salutations, with new messages appearing every few seconds. ""Happy 75th Birthday to San Franciscos Golden Gate Bridge! You are beautiful,"" wrote one woman. The fun climaxes once the sun goes down over the abutting Pacific Ocean, with fireworks planned for 9:30 p.m. (12:30 a.m. ET) that aim to showcase the bridge, bay and nearby national parks, according to the official Golden Gate Bridge 75th Anniversary website. From a practical standpoint, the suspension bridge has served a key role connecting San Francisco and Marin County since opening to vehicles on May 28, 1937, a little more than four years after construction on it began. LIFE: 75 years of the Golden Gate Bridge in pictures . In the time since the first vehicles rolled across the 4,200-foot main span between the bridge's two towers, the Golden Gate has gained symbolic significance as emblematic of the Bay Area. And many have admired it for its artistic merit, with the bridge serving as the backdrop for countless photos, paintings and more. The bridge was made for superlatives and wow-inducing numbers, as provided by the Golden Gate Bridge Highway & Transportation District: . -- Each tower has approximately 600,000 rivets. -- The 4,200-foot suspension span was the longest in the world until New York's Verrazano-Narrows Bridge opened in 1964. -- Painting is an ongoing task, because it protects the bridge from high salt content in the air, which corrodes steel components. -- The bridge has been closed three times because of weather, most recently for nearly three-and-a-half hours on December 3, 1983, due to high winds that gusted up to 75 mph. On Sunday cars appeared to be moving smoothly over the bridge during the afternoon, though traffic backups may be in the forecast at night -- specifically between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m., when the bridge will close to vehicles. As for San Francisco's signature fog, the National Weather Service predicted patchy fog won't roll in until after 11 p.m. Mostly cloudy skies and winds gusting as strong as 23 mph are forecast for during the night.","San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge opened in May 1937 .

"(Mashable)  -- UK artist Banksy, he of the guerilla techniques and ever-increasing popularity, is about to be unceremoniously identified to the highest bidder in an eBay auction, which ends Wednesday. At press time, the winning bidder is offering one slim dollar shy of a million. Bidding started at $3,000; the auction has had 38 bids. In the listing, the seller states, ""I have uncovered [Banksy's] identity by matching up the prices of his sold pieces to corresponding tax records. I will reveal no more details... I give you 100% assurance that it is most certainly the full name of the street artist known as 'Banksy.'"" The seller also says that eBay had previously terminated his auction because he was selling an intangible good; the seller is now technically offering for auction a piece of paper containing Banksy's legal name. The party offering Banksy's identity is hardly a power seller, having a fairly sparse but mostly positive record that dates back to 2001. At this time, we have no way of determining whether the winning bidder is being taken to the cleaners to the tune of $1 million or whether the seller is legitimately peddling an exclusive glimpse into the identity of a public figure who clearly wants to be anything but public. However, we read on the artist's website that not all Banksy work that is sold necessarily corresponds to the artist himself. CNN: Banksy still hiding in plain sight .

"(CNN) -- One of the world's largest pulp and paper companies is destroying Indonesia's rainforests and taking away the habitat of rare animals, environmental group Greenpeace charged Tuesday. The Greenpeace report accuses Asia Pulp and Paper of ""relentlessly trashing rainforests, driving species extinction and, if left unchecked, will threaten Indonesia's efforts to address climate change."" APP, a division of Sinar Mas, denied the charges levied by Greenpeace, including the alleged expansion of logging operations by 17 million hectares (42 million acres). ""The allegations are totally illogical and untrue, Asia Pulp and Paper has no plans for the expansions in question,"" said Aida Greenbury, an APP spokeswoman, who said the Indonesian government has publicly announced that their quota for pulp and paper is 10 million hectares (25 million acres) by 2014. ""I urged Greenpeace to do a proper research before putting such allegations"" Greenbury added. Sinar Mas, which also has a palm oil arm, has long be a target of Greenpeace efforts to curb deforestation. The environmental group says the land cleared for palm oil plantations, and for pulp and paper products is doing long-term damage to Indonesia's rainforests and the environment. Greenpeace says a $1 billion deal between Norway and Indonesia announced in May to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through a moratorium on logging has a loophole that would allow APP to clear sensitive forest and peatlands. ""Millions of hectares of forests -- including hundreds of thousands of hectares under Sinar Mas control -- are not part of the deal with Norway,"" said Bustar Maitar, a Greenpeace Southeast Asia forest campaigner. ""This loophole will undermine all attempts to reduce Indonesia's emissions. President (Susilo Bambang) Yudhoyono must act immediately by implementing a moratorium on all forest destruction and ensure the protection of peatlands. Only then will we be able to really reduce Indonesia's GHG emissions."" Indonesia is one of the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases because of rampant clearing and burning of its forests and peat lands for logging and conversion into palm oil plantations. The country has long been a target of harsh criticisms from environmental groups who have accused the government of failing to enforce its own laws. Yudhoyono said in May that Indonesia would ""conduct a moratorium for two years where we stop the conversion of peat land and of forest."" He was joined by Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, who said Norway would provide $1 billion to Indonesia to help with the effort to reduce deforestation. ""Indonesia is a key country in terms of reducing deforestation. Therefore this agreement and Indonesia's commitment is a great step forward in achieving large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions,"" Stoltenberg said. Yudhoyono said the halt on new concessions would start in 2010 as part of a broader strategy to reduce the nation's greenhouse gas emissions by at least 26 percent by 2020. Deforestation accounts for almost a fifth of total greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. The Indonesia-Norway partnership to cut emissions is part of a broader international strategy called Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation, or REDD, that would make stored carbon dioxide in tropical forests a commodity that can be bought and sold on the global market.","Asia Pulp and Paper accused of destroying rainforests and habitat .

"(CNN) -- Didier Drogba has confirmed he is leaving Chelsea, a decision which means the striker's last kick of a ball for the English club will be the penalty that sealed a first European Champions League crown on Saturday. The Ivory Coast forward scored the decisive spot kick as Chelsea defeated Bayern Munich to secure club football's most coveted trophy, but he is to seek pastures new when his contract expires in June. The 34-year-old has scored 157 goals in 341 appearances since he signed for the west London club from French side Marseille back in 2004 and he has been linked with a big-money move to China. He told Chelsea's official website: ""I wanted to put an end to all the speculation and confirm that I am leaving. Chelsea win Champions League after shoot out drama in Munich . ""It has been a very difficult decision for me to make and I am very proud of what we have achieved but the time is right for a new challenge for me.""

He has finished as the Premier League's top scorer on two occasions and has twice been voted the Players' Player of the Year. ""As a team we have accomplished so much and have won every single trophy possible,"" he added. ""Saturday was a very special moment for everyone at the club and for all the fans, and I am very proud to have played my part in bringing many trophies to this club, which has been my home for the last eight years.

Drogba was signed by Jose Mourinho, who now coaches Spanish giants Real Madrid, and has spearheaded Chelsea's front line for the best part of a decade. He has the reputation of being a big-game player and has scored nine goals in cup final matches for Chelsea.

"(CNN) -- It was the scene for one of the most famous controversies in soccer history. Did England striker Geoff Hurst's shot during the 1966 World Cup final at Wembley cross the line? The Russian who was running the line that day thought so and his decision helped England to a 4-2 win over West Germany -- their only major tournament success to date. Forty-six years later, the same London stadium will provide the setting for a major test of pioneering goal-line technology (GLT), that could revolutionize the game of football forever. British firm ""Hawk-eye"" employ a series of cameras mounted inside the goal frame and their approach will be tested during England's Euro 2012 warm-up match with Belgium, though none of the information will be available to the match officials. Goal-line technology enters final testing . Scientists and FIFA officials will analyze the results and if they prove successful, the technology could be ratified at a meeting of the International Football Association Board (IFAB) in early July. The experiment in front of an estimated crowd of 90,000 at Wembley follows the first Hawk-eye trial at a non-league English cup match earlier this month. An alternative system, designed by German company ""GoalRef"" is also in the final stages of testing. It is somewhat ironic the technology is to be examined during an England match as the team were on the wrong end of a refereeing decision at the 2010 World Cup. Frank Lampard's shot was disallowed during a second round match with Germany despite replays showing the ball was a full yard over the goal-line. That incident in South Africa prompted FIFA to overturn their long-held stance on goal-line technology and begin trials. A statement on FIFA's website said: ""Only the EMPA observers, IFAB and FIFA representatives at Wembley will have access to the GLT system readings. ""Therefore, should a goal-line incident occur at this or any of the 'test' matches, the system will not be utilized by the match officials. It means the GLT system will have no influence on the outcome of the matches in which the system is being tested. ""Such tests, along with those being conducted for the GoalRef system in Denmark, could lead to the International Football Association Board approving the introduction of GLT at its special meeting at the beginning of July."" There have been several contentious incidents in the last English season that has renewed calls for the technology to be introduced. Chelsea were awarded a goal in an FA Cup semifinal against Tottenham at Wembley that was shown not to have crossed the line, while Queens Park Rangers defender Clint Hill's header against Bolton wasn't given despite being well over the line. English Premier League chairman Richard Scudamore has said he is keen to introduce the technology next season if it is rubber-stamped by FIFA. FIFA have also confirmed that referees are to be drug tested to check they are not taking performance enhancing substances. At a meeting of the world governing body's executive committee, chief medical officer Jiri Dvorak said match officials should be subject to the same tests as players. ""We have to consider referees as part of the game,"" he was quoted as saying by the UK Press Association. ""We have started to discuss this and this is something for the future which will be discussed to include possibly an anti-doping program for referees. ""We do not have an indication that this is a problem but this is something we have to look at. The referees are a neglected population.""","FIFA to trial goal-line technology during England's friendly with Belgium at Wembley .

"(CNN) -- A Russian man the FBI believes has been responsible for one-third of the spam you get in your inbox pleaded not guilty Friday at his arraignment in a Milwaukee, Wisconsin, federal court. According to court documents and FBI affidavits, experts looking into the ""Mega-D"" spam automated botnet -- which is a prime source for selling counterfeit goods -- identified Oleg Nikolaenko, 23, as the plan's mastermind. ""'Mega-D"" was likely the largest botnet in the world, accounting for 32 percent of all spam,"" the court documents said. ""Security researchers estimated that the botnet was capable of sending ten billion spam e-mail messages a day."" On Friday, Nikolaenko pleaded not guilty to charges related to federal anti-spam legislation. He was denied bail because he was considered a flight risk, CNN Milwaukee affiliate WDJT reported. Court documents show the scope of the counterfeit ring and authorities' attempts to track down Nikolaenko. A glimpse into how much the operation may have made can be seen in the documents, which allege that Nikolaenko received $459,098.47 between June 4 and December 5, 2007, through his work distributing e-mails peddling everything from advertised erectile dysfunction drugs, other counterfeit prescriptions and ""herbal remedies."" Authorities got a break when a they arrested a seller of counterfeit Rolexes, who told them that he paid spammers $2 million to help sell his product. That man gave federal agents information that led them across several continents, to different e-mail addresses and websites and, eventually, to Nikolaenko, authorities said. FBI agents and the Federal Trade Commission had been monitoring him since at least 2007, according to court documents. That included two trips that the Russian took to the United States last year. Nikolaenko was finally caught November 4, while in Las Vegas, Nevada, for an auto show. Christopher Van Wagner, Nikolaenko's lawyer, told WDJT that his client is ""merely accused ... of essentially a low-level felony crime."" ""You folks in the media have dubbed him the King of Spam, or maybe the prosecutor has,"" Van Wagner said Friday.

"(CNN) -- Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's a Batmobile-like race car which will take to the track at the legendary Le Mans 24 Hour event in June. Nissan's experimental DeltaWing, which bears a startling resemblance to the vehicle made famous by the ""Caped Crusader,"" was unveiled by the Japanese manufacturer in London on Tuesday. The purpose of the car is to promote fuel efficiency, with the DeltaWing's 1.6 liter engine set to complete motorsport's legendary endurance challenge using half the gas of its regular counterparts. Despite being granted entry to the marquee French race, the DeltaWing will not be counted in the final Le Mans 24 Hour classification as it is participating as an experimental vehicle. ""This announcement gives Nissan the opportunity to become part of a ground-breaking motorsport project, and one which could shape the future of the sport,"" Nissan's executive vice president Andy Palmer said in a statement. ""As motor racing rulebooks have become tighter over time, racing cars look more and more similar and the technology used has had less and less relevance to road car development. ""Nissan DeltaWing aims to change that, and we are delighted to have become part of the project."" The DeltaWing's radical design has half the aerodynamic drag of a conventional car and is only half the weight. It can also produce 300 bhp (horsepower) thanks to a turbocharged four-cylinder engine. Rather than being piloted by Bruce Wayne's vigilante alter ego, the first two drivers of the DeltaWing will be Britain's Marino Franchitti, the younger brother of IndyCar legend Dario Franchitti, and Michael Krumm of Germany.

"(Rolling Stone) -- Kanye West premiered his much-discussed short film/art installation ""Cruel Summer"" at the Cannes Film Festival last night. Starring Kid Cudi as a car thief who falls in love with a blind Arabian princess, the clip is the project he was reportedly working on in the Middle East in February. The film's cast also includes Razane Jammal, Pusha T, Big Sean, Palestinian actor Ali Suliman, Aziz Ansari and West himself. As MTV points out, ""Cruel Summer"" is similar to West's 2010 short film ""Runaway"" in that it's an extended music video with little dialogue and plenty of striking imagery. ""Cruel Summer"" utilizes seven screens and features completely new music from West and his G.O.O.D. Music affiliates that will reportedly appear on an album, also titled Cruel Summer, set for release sometime this year. Reactions to the music have been overwhelmingly positive, with MTV calling it ""rocking"" and GQ senior editor Logan Hill tweeting from the premiere that the music ""was the best part -- big complex production, huge beats."" The Hollywood Reporter noted multiple instances of chair-dancing in the audience. Response to the film has also been generally warm. The Los Angeles Times film blog 24 Frames wrote, ""The story is secondary to the pyrotechnics, with new music from West and a thumping surround-sound quality that makes a 3D Michael Bay effort feel like an iPad short."" Vulture, meanwhile, praised West's ""great visual sense"" and noted the effectiveness of the special camera rig invented for the film to incorporate all seven screens, whether it was stretching a single shot across multiple screens or having each display a different image/angle during a single scene. ""The movie is all Kanye's vision -- his images, his music and costumes he designed, mixed with pieces by local Arabian designers,"" wrote Jada Yuan. ""He put it together in two-and-a-half months with only four days of actual shooting."" In a speech following the film, West said, ""I was very particular about having the screens be separate and having it where your mind puts the screens back together -- the way you can put memories together, the way that happens throughout the day and it all links back up."" Vulture also managed to score a comment from one of the many stars in attendance, Jay-Z. ""It's about the things that separate us -- race and class in society and things like that. But the only thing that really binds us is true love,"" he said. West said he will keep working on and improving the film, and he plans to bring it to Qatar and New York in the future. ""I'm not the best director in the world or anything like that, but I had an idea,"" said West during his post-film speech. ""I could dream of, one day, this being the way that people watch movies, in this form where it surrounds you and people want to go back and see it more and more because they missed something else to the left and missed something else to the right, and it felt more like the experience of life.""

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN)  -- Japanese authorities on Friday released an American Marine accused of raping a teenager in Okinawa after the girl dropped the allegations, the U.S. military said. Japanese protest near the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo earlier this month over a Marine accused of rape in Okinawa. The Marine Corps said it is holding Staff Sgt. Tyrone Luther Hadnott, 38, in a Marine facility as it investigates whether he violated codes of military justice. The girl's accusation, which stirred memories of a brutal rape more than a decade ago, triggered outrage across Japan. Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda deplored it as ""unforgivable."" Hadnott was taken into Japanese custody February 11. The allegation also led to tight restrictions for American troops and their families at the U.S. base on Okinawa.  Watch how the military was caught off guard » . All troops stationed on the southern Japanese island have been confined to the base or their off-base residences for a ""period of reflection"" since February 20, except for work, worship, school or medical appointments. ""This period of reflection will allow commanders and all service members an opportunity to further review procedures and orders that govern the discipline and conduct of all U.S. service members serving in Okinawa,"" said a news release from the Marine Corps' Camp Butler on the island. The restrictions remained in place Friday despite Hadnott's release from Japanese custody, the U.S. military said. An evaluation of them has been scheduled for Monday. The U.S. military in Japan also said it formed a sexual assault prevention task force after the allegation arose. More than 40,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan, most of them on Okinawa, which accounts for less than 1 percent of Japan's total area. The troops were placed there under a security alliance after Japan was defeated in World War II and was forced to renounce its right to a military. The U.S. military presence has at times bred resentment among Okinawans, who have long complained about crime, noise and accidents. Anti-American sentiments boiled over in 1995 after three American servicemen kidnapped and gang-raped a 12-year-old Okinawan schoolgirl. Two years ago, a U.S. civilian military employee was sentenced to nine years in prison for raping two women.

"(CNN) -- The United States men's Olympic soccer team had its hopes dashed Monday night after a dramatic late goal killed its chances of going to London. A goal in the 95th minute, during stoppage time, pulled El Salvador to a 3-3 tie and knocked the U.S. team out of qualifying contention. A victory would have put the U.S. for Saturday's semifinals as winner of Group A in the CONCACAF region tournament. It is the second time the U.S. failed to qualify for the Olympics since 1976, according to the U.S. soccer team website, having also missed out in 2004. The last time the El Salvador men's team made it to the Olympics was in 1968. The Central American side finished top of the group on goal difference from Canada, which conceded a late equalizer in Monday's 1-1 draw with Cuba and will now play the winner of the other pool on Saturday. The U.S. team got out to a quick lead in Nashville when forward Terrence Boyd scored a goal inside the first minute, but El Salvador stormed back scoring two goals in the 35th and 38th minutes through Lester Blanco and Andres Flores. The Americans regained the lead with quickfire goals in the 65th and 68th minutes from Boyd and Joe Corona, but could not hold on. El Salvador's Jaime Alas blasted a shot from some 25 yards out with about one minute left in the match, and the ball bounced off the hands of goalkeeper Sean Johnson before darting into the goal. The El Salvador players celebrated while some U.S. players fell to the pitch, inconsolable. ""It's a painful moment. The players are devastated. To put in as much as they put in that game, the amount of heart they put in, to play the way they played in that second half to come from behind and score two goals, to be seconds away from getting the No. 1 seed, it's unimaginable,"" said head coach Caleb Porter. Mexico also qualified for Saturday's semifinals in Kansas City after beating Honduras 3-0 and should qualify top of Group B by winning Tuesday's final game against Panama.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A group that includes former basketball star Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson will acquire the Los Angeles Dodgers for $2 billion, the team said Tuesday night. The price is the most ever paid for a North American sports franchise, according to MLB.com. The group will officially acquire the team, one of baseball's most storied franchises, after the deal is approved by the judge overseeing the Dodgers' bankruptcy. The team has won the World Series championship six times and, for decades, boasted an intensely loyal fan base. But in recent years, under the ownership of real estate developer Frank McCourt, the Dodgers made headlines more for their financial woes than for their home runs. The team's troubles began when McCourt and his wife, Jamie, decided to part ways. An acrimonious and expensive divorce battle followed. The couple fought bitterly over ownership of the team. In April 2011, Major League Baseball took charge of the beleaguered team. Two months later, the team filed for bankruptcy. In October, McCourt announced that he and his wife had reached a settlement. He is scheduled to pay her $131 million, MLB.com reported. Attorneys' fees alone could reach $35 million. In an effort to hold on to the team, McCourt tried to score a $3 billion television deal with Fox, but it was rejected by Commissioner Bud Selig. Johnson said the sale will start a new chapter for the Dodgers. ""I am thrilled to be part of the historic Dodger franchise and intend to build on the fantastic foundation laid by Frank McCourt as we drive the Dodgers back to the front page of the sports section in our wonderful community of Los Angeles,"" said Johnson, a former Los Angeles Laker who is an icon in his own right. Along with Johnson, the group acquiring the team includes Stan Kasten, a former executive with the Atlanta Braves and Washington Nationals, and Guggenheim Partners CEO Mark Walter. Some members of the group will also partner with McCourt to acquire Dodger Stadium and several other nearby properties for $150 million. Legendary former Dodgers coach Tommy Lasorda applauded the sale, saying he has faith in both Johnson and Kasten. ""I'm very impressed with both of them, and I just hope that they can bring the championship to the greatest fans in all of baseball,"" Lasorda said Wednesday. The Dodgers finished in third place in the National League Western Division last season and did not make the playoffs. The club has not won a World Series since 1988, when Lasorda was the manager. Johnson ""can do a lot"" to boost the team, Lasorda said. ""He can talk to the players individually. He can talk to them about winning. He knows what it is to win, and he can transfer that attitude and that success that he has enjoyed to the players."" Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig called Johnson ""a living embodiment of so many of the ideals that are vital to our game and its future."" ""The interest in this franchise and its historic sale price are profound illustrations of the great overall health of our industry,"" Selig said in a statement. ""This has been a long, difficult process, and I once again want to thank the great Dodger fans for their loyalty and patience."" Lakers owner Jerry Buss also issued a statement congratulating Johnson and his partners. ""In addition to being a phenomenal success on the court in leading the Lakers to five NBA Championships, he has been a success in everything else he's become involved with,"" Buss said, ""most notably his spectacular business career and also his educational campaign on behalf of HIV awareness."" Forbes Executive Editor Michael Ozanian said that although his magazine valued the team at $1.4 billion before the sale, the $2 billion paid by Johnson's group may turn out to be a good deal. It depends on the local television rights contract, which could be worth $3.5 billion over 10 years, he said. McCourt stands to clear about $800 million from the sale, even after paying for the divorce, Ozanian said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Congress gave final approval Friday to a giant transportation funding bill as part of a package that includes a measure holding down interest rates on federal student loans. Both issues are priorities of President Barack Obama's, and the legislation demonstrated rare bipartisan agreement in the deeply divided Congress. The package won Senate approval with a 74-19 vote after passing the House 373-52. Hours later, President Barack Obama signed into a law a bill that temporarily -- from June 30 through July 6 -- assures there will be continued funding for certain transportation projects and halts potential student loan interest rate hikes, according to a news release issued by the White House shortly after 8 p.m. Friday. He could sign the larger legislation at a later date, presumably by the end of next week before the stopgap bill expires. Compromises on the transportation bill and the student loan issue, as well as a third component reauthorizing national flood insurance, came in rare bipartisan agreement during the same week that House Republicans enraged Democrats by voting to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress. None of the rancor from Thursday's contempt vote was evident Friday, as legislators involved in reaching the compromise praised the bipartisan effort. The top senators in the negotiations, Democrat Barbara Boxer of California and Republican James Inhofe of Oklahoma, issued a joint statement expressing thanks and praise for all involved in getting the package passed. A White House statement said the legislation prevents middle-class families from getting hurt by congressional inaction on extending transportation funding and preventing the federal student loan rate from doubling. Passing the package meant Congress beat looming deadlines, with highway repair funding and the lower student loan rates set to expire Saturday. The transportation bill funds construction for highways, bridges and other transportation projects for two years in every state and congressional district in the nation. Obama has pushed for it as a way to boost job growth in the construction industry, and both parties expressed interest in reaching a deal. Still, enactment of the measure marks a significant accomplishment for legislators. In recent years, Congress was able to agree only on a series of short-term extensions of the previous transportation bill passed in 2005. Aides predicted the final bill would get the large bipartisan majorities it did, although some Republicans opposed the measure's price of just over $100 billion. Both parties had to compromise on core issues. Republicans dropped language that would have approved the Keystone XL pipeline and prevented the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating harmful coal ash waste from power plants. Democrats were forced to accept GOP demands to streamline and speed up the federal review process of construction projects. Republicans said that doing so would cut permitting times in half. They also got reforms that would allow states to opt out of federal mandates to spend highway dollars on bike paths and highway beautification projects. Doing so, Republicans said, would allow states to spend more on critical infrastructure projects. Although the agreement includes many of the reforms the House GOP pushed for, it falls far short of the broader transportation and energy bill that House Speaker John Boehner unveiled this year. Boehner, R-Ohio, framed that initial proposal -- which combined road and bridge projects with provisions promoting greater domestic energy production such as more drilling on public lands and approval of the Keystone XL pipeline -- as a major jobs bill. However, internal GOP divisions forced House Republican leaders to pull the measure and it never got a floor vote. The energy portions of the bill did pass the House, but none of those were included in the final measure negotiated with the Senate. The student loan measure will keep interest rates at the current 3.4% rate, which was set to double to 6.8% on Sunday. Obama brought national attention to the student loan issue and started campaigning for it in April. After the certain Republican candidate for president, Mitt Romney, also said he supported extending the lower rate, Congress got serious about looking for ways to make it happen for another year. During negotiations this week, legislators decided the revenue to pay the $6 billion cost should come from changes to the way companies fund pension programs. The deal would also limit how long undergraduate students can go to school without accruing interest on student loans to six years. CNNMoney's Jennifer Liberto and CNN's Ted Barrett and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama signs a stopgap bill affecting transportation funding, student loan rates .

The move would separate the 20th Century Fox film studio, Fox broadcast network and Fox News Channel from newspapers and book publishing, according to The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, in which the proposal was first reported. News Corp.'s publishing unit includes newspapers such as The Times of London and The New York Post. Its book publishing assets include HarperCollins. News Corp. is controlled by media magnate Rupert Murdoch. He has been grappling in recent months with criminal investigations into his company over allegations of hacking into people's phones and improper collusion with British police. The scandal prompted News Corp. to shut down its venerable old British tabloid News of the World last year. A report last month from a British Parliament committee said that Murdoch was not a ""fit person to exercise the stewardship of a major international company."" News Corp. said Wednesday night it would have no comment on The Wall Street Journal's report.","Wall Street Journal: News Corp. board agrees to split company .

"(CNN) -- Arch rivals Barcelona and Real Madrid meet for the sixth time this season Saturday in an El Clasico clash which is likely to decide the destination of the Spanish title. Reigning champions Barcelona will have home advantage at their Camp Nou stadium, but trail Real by four points with only five games remaining. A draw would leave Los Blancos in pole position to reclaim the La Liga crown after four years but assistant coach Aitor Karanka said they would approach the heavyweight clash in positive fashion. ""We will play the same way we did in our last three games at the Camp Nou. We did everything in our power in three different championships and gave good performances,"" he told the official Real Madrid website. Karanka, once again fronting up to the media in the absence of his boss Jose Mourinho, said that whatever the outcome his team were still in good position for ultimate success in the championship race. ""I believe the three points at stake are important because there fewer games left in the competition. Whatever the score, four games will remain and we'll continue to work as naturally as we've been doing so far. Win, draw or lose, this team is doing a very good job this year and we will keep it up."" he added. Barcelona have cut into Real's lead, which stood at 10 points just over a month ago, with draws against Malaga, Villarreal and Valencia holding up the pacesetters. By contrast, Pep Guardiola's Barcelona have mounted a late charge with 11 straight La Liga wins with Lionel Messi in free scoring form with 18 goals in that run. It has taken his personal tally to the season to a remarkable 63 in all competitions. Fellow superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has also maintained his scoring streak for Real, 53 for the season and tied with Messi in the battle for the 'Pichichi' trophy awarded to top striker in La Liga. Both have 41. It's no wonder Guardiola believes the battle between the two might well decide the outcome of Saturday's showdown. ""Leo Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo feed off each other, they are apart from everyone else. We're lucky to be afforded the chance to enjoy some great football players. They are decisive players. They score when the team is playing well or when the team is playing poorly,"" he told reporters. Unusually, both teams go into the frenetic atmosphere of an El Clasico clash off the back of rare defeats. Real lost 2-1 Tuesday at Bayern Munich in the first leg of their Champions League semifinal, while Barcelona suffered a 1-0 reverse at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge stadium 24 hours later. They will be favorites to turn around the ties in their home legs to set up the possibility of a seventh El Clasico of the season in the final at Bayern's Allianz Arena next month. Keir Radnedge, the executive editor of World Soccer, told CNN that neither side was likely to be affected by the setbacks. ""The extra day's rest might be important (for Real) but there were no serious injuries for either side and after all they both just lost by one goal,"" he said. For now the focus will be on the league clash and the odds are against Mourinho, despite his incredible managerial record in four countries. Since taking charge at the Bernabeu in the summer of 2010 his team has only beaten Barcelona once in 10 attempts, the final of the Copa Del Rey last season with Ronaldo scoring the winner in extra time. Radnedge believes Mourinho will be making La Liga success for his team a priority, even over the Champions League crown. ""La Liga very definitely,"" he said. ""They want to get past this jinx and I would imagine if Mourinho achieved that he could move on to his next challenge,"" he said. But his side will have to buck the form book. This season their Catalan rivals have beaten them over two legs in the Spanish Super Cup and the quarterfinal of the Copa Del Rey, again over two legs. A 3-1 league win for Barcelona in December in the Bernabeu may also be a pointer. Midfield star Xavi scored in that win and will be making a record 32nd El Clasico appearance should he get on the pitch on Saturday night.","Barcelona and Real Madrid meet in El Clasico at the Camp Nou on Saturday .

"Washington (CNN) -- A divided Supreme Court spent this week's final oral argument on health care reform Wednesday examining whether states would be ""coerced"" by the federal government to expand their share of Medicaid costs by the risk of losing funding if they refused to take part. The session concluded three days of public debate on the 2010 Affordable Health Act and focused on the contentious legal issue of federal versus state powers, in this case involving the Medicaid government-run health care for the poor and disabled. Medicaid, which operates on federal and state funding, would be expanded under the health care reform law, and 26 states filed legal challenges against what they contended was an unfair burden forced on them by Washington. Court tackles question: Would all of health law be scrapped? The debate on Medicaid was especially divided along ideological lines. Paul Clement, arguing for the states that say they would suffer under the new Medicaid requirements, met skepticism from many on the left. Justice Elena Kagan noted that 90% of current Medicaid funding comes from Washington and asked if it would be a bad deal ""if the government were to give boatloads of money to the states."" When Clement replied yes, Kagan erupted, saying ""Wow, wow!"" and shaking her head. However, Chief Justice John Roberts and his conservative colleagues worried the states would be powerless to refuse the new requirements. ""Why not be concerned about the authority the federal government is exercising?"" Roberts said to Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, who represented the government. ""That is the leverage"" the central bureaucracy holds, Roberts noted. The ""coercion"" issue was surprisingly added to the health care debate by the Supreme Court justices. Medicaid is administered by the states with a combination of federal and state money. It currently required coverage only for poor children and their parents or caretakers, adults with disabilities and poor individuals 65 or older. Both sides of the issue agree that what the high court decides on Medicaid could have broad implications for the regulatory ability of the federal government to set long-term national policy goals in areas such as the environment, education and the workplace. Some states have long complained their autonomy is being eroded by creeping federal intervention on spending matters. Article 1 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to ""lay and collect ... taxes to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States"" and to ""regulate commerce ... among the several states."" Such authority has long been broadly interpreted, including when imposing conditions on recipients, be they individuals or states. No federal court has ever ruled states have been unlawfully coerced when they accept conditions or strings attached to federal funds. The Supreme Court in 1987 affirmed that congressional discretion. Starting in 2014, the health care law's Medicaid changes would make millions of additional Americans eligible for benefits by raising the income cap for qualification. That would include all adults up to 133% of the federal poverty line. The tricky point is that states are not forced to agree to the law's incremental Medicaid increases, spread out over six years. The states could instead abandon their participation in the program, but they say that would be a financial, social and political catastrophe -- one that they cannot realistically accept. Lawsuits by 26 Republican-led states say the new law's significant expansion of the social safety net unconstitutionally ""coerces"" state governments. Supporters of the health care law say the Medicaid issue involves political motivations rather than real policy concerns. ""These arguments aren't based on Medicaid's health outcomes among children or seniors,"" Dr. L. Toni Lewis, the health care chair of the Service Employers International Union, said at a news conference Wednesday. ""They aren't based on testimony from those who have received services from Medicaid. They aren't even based on data that shows how well Medicaid controls costs compared to private insurance. That's because the challenge to Medicaid in the Supreme Court isn't based on what's good for our health. It's just based on politics and posturing.""

"(CNN) -- A Disney cruise liner stopped to rescue four men signaling for help near Key West, Florida, a spokeswoman for the company said Tuesday. The Disney Fantasy was sailing from Port Canaveral, Florida, to Grand Cayman Sunday afternoon when it spotted the four men aboard a small raft, Rebecca Peddie of Disney Cruise Line said. The men were brought aboard the 130,000-ton ship, where they were given medical attention, along with food and water, she said. ""We are proud of our Disney Fantasy crew members, who skillfully demonstrated their training and commitment to maritime protocols around saving lives at sea,"" she said. ""We have notified the U.S. Coast Guard of this rescue and are working with the proper authorities to coordinate the debarkation of the group."" The rescue by the Disney Fantasy follows recent claims that a ship operated by Princess Cruise Lines failed to stop for three Panamanian fishermen adrift at sea, despite passengers alerting crew to their plight. The sole survivor aboard the fishing boat, 18-year-old Adrian Vasquez, filed a lawsuit earlier this month against the company, arguing that its ship, the Star Princess, should have stopped and saved him. The fishing boat, Fifty Cents, had been adrift for 15 days when it crossed paths with the Star Princess on March 10, according to the lawsuit. At the time, all three fishermen aboard were alive. Vasquez was finally rescued by the Ecuadorian navy after 28 days adrift but his companions had died. His lawsuit seeks compensation for physical, emotional and psychological injuries that it alleges he suffered as a result of the conduct of cruise line employees. Princess Cruises said it deeply regrets the loss of life and was investigating the incident. It said it understands its responsibility under the law to aid a vessel in distress and noted its ships had carried out more than 30 rescues in the past. CNN's Devon Sayers contributed to this report.","Disney Cruise Lines says its ship stopped to rescue four men signaling for help off Key West .

"(CNN) -- Those new to the cult of Mac may not realize it, but there once was a time when that iconic logo that shines from the top of Apple notebooks used to be positioned, well, upside down. Anyone gazing at the back of an open PowerBook or iBook saw Apple's logo balancing on its stem, almost as if in the middle of a pirouette. And now we know exactly why Apple opted for its original logo positioning: Joe Moreno, a former senior web app engineer and marketer at Apple, took to his blog Sunday to disclose the story behind Apple's original design. Moreno said that Apple staff confused by the design decision used the company's anonymous internal question system Can We Talk? to ask ""Why is the Apple logo upside down on laptops when the lid is open?"" Apparently, the Apple Design Group had discussed the issue of the Apple logo on the lid extensively. If the logo faces the user when he or she opens the laptop, then it's upside down when the lid is up. And if the logo is right side up when the laptop is open, then it's upside down to the user when he or she is looking to open it. Apple CEO Steve Jobs wanted to provide the best experience for the user, and so the Apple logo was initially placed to be upside down to onlookers. But the decision was reversed within a few years. ""Opening a laptop from the wrong end is a self-correcting problem that only lasts for a few seconds. However, viewing the upside logo is a problem that lasts indefinitely,"" Moreno wrote.

"(CNN) -- Four hours after the green flag dropped, Kasey Kahne sped across the finish line first Sunday night to take NASCAR's longest, most grueling race of the season, the Coca-Cola 600. The win was the Washington state native's first of the year and the 13th of his career -- three of those coming in this very race. ""It feels really good,"" Kahne told Fox Sports, which broadcast the race. ""We went 600 miles, no problem, with tons of power.""

"(CNN) -- The power of music and the power of politics met Tuesday, with a hip-hop mogul and one of the most prominent leaders in Congress joining their considerable forces to spotlight issues facing youth in America. Russell Simmons hopes by investing in youths they can stay out of trouble and be more successful adults. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi attended a youth conference co-sponsored by entrepreneur and entertainer Russell Simmons in Washington. The one-day event, called Keeping the Promise to Our Children, brought legislators together with entertainment A-listers, including Oscar-nominee Terrence Howard, who used their celebrity to advocate a variety of causes: foster care, health care and education among them. Simmons' Hip Hop Summit Action Network and the nonprofit, California-based Children Uniting Nations hosted the event. This is the fourth conference organized by Daphna Ziman, an adoptive mother of a child formerly in foster care and founder of Children Uniting Nations, which matches children in foster care with mentors. Actress Gabrielle Union and actor/musician Howard were among the celebrities at the conference who pushed for policy changes directed at improving educational outreach to foster children. Only 54 percent of children in foster care graduate high school, according to the University of Chicago's Chapin Hall Center for Children. ""Intervening in the lives of these young people, giving them a sense of dignity and worth, providing them with more opportunities, therefore, is one of the most important things you can do, not just for them, which is the most important thing, but for the strength of our country,"" said Pelosi at a news conference before the event. Panel discussions at the conference also addressed nutrition, mental health, HIV/AIDS and drug abuse. Children Uniting Nations plans to lobby Congress on these issues, said the organization's spokeswoman, Juliette Harris. Last year, the organization pushed for a $5,000 college loan subsidy for students who mentor at-risk youths, and the subsidy was passed in the House as part of the College Opportunity and Affordability Act. This year, the organization has lobbied for the Foster Care Mentoring Act of 2009, which was introduced by Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-Louisiana; and Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-New York, also attendees at Tuesday's conference. The act proposes an allocation of $15 million for foster-care mentoring programs. Investing in youths now can help them stay out of trouble and be more successful adults, said Simmons.

"(CNN) -- Britain's Andy Murray began his clay court campaign with an impressive straight sets win over Serbia's Viktor Troicki at the Monte Carlo Masters Tuesday. The world number four was the first of the big name seeds in action in the principality and wasted little time in dispatching Troicki 6-0 6-3 in a second round match. Murray reached the semifinals of the Masters 1000 tournament last year and the French Open, beaten on both occasions by the 'king of clay' Rafael Nadal. Troicki was able to muster little in the way of opposition and was whitewashed in a one-sided opening set. He was able to hold his service at the start of the second, but Murray broke again to edge ahead and a second break at 5-3 saw him close out victory in 67 minutes. The third seed, who is sporting a new close crop haircut, will meet either Julien Benneteau or Jurgen Melzer in the next round. ""It was good. I moved well,"" said Murray. ""I was sliding pretty well on the court. Normally that's the thing that takes time to get used to. Normally for me that's a good sign on the clay, whether I'm playing well or not,"" he told the official ATP Tour website. Fourth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga celebrated his 27th birthday with a 6-2 6-4 win over Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber in their second round match. The Frenchman was earning a tough third round clash against 13th-seeded Spaniard Fernando Verdasco, who recovered from a set down to beat Ivan Dodig of Croatia 3-6 6-3 6-1. Dodig had brought down the curtain on the career of his compatriot Ivan Ljubicic Sunday with a straight sets win in their first round match.

"(CNN) -- The 19-year-old Tulsa, Oklahoma, man whose Facebook page lamented his father's death ""at the hands of a f--king n----r"" told investigators he shot three of the African-Americans injured or killed in a Friday shooting spree, according to police documents. Fellow suspect Alvin Watts confessed to shooting the other two people, according to the documents, which include only summaries of the reported confessions and few details. Based on his statement, police believe Watts pulled the trigger in two of the three fatal shootings, according to the documents. A police spokesman declined to comment Tuesday when asked about the reported confessions. Authorities accuse the pair of gunning down apparent strangers at four different locations in a largely African-American section of Tulsa early Friday. Authorities identified the victims as Dannaer Fields, William Allen and Bobby Clark. The other two shooting victims survived. Police arrested Watts, 33, and Jake England, 19, early Sunday after tips led investigators to England's burned pickup. The vehicle matched one reported at the crime scenes, according to the arrest reports. A judge ordered England and Watts held Monday on $9.16 million bond each pending formal charges on allegations of murder, shooting with intent to kill and gun possession. Police reports characterize both men as white, but authorities have declined to say whether they think race played a role in the shootings. An update posted to England's Facebook page the day before the shootings noted it was the second anniversary of his father's death ""at the hands of a f--king n----r."" The entry also mentioned his girlfriend's recent suicide. Prosecutors will review whether hate crime charges are appropriate against England and Watts, Tulsa County District Attorney Tim Harris said Monday. ""If the motivation is racial in this case, then that needs to be vetted in a court of law just like any others,"" Harris said. ""It's the law of the state of Oklahoma, and if the facts and the evidence support that, then we're going to go forward with it."" Police Chief Chuck Jordan described England and Watts as apparently close friends who shared a home in Tulsa. One survivor of Friday's shootings, Deon Tucker, told reporters Monday that he was standing on his porch when a white pickup pulled up and the driver asked him for directions. ""Next thing I know, they start shooting,"" he said. ""What are they shooting me for? I ain't got no enemies. I didn't know what was going on,"" recalled Tucker, who said he was shot once in the chest. He added that he understands that his race might have led to his shooting. But Tucker said he simply ""got caught in the wrong spot"" and isn't ""mad at anybody,"" describing his shooter as a ""lunatic."" On Friday, a friend had warned England not to ""do anything stupid"" after he posted a message Friday, apparently after the shootings, that read ""It just mite be the time to call it quits."" ""I hate to say it like that but I'm done if something does happen tonite be ready for another funeral later,"" England wrote. ""It's hard not to go off between that and sheran I'm gone in the head,"" he wrote, referring to his girlfriend. The Facebook page was taken down Sunday afternoon. Watts' brother, Michael Watts, said the shootings ""broke our heart,"" CNN affiliate KTUL reported. ""If that boy done this, there's no excuse for it,"" KTUL quoted Watts as saying. ""I just want to apologize to those families. My heart goes out to them."" A man who identified himself as England's uncle -- speaking Monday outside the suspects' home -- said his nephew had been troubled by the recent suicide of his girlfriend and his father's death in April 2010. ""His mind couldn't take it anymore, I guess,"" the man said. ""I guess it just snapped his mind."" Prosecutors declined to file homicide charges in the death of England's father, ruling it a justifiable homicide, the Tulsa County District Attorney's Office said in a statement Monday. England and Watts remained jailed Tuesday pending an April 16 arraignment. Meanwhile, prosecutors prepared formal charges against the pair. While Harris declined to say Monday if hate crime charges would be included, City Councilor Jack Henderson said the online posts and the circumstances of the shootings lead him to believe that the shooters targeted their victims chiefly because of race. ""You have an individual -- a white male -- going into a predominantly black community (to) shoot at black people. And with the other evidence ... and some of the things that were said, that leads me to believe that this was totally a hate crime,"" Henderson said. Tulsa was the scene of a 1921 race riot -- considered one of the worst in the nation -- that destroyed the famed Greenwood District, a wealthy black enclave known as the black Wall Street. Harris said the community's response to the shootings said more about current race relations in Tulsa than the shootings should. ""This community will not be defined by the treacherous, evil crimes of two individuals,"" he said. ""That's not what Tulsa, Oklahoma, is about, and that's not what our people are about,"" he said. ""The fact that this community drew together as one to stop this threat is what Tulsa is all about."" CNN's Maria P. White and Jason Carroll contributed to this report.","NEW: Police believe Alvin Watts killed two of three victims, documents show .

"New York (CNN) -- A federal jury began deliberations Monday in the case of a man accused -- with two others -- of plotting to bomb New York's subway system. Prosecutors say Adis Medunjanin, a Bosnian-born American, conspired with admitted terrorists Najubullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay in the terrorist plot planned, but never executed, in 2009. In closing arguments late last week at a federal court in Brooklyn, Assistant U.S. Attorney Berit Berger said that Medunjanin was willing ""to strap a suicide bomb to himself, walk into a New York City subway and blow it up."" Berger told jurors that al Qaeda leaders assigned the mission to Medunjanin in 2008, while he was in Pakistan's tribal belt with two high school friends, Najibullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay. Medunjanin's attorney Robert Gottlieb denied the prosecution's account in his own closing arguments, insisting his client traveled to Pakistan ""not to join al Qaeda, but to join the Taliban in fighting foreign troops in Afghanistan."" Gottlieb said Medunjanin wanted to join the Taliban to stand up for Muslims and defend the Muslim religion. He called all three young men, including Zazi and Ahmedzay, ""immature, naive and clueless"" when they set out. ""They wanted to fulfill some romantic version of jihad,"" Gottlieb said. Upon their return to the United States, prosecutors contend that Medunjanin and his two friends hatched a plan to rig backpacks with explosives and blow them up. But Gottlieb denies his client had a role in such a bomb plot. Medunjanin has pleaded not guilty to charges that include conspiring to use weapons of mass destruction and conspiring to provide material support to al Qaeda. He faces life in prison if convicted. Co-conspirators Zazi, an immigrant from Pakistan, and Ahmedzay, an immigrant from Afghanistan, have pleaded guilty to planning the attack with him and are awaiting sentencing. Both men have cooperated with the government and testified at Medunjanin's trial.","NEW: A federal jury in New York begins deliberations in Adis Medunjanin's case .

"(CNN) -- Clive Owen isn't the leading man actor normally described as dashing and ruggedly handsome when he enters the room. Sure, the movie star charm and warmth is there, but when Owen sits down with a group of reporters, it's as a father who knows terror. After being introduced to American audiences in 2000 with ""Croupier,"" Owen has carved out a career in films portraying an intense, if disheveled, man of thought and action in ""Children of Men,"" ""Closer"" and ""Inside Man."" He's also shown the ability to be a little less thoughtful with fun, ultraviolent flicks ""Shoot 'Em Up"" and ""Sin City."" In the new psychologically driven horror-thriller ""Intruders,"" which opened March 30, Owen plays John Farrow, father to a 13-year-old daughter terrorized by the tormenting being ""Hollow Face,"" who wishes to possess her and might be connected to a family secret. Meanwhile, in another country, a young boy is experiencing the same phenomenon. As the children's stories begin to take shape and come together, the Hollow Face mystery is unraveled, as is Farrow's family unit. Along with the online sexual predator film ""Trust"" -- and to some degree the single-parent drama ""The Boys Are Back"" -- ""Intruders"" seems to mark a new chapter of Owen's career playing fathers who often feel powerless. Owen sat down with CNN to discuss his portrayal as a father and his own real-life experience as one. He also talks about what terrified him as a child and as an adult, and the power of secrets in families. CNN: Why do audiences respond to seeing children terrified? Clive Owen: Because we remember being terrified, probably. ... Bad dreams and nightmares, when you're very young, are very intense experiences. I remember it, and I've seen it in my own children. I think, over time, you learn to process it, and you wake up very quickly and can figure out what's real and what isn't real. But for a child, it can really throw you off center. CNN: How important do you think family secrets are? Owen: I think that we all have them. I think that's the truth. I think that this is a very personal film to Juan Carlos and happened to him when he was young and related to secrets that his family had and that's why he wanted to explore them in this film. CNN: Do you think it's important to keep them or is it detrimental? Owen: I think you have to take each one at a time. I think sometimes it is maybe better to get things out in the open. CNN: What scared you as a kid? What scares you now? Owen: I wasn't that sort of a fearful kid, really. I remember having nightmares, but I never had recurring nightmares or got scared at night. I wasn't that kind of child. When people say to me, what scares me now, it's without doubt, the sort of welfare and well-being of my children, really. I think that's the one thing that you kind of don't have much control over -- just fearful that they're going to be OK and they're going to be alright. CNN: As opposed to roles where your body has taken a beating, does this kind of psychological role beat up your mind at all when the threat is from within? Owen: That's a good question because it's harder work than you think. You've got to take the audience to quite an intense place and sometimes doing that is as hard as doing a page of dialogue. Because if you fall short, the thing doesn't work. You have to get to get to a level of intensity. That's why I thought Ella [Ella Purnell, who plays Owen's daughter Mia in ""Intruders""] was so good in the movie -- because she, in some ways, really holds that together. It's her emotional terror that we're kind of gripped by as the film goes on. CNN: Can you talk a little bit about how your character growing up has unresolved issues with his mother that affected his parenting skills when he became an adult? Owen: I think there's absolutely no question the central theme is that passing on fears to your children is a very real and truthful thing. ... I've got a friend ... and the mother is scared of dogs, and the kids are now terrified of dogs. ... That's a very simplistic version, but I think that kids are very sensitive and alive to what's going on within people and specifically, their parents. CNN: Have you passed on any fears to your kids? Owen: Only good things! CNN: When you're dealing with a child actor like Ella in these very intense scenes, do you ever have to step aside with her and just check in on her to see if she's OK? Owen: I think you have to do that before you even start working. I've done about three films in the last few years that have very strong relationships with children and playing a parent, basically. It's usually important that they feel safe before you begin, especially if you want to push it into areas that are uncomfortable, which is an interesting and good thing to do. But the child needs to feel safe and that everything's OK. ... I actually really love working with young actors because I think they are so responsive and instinctive. And it's much less honed a craft they're employing, but it's very real and reactive. CNN: Are you going to veer off from thrillers? Are you going to do more comedy now? Owen: No. I am filming a comedy, which is very exciting actually. It's the first one that I'll do really. I really like it. It really makes me laugh. So, I'm excited about that but that's not for a while, yet. I think I just instinctively respond to material and, at the end of the day, you look at it, and that kind of shapes a career. There's no question that ""Trust,"" ""The Boys Are Back,"" and this film are obviously are related because I'm a parent. I'm a parent of two girls. There are things within that that I thought, 'this is really interesting to explore' ... to do it in a very truthful way is something very exciting to discover. CNN: You've said you're a huge fan of ""The Exorcist."" So why do you love it so much? Owen: I think it's a really well-directed movie. Not just a horror movie, but a movie. I just thought it was extremely well-acted, and it still holds up today. It's disturbing. My 12-year-old daughter has heard about it and says, 'Dad, I want to watch ""The Exorcist"".' Sweetheart, you're not watching that for 10 years. Don't even think about it. I had it in the house and got rid of it because I'm paranoid that she was going to think, 'I'll just have a little look,' and get traumatized for the next four years.","Clive Owen has carved out a career portraying an intense man of thought and action .

"New York (CNN) -- Pedro Hernandez was arraigned early Friday evening on a second-degree murder charge tied to the case of Etan Patz, the New York boy whose disappearance 33 years to the day spurred nationwide attention about missing children. The suspect appeared about 6:25 p.m. Friday via video feed from Manhattan's Bellevue Hospital, where he is being held for evaluation and is on suicide watch, according to a law enforcement source. Judge Matthew Sciarrino presided over the proceedings from a New York courtroom, where people watched the arraignment. Sciarrino denied bail for Hernandez after defense attorney Harvey Fishbein said the suspect has a ""long psychiatric history"" including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and hallucinations. The lawyer asked that Hernandez undergo a full psychiatric evaluation, a request the judge granted. Dressed in an orange jumpsuit and sitting at a brown table, Hernandez did not speak and showed no evident emotion during the proceedings. The next major step in the legal process would be for a grand jury to hear prosecutors' evidence against Hernandez for a potential indictment, after the defense waived its right to an expedited indictment on Friday. It is not clear when this might happen. Earlier Friday, Hernandez was sent to the hospital ""because he's on medications, and we prefer to administer those in a hospital setting,"" said police spokesman Paul Browne, who declined to elaborate on the medications. ""When Hernandez arrived at the hospital, he began making statements that he wanted to die, and a psychiatric evaluation was ordered, "" added the law enforcement source. The former Manhattan stock clerk who lived in Etan's neighborhood when the boy vanished was arrested the previous day by police following up on a tip. Neighbors say suspect in Patz killing lived a quiet life with his family . Hernandez, who was 19 in 1979, told police he lured Etan to a store with the promise of a soda, choked him and placed his body in the trash about a block and a half away, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. The boy was killed in the basement of a Manhattan building, according to the charging document filed late Friday afternoon by the Manhattan district attorney's office. ""Detectives believe in the credibility of the statement,"" Kelly said, although investigators had not uncovered any forensic evidence linking Hernandez to the boy's disappearance. Kelly said it is unlikely that Etan's remains would be found. Patz investigation a 33-year-long roller coaster ride . ""He did the right thing, you know, to confess,"" Hernandez's brother-in-law Jose Lopez told CNN affiliate KYW. ""Get this thing over with for the people out there and the family over here."" But Lisa Cohen, whose 2009 book, ""After Etan,"" is widely considered the definitive account of the case, said she's not convinced that Hernandez killed the boy. ""No, I'm not, but that's not necessarily because he didn't do it,"" she said. ""That's just because this has just happened. I'd never heard his name before."" Hernandez has no criminal record and is the father of a teenage girl, Kelly said. Etan, 6, went missing on May 25, 1979, a block from his home in Manhattan. He was walking to school alone for the first time when he vanished. His disappearance helped spawn a national movement to raise awareness of missing children, including the then-novel approach of putting an image of the child's face on thousands of milk cartons. Missing child case 'awakened America' In the years after Etan's disappearance, Hernandez told a family member and others that he had ""done a bad thing"" and killed a child in New York, police said. While the motive remained unclear, Kelly described it as a crime of opportunity and said Hernandez was remorseful. ""The detectives thought it was a feeling of relief on his part,"" he said. Other employees of the store were interviewed after Etan disappeared, but not Hernandez, police said. ""I can't tell you why,"" Kelly said. The police investigation continues, as does the FBI's, the agency said in a statement Thursday night. ""The FBI's investigation into the disappearance of Etan Patz remains active and ongoing. We remain determined to solve this case,"" FBI Assistant Director Janice K. Fedarcyk said in the statement. Thursday's arrest came nearly a month after investigators searched the former basement workshop of carpenter Othniel Miller, who had given Etan a dollar the day before the boy's disappearance for helping him around the shop. Etan had said before he disappeared that he planned to use the dollar to buy a soda. The search produced no apparent clues. ""Mr. Miller is relieved by these developments, as he was not involved in any way with Etan Patz's disappearance,"" said Miller's attorney, Michael C. Farkas. ""At the same time, Mr. Miller is very pleased that those responsible for this heinous crime may be brought to justice, and the Patz family may finally have the closure they deserve."" A separate law enforcement source said Thursday that Hernandez's claims were being treated with ""a healthy dose of skepticism."" The tipster whose information led to Hernandez's arrest contacted authorities months ago after news coverage of their renewed search. That contact, at least in part, prompted investigators to question Hernandez. A spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney's office, which reopened the case in 2010, declined to comment on the recent development. Etan was officially declared dead in 2001 as part of a lawsuit filed by his family against Jose Antonio Ramos, a drifter and convicted child molester acquainted with Etan's baby sitter. A judge found Ramos responsible for the boy's death and ordered him to pay the family $2 million, money the Patz family has never received. Although Ramos was considered a key focus of the investigation for years, he has never been charged in the case. He is serving a 20-year prison sentence in Pennsylvania for molesting another boy and is set to be released this year. President Ronald Reagan named May 25, the day Etan went missing, as National Missing Children's Day.

"(CNN) -- Separatist rebels who captured northern areas of Mali called a cease-fire starting Thursday, saying they had captured key territory and achieved their military mission. The Azawad National Liberation Movement (MNLA) said the rebels had captured enough of Mali's vast Sahara region to put down their guns. The online statement said the MNLA ""decides unilaterally to proclaim an end to military operations as of Thursday, April 5 at midnight GMT."" The Tuaregs consider the area, which they call Azawad, as the cradle of their nomadic civilization and launched an insurgency in January to achieve a separate homeland. The conflict has uprooted more than 200,000 people from their homes. Buoyed by the chaos after last month's military coup that toppled the government, the rebels swept through the north with relative ease and wrested control of several strategic cities, including Kidal, Gao and Timbuktu. ""In all liberated regions, may it be in Kidal, Gao or Timbuktu, the MLNA today constitutes the sole authority providing security to the population,"" MNLA spokesman Mossa Ag Attaher told CNN affiliate BFM-TV. The rebels have effectively split the West African nation in two, and northern areas remain volatile and tense, preventing aid agencies from accessing displaced people, the United Nations refugee agency said Thursday. Thursday, the regional group, Economic Community of West African States, met in the Ivorian capital, Abidjan, to discuss military intervention in Mali. The MLNA, however, warned ECOWAS against the deployment of troops. Attaher told BFM-TV that the rebels have at least 3,000 fighters and any intervention ""would be a disaster."" After the March 22 coup, Mali, long a shining example of democracy and stability in Africa, plunged into crisis. Amnesty International said northern Mali was teetering on the brink of disaster. Kidal, Gao and Timbuktu have experienced days of looting, abductions and chaos since they were occupied by armed groups late last week, the human rights group said. ""All the food and medicine stored by major aid agencies has been looted, and most of the aid workers have fled,"" said Gaetan Mootoo, Amnesty International's researcher on West Africa. ""Women and girls particularly are too terrified to leave their homes. People are describing an atmosphere of near total lawlessness,"" Mootoo said. In Gao, water and electricity have been cut and the hospital looted, Amnesty reported. Shops are shuttered, and people are surviving on meager food supplies. ""Medicine has been stolen and the records of the patients destroyed,"" a doctor told Amnesty. ""In a few days, years of medical efforts and success have disappeared in the flames."" The Algerian consul in Gao and six employees were forcibly taken from the consulate and are being held by unidentified groups, the Algerie Presse Service reported. ""The Algerian government is totally mobilized for their liberation as soon as possible,"" said Algerian Foreign Minister Mourad Medelci. In Kidal, Ansar Dine, an Islamist faction of the secular MNLA, has asked women to wear veils and destroyed a nightclub, Amnesty said. Ansar Dine is intent in imposing Sharia, or Islamic law. In Timbuktu, Ansar Dine arrested and detained people accused of robbery and looting. Amnesty said it was concerned the group would mete out punishments in accordance with Sharia. ""The town is emptying out,"" a Timbuktu resident told Amnesty. ""People are going to the south or to Mauritania. They are using all means: by car, by motorbike or on the donkeys."" Meanwhile in the capital, Bamako, military leaders who overthrew President Amadou Toumani Toure because of his alleged inability to handle the Tuareg rebellion postponed plans Thursday for a national convention aimed at addressing political woes. The reason remained unclear. Military leaders had planned to invite political parties and civilian representatives to the convention, said Capt. Amadou Sanogo, the junta leader. The international community -- including West African states, the African Union and the United States -- has called for the immediate restoration of constitutional rule. The African Union and ECOWAS have also slapped the military junta with travel and economic restrictions and have frozen its assets. ECOWAS imposed a diplomatic and financial embargo, said Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara, who is chairman of the group. ""All diplomatic, economic, financial measures and others ... will not be lifted until the re-establishment of constitutional order,"" he said. Sanctions targeted the supporters and relatives of the military junta and all those involved in contributing to the ""destabilization"" of Mali, the African Union said. Under the sanctions, five neighboring nations will close their borders to landlocked Mali except for humanitarian purposes and deny the nation access to their ports, freeze its accounts in regional banks and suspend its participation in cultural and sporting events. Now, Mali has no no access to the sea, is heavily dependent on foreign aid and faces a future of uncertainty.

"(CNN) -- Newly released documents have reignited the debate in Washington over whether Obama administration officials granted too much access to filmmakers making a movie about the raid that killed Osama bin Laden -- and whether national security was compromised in the process. The documents show, for example, that a defense official offered the filmmakers access to a planner from SEAL Team Six, the super-secret special ops division that successfully executed the high-stakes raid in Pakistan last year. It is not clear if any such access eventually took place. But according to a transcript from the meeting, in July of last year, Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Michael Vickers told screenwriter Mark Boal and director Kathryn Bigelow that the defense department would offer up a plum interview. ""They'll make a guy available who was involved from the beginning as a planner; a SEAL Team 6 Operator and Commander,"" Vickers said, according to the transcript. The name of that man is blacked out in the transcript that was released, and Vickers tells the filmmakers not to reveal the man's identity. ""He shouldn't be talking out of school,"" Vickers says, but ""he knows what he can and can't say."" ""That's dynamite,"" says Boal, according to the transcript. ""That's incredible,"" says Bigelow. ""You're going to get a little bit of operational stuff,"" Vickers says, ""but more really policy -- like how did we make the decision, the risks, that kind of stuff."" It was not clear whether the SEAL team commander ever met with the filmmakers. A Pentagon spokesman said the Defense Department gave them no access to classified information about the raid. But Rep. Peter King, R-New York, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, says the offer of access looks like a ""potentially dangerous collaboration"" and raises ""very serious questions"" about whether the administration is sufficiently protecting operational secrets. ""If this is too sensitive for the average person to know about,"" King said, ""did Kathryn Bigelow have security clearance? Is she cleared to go in there?"" Fran Townsend, former White House homeland security adviser under President George W. Bush and a CNN contributor, called the revelations ""troubling."" She said revealing too much information about how the bin Laden raid was planned and executed could help other terrorists escape attempts to capture them. ""The understanding of how that happens is really very important to our enemies because then they know which information to withhold from us,"" she said. ""We don't want to make that mission -- attacking or targeting future al Qeada leaders -- any more difficult than it already is."" ""There's a real downside to giving too much access to Hollywood,"" she said. The records were released to the Washington watchdog organization Judicial Watch, after it filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. According to e-mails among the documents, the filmmakers also met with acting CIA Director Michael Morrell, National Security Council Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, and White House Counterterrorism Adviser John Brennan. The records also suggest that they were given a walk-though of the ""vault"" room used by the CIA when planning the raid. Doctor linked to raid sent to prison . A CIA spokesperson confirmed that CIA officers sometimes to meet with writers and filmmakers to help make the portrayal of the CIA more accurate, but called those meetings unclassified. The spokesperson added that ""the 'vault' in question, that had been used for planning the raid, was empty at the time of the filmmakers' visit."" Likewise, White House officials have said they did not give the filmmakers anything that was not also provided to journalists. ""The same information was given to the White House press corps,"" said National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor. ""We do not discuss classified information."" Administration officials have also rejected suggestions that they were hoping that a movie recounting the daring and successful raid ordered by President Barack Obama would burnish his image just when the presidential campaign reached its height. The released documents show that the political strategy firm Glover Park Group, which has ties to Democrats, helped the filmmakers arrange meetings in Washington. ""To have Democratic consultants, lobbyists, having access with Hollywood producers to inner workings of the CIA, of the military, raises very serious questions,"" said Republican Rep. King. But the filmmakers, whose representatives declined to comment Wednesday, have said in the past that the film would be about a nonpartisan American triumph without regard for political affiliation. And while the release of the film had once been anticipated for October, just weeks before Election Day, its release is not expected until December. CNN's Suzanne Kelly, Brianna Keilar, and Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report.","Filmmakers are making a movie about the raid that killed Osama bin Laden .

"(CNN) -- Italian footballer Piermario Morosini has died after collapsing during a Serie B match at Pescara on Saturday, according to Italian media reports. The 25-year-old collapsed after suffering a heart attack during the first half of the game of the match between Pescara and Livorno in Italian football's second division. He was treated on the pitch before being rushed by ambulance to Pescara's Civile Santo Spirito hospital but was later pronounced dead. A statement on the official Serie A web site said: ""The world of soccer is in mourning for the tragedy that took place this afternoon in Pescara, where during a match between the home team and Livorno, the soccer player Piermario Morosini collapsed on the ground (struck down) by a heart attack. ""The young midfield player came under pharmacological coma, but he died around 17:00."" Morosini, a former Italy under-21 international, was on loan at Livorno from Serie A side Udinese. The match was immediately abandoned and the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) announced a short time later that all football fixtures this weekend have been canceled. Inter Milan captain, Javier Zanetti, who learned of the news as his team were preparing for their Serie A fixture against Udinese, said the whole team was shocked by the news. ""We're all deeply dismayed and very sorry,"" Zanetti said in a statement published on Inter's web site. ""It is hard to believe what has happened and of course it was right to postpone all league games. My thoughts and those of all my teammates go out to all his family,"" Zanetti added. Fellow professionals have also taken to Twitter to express their sadness at the player's passing. Manchester City's Argentine international Sergio Aguero said: ""Livorno Piermario Morosini's passing is a great blow to everyone. It's a sad day for me as well. My condolences to his family."" While Wesley Sniejder of Inter Milan wrote: ""Rest in peace Piermario Morosini, riposa in pace...."" Morosini's death comes just under a month after English Premier League player Fabrice Muamba collapsed after suffering a cardiac arrest during an FA Cup match between Bolton Wanderers and Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on March 17. The 24-year-old's heart stopped for 78 minutes as doctors struggled to keep him alive at the stadium and then later at the London Chest Hospital on March 17.

"ANTHONY, Texas (CNN) -- Texas may be best known for ""Big Oil."" But the oil that could some day make a dent in the country's use of fossil fuels is small. Microscopic, in fact: algae. Literally and figuratively, this is green fuel. Plant physiologist Glen Kertz believes algae can some day be . competitive as a source for biofuel. ""Algae is the ultimate in renewable energy,"" Glen Kertz, president and CEO of Valcent Products, told CNN while conducting a tour of his algae greenhouse on the outskirts of El Paso. Kertz, a plant physiologist and entrepreneur, holds about 20 patents. And he is psyched about the potential algae holds, both as an energy source and as a way to deal with global warming. ""We are a giant solar collecting system. We get the bulk of our energy from the sunshine,"" said Kertz. Algae are among the fastest growing plants in the world, and about 50 percent of their weight is oil. That lipid oil can be used to make biodiesel for cars, trucks, and airplanes.  Watch how pond scum can be turned into fuel » . Most people know algae as ""pond scum."" And until recently, most energy research and development projects used ponds to grow it. But instead of ponds, Valcent uses a closed, vertical system, growing the algae in long rows of moving plastic bags. The patented system is called Vertigro, a joint venture with Canadian alternative energy company Global Green Solutions. The companies have invested about $5 million in the Texas facility. ""A pond has a limited amount of surface area for solar absorption,"" said Kertz. ""By going vertical, you can get a lot more surface area to expose cells to the sunlight. It keeps the algae hanging in the sunlight just long enough to pick up the solar energy they need to produce, to go through photosynthesis,"" he said. Kertz said he can produce about 100,000 gallons of algae oil a year per acre, compared to about 30 gallons per acre from corn; 50 gallons from soybeans. Using algae as an alternative fuel is not a new idea. The U.S. Department of Energy studied it for about 18 years, from 1978 to 1996. But according to Al Darzins of the DOE's National Renewable Energy Lab, in 1996 the feds decided that algae oil could never compete economically with fossil fuels. The price of a barrel of oil in 1996? About 20 bucks! Government scientists experimented with algae in open ponds in California, Hawaii, and in Roswell, New Mexico. But that involved a lot of land area, with inherent problems of evaporation and contamination from other plant species and various flying and swimming critters. Darzins said NREL switched from algae research to focus on cellulosic ethanol. That's ethanol made from plants like switchgrass and plant stover -- the leaves and stalks left after a harvest -- but not edible crops such as corn and soybeans. Valcent research scientist Aga Pinowska said there are about 65,000 known algae species, with perhaps hundreds of thousands more still to be identified. A big part of the research at the west Texas facility involves determining what type of algae produces what type of fuel. One species may be best suited for jet fuel, while the oil content of another may be more efficient for truck diesel. In the Vertigro lab, Pinowska studies the care and feeding of algae for just such specifics. She said even small changes in the nutrients that certain algae get can help create a more efficient oil content. And she said a knowledge of algae's virtues goes way back. ""Even the Aztecs knew it was beneficial; they used it as a high protein food,"" said Pinowska. The other common commercial use of algae today is as a health food drink, usually sold as ""Spirulina."" I'm too sexy for my pond . And who knew that single celled plants could be such ""hotties"" when it comes to sex? Kertz said it's a real ""algae orgy"" under the microscope. Some algae reproduce sexually, some asexually, while many combine both modes. In some green algae the type of reproduction may be altered if there are changes in environmental conditions, such as lack of moisture or nutrients. Intriguing details like that keep Kertz and other scientists searching for more and different algae. While dusty west Texas may not be the best hunting grounds, he said he is always on the lookout for samples in puddles, streams or ponds. Locating algae processing plants intelligently can add to their efficiency. Locating algae facilities next to carbon producing power plants, or manufacturing plants, for instance, the plants could sequester the C02 they create and use those emissions to help grow the algae, which need the C02 for photosynthesis. And after more than a decade hiatus, the U.S. government is back in the algae game. The 2007 Energy Security and Independence Act includes language promoting the use of algae for biofuels. From the Pentagon to Minnesota to New Zealand, both governments and private companies are exploring the use of algae to produce fuel. But Al Darzins of the National Renewable Energy Lab said the world is still probably 5 to 10 years away from any substantial use of biofuels. ""There's not any one system that anyone has chosen yet. Whatever it is has to be dirt, dirt cheap,"" said Darzins. E-mail to a friend .","Some types of algae are about 50 percent oil, suitable for biodiesel .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- When he lost his second parent to HIV/AIDS seven years ago, Ayanda Buthelezi's future seemed bleak. ""I thought maybe God hated us,"" said Buthelezi, now 22. ""We were very scared. ... But I had to be strong for my brother because he was still young."" As orphans in Johannesburg, the Buthelezi brothers were moved to a home for families and children affected by HIV/AIDS. There, they were introduced to their first computer through Infinite Family, a nonprofit started by Amy Stokes. The group connects South African children with caring adults around the world via computer. ""Whatever the cause may be, these children are severely lacking adult attention and guidance,"" Stokes said. ""Kids come into the computer lab because they want this special someone in their lives ... they want to connect with that special someone."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2011 CNN Heroes . Using a custom, Web-based technology, Infinite Family has so far connected almost 300 South African teens -- called Net Buddies -- with nearly 200 volunteer mentors from around the world. For at least a half-hour each week, pairs meet face to face on what they call the Ezomndeni-net. In Zulu, ""Ezomndeni means 'everything related to family,'"" said Stokes, 44. ""Our platform is a virtual world where the mentors and the kids log in in different places, but then can interact and share information in many different ways. A relationship starts between one person here and one person there, and then that relationship expands."" In addition to basic Web-cam capabilities, the Ezomndeni-net offers about a dozen interactive forums, including a live chat function, a virtual ""wipeboard"" where pairs can play games, and areas where pairs can do homework and surf the Web together. There is also an alert SOS button that Net Buddies can use if they are in dire need of guidance between scheduled chats. The experience has benefited Buthelezi, who is starting his first job as an IT professional on the Gautrain Project, South Africa's first inner-city high-speed rail. When he was younger, ""he was one of those kids that was sitting in the back of the classroom and was really, really struggling,"" Stokes said. ""About six months after being connected with Betty and Dave (Voigt of Sycamore, Pennsylvania,) he came up to me when I came to visit and said, 'Amy, Amy, I'm in the head of the class now, and I am so happy with where my life is going.'"" Buthelezi is also pursuing a degree in IT, and he credits Infinite Family for getting his life on the right track. ""My net family, Betty, she always advise me with the future plans: how to set my goals, how to achieve them,"" Buthelezi said. ""I thought maybe this is my chance again to have a family. ... They've been there for me ... just like my parents."" Stokes, a resident of Yonkers, New York, understands the important role a caring adult can play on a child's own concept of the future. Raised with two adopted siblings, she knew from an early age that she wanted to become an adoptive parent one day. She did so in 2003, when she and her husband, Chris, visited South Africa to adopt their son Calder, now 7. While in South Africa, Stokes witnessed how HIV/AIDS has resulted in millions of children being left without parents. According to the United Nations, nearly 15 million children in sub-Saharan Africa have been orphaned by HIV/AIDS. ""If none of the adults you care about has ever lived past 35, then why would you think you can? Why would you stay in school; why would you learn skills?"" Stokes said. ""[With] so many children and so few adults to help them grow up, I knew we had to find a way to bring new information, resources and the caring, nurturing effect of other adults into the lives of [these] children."" Since 2006, Infinite Family has built and operated five computer labs at partner organization sites across South Africa. In addition to providing mentors for children, the computer-driven communication of the Ezomndeni-net also develops their language and technology skills, preparing them to compete in the global marketplace. ""If the relationship is the motivation for attracting a child to a caring adult, then it's also the inspiration for getting that child to invest in themselves, to learn the skills to do whatever they need in the future,"" Stokes said. Before being paired with a child, mentors are subject to background checks, technological tutorials and cultural seminars covering mourning, HIV and developing relationships through e-mail. They sign up for a minimum of one year, but most continue beyond the requirement. Mentors can meet with their Net Buddies from wherever they have a secure Internet connection. Gifts, further financial assistance and any other help is optional and given to partner organizations directly -- never between mentor and mentee. ""The mentors know that all they have to offer is themselves,"" Stokes said. ""We like to say, 'The gift is you.' ... It's a bite-sized opportunity to change a world. And there's no commute.""

"(CNN) -- British Prime Minister David Cameron will arrive in Myanmar Friday accompanied by a delegation of 10 business leaders -- a measure of how quickly the once reclusive Southeast Asian country is reengaging with the world both diplomatically and economically. The delegation will be presented as ""tourists"" to circumvent restrictions imposed by European Union trade sanctions, according to Britain's Guardian newspaper. ""It is not a trade mission. We are going to Burma for reasons of geography and the recent elections, which led to a positive outcome,"" a source from the British government reportedly told the newspaper. ""The government policy on Burma is to discourage trade. That remains the case. Around ten members of the business delegation will come to Burma. They will have a cultural program. They will be like tourists."" The move is controversial since Britain still publicly backs EU sanctions which have held against the military-backed government since 1996. Cameron's visit is the first by a major Western leader since a 1962 coup began a half century of military rule. U.S. to ease Myanmar sanctions, open relations . Western firms, meanwhile, are vying to be among the first to do business in Myanmar once sanctions are lifted. Competitors from China, India, Japan, Thailand and South Korea are already well entrenched, tapping resources such as oil and natural gas, as well as sizeable deposits of coal, nickel ore and gemstones. Myanmar also stands to be a substantial exporter of lumber and rice. Cameron is currently touring Southeast Asia -- including Malaysia and Indonesia -- with a delegation of 35 business leaders from companies such as Shell, BAE Systems and the world's biggest miner, BHP Billiton. The EU is due to meet on April 23 to discuss its common position on Myanmar, saying it was likely to send a ""positive signal"" when it reviews the measures later this month. Both Germany and Italy are pushing for the complete lifting of sanctions, but other EU members -- Britain included -- are likely to push for some sanctions to remain in place over Myanmar's political prisoners. Human rights groups estimate that Myanmar holds 1,000 political prisoners including students, activists and monks. Last week, the human rights advocacy group Human Rights Watch called on the EU to be cautious over sanctions, matching Myanmar reform for reform rather than simply lifting sanctions wholesale. While the U.S. has welcomed changes in Myanmar -- this month announcing it would for the first time in 21 years nominate a candidate to serve as U.S. ambassador to the country -- it also has urged caution as it seeks progress on more fronts including the resolution of ethnic violence. Aung San Suu Kyi's opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) won 43 out of 45 parliamentary seats, representing about 5% of the total parliamentary seats, in elections on April 1. Critics claim the election involved a relative handful of seats in a powerless parliament, amounting to little more than a token concession to the opposition and the international community, but Western countries viewed the result as a powerful message from Myanmar that it was seeking reform. Sean Turnell, editor of the Burma Economic Watch and an associate professor in economics at Macquarie University in Sydney, told CNN that while Western corporations were keen to do business in Myanmar, he warned against taking too cynical a view on the lifting of sanctions. ""The desire for reform is quite genuine,"" Turnell said. He said the big question would be to what extent Suu Kyi's election would translate into real reform and to what extent she would be given a free hand to draft new laws. ""The object of those that want sanctions lifted in the U.S. was to try to bolster the reformers in Myanmar and, in their words, 'put a bit of wind in their sails,'"" Turnell said. ""The dilemma for the U.S. is how to best support them,"" he added. Turnell said the issue of sanctions had gathered a new complexity in the light of the continuing conflict with the Kachin ethnic minority in the far north of the country. Human Rights Watch says fighting between the Myanmar military and the Kachin Independence Army, one of the largest and most powerful ethnic armies, has escalated over the past two years. The conflict has led to widespread refugee displacement in Myanmar. ""Issues such as this are starting to divide people of goodwill,"" Turnell said. ""There's an issue over what's moral and what is effective -- what do we hold our noses over and what do we stand firm on?"" Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been run by a military junta since 1962. Sanctions were placed on the country following the violent suppression of popular protests in 1988. Since then, U.S. Congress has placed overlapping sanctions on the country at various times, resulting in differing restrictions, waiver provisions, expiration conditions, and reporting requirements. Myanmar announced a series of reforms after elections in 2010 brought a civilian government with close ties to the military to power.","British Prime Minister David Cameron is to arrive in Myanmar Friday .

"(CNN) -- Gunmen opened fire at an illegal cockfighting ring in southern Texas early Thursday morning, killing three people and wounding at least eight, the Hidalgo County sheriff's office told CNN. Sheriff Lupe Trevino told CNN affiliate KRGV that his deputies are ""dealing with a crime scene from hell."" The injured were taken to hospitals in the area, sheriff's communication supervisor Gloria Felix told CNN. The site, a ranch near the city of Elsa, hosted a sophisticated cockfighting operation complete with concession stands and bleachers, the sheriff told KRGV. Several masked gunmen opened fire, and people took off running into the brush, he said. Deputies were looking for witnesses and evidence. No arrests had been made as of Thursday morning.

"(CNN) -- The NAACP chapter in Dallas is calling for an end to the Texas state lottery, saying the game drains the finances of low-income ticket-buyers who can least afford it, especially minorities. ""It's an addiction,"" chapter President Juanita Wallace said. ""Many, many people have actually spent all their money in hope of getting out of a situation, when in fact, they're getting themselves into a worse situation."" She said one man she knew died last week without health insurance. ""He had an insurance policy,"" she said, ""and he withdrew all of the funds from the policy, actually, to play the lottery."" Wallace also believes that minorities are disproportionately drawn to playing the lottery. ""The way things are set up in the store is targeted for black people and poor people,"" she said. A spokeswoman with the Texas Lottery Commission rejected that assertion, saying the Texas lottery does not target low-income areas specifically and does not market any differently from one demographic to another. Four $1M Powerball tickets sold in same county, at same chain . ""Our marketing and advertising efforts are designed to reach a broad audience of adult Texans,"" spokeswoman Kelly Cripe said. Wallace says her NAACP chapter is already lobbying lawmakers, as are organizations like the Baptist General Convention of Texas that were already opposed to the lottery. But at a convenience store in Dallas this week, some ticket-buyers did not appreciate the idea of losing the option of playing. ""It's up to me,"" David Anderson told CNN affiliate station KTVT as he stood in line. ""If I make a certain amount, it's up to me: Should I spend this $5 (on a ticket)? Or should I go buy a loaf of bread and hamburger to feed the kids?"" Professor Irwin Morris of the University of Maryland says low-income people are more likely to play the lottery, not necessarily because they are targeted but because they have more to gain. ""It's an opportunity to change your living circumstances,"" he said. ""So for someone who's already wealthy, it would take a dramatic lottery win -- a Lotto, let's say -- to significantly change their living circumstances. If someone is of much more meager means, a much smaller win could literally change the character of their living circumstances."" Adviser to lottery winners: Take the money and hush . As a result, he said, ""I think there is considerable evidence that the poor pay a greater portion of their income on lotteries than the wealthy."" Statistics show that for the Pick 3 lottery in Texas, a third of people who make less than $20,000 play, but only about a quarter or fewer of people making more than $20,000 do. And for instant scratch-off tickets, the most popular game, unemployed people were more likely to play than employed people or retirees. Wallace says that means the people who can least afford it are the most likely to splurge. Lottery players point out that the games are fun to play, and they offer the hope of winning life-altering riches. The ticket sales also raise substantial revenues for state coffers. ""Since the first ticket was sold in 1992, the Texas Lottery has generated $20 billion in revenue for the state,"" Cripe said, ""and contributed more than $14 billion to the Foundation School Fund. These are not insignificant numbers."" Morris said he has not seen evidence that states with lotteries spend more on schools than states without. But now that states have come to rely on those revenues, he said, it would be difficult for a state to pull the plug on its lottery. ""If that were eliminated,"" he said, ""how difficult would it be politically to come up with the same amount of revenue through other taxes or fees?"" School teachers become secret millionaires with Mega Millions win .","Dallas chapter says lottery drains money from those who can least afford it .

"(Ars Technica) -- Apple's prized product designer Jonathan (""Jony"") Ive is a constant source of fascination among the press -- doubly so after the death of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Though Ive appears with relative frequency in news articles and documentaries, interest in his design philosophy has never let up. Perhaps that is because Ive has always spoken in an abstract, philosophical sense about the way he approaches design, which only seems to perpetuate the mystery surrounding one of Apple's core talents. In an extensive two-part interview published in UK newspaper The Telegraph on Wednesday, Ive discussed some of his product approaches as well as his attitudes toward design failures, Apple's performance under newly minted CEO Tim Cook, and more. IBM worries iPhone's Siri has loose lips . The interview itself is worth reading, but we took interest in a few highlights from throughout his discussion with The Telegraph. Among them: . -- Contrary to popular belief, Ive says the iPad 2's design was not inspired by the making of a samurai sword. Rumor after the iPad 2's launch in 2011 was that Ive had traveled to Japan to watch the process of creating such a sword, which then translated to the ""razor edge"" of the iPad 2, but Ive insists this is just lore. -- Don't like the stitched leather UI on a number of Apple's iOS and Lion applications, like Find My Friends, Maps, and iCal? It seems that Ive doesn't either -- The Telegraph claims Ive ""winced"" when asked about the stitched leather, but gave a diplomatic response: ""My focus is very much working with the other teams on the product ideas and then developing the hardware and so that's our focus and that's our responsibility. In terms of those elements you're talking about, I'm not really connected to that."" Apple's new 'spaceship' campus: What will the neighbors say? -- Ive says he thinks the products he's currently working on are the ""most important and the best work we've done."" This seems to fall along the company line of always hinting at the next big thing, but Ive heavily implies that some of Apple's unreleased products are truly his best work. ""[W]hich of course I can't tell you about."" -- Ive acknowledges that not all of his designs are successful, but most of them remain behind closed doors. Still, it's hard for him to part with a product design once the team decides the product just isn't going to work. ""[T]here have been times when we've been working on a program and when we are at a very mature stage and we do have solutions and you have that sinking feeling because you're trying to articulate the values to yourself and to others just a little bit too loudly,"" he said. ""And you have that sinking feeling that the fact that you are having to articulate the value and persuade other people is probably indicative of the fact that actually it's not good enough. On a number of occasions we've actually all been honest with ourselves and said 'you know, this isn't good enough, we need to stop'. And that's very difficult."" Former Apple employee explains 'upside-down' logo . -- On Tim Cook's potential ""failures"" as a CEO compared to Steve Jobs, Ive strongly believes that won't happen. ""We're developing products in exactly the same way that we were two years ago, five years ago, ten years ago. It's not that there are a few of us working in the same way: there is a large group of us working in the same way,"" he said. Ive, who has been knighted before the UK for his various achievements, was knighted once again on Wednesday for his services in design and enterprise.

"(CNN) -- The principal cellist of the Beijing Symphony Orchestra has been dismissed from his post after a video of his boorish behavior on a passenger train last week outraged users on Chinese social networks. Russian national Oleg Vedernikov was filmed with his bare feet placed on the headrest of a female passenger in front of him. He refused to remove them after she repeatedly objected, then taunted her and used obscenities in Chinese as she swatted at his feet with a newspaper and threw magazines and plastic bottles at him in frustration. When train staff showed up, he denied knowledge of the incident. But the heated exchange, captured on video by a fellow passenger, provoked widespread public criticism after it was widely circulated on Chinese microblogging website Sina Weibo. The orchestra announced Vedernikov's dismissal in a statement published Monday on its official website. ""Beijing Symphony Orchestra firmly believes that Oleg's conduct has badly damaged the orchestra's reputation,"" the statement said. ""In accordance with the orchestra's regulations and the terms of his employment contract, Beijing Symphony Orchestra has dismissed him."" Music director and principal conductor Tan Lihua said, ""the orchestra, as a civilized envoy of high culture, requires all of its staff, including foreign performers, to comply with the country's laws and regulations as well as traditional moral standards."" Vedernikov's dismissal is the latest in a series of high-profile incidents involving foreigners behaving badly in China. Two weeks ago, a drunk British tourist was captured on video attempting to sexually assault a Chinese woman in public. Again, this provoked widespread anger on social networking sites, and came at a time when the government is cracking down on foreigners living and working in the country without proper credentials.

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal beat Novak Djokovic in a one-sided Monte Carlo Masters final Sunday to claim his eighth straight title in the principality. Nadal brushed aside the world number one 6-3 6-1 in just 78 minutes to end a run of seven straight defeats in finals to the Serbian, including this year's six-hour epic at the Australian Open. ""I've always felt unbelievable here,"" a visibly emotional Nadal said after his emphatic victory. ""It's unbelievable to win this historic tournament eight times. I always feel great when I come here. ""I had lost to Novak seven times, so losing eight would not have been much different. But to win this one makes a big difference."" Nadal has made the title his own at the distinctive clay court tournament overlooking the Mediterranean and was clinching his 20th in a Masters 1000 tournament, the first man to reach that landmark. But he had not won on the ATP Tour since claiming the French Open at Roland Garros last June as Djokovic has dominated. Djokovic, who was playing this week after learning of the death of his grandfather in Serbia, took the first game to love but struggled to maintain that level. ""I'm sorry for my performance today, Rafa played well and deserved to win today,"" said Djokovic. ""I'm still very happy to reach the finals for the second time,"" he added, referring to his 2009 loss to Nadal in Monte Carlo.

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Mexican authorities were investigating Wednesday after finding the dismembered bodies of 15 people inside two vehicles on a highway in western Mexico, state media reported. Investigators were working to determine the ages, genders and identities of the victims, Jalisco state Attorney General Tomas Coronado Olmos said. The bodies, found in two vehicles on a highway between the cities of Guadalajara and Chapala, could be connected with the kidnapping of 12 people in a nearby municipality, Coronado said, according to the state-run Notimex news agency. The discovery occurred more than five months after authorities found 26 bodies in three vehicles near a monument on one of Guadalajara's main avenues. Jalisco state has seen an increase in violence since 2008, as clashes increase between drug cartels over trafficking routes and local drug sales. Several weeks after the bodies were found in November, state prosecutors said they had arrested three men who masterminded those killings. The suspects, they said, were members of the Milenio cartel, which is allied with the Zetas and fighting for territory in the region with the powerful Sinaloa cartel. More than 47,000 people have been killed in drug-related violence since Mexican President Felipe Calderon announced a crackdown on cartels in December 2006, according to government statistics. But brutal cartel killings have been less common in Guadalajara, Mexico's second-most populous city.

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- A small plane crashed after it was unable to land in a mountainous area of Nepal on Monday, killing 15 of the 21 people on board, aviation officials said. The plane was about a mile from the airport at Jomsom, a popular tourist town in central Nepal, when it went down, said Purusottam Shakya, deputy director of air traffic service operations in Kathmandu. It was operated by Agni Air, a Nepalese carrier. Six of the 21 people on board somehow survived the impact. They include an air hostess, two Danish passengers and three Indian passengers, said Bindesh Lal Karna, an official for the Rescue Coordination Committee at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. Of the Indian survivors, two are children aged 6 and 9, while the other is a man who is now in intensive care, according to Karna. The thirteen other Indian passengers on the plane and the two other crew members were killed. The survivors were airlifted to the town of Pokhara, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) west of Kathmandu. According to Karna, the crash occurred after a technical problem prevented the plane from landing normally after a flight from Pokhara. Karna said the pilot decided to turn the plane around and head back to Pokhara, but as he did so, the plane dropped out of the air. Jomsom is the gateway to Muktinath Temple, a pilgrimage site for Hindus from Nepal and India. The temple is about six hours' walk from the airport, in the Annapurna range of mountains, a part of the Himalayas popular among hiking enthusiasts. The crash is the second disaster to hit the Annapurna region in less than two weeks. On May 5, a flash flood swept away houses near a river that flows down from the mountain range. Thirty-one bodies have been recovered from the flooding, while 40 people are still missing, according to the local police.

"(CNN) -- Seriously, iPhone fans? Just hours after Instagram, a mobile app that lets users layer pre-programmed filters over their photos to achieve maximum hipness, launched on Google's Android operating system Tuesday, the snark began. Until then, the 18-month-old app had been exclusive to Apple devices. ""Instagram went from a gated community to section 8 all in 1 day,"" wrote Twitter user @joelby1328. That widely shared message (surrounded by other gems such as ""I'm smoking with a (expletive) newbie! She still has other people light her bowl for her!!!"") was as good a representative as any of a surprising number of tweets suggesting, or downright saying, that Android phone users are in some way inferior to iPhone owners. More than 1 million Android users downloaded the app in the first 24 hours, and it became the talk of the town online. According to one analysis, there were 719,874 Twitter mentions of Instagram and Android within the first 24 hours of the app's release. Many of them weren't exactly complimentary. ""With Instagram for Android I can upload photos of abandoned beers on the backs of bar toilets RIGHT from my mobile phone!"" said a user whose screen name won't be repeated here. In fairness, even thousands of comments only represent a tiny portion of the folks who own iPhones, iPads or iPods with Web capabilities. But they highlight one of the Internet's most enduring (and some would say annoying) geek fights. Conflict-minded Apple fans argue that Android phones are less slick and uglier, and that they junk up the system with low-quality apps generated in its open developer community. Android diehards counter that many Apple fans will blindly buy up anything the company produces and that the closed iOS system stifles creativity. ""And that's the most remarkable takeaway of this phenomenon, I think: that which smartphone we own has begun to inform our identities,"" wrote CNET's Emily Dreyfuss. ""In our gadget-filled lives, our phones have become another way for us to organize ourselves into separate groups, to label each other as 'other' and 'apart.' Our tech has come to define us."" While there's definitely a ""first world problem"" aspect of squabbling about smartphones, as Android continues to grow in market share, there may in fact be a class-war element at work here. Apple offers one iPhone, with a price tag that ranges up to $399 and, in many cases, with an expensive monthly data plan to go with it. Android, meanwhile, is available on a wide range of phones. While there are certainly some high-end models, such as the new phone-tablet hybrid Samsung Galaxy Note, Android also runs on cheaper, less-advanced phones and on discount carriers instead of the handful of Apple-approved networks that the iPhone can access. ""So while there is often a tinge of irony or the hahahaha-colored patina of UGH in the proclamations of iPhone users disgusted by the idea of the Android barbarians at the gate,"" wrote Matt Buchanan at BuzzFeed, ""under the surface is a more general tension between a population that tends to be more affluent and often manifests that affluence as a form of taste ... and one of the masses, a population filled with some segments that, generally speaking, have less of a voice in culture already, particularly in technology."" Here's hoping that the app snobbery soon fades. One sign of hope? Maybe Apple and Android fans can band together in the face of a common enemy.

"(CNN) -- Christian groups in the Philippines planned to protest Lady Gaga's performances there Monday and Tuesday, just after Muslim protests have cast doubt whether she will be allowed to perform in Indonesia. ""This protest is not against Lady Gaga as a person but on her music and on how she declares distorted views about the Lord Jesus Christ,"" said Reuben Abante, bishop of Lighthouse Bible Baptist Church and secretary-general of Biblemode Youth, which is leading the protests. Reached by phone, Abante said he expected a couple thousand protesters outside the Manila venue, Mall of Asia Arena, Monday night for a grand prayer rally before the concert. ""We are Christian Filipinos. She comes to our land. For us, this is something that should not be shown to the youth we have."" His brother, the group's president, is former Congressman Benny Abante, himself a pastor. Of particular offense to the group is the pop star's song, ""Judas,"" with lyrics like, ""Whoa whoa I'm in love with Juda-as, Jud-as,"" ""Jesus is my virtue and Judas is the demon I cling to I cling to."" Lady Gaga's Filipino promoter, Ovation Productions, is run by Renen de Guia, who is described on the company's website as a born-again Christian. Attempts to reach him were not successful. When asked if Lady Gaga's concerts could contravene Philippine laws, Loretta Ann P. Rosales, chairwoman of the Commission on Human Rights, replied in an email, ""The Philippines is proud of the fact that we do indeed have one of the best Bill of Rights in our Constitution that has the widest latitude as all other Constitutional democracies in protecting freedom of thought, freedom of expression, freedom of religion."" ""I have heard raves over her concert by Filipinos who have watched her,"" she added. ""Maybe I shall have a chance to enjoy her concert too one day."" It is not the first time Rosales and Abante have faced off; in 2006, while both were in Congress, Abante had blocked passage of an anti-discrimination bill co-authored by Rosales aimed at protecting lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders. For Lady Gaga, the protests in the Philippines are the latest in her problematic Asian tour. Her provocative lyrics and risquÃ© costumes have prompted conservative Muslims in Indonesia to call for the cancellation of her upcoming concert in Jakarta. As of Monday, her Indonesian promoter, Big Daddy Entertainment, was still trying to secure a permit, and the June 3 event was still on, according to its website.

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal won a record sixth title at the Rome Masters to strike a psychological blow over Novak Djokovic ahead of the French Open. The Spaniard won 7-5, 6-4 to help erase painful memories from last year's final when Nadal again faced Djokovic only for the Serb to come out on top. The victory also ends a run of seven defeats for Nadal against Djokovic. ""Winning is important, when you lose you play with doubts,"" Nadal told AFP after the match. ""This was an important match. I will put this trophy in my bedroom. It is a dream of confidence I am playing well. ""This comes when I play at the right level, hopefully I'll keep playing like this."" The victory, which follows Nadal's shock early exit in Madrid on the now-infamous blue clay, also sees the Spaniard leapfrog Roger Federer into second place in the world rankings.

Meanwhile world number one Djokovic must pick himself up after a frustrating display in Rome.

""I think that the match today was quite close, even if he won in straight sets. ""If you don't use the opportunities against Rafa he gets momentum. I made a lot of errors which should not happen when you play against Nadal. I will go to Paris with confidence and I played a great week.""

"(CNN) -- Norway's world 100-meter breaststroke champion and Olympic silver medalist Alexander Dale Oen has died suddenly at the age 26. In a statement on its official website, the Norwegian swimming federation said Dale Oen was found collapsed in his bathroom after a cardiac arrest late Monday in Arizona where he was participating in a training camp. The team's doctor Ola Roensen tried to resuscitate him before he was taken to the nearby Flagstaff Medical Center. He was pronounced dead at 9 p.m. local time. ""We're all in shock,"" Norway's national swimming coach Petter Loevberg said. ""This is an out-of-body experience for the whole team over here. Our thoughts primarily go to his family who have lost Alexander way too early."" Dale Oen won the 100-meter breaststroke at last year's world championships in Shanghai, three days after Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people in a bomb and gun attack in Norway. The swimmer poignantly pointed to the Norwegian flag on his cap, and later dedicated his win to the victims. ""Everyone back home now is of course paralyzed with what happened,"" he said after the race. ""But it was important for me to symbolize that even though I'm here in China, I'm able to feel the same emotions."" Dale Oen also won silver at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing for Norway's first ever swimming medal and was expected to be one of the country's main hopes for gold in London later this year. World swimming's governing body FINA said he was ""certainly preparing a brilliant participation at the upcoming Olympic Games in London."" Norway's swimming federation did not give a cause of the cardiac arrest. It said Dale Oen had only had a light workout on Monday and had seemed in good health. ""This is the blackest day in the history of Norwegian swimming,"" said Per Rune Eknes, president of the federation. Four-time Olympic breaststroke champion Kosuke Kitajima, who Dale Oen would have been looking to beat in London, tweeted that he was ""in shock over the passing of a dear friend and great rival. RIP Alex."" Cameron van der Burgh of South Africa, who took bronze behind Dale Oen in Shanghai last year, wrote on Twitter: ""To my greatest rival. My greatest friend. My brother in breaststroke. May you rest in peace. One love."" In his final tweet written on the day of his death, Dale Oen wrote that he was looking forward to returning to his hometown, Bergen. ""2 days left of our camp up here in Flagstaff,then its back to the most beautiful city in Norway."" Dale Oen's death comes 18 months after American open-water swimmer Fran Crippen died during a race in the United Arab Emirates, also at the age of 26. Crippen's death was caused by heat exhaustion leading to drowning.","Norwegian swimmer Alexander Dale Oen dies suddenly at the age of 26 .

"(EW.com) -- The ""Games"" have officially begun! Last night, ""The Hunger Games"" grossed a truly staggering $19.7 million from midnight showings across the country -- the highest midnight total ever for a non-sequel, and the seventh highest midnight total ever (behind three ""Harry Potters"" and three ""Twilights""). After only a few hours, it's clear that the film is already a smash, and it's almost certainly headed for a debut well above the $100 million mark. Sure, the overnight figure can't compare to the $43.5 million that ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 2"" conjured up at midnight shows last year (on its way to $169.3 million -- the highest opening weekend of all time), or the $30.3 million that ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn -- Part 1"" found at midnight on its way to $138.1 million, but it's likely that ""The Hunger Games,"" which doesn't have the same amount of built-in sequel anticipation, won't face the same weekend frontloadedness as those titles. Saturday and Sunday grosses should prove quite sturdy. Back in 2008, ""The Dark Knight"" earned $18.5 million at midnight, but still managed a stunning $158 million debut -- the second highest debut of all time -- proving that not every blockbuster makes a full 25 percent of its opening weekend gross at midnight. Based on this $19.7 million figure, ""The Hunger Games"" should take in at least $50 million on Friday and could reach as high as $150 million over the full weekend frame -- although that estimation is very bullish. My fellow box office prognosticating colleague John Young is predicting a more sensible $130 million weekend. We'll have to wait and see see how high it climbs. Either way, it appears that the odds are very much in Lionsgate's favor! See the full article at EW.com.

"Washington (CNN) -- A day after the head of the General Services Administration resigned because of a procurement scandal at the federal agency, officials vowed Tuesday to implement spending reforms and disciplinary action she announced on the way out the door. A letter Monday from now-former GSA Administrator Martha Johnson agreed with the recommendations of the GSA inspector general in a report that documented massive overspending, questionable expenditures and a cavalier attitude toward procurement rules surrounding a regional training conference held in Las Vegas in 2010. The inspector general's report on the GSA ""Western Regions"" training conference showed the government spent more than $822,000 for the 300 attendees, including $75,000 on team-building exercises, $6,000 on commemorative coins and $6,000 on canteens, keychains and T-shirts. Johnson said the details in the report are ""egregious,"" and ""absolutely unacceptable,"" and she announced measures that include ""disciplinary action against several senior management officials."" Johnson's letter to the inspector general did not name names, but a congressional panel late Tuesday said the agency's Public Buildings Service Commissioner Robert Peck was fired. Before she resigned Monday, Johnson canceled certain GSA regional training conferences in the future, put others under the oversight of different agency officials and announced tighter controls and review over GSA's procurement and contract spending. U.S. House lawmakers now plan a hearing to review the findings and potentially call for additional steps. Florida Republican Rep. John Mica issued a statement saying ""the tab even included a clown for entertainment. This is just the tip of the iceberg."" Mica is chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, the panel that will hold a hearing on the matter within weeks. The misconduct allegedly started during planning for the Las Vegas event about two years ago. After Johnson's resignation Monday, the administration named as acting administrator Dan Tangherlini, who was brought over from the U.S. Treasury Department. Tangherlini said in a letter of introduction to GSA employees that the agency was taking some immediate action ""to ensure that our customers maintain their faith in our services."" Those measure include a review of planned conferences and meetings that involve travel or substantial expenditures of public funds and the cancellation of a number of conferences that only or primarily involved staff, he said in the letter. Tangherlini also the agency would evaluate its conference and travel policy and business justification. Among the items cited in the inspector general's report was a $12,000 finder's fee paid to an outside company to book the ""M Resort"" complex and hotel for the convention, despite the fact the GSA has event planners on staff who are supposed to do that on the agency's behalf. Then there was the food bill. The inspector general's report hit GSA for catering events portrayed as ""awards"" ceremonies, apparently as a pretext to having the expense covered. The ""awards"" were for entertainment, in what the investigation said was a talent show among participants. In its findings, the report said: ""The proper purpose of an awards ceremony is to give out awards recognizing significant contributions to the efficiency and effectiveness of government operations, rather than holding an event and giving out awards as an ancillary purpose to justify food."" The investigation was prompted by a GSA deputy administrator, according to the report, who asked for a probe of ""employee misconduct"" and questionable spending on activity surrounding the Western Regions conference held at a resort hotel in October, 2010. GSA employs nearly 13,000 people across the country, and is the federal agency that buys and manages goods and services for the government ranging from envelopes to real estate and office buildings. As staffers got word of the 16-page report, reaction Tuesday was described as grim. GSA press secretary Gregory Mecher told CNN, ""I think there's a general feeling of being disturbed, and that people are appalled by the report."" Also Tuesday, the watchdog group Common Cause called the report ""mind-boggling,"" and praised the GSA official who came forward to make the allegations. In a statement obtained by CNN, Common Cause president Bob Edgar said, ""Every federal employee should be looking at every expenditure with a critical eye and asking: 'Is this necessary? Does it serve the public interest?'"" Another group, Public Notice, which urges a policy of fiscal restraint, issued a statement Tuesday that said ""GSA's boondoggle is a small symptom of a much larger problem"" of government overspending. Executive Director Gretchen Hamel called on congressional lawmakers to cross party lines, negotiate and craft a sustainable federal budget.","NEW: Acting GSA head promises immediate action to maintain ""faith in our services""

"Chicago (CNN) -- Jurors deliberated a full day without reaching a verdict Thursday in the trial of a man accused of killing the mother, brother and 7-year-old nephew of entertainer Jennifer Hudson. William Balfour, Hudson's former brother-in-law, faces charges of first-degree murder, home invasion, residential burglary and possession of a stolen vehicle. He has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyer has argued that there is no forensic evidence linking him to the killings. Heated closing arguments Wednesday set a tense tone in the courtroom before the judge sent the 12 jurors into deliberations. The singer-actress kept her head down during much of Cook County Prosecutor Jennifer Bagby's closing argument. After showing autopsy photos of the victims, Bagby pointed toward Balfour. ""It's time to hold him responsible,"" she said. ""They have failed to prove their case,"" Balfour's attorney Amy Thompson said Wednesday during her closing argument, her voice rising. ""He is on trial for his life."" Thompson argued that police homed in on Balfour rather than conducting a full investigation. ""In their mind, this wasn't a whodunnit,"" she said. No DNA evidence points to Balfour, said Thompson, who also questioned police work in the case, describing a set of keys that she said surfaced on an evidence list a month after the slayings. ""Those keys show how desperate the state was. They resorted to this. ... My client is an innocent man,"" she said. But prosecutors argued that physical and circumstantial evidence links Balfour to the killings and described as ""absurd"" defense claims that police may have planted evidence or been part of a conspiracy to frame Balfour. Prosecutor Jim McKay told jurors that there was a ""tsunami of circumstantial evidence."" ""The circumstantial facts of this case are drowning this guy in guilt,"" he said. Bagby said in her closing argument that Balfour had threatened to kill the family of Julia Hudson, Jennifer Hudson's sister. ""If you leave me, I'll kill you. I'll kill your family first. You'll be the last to die,"" he had said, according to Bagby. ""He went in that house for one reason, and one reason only, to carry out that threat,"" Bagby told jurors. Balfour is accused of fatally shooting Hudson's mother, Darnell Donerson, 57, and the singer's brother, Jason Hudson, 29, in their Chicago home in October 2008. The body of Hudson's 7-year-old nephew, Julian King, was found three days later in an abandoned vehicle. Prosecutors have portrayed Balfour as a jealous man who murdered the three people in a rage at the thought that his wife had a boyfriend. In her closing argument, Bagby said Balfour shot Hudson's mother as she tried to defend herself with a broom. ""He fired that gun at her over and over and over,"" Bagby said. McKay called Balfour ""a true coward."" ""He shoots a 57-year-old grandmother in the back. He shoots a 29-year-old man in his sleep. He shoots a 7-year-old twice in the head,"" McKay told jurors. ""The family, the community, the city, the country demand justice."" There have been 83 witnesses and 11 days of testimony in the trial. Hudson, who was on hand through the trial, was called as the prosecution's first witness. She broke down in tears several times on the stand as she recalled her family. ""None of us wanted her to marry him,"" Hudson said of her sister's decision to marry Balfour. ""We did not like how he treated her. ""Where he was, I tried not to be,"" she said. The deaths took place a year after Hudson, who rose to fame as a contestant on ""American Idol,"" won an Oscar for her role in the movie ""Dreamgirls."" In a recent interview with CNN's Piers Morgan, Hudson reflected on the life of her mother. ""My mother was a very wise and strong person. I feel like she raised us well, and she prepared me well, and so that's what I live by,"" she said. Her career has continued to blossom and remains varied since her relatives' deaths. Recent milestones include penning a memoir detailing her struggles with her weight; being cast as Nelson Mandela's ex-wife, Winnie, in an upcoming movie; releasing a new album; and singing a well-received tribute to Whitney Houston at the Grammy Awards in February.

"(CNN) -- Dharun Ravi, the former Rutgers University student convicted of bias intimidation by use of a hidden webcam, is expected to appear in court on Wednesday, one day after he apologized for his behavior and said he plans to submit to his impending jail sentence. ""I accept responsibility for and regret my thoughtless, insensitive, immature, stupid and childish choices that I made on September 19, 2010, and September 21, 2010,"" Ravi said in a written statement on Tuesday. Ravi was sentenced to serve 30 days in jail, three years of probation and must complete 300 hours of community service aimed at assisting victims of bias crimes. He plans to surrender himself on Thursday. Ravi also must pay more than $11,000 in restitution. The state's decision to appeal the sentence automatically stayed it, according to Ravi's attorney Steven Altman. He is allowed, however, to chose to go ahead and serve it so long as he waives any double jeopardy claim, the attorney said. The purpose of Wednesday's court appearance is to place that waiver on the record, said Altman. ""I decided to accept and hopefully complete the sentence as soon as possible. It's the only way I can go on with my life,"" Ravi said in his statement. Ravi's gay roommate killed himself by jumping off New York's George Washington Bridge. Tyler Clementi, an 18-year-old freshman, plunged to his death into the Hudson River after learning Ravi had secretly spied via a webcam as Clementi had an intimate encounter with another man. Middlesex County Prosecutor Bruce J. Kaplan has said Ravi's crimes warranted ""more than a 30-day jail term"" and called Superior Judge Glenn Berman's sentence ""insufficient under the sentencing laws of this state, the facts that were determined by a jury and long-standing appellate precedent."" Was 30-day sentence fair? Calling the appeal ""a registering of outrage,"" CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin said there is ""very little chance"" the sentence will be overturned. He noted that under New Jersey law, the judge had the flexibility to sentence Ravi to anything from zero to 10 years in prison.","NEW: Dharun Ravi is expected to appear in court on Wednesday .

"Paris (CNN) -- New French President Francois Hollande has chosen mostly moderates for his Cabinet, indicating an effort to build a broad coalition in the country. The Socialist leader selected moderates to serve as ministers of labor, economy, foreign affairs, defense and other posts. The Cabinet, announced Wednesday, also includes several leftists and at least one minister who comes from the Socialist Party's right wing. Half of the 34 ministers and junior ministers are women. And the group spans generations: The youngest is 34; the eldest is 66. Many are experts in their fields. ""It's a renewed government,"" said newly named Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault. ""It's the change the French wanted."" The Cabinet includes moderate left political figures Michel Sapin as labor minister and Laurent Fabius as foreign minister. Pierre Moscovici will be minister of economy and finance, and his fellow moderate, Socialist Jean-Yves Le Drian, will be defense minister. Officials with strong left-leaning tendencies were chosen as ministers of education, industry and environment. Manuel Valls, from the right wing of the Socialist Party, will be minister of interior. Hollande, the country's first Socialist president since Francois Mitterrand left office in 1995, won an election this month against incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy. Very few of Hollande's Cabinet selections served under Mitterrand. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne contributed to this report.","NEW: ""It's the change the French wanted,"" Prime Minister Ayrault says .

"London (CNN) -- More than 20 years after its independence from the Soviet Union, Estonia has become one of Europe's rare economic success stories. The Baltic state of 1.3 million people joined the eurozone last year, becoming the fastest growing economy within the single currency. Today it has the highest per capita GDP of any of the former Soviet republics. Vesa Kandell is general manager of a plant for ABB, a Swiss industrial group which is one of Estonia's biggest investors, operating four factories and employing 1000 people. He told CNN's Richard Quest Estonia has become an important high-tech production hub for ABB during its two decades in the country. This is partly due to having the highly skilled workforce required to produce the company's generators, used to power everything from wind turbines to electric vehicle chargers. ""We need engineers to design the world class products, we need engineers to run the production, we need a very skilled people to run the operations here on the shop floor,"" he said. ""There [are] well-educated engineering people, but also well-educated hard working people for the factory operations."" Companies operating in Estonia also received valuable support from the government, which imposed no tax on profits reinvested in businesses. ""The business environment here is very modern and liberal. It's not as hard and slow as many other countries,"" he said. The government here [has] a very strong focus on developing the business side."" In Estonia's capital, Tallinn, Artjom Sokolov, the chief executive officer of Estonian Cell, said that the company had felt the consequences of joining the eurozone during the Greek debt crisis. The business, which produces pulp for the paper industry, had to pay close attention to the currency markets as its costs were in euros and its prices in dollars. The fluctuating exchange rates had been affecting the business. Sokolov said he kept half his savings in dollars to mitigate the risk of the euro failing. ""I believe in a couple of years, maybe four to five years time, there is a likelihood that there is not such a euro as we currently have it,"" he said. He said western Europe had something to learn from the work ethic of Estonia and other eastern European countries. ""The welfare state is over, people have to accept that the good life is over. They have to start working in western Europe, because strikes will not help,"" he said. ""What is good in the case of Estonia is people haven't forgotten how to work.""","Estonia joined the eurozone last year and is its fastest growing economy .
