"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi, fresh from becoming the first player to win the prestigious Ballon d'Or award on four occasions, found himself on the bench as Barcelona cruised past Cordoba in the Copa del Rey. The Argentine, who scored an astonishing 91 goals for club and country in 2012, watched on from the sidelines as Barca recorded a 5-0 win to wrap up a 7-0 aggregate victory. Messi crowned world's best for record fourth time . Cordoba, which plays in the third tier, was blown away as two goals from David Villa and a Thiago Alcantara strike put Barcelona three goals ahead inside the opening 26 minutes. Alexis Sanchez scored twice after the break as the La Liga leaders set up a quarterfinal clash with Malaga, despite the absence of coach Tito Vilanova. The 44-year-old missed the game to seek medical advice following an operation for cancer of the salivary gland. Vilanova returns as Barca get back to work . Vilanova, who was present for last weekend's 4-0 win over city rival Espanyol, faces six weeks of chemotherapy and radiotherapy following the operation which took place on December 20.

"(CNN) -- Wednesday's presidential debate might very well give Mitt Romney a significant boost, but the former governor still faces a difficult path. One of the more intriguing aspects of the 2012 election is that Mitt Romney might win a substantial majority among white voters while still losing the presidential election. Regardless of the outcome of this election, the rising minority share of the electorate will force a deep rethinking of Republican strategy. Back in 2008, John McCain won 55% of the non-Hispanic white vote against 43% for Barack Obama. It is worth noting that Obama increased the Democratic share of the white vote by 2 percentage points relative to Sen. John Kerry, the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee. Opinion: To woo Latinos, Romney needs specifics . At the same time, Obama won 95% of the African-American vote, an increase of 7 percentage points compared with Kerry, and 66% of the Latino vote, an even more impressive increase of 13 percentage points. As Ron Brownstein, editorial director of National Journal and a CNN contributor, has observed, Obama's success among minority voters has put the Republican presidential nominee in a demographic bind. If we assume that Obama's support among black and Latino voters won't dramatically erode between now and November, Romney will have to outperform McCain by a substantial margin among white voters to win the presidential election. In light of recent Democratic success among college-educated white women and Romney's relatively weak performance among noncollege-educated white voters outside of the South, this will prove challenging. We see some of these dynamics at play in down-ballot races. In recent weeks, the prospects of a number of Republican candidates for the U.S. Senate have deteriorated. One of the bigger disappointments for the GOP is the growing gap in the polls between former New Mexico Rep. Heather Wilson, a Rhodes Scholar and U.S. Air Force veteran who is rightly regarded as having been one of the party's most talented female officeholders, and Rep. Martin Heinrich, the Democrat who now represents Wilson's old congressional district. Opinion: It's immigration, stupid, say Latino voters in Nevada . Republicans have long understood that New Mexico would be a tough race for them. Though a Republican, the charismatic Mexican-American prosecutor Susana Martinez won the state's gubernatorial election in 2010 by a margin of just under 7%, while Barack Obama won New Mexico's electoral votes over John McCain in 2008 by an impressive 15-point margin. So what might account for the differences in how Martinez and Wilson have been received by New Mexico voters? Part of the story is undoubtedly the fact that the electorate in midterm races tends to be smaller and older than in presidential years, which are more favorable to Democratic candidates. Another part of the story, however, is that the ethnic composition of New Mexico's electorate has also changed. That is, Latinos will likely represent a somewhat larger share of the electorate in 2012 than in 2010, and it is a safe bet that this share will increase over time. An Anglo Republican such as Wilson is by no means doomed to fare poorly among Latino voters. George W. Bush, for example, attracted a large share of the Latino vote in New Mexico and in the United States as a whole. Yet Martinez seems to have made deeper inroads into the Latino electorate than Wilson. Democrats appear to be consolidating recent gains in the largest Latino ethnic groups, including the vitally important Mexican-American constituency. The choice of San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro to give this year's keynote address at the Democratic National Convention was presumably made with this point in mind. A recent report by Ruy Teixeira and John Halpin of the center-left Center for American Progress -- ""The Path to 270 Revisited"" -- carefully documents the rising importance of America's nonwhite electorate to the outcome of presidential elections. Opinion: Romney shakes up the race . Along with Colorado and Nevada, New Mexico is part of a vitally important swing region that had until recent years been Republican-leaning. Teixeira and Halpin argue that the changing demographic composition of these states, and in particular the rising Latino share of the electorate, is a key reason why they have become friendlier terrain for Democratic candidates. Yet Teixeira and Halpin demonstrate that this dynamic doesn't apply just to the Southwest. In a number of so-called New South states, for example, the rising Latino share of the electorate is occurring alongside an increase in the African-American share of the electorate. Given the fact that the African-American electorate tends to strongly favor Democratic candidates, there is a distinct possibility that a number of states now considered reliably Republican, such as Georgia, might become competitive in the not-too-distant future. These larger trends raise two possibilities for future Republican candidates. One is that the GOP should work toward building substantially greater support among white voters. Even as the white share of the electorate decreases, winning a larger slice of a shrinking pie is a viable strategy. The biggest hurdle to this strategy, however, is the cultural polarization of the white electorate. Among younger white voters, for example, socially liberal views on issues such as same-sex marriage are quite common while older white voters, who have been a bedrock of GOP support, tend to embrace socially conservative views. Reconciling these positions might prove difficult. Leaving age differences aside, college-educated white voters tend to be less receptive to cultural populism than noncollege-educated white voters. Although many analysts have suggested that Republicans should embrace liberal positions on various social issues to appeal to college-educated white voters, this might endanger the party's hold on less-educated whites. Some attribute Romney's relatively poor performance among noncollege-educated white voters to a campaign message that caters more to the concerns of tax-sensitive voters than to less affluent voters. The second possibility, championed by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush among many others, is that Republicans should redouble their efforts to appeal to Latino voters. This strategy is often associated with the view that Republicans should embrace comprehensive immigration reform legislation that would create a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, a majority of whom are of Latin American origin. Opinion: The audacity of Romney's Etch a Sketch . It is not obvious, however, that this strategy would yield significant political dividends, and it would alienate voters who believe that creating a path to citizenship would undermine the credibility of future immigration enforcement efforts. A deeper look suggests that when you compare Latinos with non-Hispanic white voters of the same income level, the edge that Democrats have among Latinos shrinks. One possibility is that Republicans will improve their vote share among Latinos as Latino households experience greater wage and income growth. The problem, of course, is that recent years have seen extremely modest wage and household income gains. And so Republicans arguably have a strong political interest in policies that will raise wages and incomes. There are, of course, other factors. Residential integration, immigrant assimilation and intermarriage could all affect the political landscape in unpredictable ways. But if current trends hold, Republicans have a much greater need to expand their coalition than Democrats. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Reihan Salam.","Reihan Salam: Mitt Romney and GOP relying on white voters more than ever .

"(CNN) -- When Howard Chiou went to Taiwan for his grandmother's funeral, he had another dead person on his mind -- the cadaver he was dissecting in his anatomy class. The Emory University medical student kept dreaming about who this dead man might have been when he was alive. ""It was at the funeral that I learned that one of my uncles had the ability to see ghosts,"" said Chiou, sharing his story at Carapace, a monthly oral storytelling event in Atlanta. ""During the entire funeral, my uncle's there giving a play by play of what my grandmother's doing in spirit form,"" telling guests that she was happy they were present. After the funeral, the uncle listened to Chiou's dreams and suggested a diagnosis of ""spirit attachment"" and treatment for the body's restless spirit. As Chiou led up to the last day of his anatomy class three years ago, Carapace's standing room only crowd waited on pins and needles to hear if he applied his uncle's treatment to the body. Atlanta residents Randy Osborne and Joyce Mitchell started Carapace more than a year ago as a local chapter of the Moth, a New York City-based oral storytelling group with a growing number of programs around the country (and a few in other countries). The Atlanta group, which broke away from the Moth and held its first independent event last month, is one of a growing number of oral storytelling groups across the country telling true stories before a live audience. Many people in the audience usually make up the potential list of storytellers for the night. Veteran Carapace storyteller Tim Banks, a retired Delta employee, shared the tale of a hawk that kept vigil with mourners after his brother's funeral. Only after hawks continued to visit him did he mention it to his sister-in-law, who told him that his brother loved hawks and would stop the car to watch them anytime he spotted them. Atlanta advertising executive Ben Yaun, a first-timer at the event but a teller of stories within his family, held the audience captive with a tale of an enormous, attacking snapping turtle that took over a fishing trip from his childhood. ""It was prehistoric, I tell you, it was prehistoric!"" he shouted to laughter from the audience. ""There's no other type of performance really where the audience becomes the performer and becomes the audience again,"" Osborne said. ""There's the intimacy of telling a story without any notes. You're singing your own song and telling your own story. You're getting up there and finding your way in front of the audience's eyes."" Carapace rules are simple: Put your name in the hat and you might get picked, tell a personal story, keep it to five minutes, no notes, no political rants, no poetry, no grudges, no propaganda. Have a beginning, middle and end. Know the last line of your story. Pay your tab. Check out Carapace's Facebook page for the complete set of rules. Author George Dawes Green gets a lot of credit for the recent growth in oral storytelling as performance. Green founded the Moth in 1997 in his New York loft, inspired by nights with friends drinking Jack Daniels, playing poker and telling stories at his friend Wanda's home on St. Simons Island in Georgia. The group was named after the moths that would sneak through the rotten porch screens, drawn to the lights. ""Storytelling seems to be in our DNA,"" said Green, author of ""The Juror,"" ""Ravens"" and ""The Caveman's Valentine."" ""Stories are the ways in which we can impart dense clusters of information glued together by emotion. It's really how we learn about the world in a way we can grasp and remember."" The Moth has grown into a nonprofit with professional staff that runs storytelling events and competitions in New York, Los Angeles, Detroit and Chicago (with more cities to come) as well as storytelling training for corporations and high schools and community centers in underserved neighborhoods. There is also a Peabody-award winning Moth Radio Hour on public radio. Oral historian Stephen Sloan says oral storytelling speaks to our identity as human beings, and he isn't surprised at the recent popularity of true stories told live. ""Before technology, storytelling was how you knew what was meaningful, how you had any deep understanding of who you were and what your place was in the world,"" said Sloan, a history professor and director of Baylor University's Institute for Oral History. ""It was the way those ideas were communicated to us. That same thread is in these stories, the unscripted nature of it, the reality of it, the rawness of it. Something significant and very deep is conveyed through the relating of experience."" Those stories attract large crowds to Moth's flagship Mainstage programs in New York and elsewhere. The Moth staff chooses a theme and invites five people from all walks of life -- some known and some not known to the audience -- to tell 10-minute first person stories on stage, said Moth artistic director Catherine Burns. Although the stories aren't strictly memorized, the artistic staff helps the storyteller to frame stories so they know where they're going with their tales. ""It takes an enormous amount of work but that's what we're dedicating to doing,"" Burns said. As the Moth has grown and partnered with interested storytellers to launch ""MothUP"" affiliates in various cities around the country, a few local groups have chafed against rules more recently required by the national organization. The Moth intended MothUP affiliates to help create Moth StorySLAMs, which are the Moth's storytelling competitions, in those cities. The local groups in Atlanta and St. Louis have created communities of storytellers who have found a family, where a laugh or nod tells the teller that he has connected with the audience. The members weren't as interested in competition. Founders of both groups found they were violating other Moth rules: They had too many people attending to fit into a living room (a location requirement) and neither wanted to charge admission. Atlanta didn't want to have judging. St. Louis gave preference to first-time storytellers. ""We open the stage to anyone who wants to tell a story and we try to fit in as many stories as we can,"" said Stacey Wehe, a founder of the St. Louis group, now named the Saint Louis Ten. Both sides describe the parting as amicable. ""We underestimated what the demand would be, which is a luxury problem to have,"" Burns said. The Atlanta and St. Louis groups ""got to a size that wasn't what the program was supposed to be. We didn't want to hold them back but we weren't ready to launch a slam there. We hope we'll do more in those cities eventually."" Back at Manuel's Tavern in Atlanta, where Carapace holds its free monthly get-togethers, any storyteller who didn't get picked to speak was invited to come up on stage at the end of the evening to share their first, last or best line. Carapace's Osborne says it tends to be a popular part of the program, and that June night is no different. Atlanta resident Shannon Turner, who was raised in the oral storytelling tradition in Appalachia, has the crowd wanting more with her single line: ""And that, my friends, is how God kept me a virgin.""","Carapace is an oral storytelling group that has people tell true stories before an audience .
Rules: Tell a personal story, keep it to five minutes, no notes, no political rants, no poetry .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of veterans may have been exposed to hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV because of medical oversights that allowed insulin pens to be used on more than one patient at a Veterans Administration hospital in Buffalo, New York, according to a memo from the Department of Veterans Affairs to Congress. ""On November 1, 2012, officials at the (Veterans Affairs Western New York Healthcare System) reported that while conducting pharmacy inspection rounds on the inpatient units, they discovered that insulin pens intended for individual patient use were found in the supply drawer of the medication carts without a patient label on them,"" said the memo, obtained by CNN through the office of U.S. Rep. Brian Higgins, D-New York. ""Although the disposable needles were changed each time it was used, the insulin pens intended for individual patient use may have been used on more than one patient."" ""There is a very small chance that some patients could have been exposed to the hepatitis B virus, the hepatitis C virus, or HIV, based on practices identified at the facility,"" the congressional memo states. ""(The health system) determined that all veterans who were prescribed the insulin pen during an inpatient stay from October 19, 2010, to November 1, 2012, should be notified."" The veterans' health care system has found that 716 patients may have been affected during this time period, Jim Blue, regional director of the VA's Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs, told CNN. ""Veterans and their families will have an opportunity to speak with a nurse who will answer questions they may have and assist with managing followup care,"" Blue said. VA under scrutiny after Legionnaires' cases . However, slow patient outreach has also been a contentious issue. ""Beyond the fact that the error occurred at all, most concerning was the length of time it took the Buffalo VA to catch the error -- over two years, as well as the three-month delay in informing patients who may have been exposed,"" Higgins, whose district includes the city of Buffalo, wrote in a letter to the VA on Monday. ""Also detail why affected patients weren't notified immediately."" Insulin pens are injector devices designed to allow multiple self-injections for one person, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's website. Because blood may enter the insulin cartridge after injection, blood-borne pathogens can be transmitted from one person to another even after the needle has been changed. The devices are never to be used by more than one person. ""Unfortunately, since the day that new technology was introduced at the VA, they did not have a protocol in place that let the nurses know they were not supposed to use the cartridge on more than one patient,"" Republican U.S. Rep. Chris Collins told CNN affiliate WGRZ. Collins also called the situation in Buffalo ""unacceptable."" The health system will continue to contact all people potentially affected by this issue, answer all questions, provide necessary information and help arrange blood tests or medical followup, according to the memo sent to Congress. Higgins has also requested a detailed response outlining what steps will be taken to prevent any similar issues in the future. Ex-hospital worker indicted over hepatitis .

"Sittwe, Myanmar (CNN) -- With a steady hand, Myanmar Red Cross volunteer Tin Tin Wae, 22, measures out chlorine powder, adds it to a large bucket of water and begins to stir. This will eventually reach some of the 100,000 displaced people in Rakhine state who have been forced from their homes after violence swept through their communities in 2012. Q&A: What's behind sectarian violence in Myanmar? In the town of Sittwe, the violence has divided the once peaceful ethnic Rakhine and Muslim communities, turning friends into enemies and driving neighbors into exile. At first glance the town appears peaceful, and the streets are bustling with people visiting shops and restaurants. But just a short drive from the town center the landscape alters with relief camps and NGO vehicles, the telltale sign that we are reaching our destination. Mozala camp houses 573 people from ethnic Rakhine communities in temporary bamboo shelters. The Red Cross is bringing in drinking water as part of its emergency relief program that distributes 8,000 liters of safe water to camps each day. The water is a lifeline for the people living in this camp. One of the residents tells me that despite other water tanks nearby, this is the only water safe for drinking. Terrorized, starving and homeless: Myanmar's Rohingya still forgotten . The cool weather in Sittwe is a shock after the oppressive heat of Yangon where we are based. People in the camps tell me they are already concerned about flooding when it rains. The tattered sandbags piled outside shelters do little to prevent the muddy, dirty water from flowing inside. In a few more months the rainy season will arrive in earnest. Will these families still be here? We visit a Muslim camp situated further out of the main town. Because of the violence and continued tensions, the camps are divided to separately house the ethnic Rakhine and Muslim communities. Read more: Obama lauds Aung San Suu Kyi, gives a nod to Myanmar . The car pulls up along the side of a busy road where a large queue is already forming outside a clinic. Red Cross volunteers inside are treating Faranarli, 14, who was in a cycling accident. His bandaged ankle covers a series of severe cuts, and he winces, as the volunteers carefully take off the bandage to clean and dress the wounds. The Red Cross is supporting health clinics in more than 10 camps, treating patients from both communities. The need for these services is evident. Mothers are clutching babies with skin complaints, and men with bandaged arms are leaning against the fragile bamboo shelter. In this dusty and crowded camp, cuts and grazes can quickly become infected, and with limited toilets and a lack of sanitation facilities, diseases can quickly spread. The Red Cross has built toilets and wells in this camp to help respond to some of the health and sanitation challenges. Volunteers have the unenviable task of regularly disinfecting the toilets with chlorine powder. The Red Cross team has been drafted from other parts of the country to help respond to substantial needs. Read more: What a difference a year makes in Myanmar . The 30 volunteers, who come for a month, live and sleep together in a small shelter in Sittwe. The conditions are basic, the work is hard, but there are no complaints. Soon a new rotation will arrive, and these teammates will return home, back to their communities, jobs and normal day-to-day lives -- an impossible reality now for the thousands of displaced families in Rakhine. The humanitarian crisis in Rakhine first erupted in June 2012, meaning many of the families we have met over the last few days have been living in camps for up to seven months. As time passes, greater priority is being placed on providing adequate temporary shelters for families unable to return home. Several hundred ""long houses"" -- temporary shelters which house eight to 10 families -- have already been built. These shelters can be seen in some of the camps we visited, but there are still not enough for the entire displaced population. In the coming months the Myanmar Red Cross plans to support the construction of up to 160 temporary shelters. While the longterm solutions to this crisis remain unclear, the need for drinking water, food, shelter and medical care are very evident. As dislocated families continue to cope with life away from home and their livelihoods, it is critical that humanitarian assistance continues to reach people in both Rakhine and Muslim communities.","Clean water is a lifeline for people living in Mozala camp in Sittwe .

"(CNN) -- Mahesh Bhupathi is best known in tennis for his many successes as a doubles specialist, but now he's playing a new role -- that of a double agent. The 37-year-old Indian veteran is still a professional on the ATP Tour, winning his latest doubles title in Dubai earlier this month, but also acts as manager to two of India's brightest tennis hopes through his company Globosport. And with a host of Bollywood film stars also featuring in the firm's portfolio, Bhupathi has a ready-made route to success once his career on court comes to an end. Bhupathi, who cites entrepreneurs such as Virgin boss Richard Branson and telecoms mogul Sunil Mittal as businessmen he looks up to, has recently made his screen debut in one of his company's latest projects. His wife, Lara Dutta, is an award-winning actress and was named Miss Universe in 2000. When he does hang up his racket, the first player from India to win a grand slam title -- Bhupathi now has 11 all in doubles formats -- aims to mix the glitz and glamor of Bollywood with a plan to boost the prospects of burgeoning tennis talent in the country. ""All of us growing up are aware what support it takes to build a tennis player,"" he told CNN's Open Court show. ""I don't think there's any dearth of talent in India -- we've always had the best juniors in the world. ""The big transition is how do you get from the juniors to the seniors, and that comes through financial support. ""In the West the kids have coaches, trainers and a pretty robust support staff, so it takes a lot of money. ""We have one kid we are supporting fulltime now. He's 14 years old and very talented, so hopefully we can make it to where we help more and more kids and eventually there will be a pipeline of players coming out of the country."" Outside of cricket, whose stars are worshiped in India, Bhupathi is one of the country's best known sporting figures. He has a clean sweep of grand slam titles in the mixed doubles, claiming his first crown at the French Open in 1997 with Japanese partner Rika Hiraki, and can also boast four men's doubles titles to boot. At January's Australian Open he partnered compatriot Rohan Bopanna -- with whom he recently won the Dubai Open title -- but they were knocked out in round three. Yet it is his partnership with another Indian player, Leander Paes, that has reaped dividends. They have won three men's doubles titles together -- at the French Open in 1999 and 2001 as well as Wimbledon in 1999. Even with a career that is still in full swing, Bhupathi also acts as agent to Sania Mirza -- the first Indian woman to break into the world's top 30 players -- and Somdev Devvarman, who reached a high of 62 in the men's rankings last year. ""For me it's two fulltime jobs so I've got to put in more work, but I really enjoy doing what I do,"" he explained. ""Sania was one of our first clients, I think we signed her when she was 15. ""The tennis part of it is easy for me because I'm on the road, I'm networked into the tennis world, so doing her racket and apparel, this is very easy as I'm there on site. ""I'm aware tennis isn't going to last forever, and this going to be a smooth and natural transition now because Golobosport is eight years old."" But though Bollywood is beckoning, Bhupathi insists his eyes are still firmly fixed on court for now.","Mahesh Bhupathi has won 11 grand slam doubles titles in his tennis career .

"DORCHESTER, Massachusetts (CNN)  -- Friends, family and colleagues paid tribute to Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy on Friday evening with a three-hour wake capped by a chorus of ""When Irish Eyes Are Smiling."" Joseph P. Kennedy II recalls how his ""Uncle Teddy"" looked after the family. An estimated 45,000 people filed past the Democratic legend's flag-draped casket at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library before the event. Connecticut Sen. Christopher Dodd, who has tried to shepherd Kennedy's signature cause of universal health care through the Senate this year, summed up his appeal in three words: ""People liked him."" ""Some people born with a famous name live off of it. Others enrich theirs,"" Dodd said. ""Teddy enriched his."" Kennedy died Tuesday night at age 77 after being ill with brain cancer for 15 months. He had represented Massachusetts in the Senate since 1962, leaving his stamp on ""nearly every important law passed in the last half-century,"" Dodd said. He became the patriarch of the first family of Democratic politics after the assassinations of his brothers, President John F. Kennedy and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, during the 1960s. One of Robert Kennedy's sons, former Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II, fondly recounted how ""Uncle Teddy"" looked after the children of his slain siblings.  Watch Vice President Biden explain how Kennedy ""crept into my heart"" » . ""The truth of the matter is that for so many of us, we just needed someone to hang on to, and Teddy was always there to hang on to,"" he said. ""He had such a big heart, and he shared that heart with all of us."" The wake was held at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in suburban Boston, a building ""that Teddy built and brought to life with his dedication to public service,"" said the slain president's daughter, Caroline. Kennedy's own presidential aspirations were hobbled by the controversy around a 1969 auto accident that left a young woman dead and a 1980 primary challenge to then-President Jimmy Carter that ended in defeat. But while the White House eluded his grasp, he played major roles in passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act and the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act. ""He constantly renewed my faith and optimism in the possible,"" Vice President Joe Biden said at the memorial. ""I never once saw your father with a defeatist attitude, I never saw him petty. I never saw him act in a small way, and as a consequence he made us all bigger -- both his friends, his allies and his foes."" Kennedy was an outspoken liberal standard-bearer during a conservative-dominated era from the 1980s to the early 2000s. He died as President Obama, whom Kennedy boosted in the 2008 presidential campaign, is pushing for a wide-ranging overhaul of the U.S. health insurance system, a fight the dying senator called ""the cause of my life"" in a July issue of Newsweek. Kennedy was famous for his close friendships with colleagues across the Senate aisle even as his name was an anathema in Republican campaign materials. Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch said the Kennedy name was ""my very best fundraiser,"" but that he developed ""a strong working relationship with and love for the man I came to fight.""  Watch Hatch tell how he won a big favor from Kennedy » . ""If you would have told me that he would become one of my closest friends in the world I probably would have suggested that you need professional help,"" Hatch said. A visibly emotional Hatch said he last saw Kennedy ""a couple of months ago,"" and the two had their picture taken together. ""That means so much to me,"" Hatch said. ""I had to say it was a wonderful occasion, and I miss fighting in public and joking with him in the background. I miss all the things we knew we could do together."" Arizona Sen. John McCain, the GOP's 2008 presidential candidate, said Kennedy ""taught me to be a better senator."" ""He was the most reliable, the most prepared and the most persistent member of the Senate,"" McCain said. ""He took the long view, and he never gave up."" McCain added, ""I think most of my colleagues would agree the place won't be the same without him."" The senator's funeral is scheduled for Saturday at Boston's Our Lady of Perpetual Help Basilica in Boston's Mission Hill section, with at least 40 of Kennedy's fellow senators and former presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush slated to attend. Obama, who called Kennedy an ""extraordinary leader"" on Wednesday, will deliver a eulogy at the funeral, according to several sources. Prime Minister Brian Cowen of Ireland, the famous clan's ancestral homeland, and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown are also expected to attend, a family spokesman said. Kennedy will be buried Saturday evening at Arlington National Cemetery, outside Washington, 95 feet south of the grave of Sen. Robert Kennedy, which is in turn just steps away from John Kennedy's burial site.","Joseph Kennedy: ""He had such a big heart, and he shared that heart with all of us""

"(Financial Times) -- India's Supreme Court has rejected a plea from Novartis, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, to patent its cancer drug Glivec, in a landmark ruling that health activists say will allow India's generics industry to keep making cheaper versions of newer medicines. The judgment will infuriate multinational pharmaceuticals companies, already frustrated at the way India's 2005 patent law -- which New Delhi had to adopt in order to join the World Trade Organisation -- has been repeatedly interpreted to permit Indian generics companies to override their patents. The Glivec case has been closely watched by both the global pharmaceuticals industry and activists for access to affordable drugs, who say it will set a precedent. For years, India did not recognise patents on drugs, which allowed India's generics drugs industry to flourish -- and become the prime supplier of affordable generic drugs to many developing countries. India's generics drug industry is valued at about $26bn. In a statement issued following the ruling, Novartis called the decision ""a setback for patients that will hinder medical progress for diseases without effective treatment options"". India's 2005 patent law recognises patents on innovative drugs, but sets a higher-than-usual threshold for granting them, especially for updated versions of existing drugs. The Indian law states that if a drug company wants a patent on a modified version of an existing patented drug, it must show improved efficacy of the compound. Novartis, which had sought a patent on Glivec, had argued that the original compound it patented was too unstable for human use, and thus it should be granted a patent for the newer form of the drug. However, India's patent office ruled that it was not eligible for a patent as it was not a new drug, a decision upheld by the Supreme Court. Novartis has threatened that if it lost the case, it would not introduce its newest generation of medicines to India. The Swiss company sells Glivec for about Rs120,000 ($2,200) per patient per month. Indian companies sell generic versions of the cancer drug at a 15th of that cost, at Rs8,000 per patient per month. The company said that few Indian cancer patients have been purchasing Glivec, and most of the medicine used in the country has been provided by the company through a donation programme. But in a previous hearing, India's Supreme Court judges have described the donation programme as ""a complicated scheme"", and suggested the company should reduce the prices. © The Financial Times Limited 2013 .","For years, India did not recognise patents on drugs, which allowed India's generics drugs industry to flourish .

"London (CNN) -- For a certain kind of middle-aged male, Friday's double golden anniversary, marking the premiere of ""Dr. No"" and the release of the Beatles' debut single ""Love Me Do"", offers an unmissable opportunity to wallow in nostalgia. Even from a distance of half a century, there are few totems of popular culture more revered and more marketable than James Bond and the Fab Four. The Beatles embodied the energy and youthful spirit of their era, yet their remarkable creativity, productivity and talent for reinvention means that much of their music still sounds fresh today, while contemporaries such as Gerry and the Pacemakers and the Dave Clark Five remain trapped for ever in the beat scene of the early ""Swinging Sixties."" Never before seen Beatles photos sell for more than Â£350,000 . Abbey Road crosswalk named historic landmark . Bond too, despite initial industry skepticism -- ""It simply won't work in America... (Sean) Connery will never go over,"" one studio representative told producers Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman at the premiere of ""Dr. No"" -- was a perfect hero for the age of Cold War paranoia and nuclear brinkmanship, the film's Caribbean setting even mirroring the unfolding Cuban missile crisis. Yet under Broccoli's long stewardship, Bond remained a figure capable of reflecting our contemporary obsessions -- whereas a jet pack-wearing Connery once propelled himself across the screens of the space age, now Daniel Craig's taut, humorless 007 is more likely to be equipped with the latest smartphone gadgets. Some, preposterously, have even claimed the existence of the Beatles as evidence of a divine hand at work. Commenting last week on the announcement that the band's albums would be re-released later this year on ""audiophile quality vinyl"", music producer Rick Rubin said of the band's prolific output: ""Truthfully, I think of it as proof of God, because it's beyond man's ability."" Predictably, both anniversaries are accompanied by a welter of other rehashed and recycled material cashing in on the occasion. Beatles completists not content with the band's already expansive canon of literature can now look forward to an anthology of John Lennon's letters and several exhaustive new reference books. Meanwhile, the ""Let It Be"" musical has just opened in London and a remastered DVD edition of ""Magical Mystery Tour"" is set to go on sale, accompanied by a serious-minded BBC documentary on the making of the critically derided comic caper that can easily be summed up in five letters: drugs. Bond's back catalogue also gets a 50th birthday facelift with the re-packaging of the 22 films as a Blu-Ray box set - though one wonders, even among hardcore fans of the series, whether there is much appetite for the sight of Roger Moore creaking and wheezing his way through ""A View to a Kill"" in high-definition clarity -- a role for which even the eyebrow-raising Englishman admits he was ""400 years too old"" by 1985. Designing 007: Exhibition marks 50 years of James Bond . James bond car sells for $4 million . None of these products are presumably aimed at a generation that can actually remember Connery or the Beatles in their heydays. The least likely upgraders to Blu-Ray would seem to be those old enough to have seen ""Dr. No"" in a cinema, just as the ""Beatles: Rock Band"" console game is unlikely to have held much appeal among those who first encountered the band -- then the UK's eighth most popular ""small group,"" according to a poll at the time -- supporting Helen Shapiro in early 1963. Instead, they are targeted at what could be described as ""Mojo Man,"" intended to prod once again the Pavlovian reflexes of compulsive consumer-collectors who, in an era when the concept of music and movies as something that we own in physical form looks increasingly redundant, remain one of the ailing entertainment industry's more dependable customers. Though not quite old enough to remember the sixties, Mojo Man grew up in a world in which the popular culture of the decade resonated long after the idealism, social change and upheaval of the era had passed into the history books, and in which the Beatles' template of guitars, bass and drums and the Bond staples of stunts, super villains and seducible women had laid the foundations for rock music and the modern action movie. Yet the problem with this conservative world view is that nothing subsequent can ever live up to the mythologized past, while other influences on the culture of our own era are belittled and ignored. Modern pop music, after all, arguably owes more to the traditions of hip hop and dance music than to ""Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."" Its enduring influence is demonstrated by an outburst by Noel Gallagher in 2008, in which the former Oasis star, born in 1967, listed the top five bands of all time as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Who, the Sex Pistols and the Kinks -- according to deeply reductive criteria that included ""no solo artists, no female artists, no collectives allowed (Public Enemy etc.)."" Such blinkered reverence is at odds with the world in which the Beatles and Bond came to stardom, when the spending power of neophyte teenagers dominated pop culture and a song or movie could be top of the pops or a box office hit one week and gone the next. No one involved in the creation of ""Love Me Do"" or ""Dr. No"" would have expected that either would be anything more than quick money spinners -- a throwaway two-minute pop song and a low-budget adaptation of a cheap paperback attempting to cash in on the Cold War appetite for espionage thrillers. In their own words: Journalists who covered Lennon's murder . TIME: Meeting the Beatles . John Lennon and George Harrison quickly became deeply disillusioned with life in the Beatles, while even Paul McCartney, now strip-mining his own back catalogue in stadiums around the world, spent years attempting to step out of the band's shadow. Similarly, Connery in a 1965 interview with Playboy magazine complained that being typecast as Bond had become ""a bit of a bore."" Yet the Beatles remain the band that we can't live and let die, doomed to be recycled as fading photocopies of the original with every incremental improvement in music technology and significant anniversary until one day we can all look forward to high-definition holograms of John, Paul, George and Ringo performing ""All You Need is Love"" in our living rooms. Similarly with Bond, while it's easy to put out new editions of the old classics or to recycle familiar plots in updated settings, can anyone say they genuinely expect ""Skyfall,"" the 23rd installment due to be released later this month, to bring anything new to the series? Fifty years is a long time, even by the standards of the rise and fall of nations, but in the ever changing world (in which we live in) of pop culture both Bond and the Beatles should long ago have been passed over to the custody of historians for safekeeping. With the release of their albums once again on vinyl, the Beatles' music will have turned full circle, returning via tapes, compact discs, minidiscs and mp3s to the format where it all began. Perhaps that's an appropriate moment, finally, to let it be.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Chris Brown's got a big problem with the prosecutor four years after he attacked Rihanna and earned five years of probation. The singer got an unusual deal when he pleaded guilty to assaulting his pop singer girlfriend. The deal allowed him to complete his court-ordered community service in Virginia under the personal supervision of Richmond Police Chief Bryan Norwood. The Los Angeles district attorney alleged in a motion filed Tuesday that Brown's mother supervised most of it, and investigators found evidence it was never done. The paperwork Brown submitted to show he had completed the 180 days of work is ""at best sloppy documentation and at worst fraudulent reporting,"" District Attorney Jackie Lacey said. Brown wasn't in town on some of the dates reported, the motion said. The ever divisive Chris Brown . The motion also accused Brown of violating probation by punching Frank Ocean at a Hollywood recording studio last month, threatening to ""bust"" -- or shoot -- the singer. The fight is still being investigated, it said. It also notes a Miami incident during which Brown allegedly stole a fan's cell phone and a chair-throwing incident after a ""Good Morning America"" interview. Also, Brown's claim to have medical marijuana license, which he used to defend against a failed drug test result, was invalid because the acupuncturist who wrote it was not licensed to prescribe drugs, the motion said. Brown's lawyer Mark Geragos disputed the charges, saying that at least six Virginia officials told the Los Angeles investigators that Brown had performed his community labor. ""Apparently the district attorney's office has completely lost their minds,"" Geragos said. ""They are making scurrilous, libelous and defamatory statements and apparently have lost their ability to read their own reports."" Geragos said he would encourage the Richmond Police Department to take legal action against the Los Angeles County district attorney. Rihanna on Chris Brown: We know what we have . Despite making serious probation violation allegations and going to the expense of sending investigators to Virginia to conduct interviews, the motion is not asking the judge to revoke Brown's probation and send him to jail. It only seeks to have him restart the 180 days of community labor in California. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Patricia Schnegg is expected to be consider it at a probation progress hearing Wednesday afternoon. It was four years ago this Friday that Brown punched Rihanna inside a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street.

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi continued his remarkable season with yet another goal as unbeaten Barcelona secured an 11-point lead at the halfway stage of the Spanish league season on Sunday. The Argentine, who won his fourth world player of the year award last week, scored once and was involved in both other goals as Barca won 3-1 at sixth-placed Malaga for a record 18th victory from 19 rounds. It surpassed the previous leading halfway mark of 52 points that Barca recorded in winning the 2010-11 title. While Atletico Madrid kept pace with a 2-0 win at home to Real Zaragoza on Sunday, third-placed champions Real Madrid now trail by 18 points following Saturday's 0-0 draw with bottom club Osasuna. Messi was an unused substitute in Thursday's Spanish Cup win over Cordoba, but he returned to action at La Rosaleda along with cancer-stricken coach Tito Vilanova. ""We're very happy to get 55 out of 57 points, but logically it will be difficult to repeat that with the Champions League and the Spanish Cup to think about as well,"" Vilanova told reporters. ""We have to go to Atletico and we have to go to Real Madrid so we can't just stop now, we have to keep going."" While Real sorely missed the suspended Cristiano Ronaldo in Pamplona, Messi underlined his value to the Catalans -- who were without injured striker David Villa. He broke the deadlock in the 27th minute, pouncing on a poor backpass by Ignacio Camacho before cutting back inside the keeper and slotting home his 28th league goal in 19 matches and 37th overall this season. Five minutes after the halftime break Messi delivered a beautiful pass over the Malaga defense -- which has conceded the fewest goals of any of La Liga's 20 clubs this season -- for Cesc Fabregas to apply a calm finish past Willy Caballero. Young midfielder Thiago Alcantara made it 3-0 with 10 minutes to go after cutting in from the right, playing a simple one-two with Messi and driving a low left-foot shot into the net. Malaga, like Barcelona playing in the last 16 of the European Champions League next month, hit back with a superb late consolation free-kick by Diego Buonanotte that his compatriot Messi would have been proud to call his own. Messi, who scored a world record 91 goals in 2012, is now 10 clear of Atletico's Radamel Falcao in the La Liga scoring charts. The Colombia striker netted a first-half penalty against Zaragoza to be two ahead of Ronaldo, who has 16. Midfielder Tiago opened the scoring as Atletico made it 10 wins from 10 home games. Real Betis moved up to fourth place with a 2-0 win at home to Levante, as Ruben Castro netted his 11th league goal this season after an opener from on-loan Costa Rica international Joel Campbell. Deportivo La Coruna drew 1-1 at mid-table Real Sociedad to mean Osasuna's move from the bottom of the table was a brief one. In Italy, Juventus gave hope to Serie A's title hopefuls after dropping points in the 1-1 draw at Parma on Sunday. The champions went ahead in the 52nd minute thanks to an own-goal by Jonathan Biabiany, but midtable Parma hit back with 13 minutes to play through Sergio Floccari. Second-placed Lazio closed the gap to three points with a 2-0 win at home to Atalanta, while Napoli reclaimed third from Inter Milan with a 3-0 win over Palermo. Seventh-placed AC Milan could only draw 0-0 at Sampdoria.","Barcelona unbeaten at halfway stage of La Liga season after 3-1 win at Malaga .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Federal health officials say 14 people in six states have been sickened by the same strain of E. coli over the past couple of months. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokeswoman Lola Russell, 14 cases of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli 0145 infection with the same DNA fingerprint have been identified in six states. ""Their illness onsets range from April 15 to May 12,"" she said, adding that the most recent case was reported June 4. ""Three ill persons have been hospitalized. One death has been reported in Louisiana."" Cases have been reported in Alabama (2), California (1), Florida (1), Georgia (5), Louisiana (4) and Tennessee (1), according to the CDC. Louisiana health officials would confirm only that one child died and three adults were sickened in the New Orleans area. CNN affiliate WWL reported that the child was 21-month-old Maelan Elizabeth Graffagnini, who fought the infection for weeks at a local hospital. Feds speed up E. coli investigation procedures . Georgia is reporting five cases, the most in one state. ""Four of five are female, and their ages range from 18 to 52, with a median of 34. Illness onsets range from (April 15-28); one case was hospitalized overnight for this illness, and no cases have died,"" said Suleima Salgado, deputy director of communications for the Georgia Department of Public Health. The cases in Georgia have been mild, according to Dr. J. Patrick O'Neal, who heads the Division of Health Protection within the Georgia Department of Public Health. He said Thursday, ""I don't think there's need for great concern. I think awareness, yes, concern, no. We have outbreaks of various diarrheal diseases quite frequently."" Neither of the Alabamans was hospitalized; both have recovered, the state's Department of Public Health said in a news release. According to the CDC, the most common strain is E. coli O157. The strain in this outbreak is 0145. ""As whole, the non-O157 serogroup is less likely to cause severe illness than E. coli O157,"" it said. ""However, some non-O157 (Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli) serogroups can cause the most severe manifestations of STEC illness."" Russell said many clinical laboratories do not regularly test for this particular strain of E. coli. However, the O145 strain is one of six additional strains for which the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Services has begun testing for in ground beef. The cause of the outbreak is unknown, and the investigation is ongoing on the federal and local levels. Infectious disease investigators will interview the victims to determine what exposures they have in common. The CDC says it's looking at both food and non-food exposures as a source of the outbreak. However, Louisiana health officials say they suspect that food may be to blame, according to a statement from the state's Department of Health and Hospitals. ""People usually get sick from STEC 2-8 days (average of 3-4 days) after swallowing the organism,"" Russell said in a statement. She added that most people infected with the 0145 strain develop diarrhea (usually watery and often bloody) and abdominal cramps. ""Most illnesses resolve on their own within seven days, but sometimes the symptoms can last longer and can be more severe."" So investigators are dependent on people accurately remembering what they ate or came into contact with before they got sick. Food such as meat and poultry but also fruit and vegetables is often the source of E. coli infections. However, unpasteurized or raw milk, water that has not been disinfected, contact with cattle or contact with the feces of infected people are other sources of infections. Young children, pregnant women, the elderly and people who have weakened immune systems (like cancer or HIV patients) are at greater risk for severe illness and death. The best way to avoid getting sick is by washing hands frequently when preparing food as well as avoiding cross-contamination of food preparation areas by washing cutting boards, counters and utensils with hot, soapy water. Properly washing hands after using the bathroom and after coming into contact with animals or being in their environments -- anywhere there may be traces of feces, where the bacteria could be lurking -- also helps. Cooking meats thoroughly to at least 160Â°F or 70ËšC kills the bacteria and prevents infection as well. Using a meat thermometer will most accurately help you determine that the food is thoroughly cooked.

"New York (CNN) -- The family of a man killed by a New York City subway train after being shoved onto the tracks in December is suing the city's transit authority, according to court documents obtained Sunday.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- In the third case in the last two weeks, more than 100 passengers aboard a troubled boat required rescue in the waters between Australia and Indonesia. On Wednesday, Australian authorities plucked 162 passengers from a boat in distress located south of Indonesia. The rescued passengers were taken to Australia's Christmas Island for initial security, health and identity screening. The authorities declined to say whether the people on the rescued boat were seeking asylum. This followed after a boat capsized near Christmas Island carrying an estimated 200 people seeking asylum on June 22, and another boat accident occurred on June 27. The number of deaths from these accidents are unclear, as authorities did not know how many people had been aboard the vessels. Dozens are believed to have died. Although it isn't clear whether the most recent incident involved asylum seekers, the issue of possible refugees boarding rickety boats to make the treacherous voyage to Australia has turned into an explosive political issue. The question for nations is what to do with people seeking help? The world's wealthiest nations like Australia or the United States are not always the most welcoming for potential refugees. A United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees report released last year described ""a time of rising anti-refugee sentiment in many industrialized"" countries. In Australia, the perception is that, ""everyday, we're being flooded by boat people who are cheating the system,"" said Kon Karapanagiotidis, CEO of Asylum Seeker Resource Centre in Australia. ""They're illegal. They're jumping the queue. Everyday, the news is reporting another boat has arrived and another boat has arrived. It's feeding this idea that we're being flooded."" The number of asylum seekers in Australia and New Zealand decreased by 9% in 2011 compared with the previous year, according to the latest report by UNHCR. Karapanagiotidis said aslyum seekers have turned into a ""political football"" and ""easy scapegoats"" without much understanding of why they embark on such dangerous journeys. Australia is not alone in grappling with the asylum issue, which is often unpopular and politically divisive. Read how the Australian Senate voted . Following the Arab Spring, waves of North African asylum seekers journeyed in boats to European nations such as Italy and Malta. This resulted in a 87% increase in asylum requests in the area in 2011 compared with the previous year, according to UNHCR. In the western hemisphere, vessels carrying Haitian migrants have traveled across to the United States -- one boat sank in the Bahamas, killing at least 11 people in June. But the notion that most asylum seekers flock to developed, wealthy nations differ from the statistics shown by UNHCR. Eighty percent of the world's refugees are hosted in developing countries, which the agency described as a ""deep imbalance in international support."" Pakistan hosts the most refugees with 1.7 million. The second and third leading countries to host refugees at the end of 2011 were Iran and Syria. The 2011 report is the most recent one available by UNHCR and may not reflect the current crisis in Syria. The vast majority of refugees remain within their region of origin -- 17% live outside their home region, according to UNHCR. ""Geography does play a big part of it,"" said Karapanagiotidis, on why asylum seekers ended up in countries like Pakistan and Iran. People are seeking the easiest and quickest escape to countries where ""immigration channels are available,"" he said. An asylum seeker is a person who wants sanctuary in another country and applies for the right to be recognized as a refugee. A refugee is recognized as a person who was forced to flee his or her country because of persecution, war or violence, according to UNHCR. Here are more statistics provided by a 2011 report by UNHCR: . Main destinations for new aslyum seekers . 1. South Africa (107,000 claims) -- half from Zimbabwe . 2.

"(CNN) -- Big-spending English club Manchester City moved a step closer to meeting European football's financial fairplay requirements on Friday despite posting a loss of almost $160 million for last season. City's deficit of £97.9 million ($158 million) for 2011-12's Premier League-winning campaign was just under half that of the £197.5 million ($318 million) for the previous period -- which was the biggest loss in soccer history. The latest figure represents the fourth highest deficit in the English game -- three of which belong to City since the arrival of its Abu Dhabi owners in 2008. It can be contrasted with the $37 million net profit made by rival Manchester United in 2011-12. United posted a reduced revenue of £320 million ($517 million) for that period, while City closed the gap with a club-record turnover of £231.1 million ($374 million). Both are substantially behind leading Spanish clubs Real Madrid and Barcelona. Chelsea boosted by first profit in Abramovich era . It was the first time that City had breached the £200 million ($323 million) mark, and reflects the club's attempts to become more self-sufficient and avoid possible punishment from UEFA for failing to meet FFP targets. However, owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed still injected £169 million ($273 million) in order to keep the club debt free. ""It is important to recognise the personal and ongoing influence of Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed on the rapid transformation that is taking place,"" said chairman Khaldoon al-Mubarak. ""The hard work of everyone involved at Manchester City over the last four years has begun to create an obvious momentum."" Last season City won the English title for the first time since 1969, and made a debut appearance in the UEFA Champions League. Manchester United seeks to cash in as sponsor DHL is sent packing . The club's revenue would have been higher if not for a group-stage exit from Europe's top club competition -- which has been repeated already this season -- but new chief executive Ferran Soriano was satisfied with the results. He joined City in September, having previously helped transform the financial fortunes of Barcelona between 2003-08. ""What I have found is a club on the verge of a historic transformation, reinforced by a genuine commitment to doing things well. It is a club with a rich history and the potential for an even brighter future,"" he said. With the FFP rules coming into play from next season, City officials are under pressure to conform -- or face the possible expulsion from European competition and a withholding of prize money. A 10-year stadium rights deal with Etihad Airlines -- owned by Abu Dhabi's royal family -- which also includes the club's under-construction campus has considerably boosted City's balance sheet. It is building an academy to try to avoid paying over the odds for star players in the future -- the £201.8 million ($326 million) wage bill for 2011-12 made City the first English club to break £200 million in salaries, according to the Sporting Intelligence website. That equates to more than $890,000 a day. ""The City Football Academy will strengthen the club's youth development and training capabilities, enable more players to move through the Academy and Elite Development Squads into the first team in the future, while bringing all of the club's operations together on a single site within the Etihad Campus,"" Khaldoon said. ""The responsibility lies with all of us to continue the hard work that will ensure that this is only the beginning of a long and successful era for Manchester City.""","English champion Manchester City posts loss of $158 million for 2011-12 season .

"(CNN) -- Bombardier is not a name many associate with commercial flight. The Canadian plane manufacturer, which for years has based its business on its smaller, regional jets, has not traditionally been in a position to challenge the likes of Airbus and Boeing when it comes to providing larger carriers. All of that could to change, however, as the company is scheduled to test fly its first C-series jet this June. Bombardier is banking a lot on their new planes, which cost them $3.4 billion to produce. The sizable investment seems paltry, however, when compared to the size of the market they hope to penetrate: aircraft that seat 100 to 150 make up a $2 trillion industry. Bombardier is hoping to scoop up half of that. With their C-series priced considerably below their competition (the $61 million price tag is 30% cheaper than what Airbus and Boeing charge for similar models), they stand a pretty good chance. ""It's an aggressive world. We've got to differentiate ourselves with the right product,"" notes Mike Arcamone, the president of Bombardier Commercial Aircraft. The company claims the new planes will not only burn 20% less fuel, but will also have 25% fewer operating cost than their rivals'. They've already pulled in over 350 orders, with Korean Air, airBaltic and Luxair first in line to add the planes to their fleet. First, however, the new planes need to undergo certification, a process that is expected to be much more stringent in light of the recent problems of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Robert Dewer, the vice president and general manager of Bombardier's C-series, insists they aren't jumping the gun. ""It's actually a thin line where you have to support the flight test plan as fast as you can, give yourself the flexibility to introduce any changes that may arise, and at the same time be ready to ramp up the production aircraft as soon as possible,"" he says. Moreover, he expects the new planes will pass with flying colors. ""We already have a very rigorous process. We throttle (each plane) more than any aircraft will see in its entire history. We pull (the wings) up, pull them down, add weight to them and take them right to the point of breaking."" The planes, he says, must be 150% stronger than the worst forces they could face during a flight. Furthermore, when presented with the opportunity to use a lithium battery back in 2011, Bombardier instead opted for something more conventional. ""We studied (the battery) quite extensively,"" says Dewer. ""We decided in the end that the technology was really not mature for us. It was a risk versus reward (scenario), and there was a lot of perceived risk."" The company has also introduced a couple of features that will make flying easier and safer for pilots, most notably the screen area in the flight deck is more than double the surface area than on other aircraft. ""The advantage of that is that you can have more information available to the pilot directly, without having to cascade menus,"" explains Dewer. ""You always want to lower the pilot's workload so that he can really manage the aircraft well."" It's too early to tell if Bombardier's gamble on the new series will pay off, but Arcamone is optimistic about their chances. ""We've just started to fight,"" he says. ""We said we were going to have about 300 firm orders when the aircraft goes into service. We are well on our way to achieving that objective.""","Canadian aircraft manufacturer set to test fly new C-series commercial jet .

The crew of the Portuguese-flagged ship reported a rupture of up to 12 inches above the waterline, the Coast Guard said. But there was no indication of any leaking cargo. No injuries were reported. Around 6 p.m., the vessel was pulled off the bridge and safely moored at the state pier on the New Hampshire side, said Coast Guard spokesman Robert Simpson. The matter is under investigation, Coast Guard spokesman Adam Stanton said. The bridge, which was built in 1940 and normally carries about 14,000 vehicles per day, sustained some damage, said Bill Boynton, a spokesman for the New Hampshire Transportation Department. The ship apparently was disabled when it drifted into the span, the Coast Guard said. But it was unclear why that was the case. The ship was carrying tallow oil, which can be used for biofuels, in cooking or for making soap.","Ship drifted into heavily used span linking Portsmouth, N.H., and Kittery, Maine .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama signed an executive order Monday designed to help reduce a growing number of prescription drug shortages while protecting patients from possible pharmaceutical industry price gouging. Among other things, the order requires the Food and Drug Administration to increase its reporting of possible shortages of certain prescription drugs, while also speeding up regulatory reviews of new drug manufacturing sites, drug suppliers and manufacturing changes. The Justice Department will be tasked with examining whether specific drug shortages are tied to an intentional stockpiling of medications designed to raise prices. Administration officials are also calling on Congress to pass more comprehensive legislation to boost the FDA's power to address prescription drug shortages. The new steps are part of a highly publicized White House initiative to bolster the economy and help consumers without assistance from a sharply divided Congress. ""The shortage of prescription drugs drives up costs, leaves consumers vulnerable to price gouging and threatens our health and safety,"" Obama said in a written statement. ""This is a problem we can't wait to fix."" Obama administration officials have also sent a letter to drug manufacturers ""reminding them of their responsibility to report the discontinuation of certain drugs to the FDA,"" the statement noted. Drug manufacturers are being encouraged to voluntarily disclose possible prescription drug shortages in instances not currently required by law. Under current law, pharmaceutical companies are only required to announce a decision to stop the manufacture of certain critical drugs if those drugs are available through a single manufacturer, according to the administration. The White House is also directing the FDA to increase the total number of staffers dealing with drug shortage issues. The new executive actions are being taken in response to a growing drug shortfall in the United States. The total number of prescription drug shortages almost tripled from 2005 to 2010, the White House noted. As the number of shortages has grown, prices have skyrocketed in certain instances. The White House cited an August Premier health care alliance report estimating that the ""typical gray market vendor"" jacks up prices by 650% on average. ""At the extreme,"" the White House statement noted, ""a drug used to treat high blood pressure that was normally priced at $25.90 was being sold at $1,200 due to a drug shortage."" Later, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters the administration will continue to use its executive branch authority to act on a number of fronts without congressional assistance. Democrats have been frustrated by GOP opposition to the president's $447 billion jobs plan, as well as a series of other administration-backed measures. ""One of the reasons why we can't wait is because Congress won't act,"" Carney said. ""As we have said throughout this initiative and in general, the president looks to ways he can use his executive authority to, broadly speaking, help Americans who can be helped through actions that this administration can take.""","Obama order aimed at prescription drug shortages, rising costs .
The FDA will report more possible shortages, speed up regulatory reviews .

"(CNN) -- Sprint star Usain Bolt gave sports fans a taste of what to expect at the 2016 Rio Olympics when he won an exhibition race on Copacabana beach on Sunday. The six-time Olympic gold medalist was unable to break his record for the 150 meters distance, but still got his season off to a winning start in the Brazilian city. He won in a time of 14.42 seconds on a specially constructed track in hot conditions in front of a reported 3,000 spectators. ""It was my first sprint race, definitely a good start for the season,"" Bolt said in quotes reported by his website. ""I'm looking forward to coming down here in 2016."" Bolt set the record for 150m in Manchester in 2009 when he clocked 14.35. This time the Jamaican headed off fellow West Indian Daniel Bailey of Antigua (14.88) and third-placed Brazilian Bruno Barrios (14.91). The distance is rarely run by top-level athletes, though in 1997 the previous year's Olympic 100m champion Donovan Bailey of Canada took on 200/400 gold medalist Michael Johnson in an unofficial clash to determine the ""world's fastest man"" -- but the American pulled up short with a leg injury. Before Bolt set the record in 2009, the previous best over 150m was the 14.80 recorded by Italy's Moscow Olympics 200m champion Pietro Mennea in 1983.","Usain Bolt wins exhibition race in Rio, which will host the 2016 Olympic Games .

"(CNN) -- Let's all stop for moment, catch our breath and take in the magnitude of what is happening. Before we jump from campaign frenzy to post-election celebration -- or disappointment -- we should not let Election Day pass without pausing to really absorb what an extraordinary thing democracy is. The idea that the people have a right to decide who will govern them, that the men and women who want to become president have to undergo a grueling, months-long job application process, engaging with citizens, trying to persuade everyone, rich and poor, young, old, men, women -- everyone -- that they deserve the position, is a truly remarkable reality. It is also a contagious idea that has spilled across the surface of the Earth like water seeking its natural level. But it is not a self-occurring, automatic state of affairs. Over the centuries, the strong simply seized power, and the masses regularly endured unjust rule. Democracy has come because of enormous effort and sacrifice. And in too many places, many are still struggling, even dying, to claim it as their own. America's democracy is flawed, yes. But it is nowhere near so flawed as to be rendered meaningless or beyond repair. President Obama: My vision for America . Those who have spent their whole lives living under a democracy, or who have never witnessed the passion with which those living without it can yearn for a legitimate government, may not grasp just how stunning it is for all the people to have the power to choose their government. History, even recent and still-unfolding history, is filled with examples of dictatorship and tyranny. And it is rich with stories of courageous efforts to bring it down. No one who remembers what happened in China in 1989 can take democracy for granted. Hundreds of thousands of students took over Tiananmen Square, erecting their crude Styrofoam and papier mache replica of the Statue of Liberty, the Goddess of Democracy they called it, smack in front of the giant portrait of Mao Zedong. They declared that the goddess announced to the world that, ""A consciousness of democracy has awakened among the Chinese people! The new era has begun."" It was not to be. Within four days, army tanks trampled the statue, along with hundreds, perhaps thousands of demonstrators. Today, the article you are reading now may not appear on Internet searches in China, which block the word ""Tiananmen,"" along with efforts to bring democracy. And who can forget the first multiracial election in South Africa? That day in 1994, voters lined up for miles as far as the eye could see, some waiting as long as 12 hours to cast their vote. The winner was Nelson Mandela, revered to this day as a symbol of equality, reconciliation, non-violence and an unbending determination to make the privilege of democracy apply to all the people. Mitt Romney: My vision for America . The passion for democracy among those who don't enjoy it can seem naive to those who have seen its flaws. I remember interviewing women in Kuwait seeking the right to vote in that emirate's very limited democracy. What if after gaining the vote they would not make any progress, I asked. Their answer revealed complete faith that democracy would bring the best outcome. Then we just have to work better, harder, to explain our positions to voters, they said. More recently, the images from Tahrir Square in Cairo inspired the world, as Egyptians sought to overthrow a decades-old dictatorship as part of a wave of revolutions across the region. We have followed with nervousness the unfolding uprisings in other parts of the Middle East, wondering whether democracy will emerge victorious. Not everyone who fights against the existing tyranny seeks democracy. There are those who would like to impose their own ideas of how the people should be ruled. 21 moments that defined the campaigns . After all, we now accept as obvious the belief spelled out in the U.S. Declaration of Independence that governments derive their power from the consent of the governed. But that is truly a revolutionary vision, one that turns the concept of power on its head. In fact, it is a majestic idea, one that seems so romantic as to appear utopian, unreachable. And it is certainly not easy to achieve in all its fullness. It's worth remembering that the proposition does not refer just to elections. Choosing a president and other representatives of the people to govern is just the first step. The true objective of the exercise is to establish a government that will work for the benefit of society or, as Lincoln so perfectly expressed it, ""a government of the people, by the people, for the people."" For a reminder of how drastically different this could be, think back to the start of the Arab revolutions, when Mohamed Bouazizi, an impoverished Tunisian fruit vendor trying desperately to make ends meet, set himself on fire after an official capriciously confiscated his fruit cart and weighing scales. Your take: Should we have polling places in churches? It means that after a government takes the reins, the country has a right to expect it to function for the benefit of the nation; that when the government fails, the people have a right to be outraged and demand results. In a few hours, the polls will close across the United States, results will begin pouring in and a large part of the population will feel deeply, painfully, angrily disappointed, while a slightly larger portion will burst into celebration (unless the election brings another excruciating delayed decision). So, let's pause briefly to experience a sense of awe for the system. After that, the time will be right for a new push to repair its many flaws. Frum: Our voting system is a disgrace . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: Pause to marvel at democracy, where governed choose their leader .
She says idea contagious, points to Tiananmen Square, South Africa, Arab Spring .

"(CNN) -- Omar Thornton, minutes after gunning down eight co-workers in Manchester, Connecticut, called state police and told them, ""I took it into my hands"" because he worked at a ""racist place,"" according to a recording of the call. Thornton, 34, told police, ""I wish I could have got more of the people."" He also said, ""I'm not going to kill anybody else."" The Hartford Distributors employee fatally shot himself Tuesday after the shooting spree that followed his resignation over theft allegations. The gripping recording of Thornton's four-minute 911 call was released Thursday, the same day the company said he never filed a complaint alleging racial discrimination, as his girlfriend Kristi Hannah asserted. Thornton called police after 8 a.m. ""You probably want to know the reason why I shot this place up. This place is a racist place. They treat me bad over here. They treat all the other black people employees bad over here, too. So I took it into my hands ... I wish I could have got more of the people,"" he said. Two dispatchers spent most of the call trying to get Thornton to tell where he was, to remain calm and surrender. Police also wanted information on guns he had. Thornton, who killed himself in an office, had a single handgun left by the time of the call. He said the Ruger ""was one of my favorites."" Thornton said he thought police were going to kill him. He declined to give his location in the warehouse. ""When they find me everything is going to be over,"" he said. ""They treated me bad since I started here. A racist company,"" Thornton said at one point. Toward the end of the call, Thornton said, ""Tell my people that I love them and I've got to go now."" One of the dispatchers said, ""If you work with me we will get this to stop."" Police were closing in on the suspect by this point. The conversation ended with the dispatcher saying, ""OK, Omar? Omar? Omar? OK."" Another dispatcher said, ""Still alive."" The president of Hartford Distributors said Thornton never filed a claim alleging racial discrimination. Ross Hollander, whose family owns the business, said there were no grievances filed with the company or Thornton's union. ""I can state to you unequivocally no racism claim was ever alleged,"" Hollander said at a news conference at which he pledged the company would cooperate with any investigations. Joanne Hannah, Kristi's mother, said her daughter had watched a report on Thornton's 911 call. ""She's devastated, back to bawling again,"" Joanne Hannah said. ""I can't even believe he did that. I guess you don't really know people, its crazy."" Kristi Hannah told CNN Thornton first told her about racial harassment at work last summer. Kristi Hannah said her mother told Thornton to take pictures of the alleged harassment with his cell phone. He took two pictures in the men's bathroom at work, she said. She described one as his name written on a cartoon, and the other as a drawing of a hangman with a noose around its neck. Connecticut state police have the phone. Hannah's mother said Thornton heard a co-worker say he ""wanted that n****r out of there."" She said Thornton told his girlfriend he had reported harassment to a company supervisor and a union representative, but nothing was done about it. Manchester police have said they have found no evidence of racial discrimination.","Omar Thornton called state police after the shootings .

"(CNN) -- A body believed to be that of an 18-year-old barista who disappeared in February has been found in a lake north of Anchorage, police in Alaska said. Samantha Koenig was last seen on February 1 being led by a man from the parking lot of the coffee stand where she worked. On Monday, a forensic dive team discovered the body in Matanuska Lake, said Anchorage Police Chief Mark Mew. The medical examiner will conduct an autopsy to confirm the identity. ""Although some questions have been answered today, I know those answers offer little consolation to the Koenig family and that many more questions remain,"" said Mary Rook, the special agent in charge of the investigation. ""I know one question both the Koenig family and the people of Anchorage have asked from the outset is, 'Why Samantha?'"" Koenig was taken from the Common Grounds Espresso stand, in the parking lot of an Anchorage fitness club, around 8 p.m. on February 1. Police said security footage showed an armed man wearing a dark hoodie leading her away. Gone, too, was the cash from the stand's register, as well as Koenig's coat, purse and cell phone. Koenig's family offered a hefty reward for information leading to her return. Friends and volunteers distributed more than 45,000 fliers door to door. The crime struck at one of the hallmarks of the Anchorage community, the tiny coffee stands around town, wrote Daily News columnist Julia O'Malley. ""Coffee shops are a thing here, a signature Anchorage phenomena,"" she wrote in a column on February 9. ""A study in 2005 said there was a coffee opportunity for every 3,300 residents in the city. At the time, that was the highest coffee-to-person ratio in the U.S."" On Monday, police said a man, already in custody for an unrelated crime, will be charged with kidnapping and murder. Without naming the man, Chief Mew said he acted alone and that Koenig died within hours of her abduction. Authorities also said investigators found no ""direct association"" between the abductor and Koenig or her family members. The only person listed as a ""person of interest"" in the case is a 34-year-old contractor from Anchorage who was arrested last month in Lufkin, Texas. The man is accused of using a debit card taken from a vehicle on the night of Koenig's abduction and using it at various locations in Anchorage and also in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, reported KTUU TV. U.S. Marshals brought him back to Alaska, and he is being held at the Anchorage Correctional Complex.","Samantha Koenig was last seen on February 1 .

"(CNN) -- President Obama on Wednesday will assume the delicate role of comforting a nation still in shock in the aftermath of the Arizona shootings while also transcending the tragedy to move a grieving nation forward. As difficult and unique as the task may be, Obama needs to look no further than his role model Ronald Reagan and his Democratic predecessor Bill Clinton for a lesson in how to console the country. Both presidents were praised for the leadership they showed in the aftermath of two domestic disasters -- the Challenger explosion in 1986 and the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. ""This is Obama's Challenger-Oklahoma City moment,"" presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said. Reagan and Clinton each paid tribute to the victims, gave support to the survivors and struck a tone of healing, as Obama will likely do when he speaks at the memorial service at the University of Arizona in Tucson. Were you affected by the shootings? Share your memories, tributes . The White House hasn't released details of what the president will say except that he will devote most of his remarks to memorializing the victims. A 9-year-old girl, a federal judge and four others were killed in the weekend shooting. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords remains in critical condition after being shot in the head. ""Obama's speech will be a vigil with rhetoric that doesn't soar, but touches the heart,"" Brinkley said. ""We want him to be our empathizer-in-chief. He's our representative at the memorial service for how we collectively feel. And that's what powerful rhetoric from presidents can do."" Reagan and Clinton both delivered speeches that were brief yet poignant when they addressed a grieving public. Reagan encouraged the country to find ""the courage to look for the seeds of hope."" In the aftermath of a bombing that killed 168 people, Clinton told mourners, ""You have lost too much, but you have not lost everything. And you have certainly not lost America, for we will stand with you for as many tomorrows as it takes."" Brinkley calls Clinton's memorial remarks ""the finest speech"" he ever gave. ""If [Obama] can get anywhere near the perfect tone touched after Oklahoma City, the country will be deeply grateful to him,"" he said. But whether Obama's speech serves as a pivotal unifying moment in his presidency depends on his ability to put the tragedy in a larger context, said Michael Wagner, a professor in the political science department at the University of Nebraska. ""Typically the shelf life of presidential speeches is pretty short,"" Wagner said. ""On the other hand, he is somebody who ran for office as someone who wanted to change the tone in Washington, so it certainly could galvanize his efforts with respect to that particular goal."" Although there is no indication that the heated political atmosphere played a part in the shooter's motive, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have called on their colleagues to tone it down. Goodwill, however, evaporates quickly in politics. ""To expect that this speech is going to change things is a pretty high expectation,"" Wagner noted. Jeff Shesol, a Clinton speech writer, said there is a need for the president to be heard in moments such as these. Shesol worked with Clinton on the remarks he gave in the aftermath of the massacre at Columbine High School in 1999, among other speeches. ""You are stopping to reflect on this loss, what has been lost and then all you can do is suggest the possibility of moving on. We are a ways from that moment ... but you can suggest that possibility of transcending this moment and finding some sort of peace in your grief,"" said Shesol, founding partner of the speech writing and strategy firm West Wing Writers. Obama began working on his speech Monday night. The president is expected to speak at the memorial service at 6 p.m. local time. While the service is open to the campus and the Tucson community, Obama's words will be heard by the nation. ""He is speaking first and most immediately to the families who are grieving, he is speaking to the local community which is badly shaken, and of course he is speaking to the national audience because we are all caught up in this together,"" Shesol said. And no matter what approach he takes, the president can expect his words to be scrutinized. ""It should not have the feel of politics to it at all, but there is no question that these are political moments,"" Shesol said.","Obama to speak at memorial service for victims of Arizona shooting .

"(CNN) -- British Prime Minister David Cameron will hold talks at 10 Downing Street on Wednesday to discuss racism in football following several high profile incidents in the English Premier League. ""We simply cannot brush this under the carpet,"" Cameron said, writing in The Sun newspaper. ""I've no doubt that football will crack this problem â€” and the Government stands ready to do anything it can to help."" Racism has been in the spotlight after cases involving some of football's most-famous players and figures. England national manager Fabio Capello resigned this month after a meeting with English Football Association chairman David Bernstein. Capello had openly criticized on Italian TV the English FA's decision to remove John Terry as England captain. Terry, who is accused of racially abusing another player during a match, will go on trial July 9 following the Euro 2012 finals. The case stems from comments the Chelsea footballer allegedly made to Queens Park Rangers player Anton Ferdinand in an English Premier League match last year. Alison Saunders, chief crown prosecutor for London, said Terry is being prosecuted for a ""racially aggravated public order offense"" because of the comments during the October 23 match. The maximum penalty for the offense is Â£2,500 (about $3,950). The London-born defender has denied the allegations. Cameron says recent events highlight the need to end ""all forms of discrimination."" The FA, the Premier League and every club has signed onto a charter to ""Tackle Homophobia and Transphobia in Sport."" In another case last year, Liverpool's Luis Suarez was suspended and fined for racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra. Suarez was suspended for eight matches and fined Â£40,000 ($63,000), England's Football Association announced in December. Evra said Suarez repeatedly shouted a racial slur at him during the October 15 match and demanded that Suarez be held accountable. Suarez did not specify what he said, but said it wasn't offensive. And his club issued a statement saying it was ""very surprised and disappointed"" with the decision. Racist taunts, alleged and proven, have dogged English football for years. In January, police arrested a man on suspicion of making a racially abusive gesture at a high-profile soccer match between Liverpool and Manchester United. Earlier that month, Merseyside police arrested a 20-year-old man on ""suspicion of a racially-aggravated public order offense"" following a Liverpool match against Oldham.","Cameron says football can ""crack this problem""

"(CNN) -- Two bushfires still rage out of control in southeast Tasmania, high heat and strong winds persist and scores are coming to grips with the destruction causes by the flames that have already rushed through. Yet, for all the tears shed thus far, the news could be worse. ""It's been a nightmare,"" Richard Scolyer told Nine News, a CNN affiliate. ""I just go along with what happens. ""At least I'm still alive. I realize I'm very lucky to be alive."" Wildfires that tore through tens of thousands of hectares on the island off Australia's southern coast destroyed more than 100 homes, but they haven't caused any known deaths, according to police and local officials. ""We've had no reports of fatalities at this stage,"" Sorrell Council Mayor Kerry Vincent told CNN affiliate Sky Australia early Monday. Vincent's territory includes Dunalley, where about 65 homes and an elementary school were destroyed Friday in addition to dozens more homes and businesses in neighboring communities, authorities said. Acting Tasmanian Police Commissioner Scott Tilyard likewise said Monday that authorities haven't found any indication anyone died in the fires. But he said they are still continuing to sift through about 500 inquiries -- some of whom may be for the same person or be for people who weren't even in the fire zones -- about potentially missing people. Then there's the matter of double-checking on the ground, including combing through scorched buildings, to ensure everyone survived. ""Until we've had the opportunity to do all the screening that we need to do, ... we can't say for certain that there hasn't been a human life or more than one human life lost as a result of these fires,"" Tilyard told reporters. Some -- like Scolyer, who arrived with nothing more than a toothbrush and the clothes he was wearing -- found refuge in the prison-turned-tourist attraction in Port Arthur. There, they have been given meals and other necessities. They've also found plenty of company in their heartbreak. ""Apparently, it's burnt out,"" Garry Fahey said of his house. ""But it's home, no matter what it's like."" Back in Dunalley, Ivan Kelly and his sons drove through the flames to escape, only to return later to find their homes and the timber mill they once owned scorched. Paige Kelly, one of the sons, said the family is trying to figure out how to tell the people who worked there that the mill may not come back. ""How do you tell somebody that?"" Kelly told Nine News. ""I don't know."" While this town already has been decimated, others remained in danger Monday. According to a Monday morning update from the Tasmania Fire Service, ""watch and alert"" advisories have been issued for a pair of fires that have already collectively burned about 29,000 hectares (110 square miles). As of that time -- and despite some progress overnight -- neither of those bushfires was under control. ""Although there has been a decrease in weather conditions and fire activity overnight and this morning, people need to remain vigilant, as fire and weather conditions can change rapidly,"" the service said for the larger of the two blazes, known as the Forcett Fire. Mother Nature wasn't helping much Monday, where high temperatures in the most affected areas are expected to reach 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. The same forecast for southeast Tasmania called for daytime winds of 20 to 30 kph (12 to 19 mph), slowly slightly by evening. Cooler temperatures are likely and isolated rain showers are possible for Tuesday and Wednesday, though winds could also intensify on those days. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard visited the fire-stricken area Monday, later talking about those who ""lost so much but (are not) able to see it"" themselves and others ""who wanted to do something as simple as go on a family holiday have had to confront the forces of nature at work."" ""To all of those people, I do want to say we're thinking of you in these moments of grief and despair, and we will be working with you in the days to come,"" she said. Aerial photographs taken earlier by Nine News showed the fire's fury as it hopscotched homes in Dunalley and Boomer Bay, burning two homes, leaving one standing and then burning another. Tasmania's fire chief told reporters Sunday that firefighters hope to bring the blaze under control by Tuesday. Part of the problem is the rugged nature of the Tasman Peninsula -- in the southeast part of island -- where the fires have been burning since last week, Chief Fire Officer Mike Brown said Sunday. ""There (are) still some problems getting fire vehicles into the Tasman Peninsula to work more on protecting properties and protecting assets,'' he said. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","NEW: There are no confirmed deaths, but authorities are still looking, police say .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Standing before throngs of cheering supporters Sunday, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called for an end to the division among Palestinians in the wake of the United Nations upgrading the authority's status -- as Israel refused to acknowledge that newfound recognition. ""The people who have achieved the accomplishment of the 29th of November, when the world wrote the birth certificate of the state of Palestine, are capable of imposing the will of the people in making the reconciliation happen,"" he said at a packed rally in Ramallah. The U.N. General Assembly on Thursday elevated the authority's status from ""non-member observer entity"" to ""non-member observer state"" -- the same category as the Vatican. Palestinian leaders had previously launched a failed bid for full U.N. membership. Abbas is a part of the Palestinian faction Fatah, which controls the West Bank. Gaza is controlled by Hamas, which has battled Fatah for power and -- until last week -- long opposed its efforts to achieve the status upgrade. Abbas, speaking Sunday, said there are ""a lot of missions"" ahead, and the ""most important is to restore our national unity and achieve reconciliation."" Israel and the United States have slammed the authority's move at the United Nations, with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday it was ""a step that will not bring us closer to peace."" And, in response to the U.N. move, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu refused Sunday to reconsider a plan to build thousands of new homes in occupied territory. The United States and a number of European nations called on Israel to roll back the settlement plan in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which was announced Friday. Clinton: New Israeli settlements a 'set back' for peace with Palestinians . Israeli settlements are widely considered illegal under international law, though Israel insists they are not. ""The answer to the attack on the Zionist character of the state of Israel obliges us to increase the tempo of settlement building plans in all the areas that the government has decided to settle in,"" Netanyahu said in remarks before the start of his weekly Cabinet meeting in Jerusalem. He said he was citing ""the language of the government decision in 1975 after the U.N. decision that equated Zionism with racism."" Netanyahu has called the Palestinian Authority's U.N. bid ""a gross violation"" of an agreement signed with the Israeli government. Israel says it violates a Palestinian agreement to work out central issues through negotiation. Netanyahu has not publicly acknowledged the approval of new construction. But a senior government official said Saturday that the prime minister signed off on building ""3,000 housing units"" in the East Jerusalem as well as authorizing planning and zoning for future construction in the West Bank town of Ma'ale Adumim. The Obama administration has repeatedly warned Israel against settling East Jerusalem and the West Bank, particularly the Ma'ale Adumim area, because it would make it nearly impossible to create a contiguous Palestinian state. The Israeli Cabinet, in a unanimous vote Sunday, rejected the U.N. General Assembly's decision, saying it changes nothing and will not be a basis for negotiations. The creation of a Palestinian state will require ""arrangements that ensure the security of the citizens of Israel, recognition of Israel as a Jewish state, and a declaration by Palestinians that the conflict is over,"" the Cabinet statement. Israel seized the West Bank, Gaza, Golan Heights and Sinai Peninsula during the 1967 war. The Sinai has since been returned to Egypt. Israel annexed the Golan Heights in 1981, a move not recognized by the international community and condemned by Syria, which still claims the land. Israel withdrew settlers from Gaza in 2005. Hamas has since regularly launched rocket attacks into southern Israel. The Palestinian bid to the United Nations and news of Israeli settlement construction came just days after a cease-fire took hold between Israel and Hamas that brought about an end to a series of Israeli military airstrikes against Gaza launched in an effort to stop the Hamas rocket attacks. Hezbollah, a militant group and political party in Lebanon, has launched attacks on Israel from the north. Both Hezbollah and Hamas receive support from Iran. A senior U.S. official told CNN last week that Iran is ""finding ways to resupply Hamas"" with long range rockets and other weapons. The European Union, the United States, and Israel consider Hamas a terrorist organization. The United States and Israel also consider Hezbollah a terrorist group. The Palestinian Authority's new U.N. status allows it to have cases heard before the International Criminal Court -- a concern for Israel as Palestinians have repeatedly tried to have their claims heard before the judicial body at the Hague. International efforts for a ""two-state solution"" focus on a plan to unite Gaza and West Bank under the authority of a single Palestinian government. Palestinian leaders want the capital in east Jerusalem. Palestinian officials have refused to enter into new talks with Israel until it stops building settlements on West Bank land. Netanyahu, meanwhile, has said there can be no such preconditions on talks. He has called on Hamas to renounce terrorism and accept the existence of Israel.

"Islamabad (CNN) -- Supporters of a Muslim cleric who wants Pakistan's leaders thrown out in favor of a caretaker government waited for him to address them in Islamabad on Tuesday after a deadline he set for the current administration to step down expired. Thousands of people gathered in an area near the parliament building, a regular site of protests in the Pakistani capital. Brief clashes took place with security forces early Tuesday as the crowd moved into the area. Local media reported that police fired shots in the air and lobbed tear gas at a crowd. The unrest subsided after 10 to 15 minutes, and the crowd continued peacefully. Thousands of people had assembled in Islamabad on Monday for a nighttime rally at which the cleric, Tahir ul Qadri, called for the dissolution of the existing government. A large number of the supporters who attended the rally remained in central Islamabad Tuesday morning. Footage from the local broadcaster Ary News showed chaotic scenes of people running and objects being thrown as gunshots echoed in the background. Members of the security forces in body armor were seen carrying guns. Read more: Pakistan Supreme Court orders arrest of prime minister in corruption case . Pakistani authorities and Qadri's supporters offered differing accounts of the moment of unrest, in which no injuries were reported. Interior Minister Rehman Malik said police were doing their best to protect Qadri and control the crowd. He said the reported clashes are under investigation. But Qadri's supporters claimed officers had attempted to arrest the cleric only to be prevented from doing so by the mass of people surrounding him. ""Once they realized that the crowd is not letting them come near him, they opened fire in the air unprovoked, which lasted for 10 minutes,"" said Shahid Mursaleen, the cleric's spokesman. The crowd then chased the police officers away with sticks, he said, adding that Qadri remained safe and unharmed. Read more: Pakistan in 2013 -- Yes, it could get worse . ""It's the beginning of the revolution,"" Qadri said earlier at the nighttime rally. ""Dissolve federal and provincial governments by tomorrow morning; otherwise, the public will force them to step down!"" Qadri urged the demonstrators to remain in the capital until they achieve their goals. ""Now and onward, you have to take care of Islamabad,"" he said. His campaign comes before national elections due this year. He referred to President Asif Ali Zardari as 'ex-president' and to Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf as 'ex-prime minister.' But the group's numbers fell far short of what organizers of the ""Million Man March"" had predicted, with witnesses estimating that some 20,000 people took part. Read more: Muslim scholar's fatwa condemns terrorism . Malik, who visited rally sites Monday by helicopter, said the turnout numbers showed that Qadri's event had ""badly failed."" Many Pakistanis followed the day's events on television as the participants, led by Qadri, headed toward Islamabad with police and soldiers lining the rally route. Video showed a convoy of buses, vans and cars packed with participants waving the national flag en route to the capital from the large eastern city of Lahore. Qadri, who traveled in a bulletproof van, has promised a Pakistani equivalent of Egypt's Tahrir Square protests. When the marchers arrived at the rally site, near Parliament and the presidential home, they joined more than 1,000 other protesters who had arrived earlier in the day for the demonstration. Return from self-imposed exile . After eight years in Canada, Qadri returned last month to Pakistan, where he is waging a campaign against the political elite. Read more: Islamic scholar who condemned terrorism: 'I am not afraid' Qadri has called for a caretaker administration to replace the current government and to carry out election reforms. His suggestion that the judiciary and the military weigh in on the composition of the interim government has raised concerns in a country where military leaders have repeatedly seized power and ruled for long periods of time. Some Pakistanis, noting that Qadri served as a lawmaker in the early 2000s, when Gen. Pervez Musharraf was leading the country, have suggested he may be working on behalf of the military. Read more: Why Karachi's violence shouldn't define city . Qadri denies those allegations and maintains he is simply seeking to ensure a corruption-free electoral process. The current government and opposition have both rejected his requests for a caretaker administration, insisting that nothing will stand in the way of timely elections and the democratic process. ""We will not succumb to these illegal demands,"" Malik said last week. Party withdraws support . The only political party that had supported Qadri's demonstration, the Mutahida Qaumi Movement, withdrew that support last week. The movement is a coalition partner in the current government. If this year's elections take place without major difficulties, it would represent the first time in Pakistan's history that a civilian government would have made it through a five-year term. Corruption is widely considered a chronic problem in Pakistan's political system; President Zardari has served prison time on corruption charges. The problem appears to be regional. Qadri's campaign comes more than a year after anti-corruption demonstrator Anna Hazare roiled Indian politics with a hunger strike that called for the introduction of strong anti-graft measures. CNN's Aliza Kassin, Saima Mohsin and Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","NEW: Supporters of Tahir ul Qadri wait for him to announce his next move .

"(CNN) -- He has yet to compete at the Olympics, but the eyes of the world will be on Oscar Pistorius if he is selected for London 2012. Born with a congenital abnormality, he had both his legs amputated below the knee at 11 months of age, but that has not stopped him competing at the highest level. The South African runs on specially-adapted carbon-fiber artificial limbs, earning him the nickname ""Blade Runner"" and the tag of ""fastest man with no legs."" After winning a legal battle to let him race against able-bodied athletes, the 25-year-old has become one of the most recognizable and popular figures in the world of sport thanks to his inspiring performances on the track. Pistorius certainly is fast, holding the world records in his T44 disability category from 100 to 400 meters, and he has won four Paralympic gold medals. His times enable him to compete internationally against able-bodied runners, and he reached the 400m semifinals at the 2011 world championships in Daegu. He also helped South Africa to the final of the 4x400m relay but was controversially omitted for the medal race. His teammates took silver and -- because he ran in the earlier rounds -- Pistorius was awarded a medal, becoming the first disabled athlete to achieve that feat at a global championships. Early years . Pistorius came from what he describes as a ""sports-crazy family, pretty much obsessed with sport"" and did not allow his disability to restrict his activities. At school in Gauteng Province, he was a keen rugby player and also competed in a wide range of sports from water polo to tennis and even triathlons. A knee injury curtailed his rugby career and he turned to track and field in 2003, quickly discovering a real talent for sprinting. Just a year later and still only 17, Pistorius won gold over 200m at the 2004 Athens Paralympics in a world record and also took bronze in the 100m, beating athletes with lesser disabilities. Using the Cheetah Flex-Foot carbon-fiber limbs, specially adapted by Icelandic company Ossur, it was the start of his journey to global stardom. Legal affairs . Pistorius began to compete in able-bodied competitions, at first in South Africa, but then abroad. ""I was starting to run times which allowed me to compete internationally on the able-bodied circuit,"" he said. But as he got quicker, it brought Pistorius into dispute with the IAAF, the world governing body of athletics, which ruled his artificial limbs gave him an unfair advantage and barred him from the circuit. Employing a top legal team, Pistorius took his case to the Court of Arbitration in Sport, which overturned the ban in 2008. However, he did not reach the Olympic qualifying standards for Beijing, where he took part in the Paralympics. ""Since it was proved my prosthetic legs give me no advantage, I have developed a very good relationship with the IAAF,"" he said. Training regime . Pistorius' success is not only down to his talent, it owes much to a grueling training regime under coach Ampie Louw. Getting up at 5 a.m. at their base in Pretoria, Pistorius puts in up to three and a half hours each day, on occasion more, in preparation for a major championship. He also has a strictly-controlled diet with lots of fruit and vegetables, plus plenty of fish and protein to aid recovery. Pistorius reports ""no injuries"" coming into the all important year of 2012. Sporting heroes . Pistorius has been an inspirational figure around the world with his exploits, while his own sporting heroes both come from track and field: Britain's former 110m world record-holder Colin Jackson and Namibian sprinter Frankie Fredericks. Jackson has become a ""great friend and mentor"" for Pistorius, who has made many trips to the UK in recent years. ""Frankie Fredericks has always been my icon, and someone who has achieved as much as he has is special,"" he said of the former world champion and four-time Olympic silver medalist. 2012 ambitions . Pistorius aims to run at both the 2012 London Olympics and the subsequent Paralympics in the British capital. He is targeting four gold medals in the Paralympics, repeating his Beijing triple in the 100, 200 and 400m, and hopefully earning success in the South African 4x100m relay team. And in the Olympic Games? ""To try to repeat my achievement in Daegu to reach the semifinals of the individual 400m."" Having already achieved the qualifying standard with a time of 45.20 seconds in Gauteng earlier this year, Pistorius is well on the way to achieving selection and will also be pressing for a place again in the South Africa's 4x400m relay squad. Sporting philosophy . Pistorius sets himself high standards, retaining values that were instilled in him from an early age: ""My family always said if you start something, you finish it."" With so much already achieved it is easy to forget he has many years of competition potentially ahead of him, but when Pistorius does eventually retire he wants to have left nothing on the track. ""To look back and know every season I did my best. That I gave it my best with no regrets.""","Oscar Pistorius is preparing for both London Olympics and Paralympics .

"(CNN) -- The national conversation over Trayvon Martin's killing is loud and intense. In some places, it's also vile and violent. The case -- in which a Hispanic neighborhood watch volunteer killed the unarmed black teen in Sanford, Florida, on February 26 -- has sparked a national controversy. It has also stoked extremist views, particularly on the Internet, experts say. George Zimmerman said he shot Martin in self-defense after the teen attacked him. Martin's family has disputed that. Investigators have not charged Zimmerman. The Southern Poverty Law Center, the civil rights group that fights bigotry, saidÂ the case has stirred up ""extremists on both sides of the racial divide."" A visitor to the website of one white supremacist group, for example, left a comment calling Martin ""a punk negroe who messed with the wrong guy."" Meanwhile, the New Black Panther Party has offered a $10,000 reward for anyone who ""captures"" Zimmerman, an offer that Martin's family has condemned. The Institute for Research & Education on Human Rights, which fights bigotry, said that ""white nationalists are trying to inject their poison"" into the case, too, portraying the teen as a ""scary black man who deserved what he got."" ""They have defamed Martin, concocted false allegations and amplified racial stereotypes of young black men -- in effect, putting the victim on trial in the court of public opinion,"" the group said. Mark Potok, an expert on extremists for the Southern Poverty Law Center, says white supremacist attitudes often emerge during such hot-button controversies. ""You see this every time there really is something like this,"" an attempt to portray victims as perpetrators and this slain 17-year-old as a ""gangster thug,"" he said. The incident has created a ""mob mentality,"" according to a commentary from William Bennett, a CNN contributor who served as secretary of education under President Reagan. ""The facts are confounding and inconclusive. But the tendency in the first days by some, including Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson and an angry chorus of followers, was to rush to judgment with little regard for fairness, due process, or respect for the terrible death of a young man,"" Bennett said. He noted that film director Spike Lee tweeted what he thought was Zimmerman's home address. It turned out to be the wrong address, though, and it ""resulted in an older couple fleeing from their home and fearing for their lives after threats and crowds outside their residence."" Lee apologized to the couple and said he would pay the couple's cost of leaving their home. Lester Spence, an assistant professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University, said he's not surprised to hear about hate speech sprouting up. He said the Internet intensifies it. ""As soon as something like this happens, bloggers focus on it. People that follow them share that content,"" he said. He said the hate shows up in comments under stories and essays on the Web -- comments that almost always aren't signed by the writers. ""People will say what they want to say under the cover of anonymity,"" he said. ""Go to almost any website that deals with this issue,"" Spence said. If there are no filters, the hate pours through, he said. Kelly McBride, senior faculty member for ethics at Poynter Institute, a nonprofit school for journalists in St. Petersburg, Florida, said she isn't surprised that extremist talk has emerged in this case. ""There have always been people who believe racist things and those people have existed on a continuum,"" she said. Hate speech involving immigration and sexual orientation also ripples across the Web. People who don't pay ""super close attention to these issues may not notice the hate speech on a regular basis,"" she said. ""The Internet affords people anonymity and insulation,"" she said. Potok said the Martin case reminds him of what happened with Shirley Sherrod, the black Agriculture Department employee who was engulfed in controversy two years ago. Late blogger Andrew Breitbart posted an edited and incomplete video of a speech by Sherrod, making her appear to say she discriminated against a white farmer looking for assistance. Sherrod resigned. A full version of the speech, however, showed that Sherrod had assisted the farmer. The department later offered Sherrod her job back when it was clear she had been misrepresented. Potok noted that she was briefly portrayed as anti-white and was briefly demonized. He compared the slams at Sherrod to the doubt cast on Martin's character.","""Extremists on both sides"" are stirred up, the Southern Poverty Law Center says .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A three-day mourning period began Friday in a southwestern Pakistani province where a series of bomb blasts killed nearly 100 people the previous day in the bustling city of Quetta. The deadliest explosions were two suicide bombings in a predominantly Shiite neighborhood known as Alamdar Road. One blast brought police, rescue workers and journalists rushing to the scene. It was swiftly followed by another explosion -- set off by a man sitting in a car with over 100 kilograms of explosives -- that caught many of those responding to the initial attack. The double bombing, described by police as one of the worst attacks on the Shiite minority, killed 85 people and wounded about 150. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a banned Sunni militant group, claimed responsibility for the Alamdar Road attacks. Shiites, a minority sect in the mainly Sunni Muslim Pakistan, face persecution from extremists. Last month, more than 20 Shiite pilgrims were killed when a car bomb detonated near the buses they were traveling in. Mir Zubair Mehmood, a Quetta police official, said the Alamdar attacks were motivated by Sunni and Shiite sectarian differences. Read more: What's working in Pakistan . Another blast in Quetta on Thursday struck a security checkpoint in a busy market, authorities said. A bomb planted in a car detonated as security forces entered the area, killing 12 people and wounding 45, according to Wazir Khan Nasir, a police spokesman. Nasir blamed the attack on Baloch insurgents. A fourth bomb went off by the side of the road leading to the city's airport, wounding three. Quetta is the capital of Balochistan province. Watch: Pakistan: Give us the drone technology . Balochistan Chief Minister Nawab Raisani announced the mourning period for the province late Thursday in the aftermath of the bombings. Over the next three days, commercial activity in Quetta, one of Pakistan's largest cities, will be suspended. Balochistan is regularly plagued by violence from myriad causes. As well as the sectarian attacks on Shiites, the unrest in the province is believed to be fomented by several insurgent groups, including the separatist Balochistan Liberation Army and the Pakistani Taliban. Although Balochistan is the largest province in Pakistan geographically, analysts and some locals have criticized the federal government for neglecting it, leading to instability. More on Pakistan: India and Pakistan trade accusations over Kashmir violence . Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf condemned the blasts in Quetta. ""The prime minister, while expressing his heartfelt condolences and sympathies with the bereaved families, reiterated the government's resolve to stamp out the menace of militancy and terrorism from the country in its all shapes and manifestations,"" said a statement released by his office.

Mingora is in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan's northwest. The U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Richard Olson, expressed condolences to the families of those killed in the attacks.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's father says he is concerned about the last moments of his son's life and about the personal physician who found the pop icon unconscious at the singer's estate. Singer Ne-Yo (L) and host Jamie Foxx pay tribute to Michael Jackson at 2009 BET Awards in Los Angeles. ""I have a lot of concerns,"" Joe Jackson told CNN's Don Lemon on the red carpet leading up to the BET Awards ceremony Sunday night. ""I can't get into that, but I don't like what happened."" Michael Jackson's personal physician, who was questioned extensively by investigators over the weekend, found the singer not breathing in bed when he entered the singer's estate last week, according to the law firm representing the doctor. However, Jackson did have a slight pulse when Dr. Conrad Murray discovered him Thursday, and Murray tried to resuscitate the singer as he awaited paramedics, a representative with the law firm of Stradley, Chernoff and Alford law firm in Houston, Texas, told CNN Sunday. Attorney Edward Chernoff is representing Murray. The law firm said reports that Murray injected Jackson with powerful painkillers, such as Demerol or Oxycontin, were false. Funeral arrangements for Jackson were pending Sunday. ""We haven't gotten to that yet -- we're working on that,"" Joe Jackson told CNN's Lemon.  Watch Joe Jackson talk about the death of his son » . Murray voluntarily met for several hours with detectives, the Los Angeles Police Department said late Saturday night. ""Detectives assigned to Robbery-Homicide Division met with Dr. Murray and conducted an extensive interview,"" a police statement said. ""Dr. Murray was cooperative and provided information which will aid the investigation.""  Watch attorney for Jackson's doctor say his client is not a suspect » . Jackson's family suspects that Murray can answer some lingering questions about the singer's last hours, but they have been unable to contact him, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said Saturday. ""The routine inquiry is now an investigation,"" Jesse Jackson said. ""They (Jackson's family) didn't know the doctor. ... He should have met with the family, given them comfort on the last hours of their son.""  Watch latest developments in Jackson's death investigation » . Jackson family attorney L. Londell McMillan told CNN that a second autopsy is ""under way."" ""We'll let that process take its course,"" McMillan, who accompanied Joe Jackson to the BET Awards, told CNN. McMillan said a will has not surfaced since Michael Jackson's death and that the singer's mother, Katherine Jackson, is seeking custody of his two children. ""Well, if there is no will, then under the state of California it goes to the next of kin. That's an adult to administer and oversee the best interests of the children and that would be Mr. and Mrs. Jackson,"" McMillan said. ""And Katherine Jackson is the duly appointed person."" He added, ""She will seek custody of the children. That's who Michael would have wanted to have the children, she loves them dearly."" On Saturday, the founder of 1-800-AUTOPSY, a private firm that conducts autopsies, told CNN that the Jackson family had contacted the business to inquire about possibly having a second autopsy done there. Jesse Jackson added on Saturday that the family needed ""an independent autopsy to get even more answers to questions that are now being driven by the gap between when Michael was last seen alive and was pronounced dead.""iReport.com: Tributes pour in for Jackson . There are lingering questions, including: ""How long had he stopped breathing? How long had he been unconscious?"" Jesse Jackson said. Michael Jackson was discovered unconscious Thursday by paramedics at his home, where Murray apparently had tried to revive him. He was rushed to a Los Angeles medical center, where he was pronounced dead.  Listen to the 911 call » . An autopsy performed by a county medical examiner was inconclusive -- although officials said there were no indications of external trauma or foul play. The Los Angeles County coroner's office has said more tests are needed before a cause of death can be determined. That could take four to six weeks.

Police have released no information on what they may have found.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Hal David, the lyricist behind such standards as ""Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head"" and ""What the World Needs Now is Love,"" has died at 91, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers said Saturday. The Oscar- and Grammy-winning songwriter, who teamed with musician Burt Bacharach on dozens of hit songs, died Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles from complications of a stroke, ASCAP said. David's greatest hits . David started working with Bacharach in the late 1950s on tunes recorded by artists including Perry Como, Gene Pitney, Dusty Springfield, Tom Jones, Frank Sinatra, the Carpenters, Barbra Streisand and Dionne Warwick. In May, President Barack Obama and the first lady hosted a concert honoring Bacharach and David as part of the ""In Performance at the White House"" series. ""As a lyric writer, Hal was simple, concise and poetic -- conveying volumes of meaning in fewest possible words and always in service to the music,"" ASCAP President and Chairman Paul Williams said. ""It is no wonder that so many of his lyrics have become part of our everyday vocabulary and his songs ... the backdrop of our lives."" Singer Smokey Robinson on Saturday said David was one of his songwriting idols when he was growing up. ""I hope that the music world will join together in celebrating the life of one of our greatest composers ever,"" Robinson said in a statement Saturday. ""I will really miss my friend but I will celebrate his life and he will live on-and-on through his incredible musical contribution."" Lyricist Carole Bayer Sager, who also worked extensively with then-husband Burt Bacharach, said David made Bacharach's melodies seem ""effortless."" David was president of ASCAP from 1980 till 1986. The Recording Academy called David an ""exquisite lyricist"" whose work has left a ""lasting impact on our culture."" He was born in Brooklyn, New York, to parents who had immigrated from Austria. He studied journalism at New York University before joining the military during World War II. Returning to New York after the war, he began working with songwriters he met at the famous Brill Building, which at the time was the center of the city's song industry, ASCAP said. It was his collaboration with Bacharach that proved the most fruitful. They were some of the first to work with Warwick when she was a young vocalist. Dionne Warwick sings Hal David's last lyrics . They also helped Herb Alpert to No. 1 with ""This Guy's in Love With You"" and wrote The Carpenters' No. 1 hit ""(They Long to Be) Close to You."" British Invasion stars like Springfield and Sandie Shaw sought the pair's talents in the 1960s, and they got Tom Jones into the Top 10 with ""What's New Pussycat."" The pair's accomplishments extended to stage and screen as well. They wrote scores and themes for 1960s films including ""Alfie"" and ""Casino Royale."" Their ""Raindrops"" tune was written for ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" and reached No. 1. They wrote the score for the musical ""Promises, Promises,"" which was nominated for a Tony Award and won a Grammy for best Cast Album of the Year in 1970. David parted ways with Bacharach in the early 1970s, but he went on to work with other composers, including Albert Hammond -- with whom he wrote ""To All the Girls I've Loved Before."" His first wife, Anne, died in 1987. He is survived by his wife, Eunice; two sons, three grandchildren, and two stepsons.

"(CNN) -- Thousands of e-mails released Wednesday by the university once attended by the Colorado movie theater shooting suspect reveal James Holmes may have once had a romantic relationship with a fellow graduate student and possibly had two badges for the campus at the time of the attack. The University of Colorado at Denver, in response to media requests for Holmes' records, released more than 3,800 e-mails that were sent or received by Holmes or mentioned his name in the text. Holmes is accused of going on a shooting spree during a midnight screening of the Batman film ""The Dark Knight Rises"" July 20 at an Aurora cinema, killing 12 people and injuring 58 others. One e-mail sent about 11 hours after the shooting said Holmes may have been involved for a short time with a student in a professor's program. ""She, fortunately, it turns out is in India right now,"" an e-mail from the professor says. ""She knows, and is pretty freaked out."" Also Wednesday, CNN affiliate KMGH reported sources said Holmes began to fantasize about killing ""a lot of people"" in early June, nearly six weeks before the shootings. The sources, who were not identified by the station but who were described as being familiar with the investigation, told KMGH that a doctor treating Holmes was asked in June if she wanted to order him held for 72 hours to be evaluated by mental health professionals. But the station's sources said the doctor decided against it because Holmes was in the process of withdrawing from the school. But an e-mail sent in July on the day of the shootings within the school's information technology department acknowledged that Holmes still had an active computer account at the time, and two badges for the campus. One official in the IT department answered the original message by saying that the department should only act on the legal department's advice and not deactivate Holmes' computer access. Hundreds of the e-mails released were redacted by the school, citing privacy laws. Many of the ones that weren't were sent between university officials in the aftermath of the killings, including one sent about seven hours later with the subject line ""Horrible News."" The professor who wrote the e-mail wonders if the suspect is the James Holmes she knows and asks others if they think it would be wise to meet with the students who may have had class with him. Other e-mails among those released were purportedly from Holmes, usually signed with ""Cheers, James Holmes."" The movie theater complex where the shootings occurred will reopen to the public on January 18, the Aurora mayor's office said Wednesday. Victims and their families will be invited to visit the theater on January 15 and 16, the mayor's office said. The next night the theater will host an event for other invited guests then will show free movies for the first three days it is open to everyone.

So what's new? No less than eight teams underwent a change of coach during the off season with Bayern Munich's appointment of Louis van Gaal the most high profile after the disappointing reign of Jurgen Klinsmann and Jupp Heynckes' spell as caretaker boss. Felix Magath has left champions Wolfsburg to help revive ailing Schalke, who finished eighth last time round, with former Stuttgart chief Armin Veh moving into the hot seat. Brazil playmaker Diego was the most significant player departure from the Bundesliga after he swapped Werder Bremen for Italian giants Juventus in a deal worth $35 million. Werder filled the void left by the influential midfielder with the $12 million signing of promising youngster Marko Marin from Borussia Monchengladbach. Striker Mario Gomez moved to Bayern Munich from Stuttgart for a Bundesliga record fee of $43 million while Wolfsburg increased their goal options with the capture of Nigeria forward Obafemi Martins. One change in the structure of the Bundesliga is the reduction of the winter break from six to three weeks to help ease fixture congestion and enable the national team longer to prepare for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. . Lukas Podolski is back at his former club Cologne . Key players: Speculation over the future of Bayern Munich star Franck Ribery - who has been linked with Chelsea, Real Madrid and Manchester United - has been the main transfer topic that has filled column inches during the off season. If Ribery remains with the club he could prove to the difference between Bayern and the rest of the title contenders although the arrival of defensive midfielder Anatoliy Tymoschuk from Zenit St Petersburg will add some much-needed steel to their midfield. Brazil striker Grafite notched 28 goals in 25 Bundesliga matches last season and his form in the 2009/10 season could be key if Wolfsburg can hold onto their title. The battle for places in Joachim Low's squad for the 2010 World Cup could also have a knock-on effect on the fortunes of several Bundesliga sides. Who will win the Bundesliga title? Sound Off below. Bayer Leverkusen pair Stefan Kiessling and Patrick Helmes could well be vying for one place in Low's squad, while Lukas Podolski in particular will be keen to be make up for lost time with Cologne following his emotional return to the club after a stop-start spell at Bayern. Wolfsburg won their first Bundesliga title last season . Key clubs: Hoffenheim enjoyed a creditable first Bundesliga campaign and were top heading into the winter break before they faded in the second half of the season following a serious injury to leading striker Vedad Ibisevic. If the Bosnia international can rediscover his touch, and new signings Franco Zuculini and Maicosuel settle in quickly, then Ralf Rangnick's men could again upset the established elite and this time stay in contention until the end of the season. Schalke supporters will hope that new boss Magath can repeat the heroics he achieved with Wolfsburg last time round. The 56-year-old steered the Wolves to their first Bundesliga title by improbably pipping Bayern Munich to the post, ending the season top of the division with a two point lead over the German giants at the top of the division after 34 games. Elsewhere, if Podolski can show the form he is capable of and finds the net regularly he may add the firepower Cologne need to move from perennial relegation strugglers to European hopefuls. All eyes will be on new Bayern Munich coach Louis van Gaal when the new season starts. Expert view:  CNN's Kate Giles - ""Well as much as I hate to say it, Bayern Munich are the favorites to do the business this season. By their high standards, last season was a flop. ""After similar disappointment in 2007, they came back hard in 2008 and were little short of unstoppable. I would not expect anything different this time round. ""To add to an already star-studded squad, they have made top-class signings in Gomez, Tymoschuk and Ivica Olic. What's more, they will be masterfully led by new coach van Gaal - who has the credentials and experience lacked by Klinsmann. ""Nonetheless, the past few years have proved the Bundesliga title is not necessarily a foregone conclusion, and there are a few other sides that can challenge the favorites.  Watch the predictions of CNN's Kate Giles for the coming campaign » . ""Wolfsburg will be hoping for a repeat of last season's glory. And after managing to hold on to strike duo Grafite and Dzeko, they are bound to get enough goals to present a solid challenge although the distraction of the Champions League could be their undoing. ""Stuttgart will also be looking to pick up where they left off and cannot afford a slow start this time round. Consistency will be the key if they are to turn into title challengers, although the departure of Gomez to Bayern will leave a huge void. ""Bayer Leverkusen are worth keeping an eye on and have added the experience of Sami Hyypia to their talented young squad while veteran coach Heynckes could be the man to unlock their potential. ""At the wrong end of the table, Nuremberg will hope to improve on the unwanted Bundesliga record of being relegated seven times while fellow new boys Mainz and Freiburg must add to their squads to have any realistic hope of survival.""","Bundesliga champions Wolfsburg kick off the new season against Stuttgart .

"(CNN) -- Watching the Charlotte Bobcats stumble around the court this year may make the casual fan wonder who is running this beleaguered organization. Ah ... er, it's Michael Jordan. MJ. His Airness. After Thursday's 104-84 loss to the New York Knicks, Jordan is now the owner of the worst team in NBA history. It's a feat that may look strange next to all the trophies Jordan garnered in his playing career. With the loss, the Bobcats end this season with a record of 7-59, finishing with an all-time worst .106 winning percentage. They take the infamous title from the 1972-73 Philadelphia 76ers who were 9-73 and had a then record-worst .110 winning percentage. The dubious distinction has some wondering how the man, widely thought of as the best basketball player of all time, could lead such a lousy team. Adding to the irony, Jordan was the leader of a Chicago Bulls team back in the 90s that is the winningest team in NBA history, scoring a 72-10 record. As the Bobcats neared the record this week, Jordan received a chorus of criticism. Legendary coach Larry Brown, who coached the Bobcats for three seasons under Jordan, joined the chorus saying Jordan has surrounded himself with ""yes men"" who are hesitant to challenge him. ""He needs more people around him who he has respect for who are not afraid to tell him what's right. That's the one thing I'm disappointed in,"" Brown said on a radio interview on 'The Dan Patrick Show.' Jordan, who fired Brown as the Bobcats coach in 2010, vehemently disagreed with that criticism in an interview Wednesday with the Charlotte Observer. Jordan also acknowledged that his six championships and five Most Valuable Player awards, numerous scoring titles and many other accomplishments as a player adds to the scrutiny he gets as an owner. ""My success will be judged differently ... I've come to accept I'll be scrutinized more than any other owner,'' Jordan said. ""I know now that I have to have a tough skin about these things.'' Jordan said he had planned to rebuild the team and knew that it could be a tough season. But he conceded that he never thought it would be this bad. ""This year the talent we had didn't respond, but that doesn't cause me to turn my back on the plan,"" Jordan told the Charlotte Observer. There were several issues that plagued the Bobcats this year. The team was hammered by injuries including the teams' best player Corey Maggette, who missed half of the season. Also the Bobcats were forced to play rookies Kemba Walker and Bismack Biyombo without much practice time because of the lockout-shortened season. SI: Former champ Walker looks ahead . ""It is the perfect storm,"" said Mike Solarte, sports director of CNN affiliate News 14 Carolina. ""It has been a challenge watching the Bobcats night in and night out. There has been very few highs and a lot of lows all season long."" But there is an upside to all the losses. The record guarantees that the Bobcats will have the greatest chance of getting the first pick in the upcoming NBA draft. And this year's draft features big man Anthony Davis, who is leaving Kentucky and is thought of being able to single-handedly change the fortune of any team that gets him. But some fans have run out of patience after watching the Bobcats end the season with a 23-game losing streak, Solarte said. ""They do have a plan,"" said Solarte. ""That is what they said all along. But when you have only seven wins nobody wants to hear about the plan. They want to know why you are not winning games now.""","The Charlotte Bobcats ended the season with a 7-59 record .
That record is the worst in NBA history .

"Tampa (CNN) -- A man hurrying to catch the light at a corner in muggy downtown Tampa carries a book with a rainbow of color on its cover. Its title stands out, especially here, where the Republican National Convention has officially accepted a platform that a New York Times editorial called ""more aggressive in its opposition to women's reproductive rights and to gay rights than any in memory."" The book is ""A Fundamental Freedom: Why Republicans, Conservatives, and Libertarians Should Support Gay Rights."" Ted McCormac is a precinct committee person for the GOP in Bradenton, Florida, and the father of a gay son. He picked up the book at a brunch co-hosted by the Young Conservatives for the Freedom to Marry and the Log Cabin Republicans -- two of a small number of visible LGBT-supportive Republican groups at this year's convention. Individual members of the Log Cabin Republicans have attended previous conventions, but this year marks a first for the group: It was invited by the Republican National Convention committee to participate in the convention itself. In addition, there are many high-profile, gay-themed events this year, including the brunch McCormac attended.""I've never been to an event of theirs, but people clearly went out of their way to be nice to me,"" McCormac said, with a catch in his voice. ""It means so much since I'm kind of new at this."" In fact, Sarah Longwell, a Log Cabin board member and one of the speakers at the brunch, began her speech by talking about McCormac. She said she teared up when she met McCormac there and he told her how proud he and his wife are of their son, Tony. Tony McCormac is getting married to Jeff Cook, who was also there working on behalf of American Unity, a political action committee that supports Republican candidates who are gay friendly. Cook is so involved in Republican politics that they've scheduled their ceremony In New York after the November election. ""That's what this is all about -- events where we can talk to Republicans about why marriage matters for our community, conservative to conservative,"" Longwell said. Longwell's own engagement is so new she still stumbles a little when she describes Karen Bencala as her ""fiancee."" But her message about why conservatives should back same-sex marriage comes through loud and clear. She shared it Wednesday with all the Republicans gathered for the convention in the form of a full-page ad in the Tampa Tribune, paid for by the Log Cabin and Young Conservatives for the Freedom to Marry. The ad shows several photos of same-sex couples smiling under a quote from Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a Christian right think tank that is far from gay friendly. In his argument that successfully added anti-same sex marriage language to the party's platform, Perkins said, ""The institution of marriage is the foundation of civil society. Its success as an institution will determine our success as a nation."" Longwell's ad goes on to say the LGBT Republican groups agree with Perkins, which is why the government should stop denying marriage licenses to gay couples. ""The freedom to marry is directly in line with the core ideals and principles of the Republican Party -- less government, more individual freedom, personal responsibility and the importance of freedom,"" it argues. ""What I want to ask Tony Perkins if I see him here is, 'If you believe marriage is the very foundation of society, why would you deny us this right?' "" Longwell said. ""I honestly believe it's cruel to deny us this. If you believe we are real people, that is."" As she finishes speaking, Longwell recognizes a man from the Family Research Council riding an escalator into the carefully secured convention center and wonders whether she could catch up with him. Until this year, Longwell may not have had the credentials to follow him into those secured areas, at least not as a Log Cabin Republican. One of the Log Cabin's former directors says this is the first year the RNC has credentialed the group and saved rooms for its members in official hotel space. Bob Kabel says the evolution of the roles that openly gay people play at the convention -- and in the party itself -- has been remarkable. Kabel was the chairman of the Log Cabin Republicans from 1993 to 1999. He went on to be elected the first openly gay person in the nation to chair a state Republican Party, in the District of Columbia. Early on, he says, he felt forced to stand up at a public meeting and shame the Republican National Convention chair into an official meeting with Log Cabin. ""The current RNC leadership has been much better. They've been great,"" Kabel said. ""We feel so much more welcome, and the voices of the Tony Perkinses in the party will be drowned out as more young people come into the party. This is not a negative issue for young people in our party. And we are more visible than ever."" Proof of his statement was visible Tuesday at a GOProud dance party called ""Homocon,"" where many young gay and straight convention danced in the shadow of buff go-go dancers wearing the LGBT group's ""freedom is fabulous"" T-shirts. At the door on the way out of the event, attendees received a convention collector's item -- a keychain with the GOProud logo. Late into the evening, GOProud co-founder Jimmy LaSalvia hushed the dancing crowd for a moment. He described how proud he was that his was the first gay GOP group to endorse this Republican presidential ticket -- even if he personally disagreed with Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan's stance against same-sex marriage. To him, the gay community is so mainstream within the party that GOProud shouldn't solely be about gay issues. ""As most of you know, I support civil marriage for gay couples,"" LaSalvia said, which drew a smattering of supportive shouts from the crowd. ""And marriage is important. But before you get married, you need a date. And everybody knows you can't get a date without a job.""","Republican Party's platform is against same-sex marriage .

"(RollingStone.com) -- The Rolling Stones began their 50th anniversary tour with the biggest possible bang on Sunday night, as a host of special guests joined them for a hit-packed show in London's O2 Arena. Former Stones comrades Bill Wyman and Mick Taylor returned to the ranks, while Mary J. Blige and Jeff Beck were also on hand to help with the celebrations. Wyman -- who left the Stones in 1992 -- was greeted with warm applause and a handshake from Keith Richards as he returned to play bass on ""It's Only Rock and Roll"" and ""Honky Tonk Women."" But the biggest cheers came for Taylor, who hasn't been a Stone since 1974 -- he played trademark blues guitar solos on an extended version of ""Midnight Rambler"" and looked like he was enjoying every second of the reunion. Rare and Intimate Pictures of the Rolling Stones . Blige brought a gospel feel to ""Gimme Shelter,"" trading vocal acrobatics with Mick Jagger, and Beck did a flashy guitar turn on 1969's ""I'm Going Down."" But, despite the headline-grabbing special guests, the evening remained very much about the Stones' core members and their remarkable career, with the set spanning from their second-ever single, 1963's ""I Wanna Be Your Man"" to their latest, 2012's ""Doom and Gloom."" In fact, it ended up pretty much like anyone else's 50th birthday party: there were some old friends, some laughs, some tears, plenty of memories and a lot of embarrassing dancing -- plus it was all over in time for everyone to get the last train home. That said, the evening began half an hour later than billed, at 8.30 p.m., with a video in which stars from Iggy Pop to Elton John and Johnny Depp to Nick Cave revealed how their first time hearing the Stones impacted them. Then a host of drummers wearing gorilla masks -- a nod to the cover of their new hits compilation, GRRR! -- paraded around the arena before ""I Wanna Be Your Man"" kicked things off. Simian percussionists and the massive, lips-shaped stage set aside, this was a relatively gimmick-free Stones set, both in terms of stage production and musical feel. This was the Stones in the raw -- or, at least, as raw as they can be after 50 years together and when playing in front of 20,000 fans. So hits like ""Get Off of My Cloud,"" ""It's All Over Now"" and ""Paint It Black,"" plus a raucous ""All Down the Line"" were rattled through with minimum ceremony, at maximum volume. A Rolling Stones album guide . Jagger, however, was in vintage showman form. In between pumping up the crowd with regular forays down a runway that ran around a central ""lips"" pit full of hardcore fans, he brought plenty of funnies, at one point even joking about the controversy over the cost of tickets for the show, which started at Â£90 (some were re-sold for thousands of pounds online). ""Everybody alright in the cheap seats?"" Jagger asked. ""They aren't so cheap though, are they? That's the trouble . . . "" ""What a year it's been for British celebrations,"" Jagger quipped later. ""There was the Queen's Diamond Jubilee . . . We didn't do that. The Olympics . . . We didn't do that. James Bond's 50th anniversary . . . And we didn't do the song for that either! But I'm so glad that we're here and that you're here."" Richards -- while seemingly content to let Ronnie Wood do some of the heavy lifting on guitar -- was in similarly jocular form. ""It's good to see you all,"" Richards grinned as he took the mic for a two-song stint, ""Before They Make Me Run"" and ""Happy,"" adding, ""It's good to see anybody."" The other members also took their moment in the sun, Wood milking the applause to such an extent that Jagger was moved to jokingly warn him that people ""had to catch the last tube."" In contrast, drummer Charlie Watts only reluctantly stepped to the front of the stage to take his bow. The set closed with a peerless run of classics, including ""Start Me Up,"" ""Tumbling Dice"" and ""Brown Sugar,"" before Jagger donned a feathery cloak for an epic ""Sympathy for the Devil"" to close the main set. After a brief break they returned with not one, but two choirs for a stunning ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" before a final ""Jumpin' Jack Flash,"" with Richards' kinetic riffing center stage, ended the evening with a massive crowd singalong. Jumpin' Jack Flashback! Rolling Stones film from '65 released . True, even after 50 years, the Stones still couldn't get any ""Satisfaction"" -- the 1965 hit was the most notable absentee from the set, despite appearing on the set list handed to the media. But as Jagger left the stage, still jogging and shaking his maracas after two and a half hours and 23 songs, it was clear that even at these ticket prices, the Stones' 50th anniversary shows deliver value for money.

"(CNN) -- Testing continues for patients who may have been exposed to HIV and hepatitis from their visit to Dr. W. Scott Harrington's suburban Tulsa, Oklahoma, dental office. By Monday, nearly 1,000 patients had been screened at a special clinic in the city, and most will receive results in about two weeks, state health officials said. The screenings began Saturday, and the free tests will continue weekdays. Harrington, 64, surrendered his dental license on March 20 after health investigators found sterilization, staffing and other infractions. The dentistry board launched its probe after one of Harrington's patients came down with hepatitis C. That patient originally tested positive for HIV, too, but a subsequent test came back negative, the Tulsa Health Department said. Investigators raised a number of sterilization and ""cross-contamination"" alarms -- such as ""unauthorized, unlicensed"" employees using IVs to sedate patients and that needles weren't handled properly. ""I will tell you that when ... we left, we were just physically kind of sick,"" Susan Rogers, executive director of the Oklahoma Board of Dentistry, said last week. ""That's how bad it was, and I've seen a lot of bad stuff over the years."" The outward cleanliness of the office belied the mess elsewhere, Rogers said said, noting that ""just basic universal precautions for blood-borne pathogens"" weren't followed. Besides being ""unlocked and unattended,"" the drug cabinet was rife with issues -- containing, for example, a drug that expired in 1993 -- according to the official complaint filed before the state dental board. Other records showed that morphine had been used in patients throughout 2012, even though the dentist had not received a morphine delivery since 2009. Harrington and his attorney have not returned multiple calls from CNN. And the oral surgeon wasn't home when a CNN crew went there on Saturday. ""How do you say you're sorry to 7,000 people that you could possibly have infected?"" said Melissa Wood, whose daughter -- a patient of Harrington's -- spent part of her 18th birthday getting tested.

"(CNN) -- Justin Timberlake is an Entertainer. That's JT, with a capital ""E"": Everyman, Everything and Everywhere right now. With the long-awaited release of ""The 20/20 Experience,"" his first album in seven years, 32-year-old Timberlake has managed to endear himself to both women and men -- crafting an amalgam of talents that have made him a character not seen in a generation or two in show-business: The well-rounded performer. You won't find anyone else like him in music, or Hollywood for that matter. It's an organic chemistry of likability: equal parts movie star, debonair showman, TV comedian and successful businessman. ""My idols have always been the types of guys who could do anything,"" Timberlake told ""The Guardian"" in 2011. ""Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Sinatra, Dean Martin; and when you look up to people like that, you don't accept that you need to be compartmentalized."" ""I wouldn't call him Frank Sinatra,"" ""Billboard""'s , Phil Gallo told CNN. ""I'll go Bing Crosby because Bing Crosby was more of the, A, wise investor, B, very specific vocal style that evolves -- but you knew it was Bing, just as you know this is Justin. And the acting in the kind of movies they were -- arty, but they told a good story and they appealed to the audience of the day."" Timberlake's business ventures are as diverse as professional sports franchises and golf courses, fashion, the Internet, and restaurants. Gallo added, ""Here's somebody who really understands popular culture -- who knows a good project when it's presented to him, that -- that captures a certain zeitgeist."" And then there's the music. It, like the singer, oozes old school. ""I will not be the type of artist that puts out 10 to 15 albums,"" Timberlake recently told ""Rolling Stone."" ""That's just not who I am. They're really special to me. I write music all the time, but until you really feel that desperate need to shout from the rooftops and express yourself in that way, I just kind of keep it to myself. I enjoy making music so much that if it doesn't come out, that's OK."" Once Timberlake decided that ""The 20/20 Experience"" was worth sharing with the world, he and close friend and producer Timbaland agreed, he told ""Rolling Stone,"" to make music ""without all the hoopla of, like expectations. Let's just make something that feels genuine ... and ... for me, it's the best stuff I've ever done."" Timberlake from Tennessee . Gospel is in his soul; Elvis is the King. Justin Timberlake is a kid from Memphis, after all. Home was actually north of the big city: Millington, Tennessee. The grandson of a preacher and son of a choir director never passed up a chance to perform. Early videos of young Justin singing in church and in local shows reveal a boy who idolized Presley, and was himself becoming the performer with the something-special swagger. Bob Westbrook, who gave 8-year-old Justin his first real singing lessons, told CNN Timberlake's X factor comes from ""his mannerism and his charisma, his hair, that whole bit, his natural stage feel."" ""People in the music industry always talk about this thing or that thing, but he definitely always had that thing. Always,"" Trace Ayala, his best friend and William Rast business partner, added. The adult Timberlake now jokes about his lack of formal training, but still thinks his sound is from the past, ""Funny enough, I learned how to sing when I was a kid [by] imitating singers ... like Al Green and Don Henley. I was an only child and was obviously really bored, so I would entertain my parents by imitating cartoon voices like Scooby Doo, Boo Boo and others. So, you know that about me now, I guess. I'm killing any cache of cool I've managed to build up over the years,"" he told ""Ask Men."" Ayala believes their hometown informs everything they do. ""Memphis is a very, very, very musical town, everything revolves around music. From the time we were little kids, you'd go to dinner and the bar next door has a live band playing. So I feel like Memphis breeds that, or at least it brings it out in you, you know?"" 'N Sync to Solo . In 1993, Justin was singing, dancing and acting in the Disney Channel's ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" alongside a group who would later become a who's-who of teenage idols, including Ryan Gosling, Cristina Aguilera, J.C. Chasez and future girlfriend Britney Spears. In 2000, 'N Sync's ""No Strings Attached"" was the top-selling album of the year and Justin Timberlake's picture was hanging inside the locker of teenage girls around the world. 'N Sync founding member Chris Kirkpatrick described to CNN what it was like working with him then: ""It's almost like he is a perfectionist, but there's no work involved. You know, it's really just boom, boom, done. It's like, 'There it is.' One take Timberlake.'"" Timberlake's writing skills were getting him noticed by other big acts, too. Michael Jackson wanted ""Gone,"" a JT-penned 'N Sync song from their last album, ""Celebrity,"" Timberlake's manager Johnny Wright told CNN. ""We were at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Michael's people came and they said, 'Hey, you know, I think Michael wants to record that record.' I looked at Justin and I was like, You're not giving that record away, because I knew how important that record was to him and what it meant for him as a writer to finally get songs."" But by 2002, Justin's high-profile relationship with Britney Spears was falling apart and 'N Sync went on hiatus. ""Everybody was kind of figuring out, 'What are we gonna do for the next six months?'"" Wright recalled. ""And then Justin kind of tapped me and said, ""I know what I'm gonna do."" He says, ""I've had this music inside of me for quite a while. I'm gonna take this time and I'm gonna go make a record."" Then Justin launched the solo career that would define his next decade. His debut album ""Justified,"" which spawned hits like ""Rock Your Body,"" ""Cry Me a River,"" and ""Like I Love You,"" soon became hot enough to land him on the biggest stage of all. Super Bowl XXXVIII was broadcast live on February 1, 2004, from Houston on CBS. As ""Billboard""'s Gallo remembers it, ""Justin Timberlake is at the Super Bowl performing with Janet Jackson and he reaches over and he pulls away her top and he has now, apparently, committed the crime of the century."" A swift apology put Justin back on track, and his star continued to rise. His sophomore album, the club-friendly ""Future Sex/LoveSounds"" gave us hits (and new vernacular) like ""Sexy Back"" and ""What Goes Around ... Comes Around"" in 2006. That was the last new music we'd hear from Timberlake until now, but in the meantime, his career would explode from Grammys to Emmys, music to movies, including the Academy Award-nominated ""The Social Network."" He began investing in business ventures that interested him, became a must-see host of ""Saturday Night Live,"" and has shot films with major stars like last year's ""Trouble with Curve"" with Clint Eastwood, and the upcoming Coen Brothers' ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" and ""Runner, Runner"" with Ben Affleck. Then came the last six months. ""Suit & Tie"" A fall wedding in Italy to actress and Hollywood crush Jessica Biel landed Timberlake back on magazine covers and back into water cooler conversation. He followed that up with the new album, released March 19, led by the single ""Suit & Tie,"" featuring Jay-Z. ""The 20/20 Experience,"" which was completed in just four weeks, according to Wright, is currently on pace to sell 850,000 to 900,000 copies in its first week, likely knocking Mumford & Sons' ""Babel"" out of the top-selling slot of the year. On top of that, it was just announced that Timberlake will follow up the soulful album with an additional 10 tracks later this year. An immensely successful ""SNL"" hosting gig preceded a week of instantly viral and hilarious appearances on ""Late Night with Jimmy Fallon."" Not only is Timberlake making what Kirkpatrick refers to as ""grown folks music,"" he's also ""doing a great job at reinventing himself,"" the former bandmate said. ""The one thing I always say about Justin is he always had an eye and an ear for what's next. Not what's cool, but what's next.""","Justin Timberlake is being called a modern-day Bing Crosby.
The multi-talented star delivers not only in music but also in movies and on TV.

"(RollingStone.com) -- Despite Lil Wayne's recent medical scare that dominated music news for days, the visionary rapper is on track to release his new album, ""I Am Not a Human Being II,"" on Tuesday. (And that's despite it having leaked a few days ago to file-sharing sites). According to Cortez Bryant, Lil Wayne's manager and the Chief Visionary Officer of his Young Money label, Wayne's new effort captures him at his career's most vital moment yet. Lil Wayne receives hospital visits from Drake, Nicki Minaj and more . ""It's mixtape Weezy -- straight street bangers you're going to hear in the club,"" Cortez says. ""The sound is more urban, with no R&B hooks, and the wordplay is still incredible and shocking -- every bar has some witty punchline. Wayne really took it back to his roots."" ""It reminds me of the traditional Cash Money sound,"" adds Bryan Williams, Cash Money's co-founder who also rhymes under his Birdman alias. ""He went back to raw rapping and beats with lots of swagger."" Of course, rap's resident alien doesn't exactly do basic: take the Diplo-produced ""Lay It Down,"" featuring Nicki Minaj. ""It's not a normal hip-hop track,"" notes Bryant. ""At first, I thought it was kinda weird -- the beat sounds like it came from outer-space -- but it grew on me, and Nicki killed it."" Lil Wayne, Birdman's daughters writing 'Paparazzi Princesses' novel . Minaj heads up a stellar guest list including Drake, 2 Chainz, Future, Big Sean and Gunplay.

"(CNN) -- Polk County, Florida, detectives arrested a man Tuesday in connection with the slaying of a priest in Mississippi. Jeremy Manieri, 31, was wanted by Waveland, Mississippi, police in connection with the Rev. Edward Everitt's death Sunday, said Donna Wood, a Polk County Sheriff's officer. ""Mr. Manieri was one of the last people ... that we know of to see Father Everitt,"" said Waveland Police Chief James Varnell. ""We believe that his motive is robbery."" Everitt, 70, was found dead Monday in the Dominican Retreat house in Waveland, Varnell said. He presided over the Holy Ghost Catholic Church in Hammond, Louisiana. ""This tragic loss of Father Ed's life leaves a deeply felt void in all our lives,"" said Bishop Robert Muench of Baton Rouge. Everitt was spending a few days of vacation at the Waveland house, which had been rebuilt after Hurricane Katrina, said a statement from the Southern Dominican Province, an order of friars. Everitt and Manieri had met two weeks before the death in Waveland. Everitt was going to hire Manieri to do a construction project there, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said. Judd said police got a ""very detailed confession"" out of Manieri upon his arrest. Sunday, Manieri and Everitt argued in the Waveland house, according to the confession, Judd said. Manieri found a firearm and shot Everitt twice. Manieri took Everitt's wallet and his vehicle, a 2011 silver GMC HHR, then called his ex-wife, Judd said. Manieri told his ex-wife he was working on an oil rig and would take her, her son and his daughter to Disney World in Florida when he got his first paycheck, Judd said. The family left Sunday night after the homicide, stopping in Mobile, Alabama, for one evening. Manieri and the family arrived in Polk County, about an hour southwest of Orlando, early Tuesday and stopped at a Days Inn, Judd said. The family had planned to buy three-day passes to Disney on Tuesday, he said. Police found the suspect by tracking Everitt's stolen vehicle, pinpointing it within 20 minutes via a GPS tracking system. Around 4:30 a.m. Tuesday, the Polk County SWAT team arrested Manieri. ""Quite frankly, he left a trail of evidence that a blind man could've followed,"" Judd said. Varnell said Manieri had a long history with the police department, including a child molestation charge in 2005, which he was convicted of in October 2006. Judd said Manieri was booked in the Polk County Jail for Tuesday night and Waveland police could take Manieri into custody as soon as Wednesday. ""Fr. Ed was a man of great energy, both preaching and caring for others,"" said a statement from the Southern Dominican Province. ""(He) will be profoundly missed by his blood family, his Dominican family and all whom he has served as a Dominican and priest over his many years of ministry."" A mass was held Tuesday in Hammond at 7 p.m. at the Holy Ghost Catholic Church in memory of Everitt. CNN's Rick Martin contributed to this report.","Arrested man is a convicted sex offender, according to police chief .

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Natalia Vodianova is the Russian supermodel and philanthropist described by designer Tom Ford as ""the most beautiful woman in the world."" Natalia Vodianova: ""I think protecting your family and giving to them is the most important achievement."" Natalia, 27, is a mother of three and has set up her own children's charity. The woman nicknamed ""Supernova"" tells My City_My Life about her tough childhood, her love of Moscow and why Russian vodka is the best. CNN: How would you describe Moscow? Natalia Vodianova: It's a city of contrasts. You have this great culture and traditions that are very normal, calm and established. And then you have explosions of emotion, craziness, art, and young people who are so proud to be Muscovites and really trying to be individuals. Moscow is a huge inspiration for me. I love what I find here, I love being here. CNN: What would you change about Moscow given the chance? NV: Definitely the way it's treated at the moment, the way the government wants to renovate the old buildings. To me it's a little bit sad because in the West people have a very different mentality about renovating buildings, keeping them as intact as possible. Watch Natalia Vodianova take CNN on a tour of Moscow. » . CNN: What's the fashion in Moscow? NV: You see women in jeans wearing very high heels and a short puffy jacket. It's really funny! CNN: Tell me about your childhood . NV: I was born in Nizhny Novgorod to a very poor family and unfortunately my father and mother separated when I was very little. She was a single mum and had two more girls. It was a struggle but we all worked really hard and stood up for each other. My mum was amazing; she never drank, she never smoked -- she lived for us. I appreciate what she has done for me and the way she raised me. CNN: Is family very important to you? NV: I think protecting your family and giving to them is so important. It's the most important achievement. CNN: How did your modeling career take off? NV: I went to Paris when I was 17. I was lucky because my career kind of gradually built up over two years -- I always had good work but I wasn't a star straight away. In fact, my agency thought that I might never do shows because I was a bit shorter and not skinny enough, but when I gave birth to my first son I was 19 and I lost a lot of weight. I guess the stress on the body was extreme and I suddenly just turned into this stick -- just the way designers love models. My career took off after Lucas was born because I opened a lot of shows on the runway and that's where a lot of stars are made in my industry. See Natalia Vodianova's Moscow in photos. » . CNN: If you weren't a model, what would your life be like? NV: It's very hard to say what my life would be like if I hadn't gone to Paris. People say I didn't change very much but I don't think that's true. I'm a happy person and even if I thought that I was happy then, I had so much baggage to carry with me: my background, people's expectations, the fact that I wasn't a perfect student and I wasn't going to school all the time -- I didn't live a normal life at all. That's not with me anymore, because of my success. It really doesn't matter because I know I have learned so much more than a lot of other girls who have had perfect childhoods. CNN: Tell us about the charity and what you are trying to achieve with it? NV: I started my foundation in 2005, after the Beslan tragedy [the 2004 school siege in which at least 339 hostages were killed]. I was in Moscow at the  time and it just struck me so much. I went back to New York, where I was living at the time, organized a fundraising event and raised $350,000 to build a playground for the children that had survived in the area. I believe that play is very therapeutic. It's really the only way for these children to forget about what happened and just be children, even if it's only for five minutes. But then I realized that it would be good for all the other children in Russia and I just started raising money and building playgrounds. Now we have 23 places all over Russia and we are building 15 more this year and planning to build more. I want to fulfill my dream of building 500 play parks in Russia. Each one will cost about $300,000 so it's a big dream -- an expensive one! CNN: Let's talk about vodka... NV: Our vodka is definitely the best. It's a very pure, good drink and it goes with Russian food. Generally I don't drink vodka outside Russia, but when you come to Russia there is no reason to order a glass of wine. CNN: What do you think of your nickname -- Supernova? NV: I don't mind being called Supernova. If one nickname is going to stick, that's not a bad one! CNN: Which five words best describe Moscow? NV: It's mysterious, cultural, exciting, crazy and spiritual.","Natalia Vodianova is a Russian supermodel and has started a children's charity .

"(CNN) -- One of the Internet's great promises is that it's the ultimate democratizer. It's open to everyone and allows all people to communicate. Facebook and Google have added new translation tools, but they take different approaches. But, so far, there have been several hitches in that plan. Not everyone has access to a computer and a broadband connection. Some governments still censor the Internet. And of course, we don't all speak the same language. For the World Wide Web to be truly global, shouldn't Chinese speakers be able to chat online with people who only speak Spanish? And why should an English speaker be barred from reading blogs written in Malagasy or Zulu? Facebook Inc. and Google Inc. are two Web companies trying particularly hard to make this happen, and they've released a number of updates to their translation services in recent weeks. The two online giants are going about the process in different ways. Facebook aims to translate the Web using an army of volunteers and some hired professional translators. Meanwhile, Google plans to let computers do most of the work. Which method will ultimately prevail remains to be seen. But for now, here's a look at the latest language features from both companies, and some background on how their translation services work. (Feel free to add your own Internet translation tips -- and fun translation bloopers -- in the comments section at the bottom of the story): . Facebook's human translation . Many tech bloggers think Facebook's method of human translation seems promising. After all, the American-born social networking site introduced non-English languages for the first time only in January 2008. Now about 70 percent of Facebook's 300 million users are outside of the United States. How it works: Real people are at the heart of Facebook translation plan. They suggest translated phrases and vote on translations that others have submitted. These crowd-sourced edits -- which work kind of like Wikipedia -- make Facebook's translation service smarter over time. Go to Facebook's translation page to check it out or to participate. Size: More than 65 languages function on Facebook now, according to Facebook's statistics. At least another 30 languages are in the works, meaning Facebook needs help working out the kinks on those languages before they're put to use. What's new? Facebook announced in a blog post on September 30 that the social network has made its crowd-sourced translation technology available to other sites on the Web. The update allows sites to install a translation gadget on their sites through Facebook Connect, a service that lets Facebook users sign in on other Web pages. Facebook also added some new languages, including Latin and ""Pirate,"" which translates the Facebooky word ""share"" as ""blabber t'yer mates!"" Pros and cons: People are good at knowing idioms and slang, so Facebook tends to get these right, but there are limited numbers of multi-lingual volunteers who want to spend time helping Facebook translate things. Also, Facebook's site is available in many languages, but its human translators don't touch wall posts, photo comments and other user-submitted items, which is a big con if you want to have friends who don't share a common language with you. People who use Facebook Connect to translate their sites can choose which text they want users to help translate, according to Facebook spokeswoman Malorie Lucich. Craig Ulliott, founder of whereivebeen.com, said he's excited about Facebook's translation application, but it would be too much to ask his site's users to translate user-submitted material. Google's 'mechanical' translation . Google uses mathematical equations to try to translate the Web's content. This fits in line with the company's mission, which is to organize the world's information and make it useful and accessible to all. How it works: Google's computers learn how to be translators by examining text that's already on the Web, and from professional Web translations posted online, said Franz Och, a principal scientist at Google. The more text is out there, the more Google learns and the better its translations become. The search-engine company currently translates documents, search results and full Web pages. Size: Google claims to be the largest free language translation service online. It covers 51 languages and more than 2,500 language pairs. The site's interface has been translated, with the help of Google users, into 130 languages. What's new?: Google recently created a widget that any Web developer can put on his or her page to offer up Google translations. So, say you're a blogger who writes about music. You might get some Brazilian readers if you offered up a button to translate your site into Portuguese. Google also recently unveiled a translation service for Google Docs, which lets anyone upload a document to the Web and have it translated into a number of languages for free. And there's a new Firefox add-on from Google to help people translate the Web more quickly. Och said real-time translation of Internet chats is on the horizon, as are more languages and increased quality as Google's computers get smarter. Pros and cons: Google's computerized approach means it can translate tons of content -- and fast. But computers aren't quite up to speed with ever-evolving modern speech, so reports of translation errors are fairly common. On the plus side, the service has been vastly improved in the last five years, Och said. Also, Google lets people spot translation errors, suggest new wordings and translate its interface into languages Google's computers don't speak just yet.","Facebook and Google are finding new ways to translate the Web .

"(CNN) -- Four people, including two children, were killed after a reservoir broke and flooded three villages in western Hungary with toxic red mud, officials said Tuesday. The government has declared a state of emergency in three counties, the State Secretariat of Governmental Communications said. The National Catastrophe Protection Directorate (OKF) said the two children who died were 1 and 3 years old. A 35-year-old man was killed in his car, and a woman was killed in her home, the government said. Rescue workers are looking for seven people who are missing. They have treated at least 116 casualties, including eight people who were seriously injured. Most have been airlifted by helicopter to hospitals in the capital, Budapest. The reservoir burst in the town of Kolontar on Monday afternoon, the government said Tuesday. At least a million cubic meters of red mud have spilled so far, the government said, affecting the villages of Kolontar, Devecser and Somlovasarhely. The toxic sludge -- a waste product from aluminum production -- could potentially endanger two major rivers, the Danube and the Raba, the government said. It has already reached the river Marcal. The Environment and Water Management Center has experts working on preventing the sludge from affecting the Danube and Raba, it said.","NEW: The sludge could potentially reach the Danube river, the government said .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Dr. Conrad Murray, who was Michael Jackson's personal physician, is refusing to testify in the wrongful death lawsuit that the singer's mother filed against concert promoter AEG Live. If called, he will plead the fifth so as not to incriminate himself, the doctor said in a statement sent to the Jackson family. Murray has never been questioned under oath about Jackson's death, which occurred on his watch. He did not testify at his trial, where he was found guilty of causing Jackson's death on June 25, 2009, by administering a deadly overdose of sedatives and the surgical anesthetic propofol in what he told police was an attempt to cure the singer's insomnia. He is serving a four-year sentence but could be out in two. On Monday, he was supposed to be deposed in the wrongful death suit. But lawyers for Jackson's mother, Katherine, and her three children called off their jailhouse visit because Murray swore ""he would not answer any questions at the deposition or the trial,"" Jackson lawyer Kevin Boyle told CNN. He said the Jackson case would not suffer without his testimony. AEG's lawyer suggests the Jacksons canceled Murray's deposition because his testimony would ""destroy"" their case. ""They are not interested in the truth,"" said the lawyer, Marvin Putnam. Asserting his 'Fifth Amendment privilege' The cancellation came after Murray's attorney Valerie Wass sent the Jacksons a sworn statement signed by Murray making it clear he would not answer any questions while his involuntary manslaughter conviction in Michael Jackson's death is being appealed. ""Accordingly, if I am called or ordered to testify at deposition or trial in the Katherine Jackson vs AEG wrongful death case, I will be asserting my Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and refuse to answer any questions,"" Murray's declaration said. Jury selection in the civil trial is set to begin April 2 in a Los Angeles County court. Prince Jackson, the pop star's oldest son, is expected to testify about his father's last days. Jacksons: Focus back on AEG . The Jackson lawsuit contends that AEG Live is responsible for Jackson's death because it hired and supervised Dr. Murray, who was administering the surgical anesthetic propofol to Jackson each night for a month to induce sleep as he prepared for a series of concerts organized by AEG Live. A jury found Dr. Murray guilty of involuntary manslaughter after hearing testimony that he violated medical standards in his treatment of Jackson. ""Dr. Murray's choice to keep quiet puts the focus back on the company, AEG, that hired Dr. Murray and agreed to pay him over $1.5 million a year, and provide Murray with a large house and drivers and other perks, to make sure that the company's biggest asset, Michael Jackson, made it to the shows on time, no matter what,"" Boyle, the Jacksons' lawyer said. A judge ruled last month that Jackson lawyers could question Murray at the Los Angeles County jail, where he is serving his prison sentence. AEG: Testimony destroys Jacksons' claim . ""The Jacksons told the world that they wanted Dr. Murray's deposition, and then when the Court gave it to them, they canceled it,"" Putnam, the AEG lawyer, told CNN on Sunday. ""They have had all of their claims dismissed except negligent hiring, and they don't want Dr. Murray to be deposed because he will tell them what he already told the police: that he worked for Michael Jackson; that Michael Jackson, not AEG, was his employer; and that Michael Jackson personally invited him to join the 'This is It' tour long before anyone at AEG had even heard of him. The Jacksons canceled the deposition because that testimony destroys the only claim they have left. They are not interested in the truth."" Back and forth . The Jacksons' lawyer argued, in response to Putnam's comment, that AEG was not interested in having Murray take the stand in the trial. ""AEG did not even try to get Dr. Murray to talk,"" Boyle said. ""AEG is simply not telling the truth. AEG can't run from the fact that they hired the man who is in jail for killing the greatest entertainer the world has ever known."" Wass, who unsuccessfully objected to the deposition, said she advised Murray to invoke his Fifth Amendment right to not answer questions because of his appeal. The appeal brief is expected to be filed next week. Jacksons plan to use e-mails . Jackson died two weeks before his ""This Is It"" comeback concerts, organized by AEG Live, were to have debuted in London in the summer of 2009. E-mails the Jackson's plan to use in their case suggested that the promoter was worried about Jackson's missed rehearsals and they sought Murray's help in getting him ready. Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson and their grandmother contend that AEG Live's pressure on Murray to have Jackson ready for daily rehearsals despite his fragile health led to his death from the propofol overdose. A cornerstone of the Jacksons' case is an e-mail AEG Live co-CEO Paul Gongaware wrote 11 days before Jackson's death. The e-mail to show director Kenny Ortega addressed concerns that Murray had kept Jackson from a rehearsal the day before: ""We want to remind (Murray) that it is AEG, not MJ, who is paying his salary. We want to remind him what is expected of him."" Jackson lawyers, calling it a ""smoking gun,"" argue the e-mail is evidence that AEG Live used Murray's fear of losing his $150,000-a-month job as Jackson's personal physician to pressure him to have Jackson ready for rehearsals despite his fragile health. Billions at stake . The lawsuit seeks a judgment against AEG Live equal to the money Jackson would have earned over the course of his remaining lifetime if he had not died. If AEG Live is found liable, it could cost the company several billion dollars, according to estimates of Jackson's income potential. AEG Live is a subsidiary of AEG, a global entertainment company that was recently for sale with an $8 billion asking price. The company announced last week it was no longer for sale.","Murray: ""I will be asserting my Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination""

"Steubenville, Ohio (CNN) -- Three teens testified Friday they saw two star Steubenville, Ohio, high school football players accused of rape engage in sexual contact with an allegedly drunk 16-year-old girl. The testimony came during the third day of a trial that has gained national attention over its focus on text messages and cell-phone pictures and videos surrounding the alleged sexual abuse of the girl. Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, are accused of raping the girl during a series of end-of-summer parties in August 2012. One of the witnesses, a 17-year-old, told Judge Thomas Lipps that he used his cell phone to record Mays putting his fingers inside the girl's vagina during a drive from one party to another. The boy said he deleted the video the next morning when he realized it was wrong. Defense lawyers tried to dismantle what prosecutors said was the central argument in the case -- whether the girl was too drunk to understand what was happening to her. The defense challenged whether all three witnesses were reconstructing events from memory or from the text messages and cell phone images. According to prosecutors, Richmond and Mays each penetrated the victim's vagina with their fingers, an act that constitutes rape under Ohio law. Trial focuses on text messages . Mays also is accused of illegal use of a minor in nudity oriented material. Lawyers for the accused teens say the two are innocent. The teen witness, whom CNN is not identifying because of his age, was identified as a friend of Mays and Richmond as well as a Steubenville High School football player and wrestler. The teen also told the court Mays later attempted to have the girl perform a sex act on him in the basement of a home, where they ended up after the initial alleged incident in the car. ""She didn't really respond to it,"" he said. CNN is not naming the girl in line with its policy of not identifying the alleged victims of sexual assault. CNN also is not naming the minors who are testifying but is identifying Mays and Richmond, whose names have been used by court officials and their attorneys and in multiple media accounts. A second witness, 18-year-old Evan Westlake, told the judge he saw Richmond digitally penetrate the girl in the basement of the home where they ended up after the parties. On cross-examination, Richmond's attorney, Walter Madison, challenged whether Westlake's was trying to right a wrong through his testimony. ""I felt a lot of regret, difficult to face my family knowing they knew what I had done,"" Westlake testified. A third witness, 18-year-old Anthony Craig, testified he saw Richmond digitally penetrate the girl in the basement. ""She wasn't moving. She wasn't talking. She wasn't participating,"" he told the court. Craig was identified in as a Steubenville High School wrestler and friend of Mays and Richmond. The teen, who testified the alleged victim was also a friend, admitted to taking a cell phone picture of the girl when she was naked in the basement and then showing it later to friends. Asked why, he responded: ""It was stupid."" The teens testified only after Lipps, who is presiding over the trial without a jury, granted them immunity from prosecution. All three initially attempted to invoke the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination. Teen rape trial shines unwelcome spotlight on Ohio town . The testimony came a day after prosecutors presented text messages they said were between Mays and various people, and the alleged victim. Prosecutors contend the texts between Mays and his friends and classmates on August 12 detail a night of heavy drinking and the sexual abuse of the girl. Some of the messages were between Mays and the alleged victim. In one message she asks what happened ""last night."" ""And don't lie about anything. I need to know the truth. People keep asking. Idk (I don't know) what to say,"" the message said, according to Joann Gibb, a computer forensic investigator with the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation, who read the messages to the court on Thursday. Mays responded that ""nothing happened last night,"" but he told her in the message she performed a sex act on him, Gibb testified. In some of the messages from Mays, according to Gibb, he writes that he had sex with the girl. In others, he says the girl performed a sex act on him. One message asked Mays: "" Did u do it?"" He responded, according to Gibb: ""No, lol. She could barely move."" Still another graphic message from Mays to a friend appeared to detail his anger over being accused of rape. ""I'm pissed all I got was a hand job, though. I should have raped since everyone thinks I did,"" the message said, according to Gibb. The defense questioned the validity of the messages, with Mays' attorney asking computer forensic expert Gibb whether she could be absolutely sure the messages were from his client. ""I can't put a person behind a cell phone,"" she said. Teens treated girl 'like a toy,' prosecutor says . In earlier testimony, teens who attended some of the booze-soaked parties testified the girl appeared to be drunk, stumbling and slurring words. But on cross-examination some said she seemed to be able to walk and answer questions. The trial, which is likely to stretch into the weekend, is moving quickly to accommodate the schedule of the judge. A verdict is expected by Sunday. CNN's Poppy Harlow and Brian Vitagliano reported from Steubenville, Ohio, and Chelsea J. Carter wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Yon Pomrenze and Michael Pearson contributed to this report.","Three witnesses testify they saw the accused sexually abuse the girl .

"(CNN) -- A fugitive accused of stealing $2 million from an armored truck he was driving and killing his partner was caught early Tuesday in Florida, according to the FBI. Kenneth Konias Jr., 22, was arrested in Pompano Beach by the FBI, the Broward Sheriff's Office and a South Florida Violent Crimes Task Force. He had been on the run since the robbery and homicide almost two months ago, according to FBI spokesman John Gillies. Between $1.3 million and $1.5 million was recovered with him, along with two guns, the FBI reported. Konias is believed to have shot his partner, Michael Haines, in the head February 28 before stealing cash from the Garda armored vehicle in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. According to a criminal complaint, a witness heard a gunshot coming from an armored truck carrying deposits about 1 p.m. ET. Surveillance video shows the vehicle in the parking lot where the shot was heard. The truck was later discovered under a Pittsburgh bridge by the company's employees and two detectives. Haines was dead inside the vehicle, authorities said. Last month, Pittsburgh police discovered about $24,000 at Konias' grandmother's grave site and more than $200,000 at his parents' home. Konias is accused of criminal homicide, theft of the victim's gun and robbery of the cash inside the armored vehicle.","NEW: Between $1.3 and $1.5 million was recovered with him, the FBI reported .

"Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN) -- As a military parade that is billed as the largest in Pyongyang's history began Sunday morning, North Korea's increasingly reclusive leader, Kim Jong Il, made a rare public appearance with his youngest son, Kim Jong Un. Video from the event showed thousands of military personnel who'd been silent a moment earlier erupt into applause and chanting as the Kims appeared in the capital to start the parade. The event featured 20,000 military personnel marching in lockstep and huge pieces of military hardware -- including many tanks and missiles -- rolling along the parade route as part of North Korea's celebration marking the anniversary of the country's Peoples' Workers Party. ""It's an annual holiday, but in effect this is an elaborate coming out party for the man who will be the next leader,"" said CNN's Alina Cho, reporting from the parade, referring to Kim's youngest son. The parade began in the Kim Il Sung Square, named for Kim Jong Il's father, North Korea's founder. The United States believes that Kim Jong Un has been tapped to replace his ailing father as North Korea's leader. Little is known about Kim Jong Un. He is thought to be 27 or 28 and was schooled abroad, believed to be capable of speaking some English and German and possibly some French. He is said to have a fondness for Michael Jordan and James Bond. In a move that surprised North Korea observers, Kim Jong Un appeared to be wearing civilian clothes instead of his military uniform and medals on Sunday, even though he had been named a four-star general last month. ""This is ... Kim Jong Il trying to make sure that senior military officers are not offended by someone who just got his start,"" said Gordon Chang, a North Korean expert and columnist for Forbes.com. ""It shows he needs to massage this process."" In a rare embrace of the media, Pyongyang invited around 60 journalists from around the world to cover the weekend's festivities, Cho said. ""We were quite hastily invited at the middle of last week,"" she said. ""We knew something big was happening but we weren't entirely sure what."" Cho said that security is tight for the celebrations and that even the news media's government minders are being checked by security personnel -- along with Cho's notebook and pen. Sunday's parade encompassed units of the three services of the Korean People's Army -- the Korean People's Internal Security Forces, the Worker-Peasant Red Guards and the Young Red Guards -- according to North Korea's state-run KCNA news agency. On Saturday, Kim and his heir apparent appeared at Pyongyang's May Day Stadium as part of the Arirang celebration, which this year marks the the 65th anniversary of the Peoples' Workers Party. The event featured hundreds of gymnastics and dance performances. Participants spend up to eight hours a day training and preparing for the occasion. Video of the event showed performers dancing enthusiastically for the crowd in the packed stadium. Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un could be seen sitting in a private box removed from the masses, flanked by military officials. Electricity was on throughout Pyongyang on Saturday, Cho said, an unusual occurrence in power-starved North Korea. The spare-no-expense celebration will likely be frowned upon by many ordinary North Koreans, Chang said. ""With the North Korean economy trending downwards, with poverty and destitution, there's got be the question of the nature of the regime,"" he said. ""They're going to look at this and say, 'Why don't I have clean water? Why don't I have food? How can they afford all of this?'"" Chinese President Hu Jintao sent Kim Jong Il a congratulatory message Saturday, commending the Peoples' Workers Party for ""overcoming difficulties and risks and arduously struggling to continuously make eye-catching achievements in its socialist revolution and construction cause,"" China's state-run Xinhua news agency quoted Hu as saying. Hu also praised the relationship between North Korea and China, and pledged to make ""it an unswerving policy to continuously strengthen and develop bilateral friendly and cooperative ties."" Kim also received messages of support from the party itself. The Peoples' Workers Party, along with other government entities, praised the party's creation saying it ""has ushered in the greatest heyday in its development, a period of great prosperity in the era of the WPK, demonstrating its invincible might under Kim Jong Il's experienced and tested guidance,"" according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Mileidy Ramayo hasn't seen her father since he left Cuba on a raft but is hoping the loosening of travel restrictions might help bring that reunion closer to taking place. ""I haven't seen my father since 1994. It would change my life to be able to see him and give him a hug,"" Ramayo said. On Monday, Cubans will no longer need an exit permit and a letter of invitation from someone in another country to travel abroad. Shortly after Fidel Castro took power in 1959, stringent travel laws were put in place to stem an exodus from Cuba. Now Cubans will require only a passport to travel internationally and can stay abroad for two years -- more than twice as long as the previous restriction -- without losing their property or ability to return to the island. Doctors and other professionals who the government said owed Cuban society for their training will also be able to take advantage of the looser restrictions. Also for the first time, Cubans will be able to travel abroad with their young children. But officials have said military officials, who might possess government secrets, and sports stars, who could earn a fortune overseas compared with their salaries in Cuba, will still face added restrictions. It was unclear whether members of dissident organizations, long prevented from receiving honors and awards abroad, would also be able to travel with greater freedom. ""If you remove the exit permit but you require Cuban citizens to revalidate their passports, the question is: Will everyone get a passport back and therefore be free to travel, or will there still be controls?"" U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Roberta Jacobson said in October after the new travel policies were announced. On Friday, a State Department spokeswoman said in a statement that the United States was working to address any increase in the number of Cubans seeking visas to come to the United States. U.S. officials have said that at least for the time being, the Cuban Adjustment Act, or ""wet foot, dry foot,"" will remain in place. The act allows Cubans who arrive on U.S. soil to remain in the country. With the loosening of travel restrictions, Cubans officials again called for an end to the policy. Waiting in a line to apply for a passport, Ramayo said she hoped that she would soon be able to travel abroad and be reunited with her family. But she conceded she still needed to find a country that would give her a visa and be able to pay for a plane ticket. Still, Ramayo said, she dreamed of seeing the world beyond Cuba's shores and then returning home. ""It's what everyone wants,"" she said. ""To be a normal country and be like all the people who can just buy a ticket and come to Cuba. That we could go other places too.""

"(CNN) -- The pastor of a Maryville, Illinois, church was shot to death during a service Sunday in front of horrified church members who then tackled the gunman, state police said. The Web site for the First Baptist Church of Maryville, Illinois, includes a photo of the Rev. Fred Winters. Fred Winters, the pastor of the First Baptist Church, was shot and killed during the 8 a.m. service, and the attacker and two church members suffered knife wounds in the attack, authorities said. The gunman entered during the service and walked up to the pulpit. Winters and the gunman apparently exchanged words before the 27-year-old man fired four shots, hitting the pastor's Bible and then the pastor, said Illinois State Police Director Larry Trent. ""The only thing we know is that the suspect said something to the pastor, and the pastor said something back to him -- we don't know what that was,"" Trent told reporters Sunday afternoon. ""It was almost as if the pastor may have recognized him, but we're not sure about that at all."" The gunman's .45-caliber pistol jammed after he shot Winters, Trent said. The man then pulled out a knife before being tackled by some of about 150 worshippers attending the service in southern Illinois, near St. Louis, Missouri.  Watch the aftermath of the church shooting » . Earlier reports from authorities said the man may have turned the knife on himself, but Trent said that was not confirmed. ""When he was tackled by two of the members, we don't know whether he fell on the knife, injuring himself at the time, or whether [his injury] was self-inflicted during the struggle,"" Trent said. Two of those who went after the attacker suffered injuries that aren't life-threatening, while the suspect's injuries are ""very serious,"" Illinois state police spokesman Ralph Timmins said. Witness Claudia Bohley told CNN affiliate KSDK-TV in St. Louis that she was in the church's foyer waiting for the service to begin when she heard ""pop, pop, pop. ... We just couldn't imagine what had happened."" She said she ran into the sanctuary and saw what looked like paper scattered on the pulpit. She said she was later told that a bullet hit Winters' Bible. ""It was like confetti. It went everywhere,"" she said. ""People were down on their knees and on the floor, screaming and praying."" She described Winters -- who is pictured on the church's Web site along with his wife and two children -- as ""such a pleasant pastor."" Trent said police are still trying to determine a motive in the shooting and that church members did not recognize the gunman. St. Louis University Hospital spokeswoman Laura Keller told CNN three males, including the suspect, were brought to the hospital. One was dead on arrival, she said, but the hospital was not releasing names and ages. She said the second was in an operating room and the third was the suspect, whose condition was not immediately available. Trent said one of two wounded church members was treated and released. Trent called the actions of the two wounded church members ""heroic,"" saying they took quick action when others ""were understandably stuck to their seats."" Phone calls to the church office went unanswered Sunday. A posting on the church's Web site said a prayer vigil would be held at 6 p.m. at Metro Community Church in Edwardsville, Illinois, about six miles north of Maryville. First Baptist Church is fairly large, with about 1,000 members, KSDK reported. The church holds four Sunday services. Timmins said many of the people attending the service remained for hours afterward, as police were conducting interviews. The Illinois shooting is believed to be the nation's first in a church since July, when a 58-year-old man opened fire in a Knoxville, Tennessee, church during a children's play. Two people were killed and six wounded in that shooting at Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church. In the Tennessee case, Jim Adkisson told police he targeted the church because of its ""liberal teachings,"" according to court papers. Adkisson pleaded guilty last month in a deal that allowed him to avoid the death penalty and will face life in prison without parole, court officials said. Police said the Maryville congregation had a plan in place, including a protocol for lockdown, in the event of an incident such as Sunday's attack.","Church members tackle gunman after shooting, police say .

"(CNN) -- South African track star Oscar Pistorius, charged with murdering girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, has applied for more lenient bail restrictions, including permission to travel overseas, a family spokesman said Monday. Pistorius also is trying to sell some assets to settle legal bills, spokesman Johan van Wyk told CNN. His Pretoria home and his racehorses are among the items Pistorius is trying to sell, according to his family. But the sprinter's family denied BBC reports Monday that he's suicidal as he awaits trial in what prosecutors say was the premeditated death of Steenkamp. Pistorius acknowledges killing her, but says it was an accident. Former Pistorius detective, off police force . The BBC3 report is based on statements from a man the network described as a close family friend who called Pistorius a ""broken man."" ""I would go as far to say that he could be on the verge of suicide,"" the network quoted Mike Azzie as saying for an upcoming BBC documentary. Pistorius repeatedly broke down and sobbed during a bail hearing last month, and the runner's uncle, Arnold Pistorius, acknowledged in a statement that his nephew ""will never be the same"" after killing Steenkamp. But the uncle said he's far from suicidal. ""Oscar, broken as he currently is, believes he has a purpose in life and is working towards that. Media reports to the contrary are untrue,"" Arnold Pistorius said. Not everyone surprised at Oscar Pistorius' fall from grace . Authorities charged Pistorius with premeditated murder last month after he shot Steenkamp in his Pretoria home on February 14. The Olympic and Paralympic sprinter, known as the ""Blade Runner"" for competing on carbon fiber blades fitted to the stumps of his amputated legs, said he thought Steenkamp was an intruder. Prosecutors argue he intentionally killed her after a loud argument. A judge ordered Pistorius released on bail last month. Among the bail conditions: He cannot return to the home where the shooting happened, had to give up his passport, cannot go near an airport and cannot drink alcohol.

"Washington (CNN) -- Reliability -- that was the watchword for President George W. Bush when it came to legacy-making choices for the Supreme Court. Reliability in both the person he wanted for the high court, and in the selection process itself. The former president's new memoir reveals a measure of success and uncertainty along the way during six crucial months in 2005. In ""Decision Points,"" Bush offers a behind-the scenes look of his successful nominations of John Roberts and Samuel Alito to the high court. Both men have lived up to White House expectations after five years on the bench, becoming influential conservatives. But there is bitterness, too, over how his pick of close aide and friend Harriet Miers failed so spectacularly, which he blamed not so much on himself, but on those from the left and right. ""While I know Harriet would have made a fine justice, I didn't think enough about how the selection would be perceived by others,"" the former president writes. ""I put my friend in an impossible situation. If I had to do it over again, I would not have thrown Harriet to the wolves of Washington."" I covered the Bush judicial nominations, and much of what Bush reveals now was what I had learned at the time from my sources. I knew that early in his presidency he had laid out a simple set of criteria for who he wanted for the federal bench, creating a disciplined, thorough vetting process to assure ""reliable"" conservatives would be chosen. Bush wanted a short list of high-court candidates ready to go. That list would include ""women, minorities, and people with no political litmus test,"" Bush wrote. ""The only tests in my mind were personal integrity, intellectual ability, and judicial restraint."" While there was some diversity, most of those eventually tapped for the courts were white males, including the two Supreme Court justices. The president most of all sought someone who would stay conservative for perhaps decades on the court-- no ""surprises"" as Bush's father had learned. ""I knew how proud Dad was to have appointed [Justice] Clarence Thomas, a wise, principled, humane man. I also knew he was disappointed that his other nominee, [Justice] David Souter had evolved into a different kind of judge than he had expected,"" Bush writes, referring to his father, former President George H.W. Bush. The moderate-liberal Souter retired in 2009. As far back as the Reagan years, right-leaning legal activists had sought to transform the courts away from what they called the ""excesses"" of a liberal legacy championed by former Chief Justice Earl Warren. From watershed rulings on abortion, criminal rights, and church-state disputes, frustrated conservatives knew the impact life-tenured federal judges would have on hot-button social issues. Republican insiders were always seeking to identify bright, young, up-and-coming lawyers to hopefully one day transform the courts.. One such person was John Roberts, who had served in the Reagan and senior Bush administrations. He was a well-paid Washington appellate attorney when he played a low-key but crucial role defending the younger Bush in court during the 2000 Florida ballot recount. The White House remembered, and groomed him for a potential seat on the high court by first naming him in 2003 to a prestigious federal appeals court. Washington was abuzz in the early summer of 2005, anticipating a high court vacancy after 11 years of stability. Then-President Bush and others assumed Chief Justice William Rehnquist -- suffering from thyroid cancer -- would step down, but Bush reveals in his book that Miers, then the White House counsel, had called him the morning of July 1 with a surprise. ""It's [Sandra Day] O'Connor,"" Bush writes that Miers told him. The pioneering first woman on the Supreme Court was leaving after nearly a quarter-century. Roberts was one of five finalists -- all federal appeals-court judges -- personally interviewed by Bush in subsequent weeks, but he was not the unanimous choice of the president's top-level staff. Miers liked Samuel Alito. Vice President Dick Cheney and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales wanted Texan Michael Luttig. But political adviser Karl Rove and Chief of Staff Andrew Card preferred Roberts. The 50-year-old Indiana native impressed the president. ""His command of the law was obvious, as was his character,"" writes Bush, ""a gentle man with a gentle soul."" Based on what my administration sources were telling me, and what I knew of Roberts, I had predicted Bush would ultimately choose him. Bush revealed now what my sources back then had said would be a key criteria, beyond the resume and conservative credentials: ""I wanted to read the person,"" face-to-face, he writes. ""I went into the interviews hoping one person would stand apart."" His gut told Bush that Roberts would be a reliable conservative judge -- and more. ""The tie breaker question,"" writes Bush was which man would be the most effective leader on the court."" Note that Bush wrote ""man,"" and while one woman was among the finalists, Judge Edith Brown Clement was never seriously considered, my administration sources told me. In retrospect, the decision was not a hard one. The difficult part for the president was at the prime-time announcement ceremony, where Roberts, his wife, and two young children gathered at the White House. Young Jack Roberts started dancing around the East Room -- he was imitating Spider Man, it was later revealed -- while Bush was speaking. ""I saw him out of the corner of my eye, and it took all my concentration to continue my remarks,"" Bush writes. Barely six weeks later, high drama. Rehnquist suddenly died during the Labor Day weekend, and now there were two immediate Supreme Court vacancies. Roberts' confirmation hearings were about to start, and the Bush team acted fast. A day after the chief justice's funeral, they tapped Roberts for the top spot, and now had to refill the O'Connor seat. This time, Bush said he was determined to change course -- name a woman and perhaps someone with no judicial experience. ""I didn't like the idea of the Supreme Court having only one woman, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"" he says in his book. His wife Laura ""agreed -- and shared her views with the press."" Miers fit the bill, but was ""shocked"" when the president asked her to be his nominee. One new tidbit revealed in the memoir was that the other top candidate besides Miers -- Priscilla Owen, like Bush a Texas native whom he had named early in his presidency to a federal appeals court seat. Bush now admits strong, discreet pushback to Miers from his own staff. Some ""argued that it was too risky to pick someone with no established record on the bench, or that we would be accused of cronyism. Several told me bluntly that she was not the right choice."" The president again went with his gut, but claiming none of his advisers ""told me to expect the firestorm of criticism we received from our supporters."" That hostile reaction from the right clearly irks the president to this day. He writes about the ""unspoken"" elitist arguments against Miers, also a fellow Texan who had not gone to an Ivy League law school. ""She is not glib. She is not fancy,"" writes Bush of Miers, singling out traits he seemed to appreciate. My sources at the time said Bush was not looking for outspoken, abrasive, or egotistical judges. Low-key, friendly, loyal were qualities he zeroed in on, along with a fierce intellect and proven conservative credentials. He found that in the personalities and paper trails of Roberts, Miers to a limited extent, and later Alito. ""I had to get the next pick,"" writes Bush. ""While the idea of selecting a woman appealed to me, I could not find any as qualified as Sam Alito,"" the candidate Miers herself had earlier championed. The former president recalls his initial July meeting with Alito, in which the New Jersey native ""seemed ill at ease."" Bush says he broke the ice by talking about a shared passion -- baseball. Alito is a huge Philadelphia Phillies fan. He is also, as Bush writes, ""as reserved as they come."" Alito survived a tough Senate confirmation, which Bush labels as ""nasty... I was disgusted by the demagoguery."" At the January 2006 White House swearing-in, the former president writes, ""I had a moment alone with Sam. I thanked him for enduring the hearings and wished him well on the court. Then I said,' Sam, you ought to thank Harriet Miers for making this possible.' He replied, 'Mr. President, you're exactly right.'"" Despite the still puzzling Miers misstep, Bush clearly believes he hit home runs with Roberts and Alito. For those nominees, the disciplined vetting process went exactly as the White House hoped, and the two have certainly re-energized the conservative majority on the court to this day. One final note: Bush's memoir reveals little about his thoughts on the 2000 post-election fight, and the high court's crucial role in stopping the recount, in essence handing him the presidency. He defends his strategic decision to have the justices ultimately decide whether the vote-counting should continue in contested Florida precincts. ""I was prepared to accept my fate"" with the high court, Bush writes, ""The country needed closure, one way or the other.""","Former President Bush writes about his Supreme Court picks in his memoir .

"(CNN) -- All four airmen on board an Air Force C-17 were killed when the cargo plane crashed during a training mission near Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska on Wednesday, the Air Force reported Thursday. John Pennell, a spokesman for Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, said the names were being withheld pending notification of relatives. He said the names might be released Friday. The aircraft, assigned to the 3rd Wing at the base, crashed about 6:14 p.m. local time, Air Force Capt. Uriah Orland said. Air Force Lt. Gen. Dana Atkins confirmed that the C-17 was a part of a demonstration practice for the 2010 Arctic Thunder air show this weekend. No decision has been made regarding whether the air show will continue as scheduled. In a statement Thursday, 3rd Wing commander Col. John McMullen said, ""Our deepest sympathy and sincerest condolences go out to the family and friends of those airmen killed in this crash. Yesterday, we lost four members of our Arctic Warrior family and it's a loss felt across our entire joint installation. Right now, our immediate focus is on providing all possible support to the loved ones of our fallen aviators. We are also engaged in a deliberate investigative process."" Witnesses say they saw the aircraft flying low over the hillside followed by a giant plume of smoke. Gov. Sean Parnell issued a statement expressing his sympathy for the crash victims. ""Alaskans are very connected to the military and our thoughts and prayers are with Alaska's Air Force family,"" Parnell said. A stress management team was dispatched to the base to help anyone who may have suffered trauma as a result of the crash. A board of officers will investigate the accident, Orland said. Pennell said he expects a lengthy investigation. ""We've got a bunch of investigators that are combing the accident site,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Barely after dawn, the crack of a bat breaks the early morning silence in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Nestled in the valley, this small town is the home of the Little League Baseball World Series. Every August, tens of thousands of fans pack the stands to cheer on teams from across the United States and around the world - each hoping to be crowned World Series champion, the pinnacle of youth baseball. Read related: Uganda's baseball little league hits a home run . But long before the crowds arrive, one team is already hard at work in the batting cages. Down the hill, in the shadow of the empty stadium, they hit pitch after pitch. Working hard is nothing new for these young players -- they've already had to overcome more obstacles than most to get here, both on and off the baseball field. Read related: Uganda youth baseball team denied U.S. visas over age discrepancies . This is the team from Lugazi, Uganda, and in the 66-year history of the Little League World Series, they are the first team to represent Africa. Lugazi, located 50 kilometers from the country's capital of Kampala, exists primarily because of a sugar-producing factory run by the Mehta Group. It employs a majority of the town, including the coach of this team -- Henry Odong. Odong is one of Uganda's original baseball players, a rarity in this football-crazed country. He shares the dream of his young players -- to some day get a Ugandan player into the Major Leagues. Read related: Ugandan gold medal winner gets $80,000 check, hero's welcome . ""I think getting here to the kids is a great motivator because I tell them I'm trying my level best to produce you guys to get to Major League Baseball,"" Odong said. ""It's all a matter of them working very hard and trying their level best to put things right, and I hope the rest of the world will get to know that you play baseball."" But Odong's group of 11-year-olds from Lugazi should actually be the second team to make the Little League World Series. Last year, a different team from Uganda's capital of Kampala won the Middle East-Africa regional tournament, held each year in Poland. Winning the tournament earned them the right to come to Williamsport, but an issue with documentation prevented the team from getting visas to the U.S., and so they never made it. Read related: Why African designers are finally in the fashion spotlight . But what happened last year opened the door for this year's team when Lugazi won in Poland. A joint effort by the team's coaches, the U.S. Embassy, and Little League helped ensure they would not be denied. And so, they became the first team to represent Africa in Williamsport. While Uganda's documentation issues are far from solved, this has been an important first step. ""We feel very, very good. We would be the second [team], but last year, I don't know what happened but they didn't get to come,"" said shortstop Tonny Okello. ""So we got the chance to come represent Africa for the first time."" For Okello and the rest of these young boys, baseball is so much more than just a game. It helps them forget -- even just for a few hours -- the hardships of home. It is especially true for Okello. His mother is suffering from breast cancer. ""Baseball, other sports, it helps me to forget some of the problems there at home,"" Okello said. ""I just sit there and start thinking of my mother because she's sick with cancer. I know she's having a hard time...but she doesn't make it look that hard."" Read related: Pop-top purses helping Ugandan women start over . None of the family members from Lugazi were able to afford the trip, but Uganda still received the loudest cheer of all when they were announced at the opening ceremonies. Throughout the tournament, fans were seen wearing Uganda shirts and hats, and constantly asking the team for photos and autographs. After a week in Williamsport, the night of Uganda's first game finally arrived. Their opponent was Panama, winners of the Latin America regional. Panama has sent 7 teams to the Little League World Series, but that didn't intimidate the first-timers from Lugazi. Their very first batter, Justine Makisimu, dug in at the plate, and got a hit on the first pitch he saw. Uganda ended up losing the game -- and the next one -- so they were eliminated from the tournament. But they did win a consolation game against the U.S. team from Oregon, earning the African continent its first-ever win at the World Series. But wins and losses weren't the focus here. What these kids accomplished extended far beyond the ball field -- an accomplishment not lost on them. ""I like history,"" 11-year-old third baseman Ronald Olaa said. ""And we've made history.""","Lugazi team became the first team to represent Africa in the Little League World Series .

"(CNN) -- Texas Gov. Rick Perry found himself standing apart from his GOP rivals on a pair of immigration issues during a CNN/Tea Party Debate in Tampa, Florida, Monday night. Sounding more like a previous Texas governor who brought ""compassionate conservatism"" to the White House, Perry staunchly defended legislation he signed that aids the children of illegal immigrants even as the audience at the debate roundly disagreed. The Texas governor was asked about a measure he approved in 2001 that grants in-state tuition rates and financial aid to the children of illegal immigrants. ""The bottom line is it doesn't make any difference what the sound of your last name is. That is the American way,"" Perry said. ""I'm proud that we are having those individuals be contributing members of our society rather than telling them, you go be on the government dole."" Several people in the audience of tea party activists booed Perry's support of that policy, which is anathema to hard-line conservatives. They argue it provides an incentive for immigrants to enter the country illegally. Perry said he did not favor amnesty for illegal immigrants. ""The American way is not to give taxpayer subsidized benefits to people who have broken our laws or who are here in the United States illegally,"" said Rep. Michele Bachmann, who used the opportunity to tout her conservative credentials.  Perry has overshadowed her campaign since entering the race last month . Perry also made waves when he said the key to securing the border would be to deploy enough ""boots on the ground,"" which he contended the federal government had failed to do. Several of his opponents disagreed, arguing that the correct approach to tamp down illegal immigration would be to build a border fence between the United States and Mexico. Perry has called the notion -- especially in rural areas -- ""preposterous"" and, at the debate, asserted his authority as the candidate with the most experience dealing with border security and immigration issues. On both issues, the governor is out-of-step with much of the conservative wing of the Republican party.  How much it may hurt him during the primary process is unclear. As the governor of a state with a large Hispanic population, Perry's ""reasonably moderate"" approach to immigration policy is simple pragmatism, said James Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin. ""I don't think anyone's going to walk around and say Rick Perry's pro-immigrant, but he's been a moderate on the issue for strategic reasons,"" Henson said. ""He's had to manage a different political environment than many of his opponents."" Latinos make up almost 40 percent of the population in Texas, and Perry carried 38 percent of their vote in his gubernatorial contest against Democrat Bill White in 2010. In addition, business owners in the state benefit from a large immigrant labor force and cross-border commerce with Mexico, Henson said. The in-state tuition measure was not the governor's only gesture toward Latinos. Last year, Perry opposed Arizona's tough immigration law, SB 1070, which orders immigrants to carry registration documents at all times and requires police to question individuals who they suspect may be in the United States illegally. But he also moved to appeal to conservatives on the contentious issue. Earlier this year, the governor supported a bill to ban ""sanctuary cities"" in the state. The legislation would have punished cities that shielded criminal suspects from having to answer questions about their immigration status. Though it initially received enthusiastic Republican support, the bill did not pass. As the GOP presidential primary race continues, some candidates may choose to focus their attacks on Perry's perceived softness on illegal immigration. Henson believes Perry is conservative enough on other key issues to weather attacks from his rivals on immigration. ""It's one of the areas where he doesn't fit into the conservative mold,"" Henson said. ""[But] I'd be surprised if the dynamic of this race turned around immigration.""","Immigration issues separate Gov. Rick Perry from his rivals .
He supports in-state tuition for the children of illegal immigrants .
His stance drew boos from the conservative tea party debate crowd .

"(CNN) -- Seventy-five years later, the innovation and courage of those who designed and built the Golden Gate Bridge shine as brightly as the span's orange towers. The suspension bridge connecting San Francisco and Marin County opened to vehicles on May 28, 1937, a little more than four years after construction began. A daylong celebration Sunday will include music, vintage cars, a watercraft parade and technology demonstrations. The events will be capped by a spectacular fireworks display showcasing the bridge and surrounding parkland. A dedication Friday of new visitor facilities and services paid tribute to the audacity that created the bridge and the 11 men who died during its construction. ""Built in the midst of the Great Depression, this bridge is a reminder, no matter what the daunting challenge and overwhelming obstacles, America always invests in big and bold endeavors."" said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-California. The bridge is named for the Golden Gate Strait, a symbol of hope for immigrants and safety for troops returning from war, Pelosi said. Sunday's activities will be centered at Crissy Field and Marina Green, along the northern waterfront of San Francisco. The bridge was made for superlatives and wow-inducing numbers, as provided by the Golden Gate Bridge Highway & Transportation District: . -- Each tower has approximately 600,000 rivets. -- The 4,200-foot suspension span was the longest in the world until New York's Verrazano-Narrows Bridge opened in 1964. -- Painting is an ongoing task, because it protects the bridge from high salt content in the air, which corrodes steel components. -- The bridge has been closed three times because of weather. What's the chance of signature Golden Gate fog during Sunday's festival? National Weather Service meteorologist Steve Anderson said there will be low clouds in the morning, partly cloudy skies in the afternoon and a mostly clear outlook for the evening. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge opened in May 1937 .

"(CNN) -- Some travelers wondered Friday whether they should be concerned about Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner after a string of recent mechanical and other problems prompted a wave of negative publicity and an unusual federal safety review. Troubles dating back just four months include reports of an oil leak, a fuel leak, engine cracks and a damaged cockpit window. This all follows a very difficult development history that included a series of production setbacks and other delays before the plane entered service in 2011. The Federal Aviation Administration, which is responsible for air safety, launched a comprehensive examination on Friday of the Dreamliner's design as well as its manufacture and assembly. The electrical system is of particular interest to authorities following a fire this week aboard an empty 787 in Boston. Atlanta-based businessman Bobby Burns said he'll choose not to fly on the aircraft anytime soon. ""I am wary of a plane model that has fire problems and leaks fuel,"" said Burns, a project manager who takes more than 50 trips a year. ""I think of it the same as a new car model: wait a year or two to get all the 'recalls' sorted out."" On the other hand, travel industry leaders report passengers seem to be taking things in stride. Jay Johnson, president of Coastline Travel Advisors in Garden Grove, California, said not one client has called with concerns about 787 safety issues. David Holyoke, president of Travel Leaders Corporate, echoed a similar conclusion. ""No one is steering clear of it at this point. No clients have called and asked to be rebooked."" Jim Osborne, who helps run a network of high-end travel agencies, says he has ""zero trepidation about flying on this plane."" In fact, he said many clients have shifted their travel plans specifically so they can experience flying on the Dreamliner wide body. More than 150 Dreamliner flights occur daily, according to Boeing. United Airlines -- which has six 787s -- debuted the nation's first domestic Dreamliner routes last November with much fanfare. ""We continue to have complete confidence in the 787 and the ability of Boeing,"" United said Friday in a statement. The airline described the problems as ""early operational issues."" United's Dreamliner fleet travels routes primarily linking Houston and Chicago and between Newark and Los Angeles. Last week, the airline kicked off its first international 787 service between Los Angeles and Tokyo. Other U.S. carriers are in line to buy Dreamliners, including Delta. American Airlines has announced an order, but it's not yet ""firm."" Worldwide, Boeing has delivered 50 Dreamliners. Several hundred are under order, making its success crucial for Boeing, which had not designed a new commercial jetliner in years before unveiling the Dreamliner. The FAA review is ""very unusual"" because the agency signed off on the aircraft's safety before it could fly commercially, said John Goglia, a former member of the National Transportation Safety Board. The safety board is the leading authority in the United States on aircraft safety investigations and is looking into the Boston fire, which preliminarily has been linked to a auxiliary battery system. The FAA ""just certified the airplane, so they're going to go back and redo it."" Does the FAA ""not trust"" their ""own people?"" asked Goglia, who's also a former airline mechanic. Kevin Hiatt, president and CEO of the Flight Safety Foundation, says the situation speaks to what's going on inside the FAA itself. ""We hope they take a look at their own processes internally to make sure that they're up to date and on par with this new technologically advanced aircraft."" The twin-engine jetliner is heralded for its mostly carbon fiber construction, which reduces weight. Its fuel saving possibilities, cutting edge technology, operational versatility and cabin appointments generated enormous interest from airlines, initially overseas. Top Boeing, Transportation Department and FAA officials said at a news conference on Friday announcing the federal safety review that it was important to maintain public confidence in the Dreamliner. ""There is a continued process that we always go through. So this is not unprecedented,"" said FAA chief Michael Huerta. But at Reagan National Airport on Friday, some passengers expressed skepticism in general about the nation's airline regulatory safety net. ""As a regulatory attorney, I know that regulatory agencies in this country don't always do their job all that efficiently,"" said Jonathan Weinrieb of Chevy Chase, Maryland. ""So do I trust them to make sure the Dreamliner is safe? No. But will that stop me from flying if that's the plane I've got to get on to get where I'm going? No."" Another traveler said his confidence in the system was high. ""They'll figure it out and get it all squared away,"" said Ridgely Albaugh of Lower Marlboro, Maryland. Goglia said every new airplane is going have ""teething problems."" The manufacturers usually ""get a handle on it quickly and fix it,"" he said. A week Boeing would like to forget . The most recent Dreamliner setbacks occurred Friday. Oil was discovered leaking from a generator on an engine at a Japanese airport, and a crack appeared in a cockpit window of a plane en route from Tokyo to western Japan, a spokeswoman for All Nippon Airways said. ANA was the Dreamliner's launch, or first customer. On Tuesday, a Japan Airlines flight bound for Tokyo aborted takeoff from Boston's Logan International Airport after a pilot on another airplane spotted the 787 leaking fuel. On Monday, a maintenance worker discovered the electrical fire aboard an empty plane being prepared at a gate at Logan for a return trip to Japan. In December, a United Airlines 787 traveling from Houston to Newark, New Jersey, was diverted to New Orleans because of mechanical problems. A general inspection of all 787s in September turned up cracked engines on two planes. The cracked window and the leaky generator were not unusual issues, ANA said, and occur with other aircraft as well. This was the third time that a window cracked on an ANA Dreamliner, but the cockpit window has five layers, and Friday's crack, in a spider web pattern, appeared in the outer layer, ANA said. It did not endanger the flight. Dreamliner's growing pains not unusual for new airplanes, experts say . Newer airplanes are safer than ever, Goglia said. ""We are flying more airplanes that have been engineered to be safer,"" he said. ""We almost (never) have material failures in airplanes anymore."" The Airbus A380 also had problems when it started flying in 2007, but aviation expert Janet Bednarek loves to fly on it. ""It had cracks in the wing, which would be much more concerning to me"" than the 787 reports, said Bednarek, a University of Dayton aviation history professor. ""They figured it out. Pilots want to get to their destination alive as much as anybody, so they don't mess around."" Like the 787, the Boeing 747 had a lot of issues when it started flying in 1970, aviation consultant Michael Boyd said. And as with the former model, Boeing will work through the current aircraft's issues and move on, the company has said. Two problems, two planes, two days . ""Just like with anything that's new, they kind of have to get the kinks out of it,"" said airline passenger Ronald Hobby, of Fort Washington, Maryland. ""So I would probably wait for a while until they get everything straight before I would fly."" CNN's Mike Ahlers, Junko Ogura, Ben Brumfield, Katia Hetter, Marnie Hunter, Jim Barnett and Todd Sperry contributed to this report.","NEW: Some fliers will wait before flying Dreamliner; others will keep flying .

"Dearborn, Michigan (CNN) -- Steve Bengelsvorf and Terry Flynn are chatting over beers on a hot, humid Wednesday night at Bamboozles, a Dearborn, Michigan, bar and restaurant, and a common pit stop for nearby factory workers. Both these clean-cut men sitting at the bar in polo-style shirts have a lot in common. They work at the nearby Severstal steel company. They're nearing retirement. And they both have strong opinions about who the next president should be. But their politics are as different as their taste in beer. ""I'm not for Obamacare, I'm not for his immigration policies, I don't particularly agree with 100% of his economic policies,"" Bengelsvorf said. For the record, he's a Bud Light guy -- and a Mitt Romney supporter. ""We can't go further into debt, and Obama is putting us further and further into debt by all these stimulus plans."" Flynn, a Miller Lite guy, supports President Barack Obama. If it weren't for the Obama-backed health care law, Flynn said his friend's unemployed son (a recent college graduate) wouldn't have health insurance coverage. CNN Poll: Health care ruling has not impacted race for White House, so far . When it comes to the economy, Flynn admits it's taking too long to recover from the recession. But he said that ""going back to the policies that got us into this mess is not the direction we want to go."" Severstal supplies steel to the big three automakers -- Ford, General Motors and Chrysler -- so Flynn's and Bengelsvorf's jobs are tied to the auto industry. Both agree on one thing: The $80 billion federal bailout of the auto industry was good for their jobs. Still, Bengelsvorf looks at it through broader lens. At one point he said, ""The other side of me says you don't bail out a company that's going bankrupt."" These two friends epitomize what we found when hitting the road in the Rust Belt. CNN took the pulse of voters in auto towns in Wisconsin, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio -- important states that could make or break Election Day for Obama and Romney. In 2008, Obama captured all four states. But this year Indiana is leaning toward Romney -- and Ohio is a tossup. In the 12 elections between 1964 and 2008 no presidential candidate has won without winning Ohio. This year Ohio has about 30,000 fewer auto manufacturing jobs than it did in 2007. Michigan has 50,000 fewer automaking jobs. On the bright side, Michigan and Ohio, respectively, have seen the nation's biggest percentage declines in unemployment over the past two years. Make no mistake, these four states hold keys to the White House because all together they have 55 of 270 electoral votes needed to win. As Obama makes a second journey down the campaign trail, he's touting the bailout of General Motors and Chrysler -- and you can bet he'll continue to do so. Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, opposed the bailout and pushed for a privately financed, managed bankruptcy of the two automakers. Watch: Politics in a former GM town . During a stop at the Half Moon Restaurant & Brewery in Kokomo, Indiana, a lot of folks with auto industry ties wanted to talk politics, including Cliff Pitcher and his friend DeWayne Bates. Just like in Michigan -- these two auto-industry friends are not supporting the same candidate. Bates doesn't think the president deserves another four years. Pitcher does. ""Mitt Romney, I like his economical experience and his business experience, and I think that would help get our country job growth and help us get back on our feet,"" said Bates, a retired Chrysler millwright. Pitcher, an electrician at one of four Kokomo Chrysler plants, counters, ""Romney might be able to create jobs, but they're gonna pay $7 or $8 an hour and you know ... I can't support my family on $7 or $8 with no benefits. Numbers don't mean anything in the creation of jobs if they're not quality jobs."" As a member of the autoworkers' union that traditionally skews Democratic, Bates said he feels like his support for Romney puts him in the minority. But other union autoworkers spoke out who take issue with Obama's economic policies -- particularly the auto bailout -- and are throwing their support behind Romney. Among them are Brian Pannebecker, who has worked at a Ford factory in Sterling Heights, Michigan, for 16 years. In Pannebecker's view, Obama shouldn't have bailed out the industry. His company, Ford, did not take a bailout. ""What I object to is all of the taxpayer dollars that were used,"" Pannebecker said. ""I think markets need to be allowed to work. And there were some fundamental problems that GM and Chrysler had that really were of their own making."" Just a few miles away from Pannebecker, electrician Stacy Steward stood in blistering 95-degree heat across the street from the Chrysler plant where she had just finished a long day's work. After being laid off from Chrysler in 2008 and out of work for 17 months, she said she was rehired one month after the auto bailout. CNN Poll: Economic optimism jumping . ""The Big Three support the entire state of Michigan,"" Steward said. ""The auto loans didn't just help Chrysler and GM; the auto loan also helped all of our suppliers. It helped all the small businesses in the areas. It helped the citizens."" Throughout this road trip in every town we visited -- large or small -- autoworkers expressed countless combinations of opinions about the state of the economy and the political direction of the nation. Come November, after all the stump speeches across the Rust Belt are said and done, many of these folks will cast their votes, hoping their candidate will take the nation's highest office. Some will get their way -- and others won't. No doubt it will be fascinating to watch. CNN Electoral Map . Read more on 2012 at CNNpolitics.com .

"(CNN) -- Weeks after flooding devastated farmland and homes in the Midwest, officials in five states said Friday that initial steps are under way for possible buyouts of property in flood zones. Flooding from the Mississippi River surrounds a home in Foley, Missouri, in late June. Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Iowa and Missouri all are considering the option. Under the buyouts, residents who qualify could choose to sell their houses to the states or communities, with the Federal Emergency Management Agency supplying 75 percent of the cost. The state of Iowa has sent a notice of interest for buyouts to affected communities, said Lucinda Robertson of the Iowa Homeland Security and Emergency Management Division. Iowa has asked interested residents to respond by September 12, Robertson said. Once the responses are in, the state will review them and ask the eligible communities to fill out the necessary applications. Illinois also is at the beginning of the buyout process, said Patti Thompson of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. The state sent out letters this week to those affected by flooding to gauge interest, Thompson said, and will wait about a month to receive their responses before determining how much money each would receive from FEMA. The state is about six to 12 months away from the actual buyout process, if interest warrants, she said. In Indiana, people in several areas have shown interest in buyouts, according to Rachel Myer of the Indiana Department of Homeland Security, and many cities and counties have begun the application process. Wisconsin Emergency Management spokeswoman Lori Getter said that state is in the ""infancy stages"" of what will be a one-year to 18-month process of buyouts. She said flooding affected about 20 communities, and some people still lack access to their homes. In Missouri, two communities have expressed interest in the buyout process, according to Susie Stonner, a public information officer for the Missouri State Emergency Management Agency. The flooding in the Midwest killed two dozen people and injured 148, according to FEMA. Some 35,000 to 40,000 people in several states have evacuated their homes.","Five states considering plan to buy flood-zone property from homeowners .

"(CNN) -- Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Saturday called on South Sudan to punish those responsible for shooting down a U.N. helicopter and taking the lives of four Russian crew members. His words come a day after the South Sudanese armed forces admitted to shooting down the helicopter in eastern South Sudan. ""We call on the government of South Sudan to carry out a full investigation of the incident, punish the guilty and take every measure to guarantee that this will never happen again,"" Lavrov said, in a statement on his website. The United Nations Mission in South Sudan said Friday four Russian crew members were killed but that there were no passengers on board the aircraft. The MI-8 helicopter went down near the settlement of Likuangole, in the state of Jonglei, in the country's east, the U.N. mission said. It is investigating the incident. The Sudan People's Liberation Army said it was an accident, according to spokesman Philip Aguer. He said the SPLA had contacted the U.N. mission after seeing the helicopter near an SPLA command post but had been told it had no aircraft in the area. The troops thought the aircraft looked to be the type that had dropped munitions to militias in the area, Aguer said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon condemned the shooting down of the helicopter, saying in a statement that it was clearly marked as being a U.N. aircraft. Ban extended condolences to the crew members and called on the government of South Sudan to bring whoever is responsible to justice.

"Rome (CNN) -- Italy's flamboyant former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi plans to marry a former television showgirl-turned-politician a half century younger, he told an Italian talk show this week. Francesca Pascale, 27, is ""a girl who is beautiful on the outside, but even more beautiful on the inside,"" the 76-year-old Berlusconi said. The billionaire, who resigned as prime minister just over a year ago at the height of his country's debt crisis, told an interviewer earlier this month that he will run again to be Italy's leader. The bride-to-be is from Naples, Italy, where she appeared as a showgirl on a local television station. She later became an activist and was elected to be a local council official representing Berlusconi's People of Liberty Party. Italians on the street -- or at the market -- revealed mixed feelings about Berlusconi's latest news. ""If it's fine for him an also for her, it should be fine for everyone,"" said one shopper. A butcher who was asked said he found it hard to believe. ""What can a man of 76 do with a 27-year-old girl?"" he asked. Opinion: What does Silvio's return mean for Italy? Berlusconi, who has been married twice before, is accused of involvement with someone even younger. He faces trial on charges that he hired an underage prostitute for sex and later tried to pull strings to get her out of jail when she was accused of theft. The woman involved in the long-running case is Moroccan dancer Karima el Mahroug, nicknamed ""Ruby the Heart-stealer."" Berlusconi has been accused of embezzlement, fraud and bribery over his career, but a tax-evasion case marked the first time he had been convicted of an offense. In October, a Milan court sentenced Berlusconi to four years in prison for tax evasion. However, under the Italian legal system, he and his fellow defendants have the right to appeal their sentence twice, in the appeals court and a higher court. Also, because the case dates to July 2006, the statute of limitations will expire next year, meaning there is a good chance none of the defendants will serve any prison time. Berlusconi, who dominated Italian politics for nearly two decades, did not reveal a wedding date. CNN's Ben Wedeman in Rome contributed to this report.","Berlusconi's bride-to-be is 27-year-old Francesca Pascale .

"Editor's Note: Tachi Yamada is the President of the Global Health Program at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. He writes for CNN's Vital Signs about how the  island of Zanzibar has virtually eliminated the disease over the past five years. ZANZIBAR, Tanzania -- I recently accompanied Margaret Chan, Director General of the WHO, and Ray Chambers, U.N. Special Envoy for Malaria, on a trip to Africa to see firsthand the region's fight against malaria. A hospital ward on the Tanzanian island of Zanzibar stands empty. The single most memorable image of the trip was from a pediatric hospital ward on the Tanzanian island of Zanzibar: a dozen beds and not a single patient in them. Imagine that.  I have searing memories of visiting wards much like this elsewhere in the world where there were as many as three children to a bed and more sleeping on the floor, deathly ill with malaria. Where have all the patients gone? After all, malaria is a big killer in much of the developing world. It is probably the most prevalent disease that mankind has ever suffered. Each year, there are over 250 million cases and almost one million deaths -- most of them young children, and the vast majority in Africa. But in many countries, malaria is also a success story. Since 2000, the number of reported malaria cases, deaths, or both has declined by at least half in 25 countries. Zanzibar -- a relatively small but striking example -- has virtually eliminated the disease over the past five years. These successes show what a combination of political will, technical resources, and financial commitment can do when applied to a strategy that works. There is no question that leaders and health officials in sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the world recognize the horrible toll of malaria. In fact, Uganda's Minister of Health told us that he himself has suffered from malaria three times this year. This understanding of the problem and the availability of tools to address it led the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2005 to fund the Malaria Control and Evaluation Program in Africa, which focused on malaria control in Zambia. Our investment was relatively small, but it helped Zambia create a comprehensive and aggressive national plan to fight malaria. With funding from the President's Malaria Initiative, the World Bank, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, Zambia greatly expanded the use of proven tools to prevent and treat the disease, such as the use of indoor spraying with insecticides, distribution of bednets, and effective malaria treatment in government clinics. As a result, in three short years, the malaria incidence in Zambia declined by more than 50 percent, and child mortality from all causes, including malaria, declined by 30 percent. Zambia, Zanzibar, and other success stories provide a beacon of hope for the dream of a world free of malaria, articulated by Bill and Melinda Gates in 2007 when they put out a call to eradicate the disease. Today, there are a number of outspoken people who question the value and true impact of development assistance. The example of malaria shows that with political will, advice on planning, funds to purchase sound, scientifically validated tools, and the courage to measure results objectively, development assistance can have an enormous impact in a short period of time. Where have all the patients gone? Home, where they can live happier, healthier lives. Let them be the retort to the skeptics of development assistance.","Yamada: The number of malaria cases has declined by at least half in 25 countries .

"(CNN) -- I almost always get asked the same question: How can it possibly be the ""end of men"" when there are so few female elected officials -- when men still hold the reins of political power? It's an excellent question. Until now, I've answered by pointing to statistical trends and future projections. Always, I ask people to take a leap of faith. But after this election, I feel like I am on so much more solid ground. The women's vote did not turn out to be historic in the way pundits predicted before the election. Yes, more women voted for President Obama, but not in record numbers. The gender gap was in fact a little smaller in this election than in 2008. Yes, women were important in certain states, but so were young people, African-Americans and Latinos, who, together, make up Obama's new winning coalition. What's more, women did not even constitute a unified vote. Married women tended to vote for Romney, while single women went for Obama. What changed in this election was that women accumulated power in a calm and measured way, and began to look for the first time much less like outsiders to the political process. New Hampshire, arguably a state populated by the greatest concentration of political insiders and obsessives, gave us our first ever matriarchy -- a delegation of House, Senate and governor that is entirely female. We elected a record number of women to the Senate. One of those new senators is Elizabeth Warren, who over the rest of her career has the potential to embody women's transition from outsider status to right in the thick of things. What about the ""war on women,"" the constantly mutating arguments over reproductive rights? On this, women won handily. In Missouri, Democrat Claire McCaskill ran against Todd Akin, who claimed that in ""legitimate rape"" the female body shuts down pregnancy. McCaskill not only beat Akin, she trounced him, winning by 16 points. Before the election, when McCaskill was still behind in the polls, women looked beleaguered and marginalized, subjected to lectures by men about their internal plumbing. Afterward, it's those who did the lecturing who seem like fringe, marginalized characters. In fact, practically all the candidates with the improbable Akin-type theories lost. (Check out this scorecard on Jezebel for a complete accounting.) Once, not all that long ago, women seemed like newcomers to the political scene, alien to its settled ways. Women were scrutinized in their every public move as though they were a newly discovered species. Think back to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Could she be tough enough on China? Soft enough to cry? Would she wear red suits to all her big speeches? If so, what did that mean? Now that the sight of a woman in a roomful of senators is becoming less unusual, our analysis becomes much less crude. Debates about image and optics are ceding to debates about actual policies. We also realize that women come in all types. More are likely to vote Democratic. Among female voters, more than 50% tend to favor abortion rights. Akin, for example, split the vote among white women. Minnesota Republican Michele Bachmann, who is strongly pro-life, kept her seat. Just as men have wide varieties of views, so do women. Voting as a bloc is something you only do if you're disenfranchised. Voting the way you want is a sign that you're gaining power. The important thing is for women to participate in the political process and speak for themselves. Workplace studies from the 1970s showed that when women reached a third of an office population, their presence no longer seemed unusual. The Senate will be one-fifth female. We're not there yet, but we're getting close. In this election, people are still discussing historic firsts -- the first openly lesbian senator (Democrat Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin), the first Asian-American woman (Democrat Mazie Hirono of Hawaii). Slowly, over time, we want these firsts to fade away and for female senators to be elected without that fact alone constituting a news story. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hanna Rosin.","Hanna Rosin: The women's vote did not turn out to be historic in this election .

"(CNN) -- French President Francois Hollande voiced anger Wednesday over the confession by his former budget minister that he had a secret Swiss bank account, and affirmed that the man had not been shielded from justice. Jerome Cahuzac resigned as minister in March, two months after prosecutors launched a preliminary investigation into suspected tax evasion. It was not until a meeting with the investigating judges on Tuesday that he finally confessed he held the undeclared Swiss bank account, a statement on his blog said. Hollande said Cahuzac had made an ""unforgivable mistake"" that was an insult to the country. ""Yesterday I was both stupefied and angry when I was informed of Jerome Cahuzac's confession to the judges,"" the president said. ""He misled the highest authorities of the country: the head of state, the government, the parliament, and through it the French people as a whole."" Hollande said the full truth will be established. ""The judicial system will play its role to the end and with complete independence,"" he said. ""I hereby affirm that Jerome Cahuzac did not benefit from any protection apart from that of the presumption of innocence. And he left the government at my request from the moment a judicial inquiry started."" Hollande vowed that steps will be taken to bolster the independence of the judiciary, to help it ""fight mercilessly"" against conflicts of interest. He also promised tougher penalties for any elected officials found guilty of fraud or corruption. The claims against Cahuzac, which he repeatedly denied, first came to light in a report by French investigative news website Mediapart in December. The website obtained a recording of a conversation in which Cahuzac supposedly told one of his aides that it worried him to have an account in Switzerland, as UBS was not the most discreet bank. 'Spiral of lies' The scandal dominated the headlines of French newspapers Wednesday. Newspaper La Liberation plastered one word, ""Indigne,"" or ""Unworthy,"" across its front page, below a close-up image of Cahuzac. It asks whether after ""months of lies,"" his confession could now trigger a political crisis. The scandal is particularly embarrassing for the Hollande government because it has vowed to crack down on tax evasion through foreign bank accounts. In his statement, Cahuzac apologized to Hollande, the government and the French people ""for the damage I have caused."" ""I was caught in a spiral of lies and I took the wrong path. I am devastated by remorse,"" he wrote. ""To think I could avoid facing a past that I wanted to consider as resolved was an unspeakable mistake."" Cahuzac said he had met with the two investigating judges Tuesday to come clean and will now ""face reality."" He had held the bank account for about 20 years but had not paid into it for about 12 years, the ex-minister wrote. He said he had given instructions for the total sum held in the Swiss account -- about 600,000 euros ($770,500) -- to be transferred to his bank account in Paris. Hollande appointed Bernard Cazeneuve to serve in Cahuzac's place following his resignation last month. READ MORE: French budget minister resigns . READ MORE: France's Hollande wants 75% tax on rich .

"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (CNN)  -- Sharon Phillips is a regular at the Anchorage Jobs Center Midtown -- grateful for the resource but a bit frustrated she has to keep coming. About 900 people a week visit the Anchorage Jobs Center Midtown. Alaska's unemployment rate is 8.3 percent. ""I am one of 70 or 80 people putting in for just about every position,"" Phillips told us during a visit this past week. ""It's been difficult."" Phillips has been looking for work for more than eight months now, often using the computerized job listings at the state-run jobs center. ""I put in for probably 10, eight to 10 jobs a week. I've been interviewed for about four a week. And I'm still unemployed,"" she said. Brad Gillespie, the Anchorage, Alaska, regional manager for the job centers, says about 900 people a week visit the midtown facility. That's up 20 percent to 30 percent from the same time a year ago. ""We're a seasonal economy up here, and we're getting into winter season,"" Gillespie said. ""So tourism is down. Construction work, too. ""And the Anchorage International Airport is an international hub for freight operations, and that's been impacted by the economy turning down."" New numbers released Friday show that the state unemployment rate is 8.4 percent -- up from 6.7 percent a year ago. The job market is so tight that the state now posts a caution on its Division of Employment Security Web site suggesting people not move to Alaska unless they already have work lined up. ""We have a fair amount of people who think that Alaska is the promised land, and they have misconceptions maybe about what is up here. And they load up the family and head out on the Alaska highway, and we want to encourage them not to do that until they have something lined up before they get here,"" Gillespie said. State economist Neal Fried says Alaska is often isolated from national economic trends because its economy is so different: manufacturing is for the most part limited to seafood processing, and the economy is built mostly around the energy sector and federal spending on the military and other government installations. But the numbers don't lie. ""We are part of it like the rest of the country is,"" Fried said. ""We are and appear to be more attached, to be more affected by this recession than we've ever been in prior recessions in this country."" The pain is hardest in the rural, remote communities where energy and food costs are way above the national average because of transportation costs. A recent University of Alaska at Anchorage analysis said unemployment among native Alaskans was approaching 20 percent. Carol Wren, the director of employment and training at the Cook Inlet Tribal Council's community center, says this is the toughest stretch she has seen in her 10 years of work at the center. Among native Alaskans, she said education rates tend to be lower and poverty rates higher. ""We have folks that may not have the credentials or the experience,"" she said. ""As it is more competitive, they are less likely to get those positions. So it is making it more difficult to help folks find work."" The center has benefited from some federal stimulus money to help families with training, child care and other costs. But Wren, while grateful for that assistance, still sees a tough stretch ahead. ""I think we are just starting to feel it here,"" she says of the recession. Democratic Sen. Mark Begich believes stimulus money is helping to cushion the blow. ""If you drive around town you will see some roads paved, some construction projects,"" said Begich, a former Anchorage mayor. He said the state received about $1.6 billion in stimulus funds, about a quarter of which he said is being spent on Alaska military installations. ""A lot of that I think buffered us at the right time,"" Begich said. Republican Gov. Sean Parnell agrees stimulus money has helped the state, but he says he would prefer Washington take steps he says would bring longer-term improvements. Tax cuts aimed at job creation is one wish, a faster decision on proposals for new exploration leases on the outercontinental shelf is another. ""Outercontinental shelf development is 35,000 new jobs,"" Parnell said. ""I have some concerns about delays and that we have companies awaiting many federal permits, and we'd like to see them move forward."" As for the stimulus money, Parnell said, ""When they try to pump up the states for a year or two  with, you know, new Medicaid funds, to then cut the states off two years later leaves every state trying to patch that, or fix that hole. ""That's the problem with stimulus funds is that they¹re great when they come in but it's horrible when they¹re gone. So, it's a dependence that gets created that doesn't lead to any more freedom or prosperity in the long run."" Looking ahead, Parnell is pushing new tourism marketing incentives to help buffer what, at this early point, looks like another tough tourism season next summer. And while he believes Alaska will not be as hard hit as many other states, Parnell voices the concerns of many here in saying that the fact that the recession arrived here late leads to worries it could linger too long. ""Alaska tends to trail the rest of the United States when it comes to the economy. So when the rest of the economy is headed up, it takes Alaska some time behind it,"" he said.","Recession hurts tourism, construction work, freight operations in Alaska .

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- Turkey's prime minister continued his outspoken criticism of China's crackdown on ethnic Uyghurs on Saturday. A Uyghur student cries as Turks pray on Friday in Ankara, Turkey, for people who died in protests in Urumqi, China. In remarks published by the official Anatolian Agency, Recep Tayyip Erdogan denouncing what he called ""savagery"" and called on the Chinese government to ""give up efforts to assimilate"" the country's Uyghur minority. On Friday, Erdogan went a step further, announcing to journalists upon his return to Ankara from the Group of Eight summit in Italy that ""the incidents in China are a genocide. There's no point in interpreting this otherwise."" Many Turks view the Uyghurs of Central Asia as fellow Turkic, Muslim brothers. At least 184 people died in last weekend's violent protests in Urumqi, in China's far-west Xinjiang region, according to Chinese state-run media. The violent demonstrations also left more than 1,000 injured in the capital, according to government figures. Heavily armed troops remain on the streets of Urumqi and curfews are in effect. The violence is a result of ethnic tensions between the Uyghurs, who are predominantly Muslim, and members of China's Han majority. Hundreds of Han Chinese were on the streets of Urumqi last Tuesday, holding sticks and pipes and calling for severe punishment of the Uyghurs, who they say committed serious crimes. The Uyghurs say they have been victimized and many of those killed in the violence Sunday were Uyghurs. Uyghur religious leaders have condemned the violence, saying it is against the spirit of the Muslim faith and Uyghur tradition. Several hundred Turkish and Uyghur demonstrators gathered during the past week to protest outside the Chinese embassy in Ankara. In another comment widely reported in the Turkish press, Erdogan announced he would be willing to approve a visa for Rebiya Kadeer, an exiled Uyghur activist currently residing in the United States. Kadeer issued a response on Saturday, which was distributed to CNN from her publisher and publicist, Kenneth Kales. ""I am grateful to Prime Minister Erdogan for his comment that Turkey will grant me a visa. I look forward to traveling to Turkey as soon as possible. The Uyghur and the Turkish people share close cultural and linguistic roots. ""The Uyghurs and Turks consider themselves as the same people. Uyghurs cherish our common language, customs, and spirit of freedom. We embrace the opportunity to meet with our Turkish cousins."" However, Kadeer was ""not entitled to represent the Uyghur people,"" a former Xinjiang official said, according to China's state-run media. Ismail Amat, an ethnic Uyghur who headed China's Xinjiang regional government, was quoted by the Xinhua news agency as calling Kadeer ""scum.""","Turkey's PM calls on China to stop assimilation efforts of Uyghurs in Xinjiang .

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic confirmed his status as World No.1 and denied Roger Federer a seventh title at the ATP World Tour Finals with a straight sets victory over his Swiss opponent at the O2 Arena Monday. The Serbian closed out victory after two hours 14 minutes of enthralling tennis, thumping his chest in trademark style to celebrate a 7-6 7-5 victory. He had trailed in each set to a break of service before hitting back in tenacious style to ultimately frustrate 17-time grand slam champion Federer. Both men came into the end of season showpiece in possession of a single grand slam title in 2012 and having held the coveted No.1 spot, Djokovic taking it back when Federer skipped the preceding Paris Masters. But it was Djokovic who put the seal on another triumphant season with his second victory in the Tour Finals after 2008, picking up the check for $1.7 million. ""Congratulations to Novak on an amazing tournament and an amazing year, You are the best. It has been an amazing year for me too,"" Federer said. Federer would have been energized by the raucous reception he received at the start of the match from an expectant capacity crowd and he did not disappoint in the opening exchanges. He won the first nine points to break service and hold for 3-0 in a purple patch to match the color of his tennis shirt. But all season Djokovic has shown an incredible tenacity and here it was no exception. Federer's 3-0 lead was erased as he broke back and then broke again to lead 5-4 and serve for the set. But Federer saved one set point before taking his first opportunity to break back to level at 5-5. The quality of the tennis was undeniable and it continued into the tiebreaker where Djokovic twice edged ahead with mini breaks only for Federer to retrieve the situation. He saved one set point with an incredible lunge at 5-6 but lost the next two points as Djokovic closed out the opener. Federer might have been expected to be deflated but he gained an early break in the second set and held the advantage until serving to level at 5-4 where he frittered away a 40-15 lead. Djokovic was not going to be denied and swept through the next two games, breaking Federer for the fourth time in a pulsating match to take the title. It was only the fourth time in the 43-year history of the Tour Finals that the top two in the world rankings had met in the final and it had fully lived up to expectations. Federer, who had beaten home hope Andy Murray in the semifinals, was losing for only the second time in eight final appearances as he chased a hat-trick of titles.","Novak Djokovic wins ATP World Tour Finals in London .

"Oslo (CNN) -- While the Nobel Peace Prize was being awarded this week in an ornate hall in Oslo, a small island nearby was shrouded in a cold mist that made it seem almost haunted. Utoya Island has dropped from the headlines, but it remains fresh in the memory of many, including one of the European Union leaders who received the Nobel prize, as the site of Norway's worst mass murder since World War II. Martin Schultz, the president of the European Parliament made a point of going to the island the very next day. ""The attack was an attack on our values,"" said Martin Schulz, president of the European Parliament. ""But our values are stronger than the attack."" Schulz -- along with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and European Council President Herman Van Rompuy -- accepted the award on the EU's behalf Monday, with the massacre of July 2011 already on his mind. It started with a deadly blast in downtown Oslo that killed eight people. In confusion that followed, the anti-immigrant extremist who detonated the bomb drove roughly 45 minutes to a ferry that took him to Utoya, the scene of an annual summer camp for young members of Norway's Labor Party. He methodically gunned down everyone he could find and killed 69 people, most of them teenagers. Anders Behring Breivik admitted carrying out the attacks, boasting that he was a patriot fighting multiculturalism in Norway. He was subjected to intense psychiatric examination, found sane and sentenced to 21 years in prison, although under Norwegian law he could be behind bars for life. The European Union was honored with the 2012 Nobel Prize because of its contribution to peace in Europe, erasing old borders and animosities. It has also contributed to multiculturalism, eliminating some of the barriers to immigration in many corners of the continent. In some countries, the debt crisis is fueling anti-immigrant sentiment. In Greece, for example, the ultra-nationalist Golden Dawn party is gaining popularity in part because of the country's changing economic and ethnic landscape. Norway is hardly an enthusiastic EU supporter, even less a hotbed of xenophobia. It has twice rejected EU membership and Breivik has been regarded as an extremist or a madman. But with the Nobel Prize for the EU and the the massacre at Utoya, Norway finds itself close to both Europe's best intentions and some of the worst instincts in European history. Schulz likened the two faces of his own brief trip to Norway to the two faces visible in the history of his own native Germany. ""We had a culture of literature and philosophy and mathematics,"" he said, ""And we had a culture of extermination at Auschwitz."" Schulz said that Norway, a nation proud of its liberal, peaceful and tolerant traditions, offered an avenue of hope . ""The reaction of the Norwegian society, to say our answer to the gunman is more democracy, more respect and to fight more for our values - that was the right answer, a good example for the whole world."" A famous peace prize and an infamous murder scene: two different worlds less than one hour apart.","Utoya Island has dropped from headlines, but it remains fresh in the memory of many .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of mourners packed a church in southwest India on Monday to honor the Indian-born nurse believed to have killed herself after taking a prank call at the hospital treating Prince William's pregnant wife. Jacintha Saldanha was buried Monday after a Mass at Our Lady of Health, Shirva, according to the Rev. Stany Tauro. Tauro said about 3,000 people attended the service. The funeral came two days after a Westminster Cathedral memorial service for Saldanha, who in early December took what turned out to be a prank call from two Australian radio show hosts pretending to be Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles. Read more: Who was nurse Jacintha Saldanha? Believing the call was genuine, she transferred it to the King Edward VII's Hospital ward where Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, was being treated for severe morning sickness. The hosts were able to get some information about Catherine's condition before the nurse who took the call grew suspicious and ended the call. Saldanha was found hanging from a wardrobe door at her hospital living quarters on December 7, a coroner's court heard Thursday. She left three notes, according to the court. The content was not disclosed. At Saturday's memorial in London, Saldanha's family spoke of the pain of losing her.

""We love you, Mum. Sleep in peace and please watch over us until we meet again in Heaven. We will always love you and keep you close to our hearts."" Although the hosts have apologized, the show has been taken off the air indefinitely. The hospital, which has said Saldanha was not subject to any disciplinary actions because of the prank, set up a memorial fund to benefit her family. CNN's Harmeet Sigh, Laura Smith-Spark, Susanna Palk and Jack Maddox contributed to this report.","About 3,000 people attend the Mass and burial, priest says .

"(CNN) -- The National Rifle Association chief issued a blistering retort to President Barack Obama's inaugural address, accusing him of name calling and limiting American freedoms. Wayne LaPierre had been relatively silent since his controversial response to the shooting massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. After the December 14 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, LaPierre held one public news conference where he doubled down on the NRA position: more guns, not fewer, provide true security. In a speech late Tuesday night, he hit upon that same theme as he repeatedly criticized Obama and his inaugural speech Monday. ""President Barack Obama quoted the Declaration of Independence and he talked about 'unalienable rights.' I would argue that his words make a mockery of both,"" LaPierre said at the annual black-tie Weatherby International Hunting and Conservation Awards in Reno, Nevada. Several times, LaPierre homed in on one part of Obama's address, where the president said, ""We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate."" Opinion: Guns were last straw for me with GOP . LaPierre said the president was attacking fervent supporters of the Second Amendment. Many of them believe it provides an absolute right to provide arms. ""When absolutes are abandoned for principles, the U.S. Constitution becomes a blank slate for anyone's graffiti,"" LaPierre said. ""Words do have meaning, Mr. President. And those meanings are absolute, especially when it comes to our Bill of Rights."" The re-emergence of the NRA's potent mouthpiece comes on the same day of another school shooting that captured national headlines -- the wounding of three people on a Texas college campus. His speech also comes as Obama and some lawmakers focus on passing gun control measures. Polls show more people are warming up to the possibility. Last week, Obama proposed background checks on all gun sales, and bans on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. With relatives of some of the 20 children killed in the Connecticut rampage looking on, Obama also signed 23 executive actions -- which don't require congressional approval -- to strengthen existing gun laws. They also take related steps on mental health and school safety. In his speech Tuesday, LaPierre set his sights on Obama's proposal to expand background checks to anyone buying a gun, whether at a store or in a private sale at an auction or convention. ""There are only two reasons for that federal list of gun owners: to tax them or take them,"" he told the cheering crowd. The tit-for-tat continues a running battle between the president and the powerful gun lobby. Last week, the NRA released an advertisement that called the president an ""elitist hypocrite,"" and asked why he opposes the idea of placing armed guards in every school -- a proposal pushed by the NRA -- despite the fact that his own children attend a school with similar security. The ad was only slated to air on the Sportsman Channel, but has gained strong media attention, both on the airwaves and online. It has also garnered criticism. Republican Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey criticized it for making a reference to the president's children in a political attack commercial. Speaking at a news conference last week, the outspoken governor decried the move as ""reprehensible"" and argued that the group lost some credibility by making the ad. ""And I think for any of us who are public figures, you see that kind of ad and you cringe. You cringe because it's just not appropriate in my view to do that,"" he said. ""They've got real issues to debate on this topic. Get to the real issues. Don't be dragging people's children into this. It's wrong."" In his Tuesday speech, LaPierre said Obama was among the ""self-appointed arbiters of what freedom really means."" ""He doesn't understand you. He doesn't agree with the freedoms you cherish. If the only way he can force you to give 'em up is through scorn and ridicule, he's more than willing to do it, even as he claims the moral high ground.""

"(CNN) -- Heavy crude oil flowing like a river through a central Arkansas neighborhood could keep residents away for several more days as crews work to clean it up. The oil began spilling into the Mayflower, Arkansas, subdivision Friday from a 2- or 3-inch gash in the Pegasus pipeline, which carries Canadian crude from Patoka, Illinois, to Nederland, Texas, according to a state transportation engineer. The cause of the leak was undetermined, he told CNN affiliate KARK in Little Rock. About two dozen homes were evacuated as the crude oil, which originated in Canada and was bound for Gulf Coast refineries, crawled through yards and down streets. ""Hopefully in the near immediate future we can get residents back into certain areas of the neighborhood,"" Environmental Protection Agency spokesman Nicolas Brescia said Sunday as reporters were given a tour of the neighborhood. Exxon Mobil, which owns the 60-year-old pipeline, met with displaced residents over the weekend to explain how they can make claims for losses. ""If you have been harmed by this spill then we're going to look at how to make that right,"" Exxon Mobil Pipeline Co. President Gary Pruessing told them. Resident Darren Hale complained to CNN affiliate KHTV that being forced to leave his home was frustrating. ""I've heard three contradictory answers as to when I will be able to go back home,"" Hale said. He was first told it would be two days, but later that it would be up to two weeks, he said. Joe Bradley, whose home is about five houses away from the rupture, told KHTV he was worried about how the spill could affect his 8-year-old daughter's health. ""Is she supposed to ride her bicycle out here playing with kids out here?"" Bradley asked. An around-the-clock cleanup operation began Saturday, with workers scrubbing streets and driveways in the Northwood subdivision, CNN affiliate KATV reported. ""The next step is going to be power washing,"" Faulkner County Judge Allen Dodson told KATV Sunday. ""More than likely, I think we are doing some testing with some power washing right now with the techniques involved there."" None of the estimated 12,000 barrels of oil that spilled has made it to nearby Lake Conway, a local drinking water source, Dodson said. ""We're approximately a mile from Lake Conway or at least from the cove,"" he said. The Pegasus pipeline, which could carry up to 90,000 barrels of crude each day, was built more than 60 years ago, an Exxon Mobil spokesman said. Leaks are not uncommon, but the company's recent inspections showed no red flags for this section, he told KARK.","Oil spills into a Mayflower, Arkansas, subdivision from a gash in the pipeline .

"(CNN) -- Early next year, British legislators will introduce a measure allowing gay marriage in England and Wales. Maria Miller, the Minister for Women and Equalities, issued a statement Tuesday announcing the plans. She added that the proposed legislation aims to ""create watertight protections for religious organizations"" that don't want to conduct same-sex marriages. Those groups wouldn't be forced to perform same-sex marriages by law; they would have a choice to ""opt in."" In addition, the Church of England and ""the Church in Wales"" would be prohibited from performing such marriages unless the churches' governing bodies change canon law, which currently prohibits it, the ministry said in a news release. ""Marriage is one of the most important institutions we have in this country,"" Miller said in the release. ""It binds us together, brings long-term commitment and stability, and makes society stronger. Our proposals mean that marriage would be available to everyone. ""I feel strongly that, if a couple wish to show their love and commitment to each other, the state should not stand in their way,"" she continued. ""These changes will strengthen marriage in our society and ensure that it remains a modern and vibrant tradition. And we are also building a fairer society for all."" Miller said the legislation would allow same-sex couples to get married in civil ceremonies and would guard against anyone in England or Wales, or within Europe, challenging the law in court. European law protects religious freedom under Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Elsewhere in Great Britain, the Scottish Parliament is moving toward its own legislation on same-sex marriage while the Northern Ireland Assembly rejected a measure on the issue in October.","Minister for Women: Granting same-sex marriage rights can strengthen society .

"London (CNN) -- Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ""has undergone surgery to remove a growth in her bladder"" and is currently recovering in the hospital, her spokeswoman, Gillian Penrose, said Friday. Thatcher, 87, is doing ""absolutely fine"" after the operation, her spokeswoman said. She was admitted to the hospital Thursday and is expected to be kept overnight. Britain's only female prime minister, Thatcher served from 1979 to 1990 as leader of the Conservative Party. She was called the ""Iron Lady"" for her personal and political toughness. She enjoyed a close friendship and working relationship with the late U.S. President Ronald Reagan, with whom she shared similar conservative views. Thatcher retired from public life after a stroke in 2002 and suffered several strokes after that. She makes few public appearances. She missed a reception in honor of her 85th birthday hosted by Prime Minister David Cameron in October 2010 and skipped the unveiling of a statue of Reagan in London in July last year.

"(CNN) -- In an emergency, do you know how to best use your cell phone to stay safe, informed and in touch? Recognizing that Americans have been getting mixed messages from many sources, this week the Federal Communication Commission and the Federal Emergency Management Administration teamed up to publish a new list of tips for communicating before, during and after a disaster. These tips complement the advice already offered in the Get Tech Ready section of the government's emergency preparedness site, Ready.gov. In an interview Thursday, FCC Chair Julius Genachowski said that in the wake of Hurricane Irene, FEMA and the FCC realized that many Americans still don't understand some important basics about how communication technology functions in emergency situations. For instance, many people don't grasp the consequences of cordless phones. If the power goes out, you can't use a cordless phone to make or receive calls unless it has a battery backup. Consequently the FCC/FEMA tip sheet recommends: ""If you have a traditional landline (non-broadband or VOIP) phone, keep at least one non-cordless phone in your home."" Said Genachowski, ""I have a 19-year-old son, and he was my guinea pig on this. I asked him if he could use a cordless phone when the power is out, and he didn't know."" Recognizing that many of today's cell phones can do much more than make calls, the tip sheet also recommends using non-voice channels to conserve capacity on wireless networks during emergencies. According to the tip sheet, ""For non-emergency communications, use text messaging, e-mail, or social media instead of making voice calls on your cell phone to avoid tying up voice networks. Data-based services like texts and e-mails are less likely to experience network congestion. You can also use social media to post your status to let family and friends know you are okay. In addition to Facebook and Twitter, you can use resources such as the American Red Cross Safe and Well program."" Learn more about why your emergency kit should include a cell phone . Disaster response overlaps with day-to-day emergency response systems, which is partly why Thursday's FCC Open Commission meeting focused on next-generation 911, or NG911, systems. In emergencies, NG911 systems would allow people to contact local emergency responders by sending text or photo/video messages to 911. On Thursday the FCC announced that it's beginning to formulate rules to accelerate the development of NG911 technologies. ""Some of these ideas used to be science fiction -- but implementing this technology is now within reach,"" said Genachowski . (The U.S. Dept. of Transportation also has an NG911 project.) The new FCC rules also would call for carriers to increase location accuracy in cell phone call tracking, and to ""enhance the information available to Public Safety Answering Points and first responders for assessing and responding to emergencies."" The FCC is also starting to examine how wireless carriers might start prioritizing 911 calls. ""Surprisingly, this is not already happening,"" said Genachowski. ""The way the system works now, if the phone network is so congested that nothing gets through, that holds up 911 calls, too. We definitely saw this after the earthquake a month ago. But when networks are congested, 911 calls should get priority over other call traffic."" Social media is a growing part of the communication picture, especially in the wake of emergencies. ""Social media is ultimately part of NG911. We need to make sure that emergency responders have access to social networks and wireless networks in their digital command centers, so they can see and integrate info from many sources and have it be actionable,"" Genachowski said. Russ Johnson, director for public safety and homeland security for Esri (a leading vendor of geographic information systems, or GIS) has offered advice on how social-media users could create actionable emergency response information through the words they use in emergency-related tweets and status updates. Johnson noted that currently the FCC/FEMA tip sheet offers ""no direction or guidance on messaging to communicate a categorical problem. I still believe we are missing the boat by not providing a recommended list of key topics, hash-tags, etc. that could be quickly recognized and prioritized during emergencies for the social media domain."" Despite safety problems posed by texting while driving, or how being distracted by your cell phone might make you an easier target for street crime, Genachowski said that in the big picture, cell phones have made the world a safer place. ""Remember 911 calls in a world without mobile phones? If you were out on the street or in your car and you saw an emergency, you couldn't call 911 immediately. The fact that most people now have cell phones is a very significant improvement in public safety,"" he said. ""Sure, we need to do more maximize this opportunity, but the fact that we have mobile networks is a big plus. The same is true for social networking. We are generally safer thanks to how people use social networks in emergencies.""","The FCC and FEMA offer new tech tips for emergency preparedness .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Kim Jong Un cut a somber figure Monday, marking the first anniversary of his father's death. North Korea said Kim Jong Il died of a heart attack from overwork on December 17, 2011. Hundreds of thousands of civilians and soldiers assembled outside the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang where the bodies of Kim Jong Il and his father Kim Il Sung lie. Read more: North Korea silences doubters, raises fears with rocket launch . Accompanied by his wife, Ri Sol Ju, who appeared to be heavily pregnant, Kim Jong Un bowed to giant statues of the former leaders inside the mausoleum. Outside, he listened to a commemorative speech from Choe Ryong-hae, head of the military's political arm. Choe praised the achievements of the former leaders before declaring, ""Kim Jong Un is North Korea's fate and future."" A lot has changed over the past year. Kim Jong Un has transformed from grieving son to a triumphant leader leading a controversial rocket launch this month. The 20-something leader, who was suddenly thrust into the limelight last December was considered by many outside, and possibly even inside, North Korea to be ill-prepared for the responsibilities that lay ahead. But experts say it was soon clear that the younger Kim would not be emulating the style of his father. ""Kim Jong Il was rather low profile for a few years after the death of Kim Il Sung which is in accordance with even older Confucian practices,"" says John Delury assistant professor at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. ""This is after all a dynastic system, but Kim Jong Un quickly proved by the spring that he was going to be quite public, quite active."" April 2012 brought with it one of the most significant dates on the North Korean calendar, as it marked the centenary of the birth of the country's founder Kim Il Sung, celebrations for which had been planned for years by the late Kim Jong Il. His son picked up the mantle and controversially launched a rocket in commemoration. Following his father's example, Kim ignored international condemnation for what he called an attempt to put a working satellite into orbit. Washington, Seoul and others in the region saw the launch as a cover for testing ballistic missile technology. Read more: Experts: Rocket launch bolsters North Korean leader . The rocket was a failure, made all the more public by the international media which had been invited into the country for the occasion. But disregarding the international embarrassment, Kim Jong Un continued with the celebrations. ""He actually performed quite well by the standard set for him,"" says Delury. ""He spoke in public which is something his father did not and he projected a kind of confidence and energy, he really turned the young and experienced to his advantage."" The world and the people of North Korea heard the voice of the new leader for the very first time. Even more surprising was Kim's acknowledgment of his people's suffering. He told a gathering of hundreds of thousands, ""Our Party is determined our people will not have to tighten their belts but will enjoy wealth and the honor of socialism."" Style-wise, Kim cuts a very different figure to his father. He is more personable and willing to interact with his people. He is often seen smiling and laughing and his wife has accompanied him on many field trips, which was unheard of during his father's reign. Read more: Is Kim Jong Un's uncertainty driving the rockets? ""She's played a very surprising role in constructing this image of a looser, more relaxed, more open leader domestically,"" adds Delury. But despite a softer side appearing on camera, little has improved for the people of North Korea. Aid groups say malnutrition is still rampant in the countryside, brutal labor camps still remain and defector groups in Seoul claim Kim has cracked down even harder on people trying to escape. They say the leader has threatened to imprison or even kill three generations of the family left behind. It's a claim CNN cannot independently confirm. Kim has made his mark on the military, replacing some generals loyal to his father with those loyal to him. ""Certainly everyone has noticed a number of the key military figures, you know four who walked with Kim Jong Il's remains a year ago have sort of disappeared from the scene or have been reshuffled."" But his statements on the South Korean or American leadership remain just as bellicose as during the his father's era and he frequently visits military barracks and installations. Read more: What is life like inside North Korea? Speculation about internal displeasure among some of those replaced by Kim Jong Un may be easing since last week's successful rocket launch, the second attempt in a year. ""I think it earned him a lot of patriotic points,"" says Jasper Kim, founder of Asia-Pacific Global research Group. ""So that will basically placate the military so this will give him extra room to maneuver in terms of making modernization efforts if that's his plan."" Kim Jong Un's use of the media has been a drastic departure from his father's time. Live broadcasts and televised public speeches are no longer so unusual. Jasper Kim adds, ""Kim Jong Un basically grew up on Google and his father grew up on letters and stamps. It's a new era and Kim Jong Un realizes the more he can kind of shape the narrative to the international community, the more it is to his benefit in terms of getting security and money and everything else that he wants for his country.""","Kim Jong Un has ruled North Korea for one year .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Ranee Roberts feels lucky to have survived the impact of a tornado that hit her Alabama convenience store in April. ""Before the twister hit, I sent a last text to say 'I love you' to my best friend, and then the building began to come apart around me,"" said the 34-year-old from Henagar. Roberts said she knew only about two minutes before impact that the twister was heading toward her store. The tornado was rated an EF-4, with estimated winds peaking at 175 mph. ""There was no time for preparations, only prayer,"" she said. ""I felt utterly hopeless thinking I might be spending my last moments on Earth curled up on the stockroom floor."" Looking back, she was ill-prepared for the storm and its aftermath. She felt that she got off extremely lucky walking away with ""just a few scratches"" to her body. She learned from her harrowing experience to keep a first-aid kit, flashlight, bicycle helmet, battery-powered radio, power generator and Meals Ready to Eat in her storm closet. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a record 14 weather and climate disasters in 2011 caused $1 billion or more in damage, including the Alabama tornado that Roberts survived. At least 669 people died in these storms and thousands were injured. View a list of the storms . ""In my four decades of tracking weather, I have never seen extreme weather like we had in 2011,"" said Jack Hayes, NOAA's assistant administrator for weather services and the National Weather Service director. Although no two years are alike, Hayes said, it's important for Americans to be prepared for the worst. ""The U.S. population has almost doubled since 1954, and trends such as urban sprawl and conversion of rural land to suburban landscapes increase the likelihood a tornado will impact densely populated areas,"" he said. ""We have also become more vulnerable to coastal storms and hurricanes as more people are living in coastal areas."" Hayes said the 2011 Southern drought and floods across the northern U.S. represent the extreme temperature and precipitation swings that climate scientists project will become more common amid a warming climate. As a result of these conditions, Hayes' agency has redoubled its efforts to create a ""Weather-Ready Nation."" ""We want the nation's response to and the outcome from severe weather to be different in 2012 and in the future,"" he noted. The devastating effects of extreme events can be reduced through improved readiness. Hayes said a ""weather-ready nation"" is one made up of people empowered to make life-saving decisions that also prevent devastating economic losses. Roberts said that neither she nor her neighbors and friends in Alabama felt they were as prepared as they could have been for April's tornado. They lacked basic supplies and relied on the Federal Emergency Management Agency, other community members and a local church to help them after the storm. ""That tornado was a clear reminder of our vulnerability,"" she said. ""Your life can change in an instant."" One of the many lessons she learned from her experience was to create an emergency preparedness plan, something Hayes wants for all Americans. In the end, emergency managers, first responders, government officials, businesses and the public need to be equipped with better weather information and a plan to make fast, smart decisions to save lives and livelihoods, Hayes said. As part of creating a ""weather-ready nation,"" Hayes' agency is launching pilot projects in the Gulf Coast, South and mid-Atlantic regions to increase ""on the ground"" capabilities. In the north central Gulf region, for instance, a pilot team of meteorologists and hydrologists is developing methods to improve coordination to enhance preparedness and response efforts. Hayes also wants Americans to understand that each type of weather condition deserves a specific type of preparedness. NOAA's website links to FEMA's ready.gov site, which offers detailed information on how to create a disaster plans for various conditions. To prepare for tornadoes, for example, it's critical that families identify a ""safe room"" in their house to go to when they hear a tornado siren or learn that a tornado warning is in effect, Hayes said. If you are outside or away from your home, you should immediately get into the lowest level of a sturdy building. The safest type of room would be underground, such as a basement or cellar, he said . Meteorologist Bonnie Schneider, who appears on the various media platforms of CNN and HLN, has written a new book releasing January 31, called ""Extreme Weather,"" which provides a guide to surviving all types of natural disasters. She notes the growing importance of technology and social media in becoming a ""weather-ready nation."" ""During natural disasters like earthquakes or hurricanes phone lines may go down so SMS and Twitter may be the only ways to communicate,"" she said. ""It's important to have these types of accounts set up, and know how to use them, before an extreme weather event occurs."" Schneider recommends having a plan for pets too, including emergency food supplies and an accessible place to keep a picture of your pet and proof of ownership. This may be needed at a shelter, or if the pet is lost. ""You've got to be proactive in preparing for extreme weather,"" she said. ""An extreme weather condition, like the tornado I experienced, doesn't care if you are rich, poor, young or old,"" said Roberts. ""What does matter is how prepared you are and how quickly you react when time is of the essence.""","NOAA: A record 14 climate disasters in 2011 caused $1 billion or more in damage .

"(CNN) -- Rescue authorities reported all five people aboard a small sightseeing plane were killed when it crashed in a mountainous area of southeast Alaska on Tuesday, a Princess Cruises spokeswoman said. The five included the plane's pilot and four Sun Princess cruise ship passengers, who were on the second day of a weeklong, round-trip cruise from Seattle, Washington, spokeswoman Julie Benson said in a statement. The pilot sent out a distress signal late Tuesday afternoon while on a planned tour of Misty Fjords National Monument, south of Juneau near Ketchikan, Alaska, according to Benson. When the single-engine DeHavilland Beaver did not return, ""rescue helicopters were dispatched to the location of the flight seeing route,"" Benson said. ""These helicopters subsequently spotted the float plane which ... crashed in rugged terrain."" No additional information was immediately released, but Benson said the company was working closely with local authorities to investigate the circumstances of the crash. Meanwhile, Princess Cruises has permanently canceled all excursions with the tour company Taquan Air, operator of the plane, Benson said. ""We are devastated to report that our passengers and the plane's pilot perished in the accident,"" Benson said. ""Our shoreside care team is doing everything possible to help their families through this difficult tragedy, and we share in their grief."" The passengers were among 1,950 people aboard the Sun Princess. Alaska State Trooper Jodi Williams identified the victims as pilot Joseph H. Campbell of Ketchikan and cruise ship passengers William F. Eddy and Jeanne J. Eddy of Jacksonville, Florida, and Marianne M. McManus and Paul J. McManus of Cherry Valley, Massachusetts.

"(CNN) -- Across the seas and oceans of Asia, islands and the waters around them are frequently a source of dispute and even military confrontation. Japan and Russia squabble over Hokkaido; Japan and China claim sovereignty over islands in the South China Sea (Senkaku to the Japanese; Diaoyu to China). Several nations lay claim to the Spratley Islands. But the coastline of the Yellow Sea -- where North and South Korea meet -- is the most explosive of all. The Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas has long been settled in the permafrost of a diplomatic cold war. Down to the last inch, the two sides know their limits. That's not so at sea, where the North and South have long disagreed on whose waters end where -- especially in the Yellow (or West) Sea, which is dotted with islands. The South Korean warship Cheonan was torpedoed in March in this disputed area, leaving 46 sailors dead. The island of Yeonpyeong, the target of a North Korean artillery barrage this week that killed four people, is in the same area. And upcoming exercises involving the U.S. and South Korean navies will take place in this part of the Yellow Sea. At the heart of the dispute is what's called the Northern Limit Line. In 1953, after the Korean War, the United Nations unilaterally drew this line three nautical miles from the North Korean coastline. That put five islands close to the coast under South Korean control. It also hemmed in the port of Haeju, the only deepwater harbor in the North that doesn't freeze in winter. What was supposed to be a temporary arrangement has become permanent in the absence of a full peace agreement. The Northern Limit Line is still in place today -- running close to the North Korean shoreline for about 100 miles. Pyongyang has never been happy about the arrangement, but only in the 1970s did it begin to challenge it. North Korea has subsequently proposed a different line -- one that would roughly extend the DMZ southwest out into the Yellow Sea, rather than hug the North Korean shoreline. A few years ago, in typically colorful language, the North labeled the NLL ""an illegal and brigandish line drawn by the U.S. on our sacred territorial waters."" But the South has always resisted Pyongyang's alternative line -- as it would have brought North Korea's maritime boundary closer to its main port of Incheon. Now add the fact that these waters are important fishing and crab grounds. For North Korean fishermen especially, the blue crab season between June and September is an important source of income. Ironically, those crabs have a habit of migrating south during these months. So these waters are frequently crowded with boats from both countries -- as well as vessels from China, just to complicate the picture. Disputes over fishing rights have resulted in dozens of boat seizures. According to the South Korean Maritime Police, the North seized 36 boats in the Yellow Sea in the 1990s. More recently, the coastal waters have seen armed clashes. The most serious of them were in 1999 and 2002, which led to loss of life. The North Koreans may not wish to risk a full-scale naval engagement -- its warships came off much worse in the 1999 skirmishes and the technological gap between the two fleets has only widened since. Last year, a South Korean warship fired on and reportedly damaged a North Korean vessel that was alleged to have crossed the Northern Limit Line, leading Pyongyang to condemn what it called ""a grave armed provocation."" So the coastal waters of the Yellow Sea have long been the ""theater"" in which Pyongyang could most easily provoke a crisis, and most easily legitimize it. Added to which, such confrontations -- using artillery and patrol boats -- can be contained and managed. Nuclear threats tend to leave less room for maneuver. In the wake of the latest incidents, both sides appear to be hardening their positions. South Korea has strengthened its rules of engagement in the Yellow Sea. Far from reducing the marines stationed on the five islands off North Korea's coast, as was planned, they will be reinforced. And there's plenty of pressure in the South Korean media for a hard line, with the conservative Chosun Ilbo claiming Thursday that ""the military has been implementing reforms that weaken defense capabilities"" on the islands. Few analysts expect any compromise on the Northern Limit Line in the near future, given the overall deterioration in relations and the complex negotiations that would be necessary to find an alternative to what was meant to be a temporary solution nearly 60 years ago.","Asian islands are a common source of friction between countries in the region .

"Washington (CNN) -- After spending more than a month in a Houston hospital, former President George H.W. Bush might get to leave this week. ""We are hopeful that he can be discharged this coming week, but we're still taking everything one day at a time,"" spokesman Jim McGrath said Saturday night. The statement came after Bush's son and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush told a crowd in Vero Beach on Saturday that his father was expected to be released Monday, according to TCPalm.com. The 41st president was hospitalized on November 23 for bronchitis and remained there while doctors monitored a lingering cough. He has also suffered from ""a stubborn fever,"" McGrath said last week. While in the hospital, Bush, 88, has cheered on the Texas A&M and the Houston Texans football teams to victories and enjoyed a special performance by the Oak Ridge Boys via telephone. His exchanges with doctors and nurses have included singing, McGrath said.","Spokesman: ""We are hopeful ... but we're still taking everything one day at a time""

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama left for Camp David on Marine One Friday but, in a twist that has left some White House reporters scratching their heads, he apparently arrived at the presidential retreat by car. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney explained the decision not to land at Camp David was made in advance because of the weather. Marine One landed at an alternate site near Frederick, Maryland and the president and his daughter, Sasha, rode in a motorcade the rest of way to the compound. Because it is customary practice that the traveling press pool is included whenever the president uses a motorcade, reporters naturally wondered why the pool was not part of the trip or even informed that the president would use a motorcade ahead of time. Meanwhile, CNN's weather team found no signs of stormy weather in the area at the time Marine One departed the White House. The White House said there were no mechanical issues with the presidential helicopter. ""It was a bit of a surprise because he (Obama) usually does not land here. They usually go all the way to Camp David,"" said Kristy Rossignuolo, a customer service representative at the Frederick Municipal Airport. Also Friday, a fighter under the direction of North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) intercepted an aircraft in the vicinity of Camp David. The civilian aircraft left the restricted area and landed at the Martinsburg Airport in West Virginia, NORAD said. No other details were immediately available on the incident, which was separate from the decision to divert Marine One.

"New York (CNN) -- A review of forensic evidence in New York City rape cases has uncovered 26 incidents where critical evidence went undetected, prompting the city's medical examiner's office to look into more than 800 rape cases over 10 years, ""reviewing and retesting everything."" On Friday, the medical examiner's rape-case review prompted New York's City Council speaker to set an ""emergency oversight hearing"" for January 22. ""The mishandling of rape cases is making double victims of women who have already suffered an indescribably horrific event,"" City Council Speaker Christine Quinn said. ""We cannot allow these women to wonder if their attacker remains free or to go one more day without knowing justice was served in their case."" The review, which began in July of 2011, focuses on the work of one technician includes all cases the technician processed over a 10-year period. So far, that re-examination has uncovered 26 cases where the technician allegedly failed to detect biological evidence critical to the cases. In another 19 cases, the review found that pieces of evidence were in the wrong rape kits. '""The only answer here is a top-down, complete review on how they train, the procedures they use and the oversight,"" said Sonia Ossorio, president of the National Organization for Women of New York City. ""The mishandling of evidence can mean that rapist who should be in jail are out walking the street just looking for more victims."" The results have only indicated false negatives, not false positives, according to Chief Medical Examiner spokeswoman Ellen Borakove. ""We know that nobody has been wrongfully convicted, and nobody is serving time for something they shouldn't be serving time for,"" she said. The technician in question was in charge of processing rape kits, alongside some 40 other staff members at the office. Around the end of 2008-2009, after she enrolled in a training program to become a DNA analyst, the supervisors realized ""there was a problem"" and took her off casework, Borakove said. Her mistakes then prompted supervisors to look at her earlier work,and they discovered the false results. ""She (the technician) is no longer here and that's the important thing,"" said Borakove. The newly discovered forensic evidence has since led to the indictment of a Brooklyn man in an incident 10 years earlier, according to Borakove and the district attorney's office.","A review uncovers 26 cases where a technician allegedly failed to detect evidence .

"(CNN) -- For all the headaches on the campaign trail, you would not think a candidate would be hounded by his own dog. That, however, has been the relentless fate of Republican contender Mitt Romney. A trip to Canada 30 years ago with the family pooch in a car top carrier, has been the gift that just keeps giving to Democrats. They've lampooned him as cruel at worst, foolish at best, with bumper stickers and T-shirts that say ""Dogs aren't luggage!"" and ""Mitt is Mean!"" Republicans have counterattacked by pointing out that President Obama wrote in his own book about eating dog as a child, helping the dog fight become a theme at this year's White House Correspondents Association dinner. Comedian Jimmy Kimmel nipped at both of them. ""If Mitt Romney offers you a ride, call shotgun. And if President Obama starts buttering you, run!"" It would be easy to dismiss all of this as political silliness were it not for one troubling fact: Sometimes the way a president connects with critters can affect the way voters relate to him. ""Presidents and their pets have a long and storied history,"" says Garrett Graff, a goldfish owner and editor-in-chief at Washingtonian magazine. His theory about why voters take such an interest in such matters: ""Most of us don't 'get' Middle East oil politics, and the rise and fall of the G.D.P., but we can 'get' if you connect with a dog or you connect with a cat."" First a little history. Ever since George Washington took office with horses and hounds in tow, presidents have welcomed animals into their lives. A lot of animals. ""John Quincy Adams,"" Graff says, ""actually liked surprising guests with an alligator he kept hidden in a bathtub."" Theodore Roosevelt, famous for his love of the great outdoors, brought a great deal of it indoors when he took the oath. In addition to dogs and horses, Roosevelt had parrots, ponies, bears, a zebra, snakes, lizards, and for reasons lost to time, a one-legged chicken. William Howard Taft had a cow that which was photographed munching away on the White House grounds. Woodrow Wilson followed suit with sheep. Actually, he pioneered the public relations potential of the flock by using it to keep the grass trimmed during World War One. Old black and white film shows Wilson gazing proudly out of his presidential office as the rams and ewes chew away at the yard, saving Uncle Sam a few mowing fees in a time of austerity. Calvin Coolidge may seem like the blandest chief executive ever in his photos, but apparently he was a wild man. Like Roosevelt, he brought a zoo with him: Lion cubs, a goose, a bobcat and a raccoon, among other critters. While in office, he was given a pygmy hippo by Harvey Firestone of car tire fame. Wilson named it Billy. ""Both Teddy Roosevelt and Calvin Coolidge gave large parts of their menageries to the National Zoo here in Washington,"" Graff says, ""and even today many if not most of the pygmy hippos here in the United States are descendents of that Calvin Coolidge hippo."" Now that's a presidential legacy. Dogs, however, have always been the most likely pick for first pet, for better or worse. For example, when Franklin D. Roosevelt was in office, a story went around that he'd accidentally left behind his Scottish terrier, Fala, during a tour of the Aleutian Islands, and then sent the Navy back to rescue the dog. Critics howled over the supposed waste of taxpayer dollars. FDR, however, neatly mows them down on a scratchy old bit of film. ""Well, of course, I don't resent attacks,"" he said, his lantern jaw jutting over a cluster of clunky microphones, without a hint of smile. ""My family don't resent attacks. But Fala does resent attacks!"" His audience roared, the critics retreated, and Fala became so famous that the dog is even a feature of the FDR Memorial in Washington, sitting in bronze at the feet of the 32nd president. Richard Nixon pulled a similar trick back in 1952 when he was Dwight D. Eisenhower's running mate. Defending himself against accusations of receiving improper gifts, he listed his kids' dog, Checkers, as one of them. ""And I just want to say right now,"" Nixon told a television audience, ""that regardless of what they say about him, we're going to keep him."" Voters ate it up. Nixon humanized himself in one sentence more than he would in an entire career. The ""Checkers Speech"" became a political legend. It does not always go well. Lyndon Johnson picked up one of his beagles by the ears, and heard dog lovers howl from coast to coast. In his classic Texas form, Johnson eventually talked his way out of it, but not without a few scratches. Still, one has to wonder, with all the potential for things to go wrong with a dog in the White House, why do presidents almost always have one? Graff has a theory on that, too: ""The presidency is a very lonely undertaking, and I think there are many moments in the White House where what you really want to do is take your pet for a walk.""","Dog lovers and comedians are sinking their canines into tales of Romney and Obama .
The dustups are nothing new; the White House has a long history of animal occupants .

"Rome (CNN) -- Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti handed in his resignation Friday to President Giorgio Napolitano, the Italian government press office said. The move comes after Parliament approved a budget by a vote of 309-55, with five abstentions, said ANSA, the state-run news agency. Monti will outline his plans Sunday but will not say until afterward whether he plans to run in elections expected to be held February 24, ANSA said, citing ""sources."" An economist and former European commissioner, Monti was appointed by Napolitano to fill former premier Silvio Berlusconi's place after he resigned last year under pressure for failing to control Italy's debt and a series of scandals. Since then, international investors have displayed confidence in the country's finances. Italy's borrowing costs have fallen this year on Monti's efforts to bring down borrowing and the improved sentiment generated by the European Central Bank's conditional scheme to buy bonds of struggling sovereigns. Berlusconi has criticized Monti's austerity policies as damaging to the country. Berlusconi's party, the People of Freedom, is the largest in Parliament. While Monti's economic reforms have been popular with investors, earning him the nickname ""Super Mario,"" the measures have not pleased the Italian public, although protests have been more muted than in Spain or Greece. Italy is in a recession, and further belt-tightening will be unpopular with its citizens. The unemployment rate in Italy rose to 11.1% in October, marking a 13-year high, and the Italian economy has contracted for five consecutive quarters. As of the third quarter, its economic growth was down 2.4% from a year earlier. However, investors have welcomed Monti's effort to cut down on the nation's debt, and Italy's borrowing costs have fallen dramatically since the country made economic changes. After drifting above 7% a year ago, the yield on Italy's 10-year government bond has fallen to about 4.5% recently. Monti's term was originally set to expire in mid-2013, but his earlier departure is expected to bring elections forward. Elections must be held within 70 days of the dissolution of Parliament.

"(CNN) -- Former President George W. Bush says he experienced no pleasure when he heard about the death of Osama bin Laden, the al Qaeda leader responsible for orchestrating the deadly terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. ""He was sitting in a restaurant in Dallas when the Secret Service told him that President (Barack) Obama wanted to speak to him. He then learned about the assassination,"" documentarian Peter Schnall told CNN in an interview. Bush ""said to us certainly there was no sense of jubilation (and) certainly no sense of happiness,"" Schnall stressed. ""If anything, he felt that finally there was a sense of closure."" Schnall interviewed the former president as part of a documentary called ""George W. Bush: The 9/11 Interview,"" which is scheduled to air on National Geographic as part of its 10-year anniversary coverage of the 9/11 attacks. The interview covers a broad range of topics tied to Bush's response to the attacks -- a response which remains a source of deep political division both within the United States and overseas. ""We could see in the interview that the president was very taken by the events of that day,"" Schnall said. ""He was very emotional."" Bush told Schnall that initially he thought a light aircraft had hit one of the towers at New York's World Trade Center. ""First I thought it was a light aircraft and my reaction was, man, either the weather was bad, or something extraordinary happened to the pilot,"" Bush said in the interview. But then-White House Chief of Staff ""Andy Card's Massachusetts accent was whispering in my ear -- 'A second plane has hit the second tower. America is under attack.'"" Bush was in a Florida classroom for an education event when he first heard about the attacks. ""Remember ... he's not in Washington. He's literally flying across the country"" in the hours that followed, Schnall told CNN. ""They are literally running from an unknown enemy and they're having to make decisions at 40,000 feet on Air Force One."" Among other things, Bush ordered the military to shoot down commercial planes that failed to respond to a Federal Aviation Administration demand to land as quickly as possible. For a period of time, the president was unsure if that order was responsible for the crash of United Airlines flight 93 near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. ""Those were decisions that (Bush) had to make. ... They troubled him then, and I think they still trouble him now,"" Schnall said. ""What struck me the most was that during those hours, the days of 9/11, the president was overwhelmed"" by events, Schnall added. He was ""overwhelmed in the sense that ... (initially) they didn't really know who the enemy was. They didn't know if there were more attacks about to happen."" Bush ""spoke about that fact that he was journeying through the fog of war."" In light of the intense controversy surrounding the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan -- as well as the broader war on terror that followed the 9/11 attacks -- does the former president have any regrets? Bush ""kind of looked at me ... and said, 'I hate that damn question,'"" Schnall noted. ""He did not ever use the word regret. He did not ever say he would do anything differently. "" But Bush did acknowledge the controversy and division created by his decisions. ""Those decisions that they made ... (have permanently) changed our lives and the world today,"" Schnall said.","George W. Bush was interviewed for a documentary airing on September 11 .

"Washington (CNN) -- A federal appeals court panel is considering whether photos of Osama bin Laden's body should be released. Judicial Watch, a conservative legal group, argued Thursday before a three-judge panel that the Freedom of Information Act requires the government to release the pictures or better explain why the release of specific images would damage national security. The judges, with the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, did not say how soon they may rule. Judicial Watch attorney Michael Bekesha said government records indicate there are 52 images of bin Laden taken just after his death or when his body was aboard the USS Carl Vinson and then buried at sea. During the court hearing, Bekesha argued the shots of the burial at sea could be released without fear of harming national security, but he did not make that claim about the more gruesome images taken just after bin Laden was shot at his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The government has said that there are sensitivities concerning the death of bin Laden and that releasing the pictures could lead to violence against Americans. ""This was the mastermind of 9/11,"" Bekesha said. ""This was the most wanted terrorist in the world."" The government has said bin Laden's body was cleaned in accordance with Islamic practices, then wrapped respectfully and buried at sea, he said. Bekesha said the government has not said how releasing those images would be harmful. The judges took issue with that and said government officials had provided information about previous incidents that led to violence in the Arab world or provided terrorists with fuel for propaganda. Among the examples were the treatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and reports that Americans had desecrated Qurans. ""Why should we not defer to that?"" asked Judge Merrick Garland, who was appointed to the court by President Bill Clinton. ""We are told there is a risk ... that Americans could die if the pictures are released."" Robert Loeb, arguing for the government, noted that al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri made statements that bin Laden's body was not treated in accordance with Muslim traditions in an effort to ""inflame tensions."" In a statement released before the hearing, Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said that ""President Obama is asking the courts to rewrite (the Freedom of Information Act) to allow his administration to withhold documents simply because their disclosure may cause controversy."" Debates over releasing the photos of the al Qaeda leader have raged in some quarters ever since the May 2011 raid in Pakistan that left him dead. The White House said that despite pressure from some lawmakers and dissent within the ranks of the president's top advisers, Obama decided not to release them. ""It is not in our national security interest ... to allow these images to become icons to rally opinion against the United States,"" White House press secretary Jay Carney said at the time. Judicial Watch asked the Defense Department to comply with a Freedom of Information request for material on the raid, including photos of the September 11 instigator lying dead on the third floor of his hideout. A federal judge ruled in April 2012 that there were legitimate national security interests to deny disclosure. ""A picture may be worth a thousand words. And perhaps moving pictures bear an even higher value,"" Judge James Boasberg said. ""Yet, in this case, verbal descriptions of the death and burial of Osama bin Laden will have to suffice."" At the Thursday hearing, Bekesha raised questions about whether the images were properly classified or if that action was taken only in the face of the FOIA request to release them. ""There's no doubt the classification was done beforehand,"" Loeb said. Judicial Watch says its appeal makes clear that the group is not seeking information about equipment or techniques used in the raid. The government has ""failed to provide any evidence that all 52 images, including those depicting bin Laden's burial at sea, pertain to 'foreign activities of the United States,' "" the appeal argues. ""Defendants also have failed to provide any evidence that images depicting the burial at sea actually pertain to 'intelligence activities.' ""Nor have they demonstrated that the release of images of a somber, dignified burial at sea reasonably could be expected to cause identifiable or describable exceptionally grave damage to national security."" CNN's Bill Mears contributed to this report.","NEW: The three-judge panel heard arguments; it did not say how soon it may rule .

"(CNN) -- Authorities believe two Arizona prison escapees and their alleged accomplice may be in the Yellowstone National Park area of Montana and Wyoming, based on recent information, the U.S. Marshals Service said Sunday. John Charles McCluskey, 45, and Tracy Province, 42, are described as armed and dangerous. They have been at large since fleeing an Arizona prison on July 30. A third escaped inmate, Daniel Renwick, 35, was arrested the day after the escape in Rifle, Colorado, where he got in a shootout with police. David Gonzales, the U.S. marshal for Arizona, told CNN that the remaining fugitives are now suspected in the killings of a couple whose bodies were found Wednesday in New Mexico. ""There was evidence that ties them, our suspects, who escaped from prison, directly to their murders,"" Gonzales told CNN. Gonzales said the fugitives have frequented truck stops and campgrounds. He said McCluskey and Province have ""white supremacist leanings"" and could be looking for ""people who are sympathetic to their cause."" Yellowstone sits at the northwest corner of Wyoming and extends a short distance into Montana and Idaho, both states where white supremacist groups have attempted to take root. Thomas Henman, a spokesman for the Marshals Service, said Arizona prison officials have said the convicts belong to the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang, but there was no concrete information to tie them to white supremacist groups outside prison. A team of marshals from Arizona has been working in the Yellowstone area since Sunday morning, along with marshals from Montana and Wyoming and officers from the National Parks Service. He wouldn't divulge the source of the information that has led authorities to Yellowstone, but said it is believed to be very credible. A $40,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the escapees' arrest, he said. McCluskey was serving 15 years for attempted second-degree murder and other charges, while Province was serving a life sentence for murder and armed robbery. A female accomplice helped Province, McCluskey and Renwick escape by throwing cutting tools over a prison fence, according to Charles Ryan, director of Arizona's Department of Corrections. Authorities have identified the suspected accomplice as 43-year-old Casslyn Mae Welch, McCluskey's cousin and fiancee, CNN affiliate KTVK reported. ""Information developed within the past two days indicated the escapees may be hiding in the Yellowstone Park area within Montana and Wyoming,"" U.S. Marshals said in a statement Sunday. ""It is believed Tracy Province has separated from John McCluskey and Casslyn Welch."" The New Mexico Department of Public Safety said Saturday police have forensic evidence linking Province and McCluskey to a couple found slain in New Mexico last week. Two burned bodies were found in a camper Wednesday in Santa Rosa, New Mexico, according to Peter Olson, spokesman for the department. New Mexico police have yet to positively identify the burned bodies, but believe they are Linda and Gary Haas of Oklahoma, whose truck was found 120 miles away in Albuquerque, New Mexico, according to Olson. He would not elaborate on the nature of the forensic evidence. Earlier Saturday, authorities arrested McCluskey's mother and charged her with aiding the escape. Claudia Washburn, 68, was arrested in Jakes Corner, Arizona, and faces charges of conspiracy to facilitate escape and hindering prosecution, Deputy U.S. Marshal Thomas Henman told CNN. Washburn, who is Welch's aunt, allegedly provided ""financial and other aid"" to McCluskey, Province and Welch. A search warrant was executed, and Washburn was being held on $250,000 bond at the Gila County Jail in Globe, Arizona, the U.S. Marshals said. In an interview with CNN Arizona affiliate KTVK, Washburn's husband said that he'd shoot his stepson McCluskey if he saw him again. ""I told the U.S Marshals I haven't got that long to live,"" Jack Washburn said. ""(I'd) serve my time."" After the break, the inmates and the accomplice abducted two truck drivers at gunpoint on Interstate 40 outside of Kingman, Arizona, and hijacked their 18-wheeler, according to the Mohave County sheriff's department in Kingman. The truck drivers and the rig were released five hours later in Flagstaff, about 135 miles to the east. The fugitives were later believed to be driving a 2002 silver Volkswagen Jetta purchased last Saturday in Phoenix. They were later spotted on a security camera in a bank inside a grocery store in Goodyear, Arizona, according to . Barrett Marson, spokesman for the Arizona Department of Corrections. CNN's Chuck Johnston contributed to this report.","U.S. Marshals: The two inmates are believed to have split up .

"Taipei (CNN) -- It's not every territory in the world that puts an Oscar-winning director's name up in lights on a towering building. But that's just the sort of thing that happens in Taiwan -- and it did on Monday night after Ang Lee picked up his second ""Best Director"" Oscar, this time for ""Life of Pi."" The moment wasn't just celebrated in grand statements, but in small scenes played out in front of televisions across Taiwan when his name was announced. I was at a TV station in Taipei that was broadcasting live coverage of the Oscars, working with a team of translators that was creating the subtitles for the rebroadcast. When Lee's name was announced the office erupted in applause. Down the hallway, more cheering could be heard. I couldn't help but think back to the Athens Games in 2004, when Chen Shih-hsin won Taiwan's first ever Olympic gold medal (under the team name ""Chinese Taipei""). Even veteran news anchors shed tears when the young taekwondo star defeated her Cuban rival. It would be reductive to suggest that these displays of patriotism are simply the response of a small country that just doesn't crank out that many Oscar winners or Olympic golds. It also speaks of a place that has been largely marginalized in the international community. Today, Taiwan has just 23 official diplomatic allies -- mostly other marginalized nations, in Central America and Africa. That's because China still sees Taiwan as part of its territory more than 60 years after the Chinese Nationalists retreated to the island at the end of a Civil War against the Communists. The Nationalists -- or Kuomintang -- are now the ruling party in a democratic Taiwan, which is officially called the Republic of China (ROC) -- not to be confused with the People's Republic of China on the Mainland. Having lost its seat at the United Nations to the PRC in 1971, the ROC found itself with a diminished voice in the international community. It turned to manufacturing and technology in the 1980s, spurring on what is now referred to as an ""economic miracle."" Today, with its economy struggling to move past the global economic downturn, Taiwan has added the arts, sports, and even baking to its repertoire. What's striking about Lee's win is that it's not just people in Taiwan who were quick to claim him as one of their own. In China, the state-run Xinhua news agency referred to him as ""Chinese-American."" While Taiwanese media latched onto the portion of Lee's acceptance speech when he thanked Taiwan and the central city of Taichung where much of the movie was filmed, Xinhua's main story included Lee's line of thanks to the 3,000 people who worked on the film for ""believing this story and sharing this incredible journey with me."" In some ways it feels like ""Linsanity"" all over again, when Taiwan and China both claimed basketball star Jeremy Lin as their own, leaving the international media struggling to chart the dangerous waters of identity politics to correctly describe him. VIEW: Photos from the red carpet . A very small voice at the fringe of the discussion wonders why it's important for people to know that Lin's paternal grandmother lives in Taiwan and referred to him as ""a real Taiwanese,"" or that Lee grew up in Tainan and still loves to visit his favorite noodle shop there. Others in Taiwan question why a nation's confidence should be based on its success in the international community. With China looming to the north, now the world's second biggest economy and wielding an influence that's verging on ""superpower"" status, the metaphor of Jonah and the whale comes to mind. The Taiwanese electorate is sharply divided on how it feels about the way ties with China have warmed ever since President Ma Ying-jeou first took office in 2008. The benefits are obvious, considering China is Taiwan's largest trade partner, but some worry that it could lead to a loss in autonomy. INTERACTIVE: Oscars by numbers . The Ma administration has been mindful of the nationalistic rhetoric of the opposition, and although the president was born in Hong Kong, he has referred to himself in the past as ""Taiwanese as well as Chinese."" Ma was also quick to congratulate Lee following the Oscars, and to urge others to follow in the director's footsteps and ""work hard at promoting Taiwan to the world."" Lee is just one name on a growing list of national heroes that both the government and the private sector have celebrated in recent years for putting Taiwan on the map: people like fashion designer Jason Wu, who moved to Canada from Taiwan and has created garments for U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama; master baker Wu Pao-chun, who beat the French patissiers at their own competition -- Les Masters de la Boulangerie in 2010; Yani Tseng, the world's number one female golfer; and even the humble vegetable seller-turned-philanthropist Chen Shu-chu, who was selected by Time Magazine as one of its heroes of 2010. So what are people saying when they embrace these heroes as Taiwanese? They are saying ""Taiwan may be small and diplomatically isolated, but it deserves to have a voice in the international community."" While Lee may not speak about politics and no longer creates movies about Taiwan, he does have a voice and people do listen. And that's worth spreading in lights across the world's second-tallest building. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A German-owned cargo ship was hijacked by pirates in the Gulf of Aden in waters near Somalia that have become notorious for pirate attacks. Pirates continue to attack shipping in the Gulf of Aden despite international naval patrols. The Antigua and Barbuda-flagged ship, named Victoria, was seized Tuesday and 11 Romanian crew members were being held captive, said Lt. Nate Christensen, a U.S. Navy Spokesman. Christensen said he did not know what cargo the ship was carrying. Piracy has been soaring off the coast of eastern Africa -- particularly Somalia, which has not had an effective government since 1991. Somali pirates have defied foreign navies patrolling the waters and have collected large ransoms from shipping companies. Ransoms started out in the tens of thousands of dollars and have since climbed into the millions. Meanwhile, the head of a shipping company recently victimized by pirates off the Somali coast told lawmakers Tuesday that U.S. cargo crews should be allowed to arm themselves in response to the rising hijacking threat. Philip Shapiro, head of Liberty Maritime Corp., told a U.S. Senate Commerce subcommittee that the owners of U.S.-flagged ""have done all they can within the law to protect our crews."" Unfortunately, he said, U.S. vessels are still largely at the mercy of pirates in shipping lanes around the heavily trafficked Gulf of Aden. ""In light of the recent threats to U.S. merchant mariners, we respectfully request that Congress consider clearing the obstacles that currently block ship owners from arming our vessels,"" Shapiro said. Pirates unsuccessfully attempted to board the Liberty Sun, a cargo vessel owned by Shapiro's company, near the Somali coast on April 14. The ship was on a humanitarian relief mission at the time, carrying 47,000 tons of food to Mombassa, Kenya. Pirate leaders later said the attempted hijacking was carried out as revenge after the U.S. Navy killed three pirates involved in a failed attack on the cargo ship Maersk Alabama. The slain pirates were holding Capt. Richard Phillips, who was in charge of the Alabama when it was boarded April 8. ""We've heard some suggestions that U.S.-flagged ship owners have not done enough to protect their vessels,"" Shapiro said. ""That view ... is flat wrong. Our company adopted every measure recommended by the international maritime organizations and required by the Coast Guard's approved security plan for making the vessel a difficult piracy target -- and more.""

"Christchurch, New Zealand (CNN) -- The death toll from the 6.3-magnitude earthquake that demolished parts of Christchurch, New Zealand, last week has climbed to 147, authorities said Sunday. The figure is expected to rise, the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management said. Seventy people have been rescued alive from the quake that struck Tuesday, the agency said. Police in the battered town said Friday that more than 200 people still missing. Many of the missing were feared dead. Included in that were all the people who were in the Canterbury TV building that toppled in the Tuesday earthquake. Police say they have ""grave fears"" for all who were in the building including 90 students and staff from the King's Education language school -- headquartered on the third floor. Donna Tai Rakena's husband Tetaki was an English teacher and was working there when the quake struck. After the shaking ceased, she said she called his cell phone and got no answer. She jumped on her bike and pedaled down to the fallen building to see if she could find her husband in the mess of mangled steel and rubble. Police broke the news to her: Her soul mate of 30 years, the man she affectionately called Wally, was believed to be dead. ""They said they'd gone into recovery mode and there was no hope of anyone coming out alive,"" she said. She now clings to hope that crews will at least find her husband's body. Rescue and recovery crews have been combing through damaged buildings since the quake struck three days ago -- toppling buildings, buckling streets and ripping the facades of iconic churches, including the Christchurch Cathedral and the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament. A series of aftershocks followed. Southern New Zealand has been hit by a series of quakes since September 4 when a 7.1-magnitude temblor struck the area. There were no deaths from that quake, which struck deeper below ground and farther away from Christchurch. Tuesday's earthquake was part of the ""aftershock sequence"" from the September earthquake, the U.S. Geological Survey said.

"(CNN) -- Four years ago, John Brennan withdrew from consideration for C.I.A. director because of his leadership role there while serious human rights violations were occurring, including waterboarding and secret detention. Mr. Brennan has said he regrets these practices. Yet he moved from the CIA to the White House, where he began to support a practice many consider worse than torture: targeted killing. Brennan has been a champion and defender of attacks by C.I.A. drones that have killed thousands of people, including hundreds of children, far from any battlefield. These killings have occurred in Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has recently said the killing is likely to expand to Libya, Mali and Nigeria. Panetta, Brennan and others in the Obama administration defended these lawless killings the same way the Bush administration justified the unlawful treatment of detainees. Officials in both administrations have sought to win public support and overcome opposition by repeatedly asserting that what they are doing is effective and lawful. The tactical parallels are striking. To create an illusion of legality, both administrations coined new labels for unlawful practices. President Bush's people coined the term ""enhanced interrogation methods"" to describe torture, and are still asserting that waterboarding is not torture but an effective, necessary tool to keep the country safe. Brennan unveiled the phrase ""hot battlefield"" in a speech at Harvard Law in September 2011. A ""hot battlefield"" is the type found in traditional armed conflicts, where enemy fighters are killed without warning and it is permissible to also kill civilians, as long as their deaths are unintentional collateral damage and not disproportionate to the military objective. The CIA is killing civilians away from ""hot battlefields,"" but according to Brennan, there are other types of battlefields that are not ""hot"" but nevertheless lawful places to intentionally kill targets and unintentionally those nearby. Opinion: Chuck Hagel is a friend to Israel . The parallels between the two administrations do not end with fabricated terminology. Lawyers in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel in both administrations have written secret memos apparently analyzing the legality of these troubling practices. After the memos were written, waterboarding continued during the Bush administration. President Obama finally ended it with an executive order signed within days of his first inauguration. Guantanamo, however, stayed open, and targeted killing continued. We can safely assume that the memos conclude the United States may lawfully carry out such practices. It is surprising to me that anyone feels the need to actually see these secret memos. International law clearly makes waterboarding, secret detention and targeted killing away from battlefields unlawful. The fact these practices have continued after the writing of the memos demonstrates the analysis is window dressing. The New York Times and the American Civil Liberties Union, among others, have committed significant resources to obtaining the memos on targeted killing. It would, of course, be interesting to compare the specious arguments and omissions that must characterize these memos with those released by the Bush administration on interrogation and detention. Some citizens might actually need to see the memos to finally demand an end to the practice. The greater importance of the secret memos does not concern what they contain, but the fact our democratic government believes legal analysis can be secret -- that how the government understands the law that regulates its conduct need not be made public. The judge in a recent case who ruled the memos might lawfully remain secret has confused the facts of a particular case with the law. Facts about particular operations can be kept secret, but not the law on which such operations are based. If the police seek a warrant, for example, in some cases the identity of a particular person sought under the warrant may be kept confidential. The law mandating the need for the warrant is public. Game playing with the law does not amount to effective counter-terrorism strategy. Brennan admitted as much in his Harvard speech: . ""I've developed a profound appreciation for the role that our values, especially the rule of law, play in keeping our country safe,"" he said. ""It's an appreciation, of course, understood by President Obama. ... That is what I want to talk about this evening: how we have strengthened, and continue to strengthen, our national security by adhering to our values and our laws."" The CIA needs someone who will do what Brennan says, not what he does.

"New York (CNN) -- For the second time in a month, a man has been shoved to his death in front of a train on a New York City subway platform, police said. The New York Police Department on Friday identified the victim as Sunando Sen, 46, of Queens. Police are searching for a woman seen running from an elevated station for the No. 7 train in Queens on Thursday evening, Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said in a statement. According to witnesses, the woman was pacing the platform and talking to herself shortly before pushing the man onto the tracks as the 11-car train entered the station. The man's body was pinned under the second car after it came to a stop. Police describe her as a heavyset woman in her 20s, wearing a ski jacket and sneakers. Security video shows her running from the scene shortly after 8 p.m. Thursday. Sen's roommate, Ar Suman, 33, told CNN on Friday that after living together for over a year they had become like ""family."" ""I came home and I heard this happened,"" said Suman, ""I am feeling very bad."" Sen owned a shop called New Amsterdam Copies and was a graphic designer for posters, according to Suman. In early December, Ki-Suck Han, 58, was shoved onto the tracks in a Times Square station as a train approached.

"(CNN) -- The video game industry has had a slow start to the year, but that's about to change. As the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) takes over the Los Angeles Convention Center this week, the biggest games of this year and next will be showcased in front of 45,000 attendees. With a big slate of blockbusters scheduled to hit retail shelves this holiday, things are looking up for gaming. The game industry is growing rapidly through new business models like free-to-play games, mobile games and cloud-based gaming. But it still relies on big-name titles to fill its coffers and entice gamers to spend an inordinate amount of time on multiplayer experiences online. Like Hollywood, game publishers are counting on bestselling franchises and sequels to attract the growing demographic of people who play games. There are a lot of games at E3, but these five titles will stand out. Collectively they should provide hours of new interactive entertainment to gamers around the world once they're released over the coming year. ""Resident Evil 6"" (Capcom, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PC, October 2, 2012) In a rarity in the game industry, where delays are commonplace, Capcom actually moved up the release date for this much-anticipated horror sequel. The ""6"" in the title holds a deeper meaning, as this ""Resident Evil"" offers three distinct, yet interconnected, two-player cooperative gameplay experiences. Set 10 years after the events that ravaged Raccoon City, these globe-trotting survival horror stories feature six unique characters that gamers control to contend with the new C-Virus plague. The zombies in this game are smarter, faster and even wield weapons, upping the ante and requiring that second player's sharpshooting help. The development team is going for a more Hollywood feel with this blend of action and terror. Gamers will actually get a double-dose of this franchise with Sony Pictures releasing ""Resident Evil: Retribution 3D"" in theaters September 14. ""Halo 4"" (Microsoft, 343 Industries, Xbox 360, November 6, 2012) ""Halo"" developer Bungie has moved on to an original franchise for Activision, leaving Microsoft to turn to new developer 343 Industries for the first in the Reclaimer Trilogy of Halo games. Set four years after the events of ""Halo 3,"" Master Chief returns with a new setting (the planet Requiem) but the same beloved first-person shooter action that has sold over 40 million games around the globe. The new game will further explore the man beneath the mask, John-117, while pushing multiplayer forward. Gamers can create their own Spartan IV warrior for multiplayer and engage in a four-player cinematic adventure in the new Spartan Ops or jump into massive competitive arenas with War Games. All multiplayer will be linked through the UNSC Infinity starship to keep players immersed in this rich sci-fi universe. ""Call of Duty: Black Ops II"" (Activision, Treyarch, PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, November 13, 2012) With the ""Call of Duty"" franchise breaking entertainment launch records every year and raking in over $1 billion per release, developer Treyarch is catapulting the first-person shooter action into the future. ""Call of Duty: Black Ops II"" spans a cinematic storyline that propels the action into 2025, although some backstory gameplay will focus on the 1980s. With American cities like Los Angeles under attack from flying drones and robots, players must contend with terrorist Raul Menendez, who's turned America's own military technology against itself. Treyarch is introducing more open-world gameplay to the mix and promises a more robust multiplayer experience (with all those new drones and robots), as well as an expanded Zombies mode with more undead enemies to contend with. ""Crysis 3"" (Electronic Arts, Crytek, PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, 2013) Crytek returns to a future Big Apple, circa 2047, in this first-person shooter, although New York has never looked quite like this. Players will explore a massive Nanodome called the New York City Liberty Dome, which offers a diverse range of environments known as the Seven Wonders. Taking control of the Nanosuit-armed Prophet, skyscrapers have been replaced by an urban rainforest teeming with overgrown trees, dense swamplands and raging rivers. It's within this landscape that players will hunt Ceph aliens and Cell Corporation henchmen using a composite bow (armed with the latest technology) and an assortment of high-powered weapons from Earth and beyond.

"(CNN) -- A bus taking a group of friends to Florida for a holiday cruise ran off the interstate and into trees early Monday, killing the driver and injuring 30 passengers, South Carolina police and a bus company employee said. The bus ran off Interstate 26 and into trees near Ridgeville, South Carolina, northwest of Charleston. The bus with about 60 people ran off Interstate 26 about three miles west of Ridgeville, South Carolina, said state Highway Patrol spokesman Bob Beres. The crash happened just after 1 a.m. ET, about 45 miles from St. Stephen, South Carolina, where the passengers boarded the bus, Beres said. A passenger, who was listed in serious condition, was taken by helicopter to a Charleston hospital. Another 30 passengers were taken to hospitals in private cars and ambulances, Beres said.

"(CNN) -- Outside my window, the wind is starting to die down, although it still comes through in gusts, sending branches and debris tumbling down the deserted street outside. The power's been out since 4 a.m. Life has skidded to a slow crawl, with no data available on my smartphone and no Internet to tell me when the storm might subside. It's just me inside my shelter, listening to the howl of the weather and racing to eat everything in the fridge before it spoils and has to be tossed into a garbage bag. Some people in New Orleans party before a storm starts or even after it begins. Young voices hollered and whooped down the street last night, kids running through the rain with bottles in their hands. In the meantime, I stood on the porch as the wind started to pick up. Waiting. Hurricane Isaac photos . Luckily, I made sure to charge up all my laptops before the power went out. In the dark, I sit in front of a rectangular glowing screen, a reminder that my separation from technology is only temporary until someone comes and repairs the lines. Soon, I'll be connected to the world again. For now, I send texts from time to time, just to make sure others are OK, to let them know I am thinking of them as we sit in the darkness listening to the world outside. Some might describe the feeling that comes with waiting for a hurricane to arrive as fear, anxiety or anger. To me, it's not quite any of those things. It's closer to surrender. Growing up, my grandmother told me stories of Hurricane Betsy that engraved themselves on my memory. In their home on Desire Street in the Ninth Ward, they stayed put when they heard that weather was coming, with none of the advanced ways to communicate about the threat of a storm that we have now. New Orleans: The food that got them through . When Betsy hit in 1965, my grandmother watched as the floodwaters gushed from the floor furnace in the hallway of their home, spilling across the living room floor. I listened, frozen in awe, as she described to me those first moments of panic, how everyone stood there and watched it, the long seconds before my mother screamed with fear. They made a mad scramble into the attic, listening to the wind batter the walls of the house as the water slowly rose up the stairs. When it drew too close, my uncle chopped a hole in the roof so they wouldn't drown. They used a bedsheet to tie themselves together so they wouldn't fall after they made their way out into the wind. Luckily, right before they climbed out of the hole, the rain stopped. I grew up not with a fear of hurricanes but rather a conviction that they had to be dealt with using a mix of careful planning and complete concession to the whims of nature. Those vivid images from my grandmother's stories never left me. She was a figure of courage to me, a devoted survivor. A love letter to Louisiana . When Hurricane Katrina destroyed the home where my mother and grandmother raised me, we were lucky enough not to be in it. They were evacuated to the Hotel Intercontinental in the French Quarter and were there for days without power. Later, my mother described to me how the entire building shook from side to side while the winds tore through the city. She smiles now when she tells the story, because she knows how close it was, how fortunate they were to be airlifted out in the end. I moved to Los Angeles not long after the storm, leaving New Orleans and my own flooded apartment behind me. The majority of what I owned was destroyed. Since I didn't have the capability to deal with what had happened, I chose to run in the other direction. But now I've returned. My grandmother never sought help for her post-traumatic stress symptoms after Betsy. In a way, I couldn't blame her. It was unspoken between us, but I knew there was something about that kind of grief that was both a secret and a treasure. Admitting it meant admitting how much life had hurt you. It was easier to carry it silently. As I watched Isaac draw up the mouth of the Mississippi River on the same August day that Katrina did seven years ago, I felt a sense of calm. I'm calm still as I sit in the dark, looking at the frayed electrical wires dangling from the poles outside the window. That's how a hurricane feels to me. It's coming face to face with something of great power, and knowing it's OK to be small and vulnerable in the face of it. From my parents' experiences, I know you can fight these things. I also know you can choose to accept them absolutely rather than struggle. If Isaac had been a stronger storm, I would have left. After so many years of hurricanes, you start to develop the same feel for them that a farmer does when he licks a finger and sticks it in the air to find out which way the wind is blowing. Monday night, as I walked home, the breeze was gentle and lovely, like a missive sent in advance of Isaac's arrival. I'll be there soon, it said. But you'll withstand me.

"(CNN) -- When Barack Obama is sworn in as president January 20, there will be music -- by, among others, Aretha Franklin, Yo-Yo Ma, Itzhak Perlman and the U.S. Marine Band. There will be prayers and speeches -- including Obama's inaugural address. And for the fourth time in the nation's 56 inauguration ceremonies, there will be poetry -- by someone far less well-known. Elizabeth Alexander says poetry can help solve problems by looking at them from a fresh angle. After the president's speech, Elizabeth Alexander will read a poem she is writing for the occasion. Alexander is a 46-year-old Yale University professor and a friend and former faculty colleague of Obama's. She joins three other poets who have read at inaugural ceremonies -- Robert Frost in 1961 for John F. Kennedy's inauguration and Maya Angelou and Miller Williams, who read at Bill Clinton's 1993 and 1997 inaugurations. Alexander has written five books of poetry, including ""American Sublime,"" a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2005. Her father is Clifford Alexander, secretary of the Army in the Carter administration, and her mother teaches history at George Washington University. Her brother is an adviser to Obama's transition team. Alexander's view of poetry is captured in a few lines from ""American Sublime"" (Graywolf Press): . Poetry is what you find / in the dirt in the corner, . overhear on the bus, God / in the details, the only way . to get from here to there. / Poetry (and now my voice is rising) is not all love, love, love, / and I'm sorry the dog died. Poetry (here I hear myself loudest) / is the human voice, . and are we not of interest to each other? Alexander spoke Friday to CNN.com. CNN: What do you think is the role of a poet in a ceremony like this? Alexander: I think that the fact that President-elect Obama has decided to have a poem in this ceremony is a wonderful affirmation to the power of language, the way in which poetry gives us distilled and mindful and careful language that can both give us a moment of pause, a moment of contemplation and that can also ... look at the world from a slightly different angle. CNN: You met Barack Obama when you were both teaching at the University of Chicago? Alexander: In the community in Hyde Park, he and Mrs. Obama were just people I'd heard about for a long time and heard wonderful things about, and we were of a generation. ... He was in the law school, and I was in the Department of English so our day-to-day work didn't really cross so much. ... [We were in] the community of people who were at that time in our early 30s, thinking about the different ways that we could contribute to improving things with whatever skills we had -- political skills, intellectual skills, skills in the discipline of law, in literature, artistic skills. That was the common ground, thinking about how we could contribute to bettering our community. CNN: And you did it by writing? Alexander: By writing and teaching. I've been a professor for many years now, and I now teach in the African-American studies department and the English Department at Yale. ... My teaching is incredibly important to me ... helping people see that the study of African-American history and culture is fundamental to understanding this country that we live in. It's been wonderful to be able to share those riches of the culture over the years. CNN: We have this historical moment, the 80th birthday of the Rev. Martin Luther King, the inauguration of the first African-American president. How does that resonate with you? Alexander: It's amazing, isn't it? I just shake my head and say, ""Isn't that something?"" The civil rights struggle in this country and in the world is not over because we have an African-American president. At the same time, this must be recognized as a tremendous moment in our nation's history. I can't tell you how many older people have said to me, ""I never thought I'd live to see this day."" The fact that this country has -- with a multiracial coalition -- elected an extraordinary president who is African-American really does feel like just an exquisite moment for us to savor even as we recognize there's still a tremendous amount of work ahead of us. CNN: What's ahead of us? Alexander: Oh my goodness, so much. There are wars or conflicts in many different places, there are potentially incipient conflicts in different places, there's the tremendous challenge of the economy. ... The larger metaphysical challenge is to think about how to work together in new ways that are, if not post-partisan -- because I don't think there's anything wrong with partisanship per se -- borne of new coalitions. Within our communities large and small, making new coalitions and finding common ground is absolutely what we're going to have to do in order to make things better. CNN: Can poetry help in that regard? Alexander: I do believe that it can. The way in which poetry models precise and mindful language is useful, because after all if we can't be precise with language, how can we share ideas? Also the felicity of art ... the way in which it makes you draw a breath and look at the world in a different way is very useful to the process of thinking through new solutions. You can look straight in front of you and never get any yield to a problem, but if you can look around the back of it or step to the side of it, those are the ways that we experience some movement with calcified problems. CNN: So you're going to write a poem about health care? Alexander: That would be fun. Of course, this [poem for the inauguration] is an occasional poem, it has to serve the moment, it has to serve the day, right? So those are the challenges of writing something that makes sense at this moment on this particular day. But of course, what I hope to do, rather than the laundry list poem, is to find language that will hopefully have a little resonance after the day is done. CNN: Will you show it to anybody before you read it? Alexander: I show it to my husband [artist Ficre Ghebreyesus] , and he is my first, last and best critic. CNN: You wrote an essay about Gwendolyn Brooks [the Pulitzer Prize-winning African-American poet] in which you said that ""the pressure on creative work can be intense for artists who belong to groups still struggling for their fair shake in society."" And then later on you said you've seen your work ""overpraised by narrow-minded white critics"" and ""criticized small-mindedly by more than one black woman elder poet -- the same poets I imagined would be pleased by it."" Your work is read very differently depending on who's reading it? Alexander: I think what I was trying to say is that at the end of the day, demographics doesn't really tell you about how your work is going to be received. ... On the one hand, I have devoted much of my work to African-American culture. That's my group, that's who I am, [I'm] proud and unambiguous about that -- but at the same time, one of the really great discoveries of a life in poetry has been that poetry is quirky. It reaches people unexpectedly. You really, really can't predict who is going to connect with various aspects of your work. That's been a real gift to me; it's made me try not to assume too much about who thinks what and who is able to gain something from work. CNN: You have two children? Alexander: Two sons, 9 and 10. CNN: How do they feel about the poem? Alexander: They are so excited, and that's of course a lovely thing. And in the excitement, we still live in our every day, so mommy is still mommy, and all the mommy things are expected of me, and that's the way I like it. CNN: What are your tastes in music? Alexander: Jazz is the music that I know deepest and love the most, and I mean jazz across the board because that's an incredibly diverse art, and also I must say, R&B, funk and soul speak very powerfully to me. CNN: Favorite artists? Alexander: Thelonious Monk is quite a favorite artist. Marvin Gaye, John Coltrane, and also the breadth and accomplishment over a career of Duke Ellington. CNN: And Aretha Franklin? Alexander: Can you imagine? I get to hear her at close range. Boy, that's going to be my gift for the year.","Elizabeth Alexander will be fourth poet to read at an inauguration .

"(CNN) -- In recent days, the South Carolina Republican primary has been referred to as the Super Bowl, ground zero and even ""Armageddon."" This hyperbole has been matched by the outrageous amount of money being spent here on political TV advertising: $11.3 million. Why? There is a lot at stake in Saturday's contest, and the campaigns know it. Without a strong finish, candidates will find that cash, supporters and key endorsements dry up. With it, they'll live to fight another day. Either way, South Carolina Republicans will most likely continue their tradition of picking the candidate who turns out to be the GOP nominee, something they have done since 1980. Here is a political primer from an actual South Carolinian who is a veteran of many of these battles: . First: Does the South Carolina GOP primary deserve its reputation as a take-no-prisoners, bare-knuckled battleground, like the media keep saying? Yes. Post-New Hampshire, my tweet urged the candidates to ""bring their big boy pants."" We have a long tradition here of hard-hitting attacks, both on the air and below the radar. This year is no different. We don't just pick a candidate, we pick presidents here in South Carolina. Most of the campaigning is done in 15 GOP-leaning counties, which account for 80% of the vote, with a focus on a ""Super Seven"" that make up more than 52% of the vote. Those seven pit the Upstate social conservatives against the laissez-faire crowd along the Coast. In South Carolina, we don't register by parties; the GOP primary is open to all those who call themselves Republicans. Our voters are a much more diverse group than those in Iowa and New Hampshire. Yes, Christian conservatives dominate the GOP here, but victory in South Carolina means you have successfully appealed to a wide variety of Republican concerns. It means you have the support of fiscal conservatives (Coast and Upstate), social conservatives (Upstate and all around), transplanted retirees (Upstate and Coastal Low Country), business owners (Statewide) and veterans (Midlands and Coast). Yes, many of us do cling to our Bibles, our guns, and also to our status as a right-to-work state. We are not big fans of the federal government. (Example: The National Labor Relations Board recently tried to prevent Boeing from building a multibillion-dollar plant in Charleston that would create thousands of jobs because the board's counsel said Boeing was punishing workers in Washington state for union activity; the NLRB has since dropped the case.) But I would be lying if I said the majority of South Carolina GOP voters are strongly anti-government. Most here think there is a role for the government, but we disagree on just how big it should be. Like everywhere else, the key issue here is jobs. Yes, social issues matter a lot to voters. Immigration reform matters. Taxes and defense issues matter. But jobs and economic development matter most in 2012. Our 9.9% statewide unemployment puts us ahead of the national average and is partially due to a lack of jobs in rural areas. And yet, other areas are doing fairly well. Consider that this past week, BMW announced a new $900 million investment that is expected to bring 300 new jobs, for starters, to Spartanburg in the Upstate. Along with the German automaker, we are also home to Michelin, Hitachi, Boeing (no thanks to the NLRB), Milliken and many other manufacturers. We have thousands of small-business owners who take personal and professional risks every single day, creating jobs and opportunities for their families and communities. It is against this backdrop that close to 400,000 voters will cast their ballots Saturday. Each is really focused on one overriding theme: beating President Obama. They will come from across the GOP spectrum, not just those hard-core ideologues that seem to make the most news. To give you an example, consider that on Sunday, Mitt Romney secured the endorsement of The Greenville News, in the heart of the social conservatives. Jon Huntsman, before dropping out of the race, received the endorsement of The State, of Columbia. Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich are doing their best to recover from missteps and misstatements, and, well, Ron Paul is Ron Paul. And of course, Rick Santorum is hoping to somehow capitalize on the support of the faith-based community after a conclave of evangelical leaders in Texas threw their support to him this past weekend. This will be more difficult with Perry and Gingrich still in the race, splitting the evangelical vote. As for results, barring a major mistake, I think Romney -- who is, and has consistently been, running well ahead of his rivals -- will be the last man standing here Saturday night. And once again, South Carolina will have done her job. Join CNN Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on Twitter.

"(CNN) -- A few thousand Muscovites braved police and subzero temperatures to mark the first anniversary of Russia's anti-Putin movement at an unsanctioned protest in central Moscow. While turnout was significantly lower than last winter's rallies, which at one point attracted more than 100,000 people, those that came faced more serious consequences, including jail and fines of more than $9,500 -- nearly the average monthly Russian salary. Hundreds of riot police cordoned off protesters who gathered next to the headquarters of the Russia's FSB security service and the former home of the KGB during the Soviet Union. Alexei Navalny, the popular anti-corruption blogger, and Sergei Udaltsov, a leftist activist, were detained by police immediately upon arriving, as were Ksenia Sobchak, the socialite turned opposition leader, and her boyfriend the activist Ilya Yashin. All four were taken to a police station in the south of Moscow but released within hours. Police initially allowed the crowd gather peacefully, but after an hour began closing in on specific protesters who they arrested in often brutal scenes. An estimated 40 people were detained. The rally was the first major protest to not receive approval from Moscow authorities, a sign of hardening relations between the city government and opposition leaders who refused to hold the rally at alternative locations suggested by the state. The demonstration is unlikely to breathe new life into the opposition, which has struggled to find direction since Vladimir Putin's re-election in March. Yet the turnout was arguably higher than expected given the threat of violence and fines. In the days before the rally, the state appeared to issue a warning to the demonstrators, announcing that a criminal investigation had been opened into Mr Navalny and his brother, and raiding the home of an associate of Mr Udaltsov. ""It was very scary for me to come. I cried this morning,"" said Tatiana, 52, who did not want to give her last name for fear of getting in trouble with her employer. She said once she had arrived at the rally she had become more confident, and had dared to affix to her coat lapel a pin that read ""We were at Bolotnya . . . Arrest me!"" -- a reference to the first major protest last year. ""They say that there we don't exist, but today we showed them that we do. Their laws created by an illegitimate regime an illegitimate president are not an order for us. We are in charge here . . . We will come out on to the streets again,"" she said. With no speeches or performances, the protest lacked the euphoria that coloured the demonstrations of a year ago. But those present insisted that were optimistic that change and reform would come, no matter how gradual. ""Over the past year, nothing particularly changed in politics. However, I think society has started thinking a bit about what needs to be done,"" said Ivan Kosnisky, a designer. ""We need to change from within. I don't know if there is a universal recipe. But we need to stop being indifferent and start thinking of things that are located outside our own apartments."" He added: ""I see the faces here I usually see at the Moscow Conservatory or the Tretyakovsky art gallery. It's simply pleasant for me to chat here with these people who are clearly of the same mind.""","Demonstrators mark anniversary of anti-Putin movement at an unsanctioned protest .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Attempting to forecast future events is a dangerous pastime. Who could have predicted the spectacular fall of Chinese politician Bo Xilai, once a rising political star, or the stunning escape of blind activist Chen Guangcheng from house arrest? But forecasting is useful for journalists who should be primed to anticipate the dominant trends ahead. So, adding to what's already out there, here goes. These are the five key China stories I'll be looking out for in 2013: . US-China tensions . The U.S. is wary of China's military growth and economic might, while China is wary of America's pivot to Asia and President Barack Obama's increasingly tough line on trade. But in 2013, there will be more immediate points of friction between the two giants. Xie Tao, a professor of Political Science at Beijing Foreign Studies University, underlines three specific trends to watch: ""Number one, whether Barack Obama will sell weapons to Taiwan in January; second, whether China will continue to block U.S. efforts to resolve the crisis in Syria; and number three, Iran."" Tao adds: ""I'm not quite optimistic about peaceful cooperation between the two countries, but in the longer term, I'm more optimistic than many other scholars of the U.S.-China relationship."" China's Own Pivot to Asia . As the U.S. makes its strategic pivot to Asia, China has been considering its own relationships in its backyard. Beijing is out to ink trade deals with Japan and South Korea while actively expanding trade ties with Southeast Asian countries like Laos and Myanmar. The New York Times' Beijing-based Chief Diplomatic Correspondent Jane Perlez tells me: ""China is a cash power in Southeast Asia. They're spending billions of dollars on roads and rail through the countries of Southeast Asia, that will enable goods to come up through China, then back down through China, and will knit the whole region together."" But given the ongoing tension with South Korea, Philippines and Japan over disputed islands in the South China Sea, as well as tension within Myanmar over China's mineral mining operations, will Beijing lose the diplomatic war for hearts and minds in the region? The Party's Priority: Cleaning up corruption . The Chinese Communist Party is facing a number of challenges that are undercutting its legitimacy: A widening rich-poor divide, a desperate need for social reforms, political corruption, and a spate of sex scandals involving Party officials. As such, the Communist Party must make cleaning up its own domestic affairs a top priority. Political commentator and columnist Frank Ching believes the new leadership's top agenda is cleaning up the Party itself, adding this observation from the recent 18th Party Congress in Beijing: ""When Xi Jinping came out to introduce members of the Standing Committee, he did not mention foreign policy at all. He didn't say anything about international relations. I think that's because he realizes China's most serious problems are domestic ones, and he's going to have to focus on those first."" China's Smartphone Boom . China, the world's biggest Internet market, is forecast to overtake the U.S. in smartphone shipments and become the world's leading smartphone market this year, according to research group IDC. With some retailing for as low as $160, China's cheap smartphones will make a huge social impact through China. According to Josh Ong, China Editor of The Next Web: ""It's becoming more and more possible for Chinese consumers to skip bulky desktops or even laptops and netbooks and rely solely on their phones as their primary computing devices. Students, migrant workers, and even rural citizens stand to benefit greatly from the rise of affordable smartphones."" As more Chinese venture online (and on microblogs) via their smartphones, there will be greater public outcry and protest, as well as greater pressure on the government to manage the added censorship load. ""We have seen the beginnings of a digital accountability system. If nearly everyone has the means to record and instantaneously broadcast their surroundings, it will keep most people from acting out,"" says Ong. China to the Moon . In the second half of 2013, China's Chang-e III is expected to land on the moon. Once the lunar rover touches down on the lunar surface, expect a massive wave of propaganda touting its scientific might. China is still on a high after setting a deep-sea diving record in the Mariana Trench and successfully docking the Shenzhou-9 with the Tiangong 1 space lab in the same week earlier this year. But China on the moon will do far more than stir national pride. It will cement China's own age of discovery for the world to admire and, in certain corners of the globe, fear. Chinese explorer Wong How Man says the message of China's space program is clear and highly symbolic. ""We're in space... not just making cellphones.""","U.S. wary of China's military, economic growth, while China is wary of America's pivot to Asia .
China will also be considering its own often fractious relationships in its backyard .
Corruption will also be a key issue for the new Chinese leadership in 2013 .
Space exploration will continue as a symbolic marker for China's development ."

"(CNN) -- West Indies batsman Chris Gayle entered the record books on day two of the first Test with Sri Lanka by hitting a majestic 333. Gayle became only the fourth player in history to register his second triple-hundred -- matching the feat of Australian legend Don Bradman, fellow West Indian Brian Lara and Virender Sehwag, of India. The opener's huge total allowed the West Indies to compile a mammoth 580-9 declared in their first innings, with Sri Lanka reaching 54-1 in reply before play closed for the day. Resuming overnight on 219, Gayle went on to compile the 12th highest Test total ever and the first ever triple-century by a West Indies player away from home. Gayle took 437 balls to complete his highest ever score, surpassing the 317 he made against South Africa at Antigua in 2005, and hit 34 fours and nine sixes. The highest ever score in Test matches is held by Lara, who hit 400 not out against England at the Antigua Recreation Ground in 2003. Adrian Barath, Darren Bravo and Brendan Nash also hit half centuries as the West Indies declared on 580. Andre Russell dismissed Sri Lankan opener Tillakaratne Dilshan for a duck but Kumar Sangakkara and Tharanga Paranavitana helped the hosts to 54-1 at the close. Meanwhile, a double century from Brendon McCullum ensured New Zealand drew the second Test with India in Hyderabad. The Kiwi hit 225 as the visitors reached 448-8 in their second innings before declaring. India, needing an implausible 327 for victory, made 68-0 before the close. The series remains 0-0 with just one match to play, starting in Nagpur on Saturday. Elsewhere, Younus Khan hit an unbeaten 131 as South Africa and Pakistan drew the first Test in Dubai. Younus shared a partnership of 186 with skipper Misbah-ul-Haq on his first Test appearance for 16 months before the teams decided on a draw with Pakistan requiring 108 runs to win from 13 overs. The second and final Test of the series starts in Abu Dhabi on Saturday.","West Indies batsman Chris Gayle hits 333 in first Test against Sri Lanka .

"(CNN) -- Additional evidence found with a man shot to death by police further links him to the shooting deaths of five people in upstate South Carolina, authorities said on Tuesday. Homicide suspect Patrick Tracy Burris, 41, was fatally shot by police in North Carolina on Monday. Reggie Lloyd, director of South Carolina's State Law Enforcement Division, would not elaborate in a conference call with reporters on the items found with 41-year-old Patrick Tracy Burris, but said they appear to have ""come from the victims."" Burris was shot to death by police early Monday in Dallas, North Carolina. Authorities said they believe he is the man who killed five people in Gaffney, South Carolina, since June 27. Police are attempting to unravel Burris' lengthy criminal history. Lloyd on Tuesday said it raises the question of ""what ... the citizens in South Carolina and in this country deserve. And to me, they deserve better than to have somebody with a 25-page rap sheet out on the street with them."" Listed as a ""habitual felon"" in North Carolina corrections records, Burris was released from prison April 29 after serving nearly eight years. His minimum sentence -- on several 2001 felony breaking and entering and larceny convictions -- was seven years and nine months; his maximum was 10 years and a month, said George Dudley, spokesman for the North Carolina Department of Correction. As a condition of Burris' release, he was placed on nine months of supervised parole, Dudley said. After he failed to make his set curfew on several occasions, ""numerous attempts were made to contact him,"" he said. After those attempts, Burris' parole officer concluded he had violated his parole and put the process in motion to revoke it -- a process that ultimately would have landed him back behind bars. It was that warrant, on parole violation, out of Lincoln County, North Carolina, that officers attempted to serve on Burris after finding him and checking his background early Monday. But he shot at authorities, who returned fire, killing him, police said. Dudley said corrections officials feel they did their duty, but were surprised at the Gaffney deaths. ""We feel sorry for the people in Gaffney and elsewhere,"" he said. Burris had six infractions listed on his corrections records during his incarceration, but Dudley said the infractions were nothing ""that would have made someone think that he might do what he did."" Lloyd, however, said burglary is considered a violent crime in South Carolina, and that Burris' history includes armed robbery. He also has weapons charges ""coming out of his ear,"" he said. ""I consider those violent."" The federal system punishes habitual criminals much more harshly, he said, and states should follow suit. Although Burris was born in Maryland, he spent many years in Rockingham County, North Carolina, said that county's sheriff, Sam Page. Most of his convictions originated there. Page noted, however, that Burris' record in that county contains only property crimes -- extortion, blackmail, larceny -- and ""no real crimes of violence."" He recalled investigating an extortion case in which Burris was thought to have forced an elderly man to write a check to him, but said the man was not willing to testify against Burris. Police in Dallas, North Carolina, responding to a call of a possible burglary early Monday encountered three people at a home -- two who lived there and the third who was an acquaintance, said Bill Blanton, sheriff of Cherokee County, South Carolina. They checked Burris' background and found the warrant, triggering the shootout. One officer was shot in the leg, but was treated and released at a hospital. About 100 investigators from North and South Carolina were working the case, Blanton said Monday. Gaffney is in Cherokee County. Peach farmer Kline W. Cash was believed to be the first of Burris' victims, according to police. He was shot to death June 27. Cash's wife found him dead in their home, and the house might also have been robbed, Blanton said. Four days later, the bound and shot bodies of Hazel Linder, 83, and her 50-year-old daughter, Gena Linder Parker, were found in the home where Linder lived alone. Authorities were still attempting to determine whether anything was taken from that home, Blanton told reporters Monday. The last victims were Stephen Tyler, 48, and his 15-year-old daughter, Abby Tyler. Stephen Tyler was pronounced dead at the scene of the shooting last week in the family's furniture and appliance store. His daughter, shot in the same incident, died Saturday. Authorities said on Monday that tests showed the gun found with Burris matched the weapon used in the killings in Gaffney, about 20 miles northeast of Spartanburg, South Carolina, and 55 miles southwest of Charlotte, North Carolina. As for the two people found at the North Carolina home with Burris, ""We have nothing to suggest they were potential victims,"" Lloyd said Tuesday. Authorities are interested in the two, however, regarding their possible association with Burris, he said. Page described Burris as physically intimidating, about 6 feet 7 inches tall and weighing about 300 pounds. ""Some people go to prison and learn how to be better and correct themselves,"" Page said, but Burris apparently did not. ""You never know what people are going to do.""","Items found with Burris appear to have ""come from the victims,"" official says .

"(CNN) -- Like so many U.S. service members before them, the bodies of Sgt. Phillip Jenkins and Pvt. James McClamrock returned late Thursday to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, the most recent deaths of the war in Iraq. But in some ways, the differences in their deaths couldn't be more striking than the 4,400 that came before them. The men, who died Tuesday, are the first two Americans killed in Iraq since the United States ended its combat role there after seven years. A September 1 ceremony, held at Al Faw Palace in Baghdad, marked the conclusion of the U.S. combat mission dubbed Operation Iraqi Freedom and the transfer to the assistance mission, named Operation New Dawn. In their new role, U.S. troops are expected to advise and assist Iraq's security forces, back Iraqi troops in counterterrorism missions and protect American civilians there during a transitional period. Some 50,000 American troops remain in Iraq. Unless the United States and Iraq forge a new agreement, all U.S. troops are scheduled to depart Iraq by the end of 2011. Ironically, Jenkins and McClamrock were killed by an Iraqi soldier. The attack occurred inside an Iraqi army commando compound when the soldier, clad in an Iraqi army uniform, fired on the U.S. soldiers near the Salaheddin province city of Tuz, the U.S. military said. The attacker was shot and killed. Maj. Gen. Mohammed al-Askari, a Defense Ministry spokesman, identified the shooter as Soran Rahman, from the Iraqi army's 4th Division. Al-Askari said Rahman got into a fight with U.S. soldiers, and then pulled his weapon and fired on them before he was fatally shot. A joint U.S.-Iraqi investigation into the incident is under way. The soldiers were part of a security element for a U.S. company commander who was meeting with members of Iraqi security forces at the compound. The bodies of Jenkins and McClamrock arrived at Dover on a cool, clear night, along with the bodies of two Marines killed in Afghanistan. A military chaplain prayed over their transfer cases before they were unloaded from a military charter and brought before their families -- families that may not have expected to lose loved ones after America's military role was over. CNN's Kelly Marshall contributed to this report.","U.S. combat operations in Iraq ended September 1 .

"Rome (CNN) -- Italian President Giorgio Napolitano on Saturday dissolved the country's parliament, following the resignation of Prime Minister Mario Monti. New elections will beheld on February 24-25, according to a statement posted on the president's website. Monti was appointed prime minister last year after the resignation of former premier Silvio Berlusconi. Monti has not indicated whether he will run in the new elections, while Berlusconi says he will. Monti resigned Friday after Parliament approved the budget. An economist and former European commissioner, Monti was appointed by Napolitano after Berlusconi stepped down under pressure for failing to control Italy's debt and a series of scandals. Since then, international investors have displayed confidence in the country's finances. Italy's borrowing costs have fallen this year on Monti's efforts to bring down borrowing and the improved sentiment generated by the European Central Bank's conditional scheme to buy bonds of struggling sovereigns. Berlusconi has criticized Monti's austerity policies as damaging to the country. Berlusconi's party, the People of Freedom, is the largest in Parliament.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Indian police have arrested three suspects named in a suicide note left by a teenager who claimed she had been gang raped, as anger in the country grows over the rising number of violent crimes committed against women. The 17-year-old girl died Wednesday after ingesting poison, according to Paramjit Singh Gill, the inspector-general of police in the Patiala district of Punjab in the country's north. In her suicide note, the girl blamed her alleged rapists for causing her death. Three of the suspects, including a female accomplice, have since been arrested, Gill said. The unnamed girl claimed she was gang-raped during the Hindu festival of Diwali on November 13. However, a formal case wasn't registered by police until 14 days later. Two police officers involved in the case have been fired and another has been suspended for their handling of the rape complaint. Gill said an investigation was underway into allegations made by the girl's family that the officers pressured her to withdraw her complaint. The teenager's death comes after days of mass protests over the gang-rape of a 23-year-old woman on a bus in New Delhi on December 16. The victim in that case died early Saturday. Read more: India gang-rape victim in Singapore for treatment . Her attackers were alleged to have assaulted the woman and her male companion, robbing them of their belongings before dumping them at the side of a road, according to a police statement. Six suspects are now under arrest, including the bus driver and a minor. The woman's male companion has since been discharged from hospital, but the violent sexual assault left the woman near death and in need of intensive care. She was flown to Singapore for treatment on Thursday where doctors described her condition as ""extremely critical."" She ""passed away peacefully"" at 4:45 a.m. Saturday (3:45 p.m. ET Friday), with her family and Indian officials at her side, Dr. Kelvin Loh, chief executive officer at Mount Elizabeth Hospital, in Singapore, said in a statement. ""Our medical team's investigations upon her arrival at the hospital ... showed that in addition to her prior cardiac arrest, she also had infection of her lungs and abdomen, as well as significant brain injury,"" Loh said after the woman had been brought to his hospital. Authorities haven't released the name of the rape victim, but protesters are calling her ""Damini,"" which means ""lightning"" in Hindi. ""Damini"" is also a 1993 Bollywood film whose lead female character fights for a housemaid, a victim of a sexual assault. The brutal attack triggered a wave of protests that started in the Raisina Hills area of New Delhi on Saturday, and spread to other areas of the city. Demonstrators marched through the streets waving signs that read, ""Hang them till death,"" and ""Stop this shame."" Police aimed water cannon at the crowd, after some demonstrators tried to break through the security barriers erected around the government district, parliament building and presidential palace. Protesters claimed they were injured in clashes, and returned to the streets on Sunday shouting anti-government slogans. More demonstrations were held on Thursday, when elderly and middle-aged women joined younger students to demand greater action and protection. They say the government is not doing enough to address the alarming incidence of rape in India. Reported rape cases have surged more than tenfold over the past 40 years -- from 2,487 in 1971 to 24,206 in 2011, according to official figures. New Delhi alone reported 572 rapes last year and more than 600 in 2012. The government announced plans Thursday to ""name and shame"" convicted rapists by posting their names, images and addresses on official websites, according to the Times of India. Read more: Opinion: India's rape problem needs a rewiring of society's attitude . Meanwhile, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh described the safety of women as his government's ""highest concern"" in a meeting with senior government officials. ""Women and girls represent half the population and our society has not been fair to this half. Their socio-economic status is improving, but gaps persist,"" he said in a speech Thursday. ""The emergence of women in public spaces, which is an absolutely essential part of social emancipation, is accompanied by growing threats to their safety and security,"" Singh said. He reiterated that the December 16 bus rape case would be dealt with in a speedy manner. ""There can be no meaningful development without the active participation of half the population and this participation simply cannot take place if their security and safety are not assured,"" Singh said. Seema Sirohi, from the Indian Council on Global Relations, told CNN that most women in India had their own stories of sexual harassment and abuse. ""To be a woman in India is not an easy proposition. Every woman has experienced some kind of abuse on public transportation, lewd remarks on the street. No matter how conservatively you are dressed, you are still open season for the men,"" she said. ""There are a lot of reasons why this happens, but the patriarchal system is one, a lack of policing is another, and general treatment of women which is not equal to men, even though it may be so under the law,"" Sirohi added. The Indian Cabinet plans to set up a commission to look into the rape and suggest measures to improve women's safety. The commission has three months to submit its report to the government.","17-year-old girl commits suicide after alleging she was gang raped .

"Washington (CNN) -- The question most readers will bring to George W. Bush's memoirs can be put into just two words: ""Why Iraq?"" Here's an abridgement of the former president's answer, from pages 228-229. ""There were state sponsors of terror. There were sworn enemies of America. There were hostile governments that threatened their neighbors. There were nations that violated international demands. There were dictators who repressed their people. And there were regimes that pursued WMD. Iraq combined all these threats. ... Before 9/11, Saddam was a problem America might have been able to manage. Through the lens of the post-9/11 world, my view changed. I had just witnessed the damage inflicted by nineteen fanatics armed with cutters. I could only imagine the destruction possible if an enemy dictator passed his WMD to terrorists."" That's the key point: After 9/11, threats that previously glanced off all of our attentions suddenly rose to dominate our minds. Here's George W. Bush again, from pages 152-153, reporting on a discussion with Dick Cheney that occurred in October 2001 during a presidential visit to China. "" 'Mr. President ... one of the bio-detectors went off at the White House. They found traces of botulinum toxin. The chances are we've all been exposed.' The CIA had briefed me on botulinum toxin. It was one of the world's most poisonous substances. ... Deputy National Security Adviser Steve Hadley explained that the FBI was testing the suspicious substance on mice. The next twenty-four hours would be crucial. ""If the mice were still scurrying around, feet down, we'd be fine. But if the mice were on their back, feet up, we're goners. ... The next day, Condi got a message that Steve was trying to reach her. 'I guess this is the call,' she said. After a few minutes, Condi came back with the news. 'Feet down, not feet up,' she said. It was a false alarm."" I was working in the White House in October 2001, and I remember vividly the mood of doom. Had you asked me then, I would have told you: I am certain I will die in the next two years. If it isn't botulinum toxin breathed into the air conditioning, then it will be a car bomb on 17th Street. If not a car bomb, then a sniper will open fire inside the Pennsylvania Avenue Starbucks where so many White House staffers picked up their morning caffe latte. I wrote a new will that October. I doubled my insurance coverage. My wife and I started uncorking and drinking the best bottles of wine in the cellar -- might as well enjoy them while we still could. President Bush nicely describes the way in which our post-9/11 fears became self-reinforcing. ""Years later, incidents like the botulinum scare can seem fanciful and far-fetched. It's easy to chuckle at the image of America's most senior officials praying for lab mice to stay upright. But at the time, the threats were urgent and real. Six mornings a week, George Tenet and the CIA briefed me on what they called the Threat Matrix, a summary of potential attacks on the homeland. ""On Sundays, I received a written intelligence briefing. Between 9/11 and mid-2003, the CIA reported to me on an average of 400 specific threats each month. The CIA tracked more than twenty separate alleged large-scale attack plots, ranging from possible chemical and biological operations in Europe to potential homeland attacks involved [sic] sleeper operatives. Some reports mentioned specific targets, including major landmarks, military bases, universities, and shopping malls. For months after 9/11, I would wake up in the middle of the night worried about what I had read."" In retrospect, these CIA warnings look like a classic bureaucratic response: Chagrined by their failure to thwart the 9/11 attacks, America's intelligence agencies overcorrected. On September 9, 2001, a state trooper in Maryland pulled over one of the 9/11 hijackers for speeding. Ziad Samir Jarrah, one of the four men who seized the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania, was driving 95 mph in a 60 mph zone. Had Jarrah been detained, who knows how his fellow plotters would have reacted? Maybe they would have assumed their security had been breached and canceled the operation. But Jarrah's name did not appear on any watch list, much less any list shared with local law enforcement. Having missed Jarrah, the agencies became determined never again to miss anyone. They careened from providing a false negative to generating hundreds of false positives. Bush mentions that in late September 2001, FBI director Bob Mueller told him that there were 331 potential al Qaeda operatives inside the United States. The October anthrax attacks intensified the alarmist mood. In the days after October 2, 2001, anthrax-laced letters arrived at the National Enquirer; ABC, NBC and CBS News; and the Senate offices of Majority Leader Tom Daschle. Altogether, 17 people were infected. Five died. From the memoirs of George W. Bush, pages 157-158. ""One of the letters containing anthrax read: . 09-11-01 . YOU CAN NOT STOP US. WE HAVE THIS ANTHRAX. YOU DIE NOW. ARE YOU AFRAID? DEATH TO AMERICA. DEATH TO ISRAEL. ALLAH IS GREAT. I was struck by a sickening thought: Was this the second wave, a biological attack? ... The biggest question during the anthrax attack was where it was coming from. One of the best intelligence services in Europe said it suspected Iraq."" And now the key line, on page 159: ""We believed more attacks were coming, but we didn't know when, where, or from whom. ... As time passed, some critics charged that we inflated the threat or manipulated alert levels for political benefit. They were flat wrong. We took the intelligence seriously ..."" iReporter: Welcome back, President Bush . Bush's account of his decision-making in his Iraq chapter will likely seem stunted to many readers. He offers considerable detail on the milestones toward the decision -- and yet readers will search in vain for the actual moment at which the decision occurred. On page 251, he ""wasn't ready to move yet."" On page 252, ""I was deeply disappointed that diplomacy had failed."" On page 253, ""Military action was my last resort. But I believed it was necessary."" The how is all there. But a big part of the why is here: . ""I remembered the shattering pain of 9/11, a surprise attack for which we received no warning. This time we had a warning like a blaring siren."" The U.S. had been accepting risks from Saddam Hussein for more than a decade. Suddenly those risks were now intolerable. And for all the grief and cost of Saddam's removal, that particular risk now threatens the United States no longer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Bush's memoirs help explain why U.S. attacked Iraq .

"(Rolling Stone) -- Drake hit New York's Nikon at Jones Beach Theater Saturday night the way he prefers to travel: with friends and family in tow. Boasting a packed bill of today's brightest young rap stars, the penultimate stop on his Club Paradise tour felt celebratory, but tense. Earlier that day, rumors swirled that the rapper might be apprehended by the NYPD at the concert following an alleged nightclub brawl with Chris Brown that left bodyguards and bystanders in stitches. But no bottles flew in the club this evening, and Drake seemed rattled but relieved: ""When I woke up this morning, I had the choice to think about a lot of things,"" he said at the top of his set. Later, he hinted further at the stress of the previous few hours: ""I wanted tonight to happen so bad,"" he said. ""I'm so f***ing glad this happened tonight."" A steady stream of blistering rap music opened the show, with Meek Mill and Waka Flocka Flame plunging straight into their current hits to rile up the early audience. ""Turn up!"" may be this generation's ""rock on!"" and Flocka embodied the phrase, leading a visceral set filled with little rapping and lots of gunshot sounds. ""Sorry to all you 'real hip-hop' n***as,"" Flocka mocked after swarming through the crowd to club anthems like ""No Hands"" and his latest gem, ""Fist Pump."" Later, J. Cole mellowed the venue with a grand sing-a-long to ""Nobody's Perfect,"" a slow burner featuring Missy Elliott that drips with all the songwriting promise the Grammy-nominated MC showed early in his career. Performing with a full band, the once scrappy college-rapper has matured under Jay-Z's Roc Nation imprint, and the boss's shadow loomed as Cole led the crowd in a Roc-A-Fella diamond salute, and interpolated ""Big Pimpin'"" into the tropical ""Can't Get Enough"" as tanned Long Islanders belted along to every word. Club Paradise is noteworthy for its openers as well as the headliner -- Meek, Waka, and Cole all drape the windows into contemporary urban culture in 2012, and each seem to have gotten there almost by accident. This, of course, is what makes Drake so exhilarating, and polarizing: the Jewish Canadian child-actor with a sheepish grin was never supposed to be a part of hip-hop, let alone at the center of it. Yet here Drake was, shining bright and pulling in countless peers to orbit around him. After racing through some early hits at the top of his set, Drake promised to deliver ""every motherf***er you want to see right here,"" before introducing the Weeknd for their haunting collaboration ""Crew Love."" The mysterious young singer came off a bit flat early on, and seemed nervous despite a string of well-received solo gigs. But the enthusiastic crowd was forgiving, and if there's one thing Drake does well, it's share the spotlight. From rising profiles ASAP Rocky and French Montana to veterans the Diplomats and Busta Rhymes, Drake paid ample homage to New York City hip-hop, typically a locals-only fundamentalist sect that regionless artists like Drake have since knocked off the pedestal of hip-hop's birthplace and sole proprietor. Still, when Cam'ron's New York anthem ""I Really Mean It"" blared from the amphitheater, Drake was a fan first: ""The songs these dudes made have influenced all of our music,"" he said. ""I'm just a kid from Toronto, but no matter where you're from, make some noise for the legendary Diplomats!"" Most of the crowd, unfamiliar with their deeper cuts, took his word for it. After playing the doe-eyed lover-boy for much of his career, Drake has spent the past few months adding a snug layer of darkness to his persona. From the subtle warnings about catching bodies on ""Headlines"" to the tougher talk on his now-infamous ""Stay Schemin'"" verse (the self-professed ""real n***a"" anthem), Drake's ""you never know"" attitude has somewhat validated the Toronto-native in some corners. A brush with the NYPD seemed almost inevitable considering his recent chest-puffing and associated acts, but the Drake onstage at Jones Beach didn't portray any rebel streak. Instead, the gummy charm fans fell in love with was on full display as he took an extended interlude to individually address members in the crowd from the front row to the nosebleeds. Spirits were high, and he barely acknowledged the controversy surrounding the previous 48 hours. ""The past few days of my life might've been some whatever shit,"" he confessed before launching into ""Take Care,"" his moving duet with Rihanna. If the lyrics were suggestive before, they felt almost literal on this evening: ""We've both had our nights, so don't be so ashamed,"" he sang sans the pop princess, despite many speculating that she'd join him on stage. ""You've seen all my mistakes, so look me in my eyes."" Chants of ""f**k Chris Brown!"" rose in pockets of the audience as the song faded, affirming the weight of the moment. Rihanna wasn't the only notable absence. For a show that was as much about his collaborators as it was his own career, Drake's major Young Money/Cash Money cohorts were nowhere to be found, making Club Paradise not quite the Summer Jam consolation many NY ticketholders had hoped for. Despite Lil Wayne and Nicki Minaj being no-shows, Drake alluded to bigger plans: ""I had a call today with a short dude with some dreads who goes by the name of Lil Wayne, and I'm gonna try to bring him with me next time,"" he quipped as the night closed. ""Same goes for the beautiful Ms. Nicki Minaj, so bare with me while I work out that Young Money World Tour."" Despite looming controversy and some missing teammates, there wasn't much trouble in Drake's paradise, and he was emphatically clear that the fans on the floor were the real VIPs: ""You can open your eyes to what they write about me, and open your ears to what they say about me, but I don't give a f**k about anyone besides the people in this room,"" he said with a slight smile as the show closed.

"(CNN) -- When a set of recommendations to reduce gun violence hits President Barack Obama's desk on Tuesday, it will trigger a new stage in a decisive political battle consuming Washington. And it will show just how much America may have changed in the wake of last month's massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. The proposals from a White House task force may include some with broad support on issues involving mental health. But one of the most intense flashpoints is already known: The group, overseen by Vice President Joe Biden, is expected to support reinstating an assault weapons ban. ""I would say that the likelihood is they will not be able to get an assault weapons ban through this Congress,"" National Rifle Association President David Keene said Sunday. But the powerful gun rights lobbying group is gearing up for a fight, which, CNN has learned, will include an ad campaign. ""When a president takes all the power of his office and is willing to expend political capital, you don't want to make predictions,"" Keene said on ""State of the Union."" Keene said he also does not believe Congress will pass a ban on high-capacity magazines. The NRA argues that such bans won't help stop gun violence and that they infringe on Second Amendment rights. But Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, said the NRA's prediction is wrong. ""I think that this issue is going to continue to move,"" he told ""State of the Union,"" speaking from Newtown. ""The NRA does not represent gun owners anymore. This is not your father's NRA. It represents gun manufacturers,"" Murphy said. While the NRA does receive large sums of money from gun makers, Keene insisted that manufacturers are ""not our constituency."" ""Our constituency is twofold,"" he said. ""It's the American people who want to own guns and use them legally, and it's the Second Amendment itself."" Biden told reporters last week, amid meetings with a wide array of groups, that he had never heard so much support for ""the need to do something about high-capacity magazines."" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who is pushing a ban similar to one that expired in 2004, has said she believes it will make it through Congress. ""All of the things that society regulates, but we can't touch guns? That's wrong,"" Feinstein said in December after 27 people, including 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary School, were killed in Newtown by a gunman who then shot himself to death. Numerous mass shootings have involved high-capacity weapons. Obama set up the task force and instructed the group to have proposals by the end of January. Biden said last week he will have a set of recommendations ready for the president by Tuesday. While the NRA, with 4.2 million members, holds a great deal of sway, it faces a country deeply concerned about the kinds of weapons that have been used in numerous mass killings. It's also facing a new foe: a political action committee created by former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly. Giffords was shot in the head in a mass shooting two years ago that killed six people. ""With Americans for Responsible Solutions engaging millions of people about ways to reduce gun violence and funding political activity nationwide, legislators will no longer have reason to fear the gun lobby,"" the two vowed in a USA Today op-ed last week. Obama made clear Saturday that he's ready for a fight over how to respond to gun violence. In his weekly radio address, he gave a list of challenges ahead, including protecting ""our children from the horrors of gun violence."" ""These, too, will be difficult missions for America. But they must be met,"" he said. The Obama administration will try to pass an assault weapons ban, an administration official said Friday. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, told CNN he believes that a ban on assault weapons alone, ""in the political reality that we have today, will not go anywhere."" A strong advocate for Second Amendment rights with an ""A"" rating from the NRA, he has expressed openness to changing laws but argues that other aspects of society should change as well. ""It has to be a comprehensive approach,"" he argued Sunday on ""State of the Union."" Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, on Sunday called on the nation's largest gun retailers to ""participate in a temporary moratorium on selling assault-style rifles until Congress has considered legislation to reduce gun violence,"" his office said in a statement. ""Since the Sandy Hook massacre, sales of assault-style rifles have skyrocketed and are poised to grow even further during an upcoming 'Gun Appreciation Day' organized by extreme pro-gun activists,"" the statement said. The group behind the event, scheduled for January 19, uses its website to encourage Americans to ""go to your local gun store, gun range or gun show with your Constitution, American flags and your 'Hands off my Guns' sign to send a loud and clear message."" Dick's Sporting Goods, one of the largest sporting goods retailers, suspended sales of certain semi-automatic rifles nationwide after the Newtown massacure. Another likely point of contention between gun rights activists and those supporting stricter gun control is a call for universal background checks. Biden has said several groups that his task force met with support such checks for all gun buyers, including those who purchase through private sales. Keene has also told CNN that he does not support instituting background checks for purchases at gun shows. He said Sunday the NRA does support the idea that people who are ruled mentally incompetent should be listed as not allowed to purchase firearms. In the interview Sunday, Keene complained that Biden's panel didn't really listen to what the NRA had to say. Despite promises that the task force had not reached conclusions before hearing from all sides, ""the conclusions were reached,"" he argued. ""We suspected all they wanted to be able to do was to say he had talked to us, and now they were going to go forward to do what they wanted to do."" Another question facing Biden's panel is how to tackle images of shootings in entertainment. His task force met with leaders of the the film, TV and video game industries. It's unknown what the task force may suggest as a response to what Obama has described as a culture that often ""glorifies guns and violence."" Meanwhile, across the country, Americans of all stripes are debating the issue in person, in town hall meetings, and in social media.","NEW: ""This is not your father's NRA,"" Sen.

"Paris (CNN) -- The apparent assassination of three Kurdish women political activists in central Paris on Thursday, all shot in the head, has provoked shock among the Kurdish community. Mystery swirls around the slayings, with no claim of responsibility or any indication from authorities as to who might have pulled the trigger. The fact that one of the women is a founding member of the Kurdish Workers' Party, or PKK -- a group viewed by Turkey, the United States and others as a terror organization -- has led to heightened speculation. The killings come at a delicate time for Kurds in Turkey, where analysts say the government has recently entered into talks with Kurdish leaders -- among them the jailed head of the PKK, Abdullah Ocalan. Analysts suggest the attack could be an attempt to derail a nascent peace process, in what is one of the Middle East's longest-running conflicts. Opinion: How Paris killings could renew Kurd flashpoint . The PKK, a pan-Kurdish nationalist movement, is best known internationally for the guerrilla war it has fought for nearly three decades against the government of Turkey, a conflict that has claimed more than 40,000 lives. The ethnic Kurdish population extends across parts of Turkey, Syria, Iran and Iraq. French Interior Minister Manuel Valls told reporters in Paris the three women had been ""without doubt executed"" and described the killings as ""totally unacceptable."" Report: Turkey's Kurdish conflict has turned more violent . The main pro-Kurdish political party in Turkey, the Peace and Democracy Party, or BDP, identified the three victims as Sakine Cansiz, who was a co-founder of the PKK, Leyla Sonmez and Fidan Dogan. Police said the women's bodies were discovered about 2 a.m. local time in the Information Center for Kurdistan in Paris, located on a busy street behind the Gare du Nord, one of the capital's main train stations. Officers took evidence bags from the building, near which much of the city's Kurdish community lives, but have released few details. Leon Edart, of the Federation of Kurdish Associations in France, told CNN affiliate BFM-TV that the women had been alone at the site, which had no security cameras, on Wednesday afternoon. Read more: Turkish town on Syrian border deals with fighting, ethnic differences . French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said that French authorities were determined to shed light on the murders and that a judicial inquiry had been opened. So far, authorities have not indicated who might have been responsible. But political leaders in Turkey have been quick to express their shock and revulsion. Turkish government spokesman Bulent Arinc condemned the ""savage"" killing of the women, in comments to the semiofficial Anadolu news agency, saying it was ""utterly wrong."" And the BDP, which has 35 elected members in the Turkish parliament, demanded answers. ""We expect the French government to enlighten this massacre beyond a shadow of doubt. We want it known that these murders committed overtly in the busiest part of Paris cannot be covered up,"" it said. Roj Welat, a spokesman for the PKK leadership in the Qandil Mountains of northern Iraq, said the PKK had not seen any claims of responsibility and was waiting for the results of the French investigation into the murders, as well as its own probe. ""It is an assassination, it is terror, it is ideological and political assassination, (a) terror attack against the Kurdish people,"" he said. ""Sakine Cansiz has been actively involved in the peace and democracy struggle, freedom struggle, of the Kurdish people for a long time. She was one of the women who participated in the formation of the PKK."" Read more: Turkey police crack down on Kurds . Hugh Pope, senior Turkey analyst for the International Crisis Group, suggested the killings would ""raise huge questions on the Kurdish side about what's going on"" in relation to the Turkish negotiations. ""No one should use this as an excuse to end these talks. Because this is a unique opportunity, it is a year without any political elections,"" he said. ""Whoever did it, it's very important that the negotiators take steps to reassure each other."" Pope warned against quick pronouncements on the assassin's identity or affiliation, saying the PKK ""has a long history of killing its own people, too. So there's no way anybody can jump to conclusions."" Huseyin Celik, a spokesman for Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP, said information was still coming in, but ""when you look how it was carried out, it seems like an internal settling of scores within the PKK."" Read more: Kurdistan officials hope Iraq will allow Turkish minister in . The murders have also left the Kurdish community in Paris and elsewhere reeling. Valls, the French minister, said that Dogan was the head of the Information Center for Kurdistan and that she was known to many in the community through her work. She was also the Paris representative of the Kurdistan National Congress, or KNK, a political group based in Brussels, Belgium. Akif Rizgar Wan, the British representative of the KNK, told CNN he had known Dogan for more than a decade and had last seen her in December. He described her killing as ""terrorism in the middle of Europe"" and an attack on efforts to find a peaceful resolution to the Kurdish question. ""It's a very big loss for us,"" he said. ""I cannot describe my sadness. I've not seen anyone else in my life so warm and helpful to anyone."" Read more: Jailed leader calls for end of Kurdish hunger strike . About 200 members of the Kurdish community rallied outside the Information Center for Kurdistan on Thursday morning but dispersed soon after. A statement on the French website Jeunesse Kurde (Kurdish Youth) on Thursday urged Kurds and friends of the Kurdish people to gather in Paris. Berivan Akyol, a spokeswoman for the Kurdish Cultural Center in Paris, said a demonstration would be held Saturday. ""We want to condemn these savage executions and the obscure political forces behind them. We are expecting at least 4,000 people,"" she told CNN. More than 150,000 Kurds live in France, many of them in the Paris area, according to BFM-TV. About 90% of the population originates from Turkey, the broadcaster says. Whether the murders will affect the high-profile negotiations in Turkey remains to be seen. Throughout the long conflict in Turkey, the PKK has modified its goals from demanding a separate Kurdish state to fighting for the expansion of Kurdish cultural and linguistic rights, as well as the release of Ocalan, the jailed PKK leader. For decades, the Turkish state discriminated against the Kurds, Turkey's largest ethnic minority, which now makes up roughly 20% of the population. The Kurdish language was banned, and Kurds were long referred to as ""mountain Turks."" During Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's 10 years in power, the government has made historic outreaches to the long-oppressed population, an effort that included secret talks with PKK leaders in 2005. But PKK-related violence has spiked recently, reaching death tolls unseen in more than 13 years, according to a report published by the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit conflict mediation organization.

"(CNN) -- The clock is ticking as the December 31 deadline approaches for Congress and President Obama to come to some sort of agreement over the infamous fiscal cliff. But what happens when the country finally reaches the fiscal edge? Tax increases for everyone? Deep spending cuts? Another recession? As President Obama puts pressure on House Republicans to come to a compromise over the fiscal cliff, it seems like everyone wants to know: What is the best solution? Adults often have to make compromises to make ends meet financially. CNN iReport invited people to share their stories of financial compromise, and what advice they would give to Congress on the fiscal cliff based on the lessons they've learned. 1. Use cash, not credit . A couple years back, Val Stayskal found herself in a financial conundrum. As a single mother, she said immediate needs such as bills, food and gas would pile up, so she started putting a lot of her expenses on credit. ""And when I could not pay off my credit cards, I would go to the bank and get a loan to pay them off,"" she said. ""It was a terrible cycle."" She was finally able to break the cycle with help from a financially savvy friend who helped limit her credit usage. ""She only worked with cash and she helped me create a budget,"" she said. Credit cards ""are so dangerous. We are paying so much interest. You think you have all this money, but it is not your own."" Since that time, Stayskal has gotten married and she and her husband own three small businesses in Chicago. They made a pledge to not use credit cards after they nearly lost their home to foreclosure during the recession four years ago. ""We only use cash,"" she said. Stayskal, 58, believes the president and Congress could learn something from her journey to free herself of credit card debt. ""I definitely feel like our nation's reliance on credit has put us in this fiscal cliff crisis,"" she said. She advised Congress to ""hold fast and push for spending cuts as well as balancing the budget in combination with increasing revenue in whatever way makes sense,"" she advised. Learning to prioritize spending is something she says was a tough, but an invaluable lesson. ""My life has improved tremendously and I attribute much of it to getting my finances straightened out,"" she said. ""We've had our own financial hiccups with the recession, and each time we apply the same principles and we are back on our feet, even when things were out of our control. It works."" WWJD... about taxes? 2. Take responsibility for your actions . The optimist within 34-year-old Swathi Ravichandran believes Congress and the president will come to an agreement over the fiscal cliff. The associate professor at Ohio's Kent State University said past incidents such as Standard & Poor's 2011 downgrading of the U.S. credit rating should serve as a reminder that there are consequences to not reaching a financial resolution. ""I have to take responsibility for my actions,"" she said when reflecting on her finances, and she said Congress should do the same. Owning up to financial responsibility is a life lesson she tried to keep in mind when purchasing a home with her husband last year. ""We decided not to let our future incomes dictate the amount of mortgage,"" she said. ""We took the opposite approach and thought, 'Will we be able to afford payments if one of us loses our job?' "" Ravichandran said the bottom line for avoiding the fiscal cliff is for the government to cut spending. ""If I spend too much, I have to curtail the rest of the month to reach my savings goal,"" she said. She said she always looks at discretionary expenses first when limiting personal spending. ""I'd cut back on the frequency of eating out, and purchasing clothing and accessories,"" she said. She thinks Congress should do the same. ""It is time to curb spending and increase revenues. Not one or the other."" 3. Stop wasting . Like many people, Savita Naraine said when finances get tight, frivolous spending goes out the window. ""This means packing a lunch and snacks and making coffee at home instead of splurging on Starbucks coffee,"" he said. The San Bernardino, California, resident and recent college graduate knows what it is like to work with a strict budget, especially since he is still looking for full-time employment. Cutting back on wasteful spending is a lesson he said Congress needs to learn. He said he was frustrated when he read a financial report back in 2011 about the Justice Department spending $16 a piece on muffins and other exuberant amounts of money on lavish business lunches. ""In this economy, it is somewhat shocking to me that people are willing to spend that amount of money when it clearly isn't necessary,"" the 29-year-old said. Naraine does not believe Congress and the president will come to an agreement on the fiscal cliff before the December 31 deadline. ""In recent years, when facing budget deadlines, the only agreement made is to extend the deadline,"" he said. He blames this on the stubbornness of politicians and their unwillingness to compromise, which worries him if taxes were to rise as a result of the fiscal cliff crisis. ""I imagine I would need to look for two jobs instead of one so that I could pay off debt incurred during college, pay my bills, and survive,"" he said. His advice for Congress is simple: Stop wasteful spending. For starters, he suggests that Congress could try hosting a potluck working lunch next time. Opinion: Beware the fiscal cliff deniers . 4. You can't please everyone . Brian Chandler's family is growing. He and his wife are expecting a second child, and their Georgia home is getting a little cramped. He'd like to buy a new house, but if taxes were to rise because of the fiscal cliff, he said he would reconsider purchasing a new home. ""It's more of a want versus a need,"" he said. Chandler was raised in a household where his parents made a combined $45,000 in the 1990s. He said growing up he didn't get everything he wanted, ""but we got everything we needed."" Chandler worked his way through college and got an entry-level position in data security. Now at the age of 34, he has a high-level managerial position. Despite his salary increase, he said the growth of his income does not change his spending habits. Decades later, he still maintains the want-versus-need mentality he learned growing up. ""I never go over my monthly income,"" he said. ""I don't drive a Porsche, even though I could afford one."" The Georgia resident believes Congress should apply the same philosophy when it comes to the fiscal cliff. ""Too often I feel our government tries to appease everyone, which clearly can't happen,"" he said. He said the best advice he could give Congress is to not delay the process any longer. ""Make the tough decision"" and ""understand that you won't be popular with all groups of Americans when you make a decision,"" he said. 5. Learn to live with less . A few years ago, Bobbie Bosworth and her husband retired from teaching. Now at the age of 61, Bosworth is working again in order to pay for rising health care costs. She hopes that President Obama's Affordable Care Act will not only lower the cost of medical care, but also increase jobs in America, as she and others across the country will finally be able to retire for good. Despite the rising cost of living, and going back to work after retirement, she is hopeful about the economy. She also believes Congress and the president will come to some agreement over the fiscal cliff before the deadline at the end of this month. She thinks the fiscal cliff agreement should include raising taxes for the wealthy. ""I would rather (Congress) go over the cliff than not raise taxes on the rich,"" she said. Over the years, Bosworth has learned to live on a tight budget. If taxes rise as a result of the fiscal cliff, she said she and her husband will have to cut back on things like traveling and eating out, which they've done in the past. She said one of the best financial lessons she learned is to spend no more than what you have. ""Learn to live with less,"" she advised. ""We don't need a lot to be happy.""","Congress and President Obama have until December 31 to come to avert the fiscal cliff .

"(CNN) -- Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who is serving a life sentence for his role in the killings of peaceful protesters during the revolution that eventually deposed him, will get a new trial. Mubarak and his former Interior Minister Habib al-Adly had appealed their life sentences. A judge agreed, the state-run al-Ahram newspaper reported Sunday. Mubarak's lawyer said Mubarak will remain in jail as he awaits his next court date, which will likely be in April. The judge also said that others facing charges should also be retried, including six interior ministry deputies, the state-run MENA news agency said. Essam El-Erian, a senior adviser to Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy, said that they looked forward to a second trial, the Freedom and Justice Party stated on its website. ""God willed the retrial would take place under Morsy's rule, with new evidence and new defendants,"" El-Erian said. Mubarak. who ruled Egypt for 30 years, was found guilty last June of ordering the killing of protesters and was immediately transferred to Tora prison in southern Cairo to serve his life sentence. The 84-year-old has suffered a range of physical problems since he was driven from office in February 2011, following weeks of protests by Egyptians demanding more freedom and reforms. He attended his trial later that year on a gurney. Last month, Mubarak was transferred to a military hospital after suffering a head injury and a bruised chest when he slipped in a prison hospital bathroom, Egyptian state-run media reported. Journalist Sarah Sirgany contributed to this report.","NEW: Adviser to current president said they're looking forward to second trial .

"Washington (CNN) -- Most of the provisions in a landmark food safety law which passed 16 months ago still haven't gone into effect and are stuck in a rule-making process at the White House, four months overdue. That leaves 80% of the U.S. food supply operating largely under safety laws dating from the Great Depression, and safety advocates and the food industry alike are puzzled. ""It's still unclear what's holding them up,"" said Chris Waldrop, who directs food policy for the Consumer Federation of America. The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act was signed by President Obama on January 4, 2011. It allows the Food and Drug Administration to take action to prevent outbreaks, increase the number of inspections and mandate recalls. Experts: Third-deadliest U.S. food outbreak was preventable . Many of the provisions, however, haven't been implemented because the White House Office of Management and Budget hasn't released the rules which the law created, which were due on January 4, 2012. ""We are back basically operating mostly under the law that is 70 years old because the new protections, the new safeguards in these rules have not been put in place,"" said Erik Olson, director of food programs for the Pew Health Group. ""We are very worried all the effort that was put into this by all of these Democrats and Republicans and independents in Congress by the business community and the health community will really be for naught if we don't move forward with these protections."" The FDA defended the speed of the review. ""These are four big rules that set a framework for a really important change for food safety,"" said Michael Taylor, deputy commissioner for Foods at the FDA. ""Each rule is complicated in its own right; they also have many interconnections."" The agency also points to parts of the law that have gone into effect, like the ability to hold food that may have been adulterated or mis-branded and requiring companies importing food to let the FDA know whether another country refused to allow it in. ""If you look at normal standards for how long it takes to get rules out, it hasn't taken very long at all,"" Taylor said. ""I'm proud of this process and the pace of the work."" But food industry lobbyists and safety advocates contacted by CNN say it may have more to do with politics. ""I think it's an administration criticized for being involved in the nanny state. They're worried about that,"" said one lobbyist who has been in White House meetings and spoke on the condition his name would not be used. ""I do think there is some concern. Will the Grocery Manufactures Association and others who stood with the president turn on him?"" The White House says this is about making good rules, not playing politics. ""The administration is working as expeditiously as possible to implement this legislation we fought so hard for,"" said Moira Mack, OMB spokeswoman. ""When it comes to rules with this degree of importance and complexity, it is critical that we get it right."" The Centers for Disease Control and prevention estimates that one in six Americans gets sick from consuming contaminated foods or beverages. Foodborne diseases cause about 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths each year, the CDC estimates.","The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act became law in 2011 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. Coast Guard planes and ships were searching Friday for a Japanese balloonist who disappeared off the Alaska coast while flying from Japan to the west coast United States. Missing Japanese balloonist Michio Kanda (R) with Naoki Ishikawa. Friends of balloonist Michio Kanda, who was on a solo flight, last heard from him via satellite phone at 9 a.m. Alaska time (6 p.m. GMT) Thursday, said USCG Petty Officer Levi Read. When he missed three subsequent scheduled calls over the next six hours, they called the Coast Guard, Read said. Read said two Coast Guard C130 Hercules planes conducted searches Thursday 435 miles south of Adak, Alaska, the balloonist's last known position. The searches continued Friday and are ongoing, Read said. Two Coast Guard cutters are also headed for the area, but both are at least a day away, he said. Read said the balloonist, who was heading for Portland, Oregon, is equipped with provisions and a survival suit. Kanda holds the world record for the longest-duration balloon flight, with a time of 50 hours and 38 minutes, according to the World Air Sports Federation. In that January 1997 flight, he and Hirosuke Takezawa flew from the Canadian provionce of Alberta to the U.S. state of Montana, according to the federation.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- With three days to go before the elections and polls showing him trailing, Republican presidential candidate John McCain appeared on NBC's late night comedy show ""Saturday Night Live,"" poking good-natured fun at his campaign. Sen. John McCain and his wife, Cindy, made guest appearances on ""Saturday Night Live."" The Arizona senator appeared in the opening skit, next to former cast member Tina Fey reprising her role as his running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. ""This past Wednesday, Barack Obama purchased airtime on three major networks,"" he said in the first skit. ""We, however, can only afford QVC (the television home shopping network)."" Later, McCain -- who delivered his lines with a smile on his face -- took another shot at his own expense. ""Look, would I rather be on three major networks? Of course,"" he said. ""But I'm a true maverick -- a Republican without money.""  Watch McCain and Fey appear on ""Saturday Night Live"" » . Throughout the skit, McCain and Fey hawked campaign memorabilia such as a set of knives that cuts through pork, and a jewelry collection that McCain's wife, Cindy, held up.   Watch Cindy McCain discuss her ""SNL"" appearance » . He dubbed the latter ""McCain Fine Gold,"" a play on the name of the campaign reform act that he sponsored with Russ Feingold, a Democratic senator from Wisconsin. McCain also took humorous potshots at his Democratic rival, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, and his vice-presidential pick, Delaware Sen. Joe Biden. McCain pointed to a set of 10 commemorative plates that he said celebrates the 10 town hall meetings he would have had with Obama. ""They are blank,"" he said. ""He wouldn't agree to those debates."" Obama had rejected McCain's proposal for the joint town hall meetings. The two participated in one such appearance as part of the three presidential debates. As for Biden, the SNL skit had Fey hawking a set of ""Joe"" action figures: Joe the Plumber, Joe Six-Pack and Joe Biden. The plumber reference was meant to invoke the now-famous Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher, who McCain has held up as a small business owner who will see his taxes rise if Obama wins the presidency. Joe Six-Pack is a term Palin has used to describe a regular American. Fey, as Palin, pointed to the Joe Biden doll and said, ""If you pull this cord, he talks for 45 minutes."" McCain added, ""It's great if you want to clear out a party."" The skit ended with the senator delivering the signature line that opens the show every weekend: ""Live from New York, it's Saturday Night."" iReport.com: Palin talks equality with iReporter . McCain also joined cast member Seth Meyers in the ""Weekend Update"" segment, where he unveiled radical last-minute campaign strategies he was considering. Among them was the 'Reverse Maverick' (""that's where I do whatever anybody tells me""), the 'Double Maverick' (""that's where I go totally berserk or just freak everybody out, even the regular mavericks"") and the ""Sad Grandpa."" ""That's where I get on TV and go, 'Come on, Obama's gonna have plenty of chances to be president. It's my turn,'"" he said. McCain has made two previous appearances on the show, which airs Saturday nights on NBC. The program, which has drawn attention for its political skits this year, garnered its highest rating in 14 seasons two weeks ago when Palin made an appearance. Obama canceled an appearance in September as a result of Hurricane Ike, but he appeared on the show in November 2007, making an unannounced cameo during an opening skit about a Halloween party at the house of New York Sen. Hillary Clinton, Obama's rival during the Democratic primary.","Sen. John McCain appears on ""Saturday Night Live"" with wife, Cindy .

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy reclaimed golf's No. 1 ranking without lifting a club after Ryder Cup teammate Luke Donald finished down the field in 37th at the RBC Heritage on Sunday. Donald needed a top-eight finish to hold off the Northern Irishman but a four-over-par 75 in the opening round put him on the back foot straight away and he eventually finished 16 shots behind the winner, Carl Pettersson of Sweden. McIlroy took the week off following a disappointing showing at the Masters, traveling to Copenhagen to support his tennis-playing girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki at her home tournament. The Dane's bid for a third successive title in the event ended in defeat in Sunday's final. McIlroy is next scheduled to play at the PGA Tour's Wells Fargo Championship at Quail Hollow, beginning May 3 -- a tournament he won in 2010. ""#1 again without touching a golf club this week.... I wish it was that easy!"" the 22-year-old tweeted on Sunday. Donald and McIlroy have swapped places three times this year already. The Englishman's latest stint at the top lasted four weeks. ""Is it a concern? No,"" Donald said. ""Obviously, I'd have liked to have played a bit more consistently this year. I built it up nicely last year through tournaments and winning a bunch."" Donald made the cut at the RBC Heritage with a second-round 69 but finished the tournament with two level-par rounds to end up on two over. ""Not my best week, getting used to leaving this place ranked #2. Nice week off now,"" tweeted Donald, who lost out to Brandt Snedeker in a playoff at last year's tournament. Donald won the Transitions Championship in March but has only one other top-10 finish. McIlroy has four top-five finishes to go with his Honda Classic win in March. Donald is next due to play at the Zurich Classic, beginning April 28. Pettersson, meanwhile, began the final round with a one-shot lead over Colt Knost and finished with a confident two-under 69 to move clear of the field for his fifth PGA Tour title. Knost had a disastrous final round of 74 to drop out of contention, leaving Pettersson to claim victory by five strokes from another American, Zach Johnson. Three years ago, the 34-year-old Pettersson dropped 30 pounds in a bid to slim down and improve his fitness, but found his swing was compromised and quickly decided to revert to his previous weight. Describing how he put the pounds back on, Pettersson told the PGA Tour website: ""Well, you drink 10 beers and (eat) a tub of ice cream before bed.""","Luke Donald needed a top-eight finish at the RBC Heritage to keep No. 1 ranking .

"(CNN) -- British Prime Minister David Cameron made a surprise visit to the troops in Afghanistan Thursday, a day after he announced a significant drawdown of UK forces there. ""Thank you for what you've done. You make our country proud,"" Cameron told the troops, according to the official Twitter account for his office at No. 10 Downing Street. Cameron said Wednesday that UK troop numbers will decrease to about 5,200 by the end of 2013. The country currently has around 9,500 military personnel in Afghanistan, 500 of which will be leaving by the end of this year. Read more: Karzai welcomes UK troop withdrawal plan . The accelerated withdrawal is due to progress in the southern province of Helmand, where Afghan forces are now taking a lead security role, British officials say. ""We came to Afghanistan to help this country stop being a haven of terror, but we've always wanted this country to be able to police itself, with its own army and its own police force,"" Cameron said during his visit. ""We're successfully training them up so we're able to bring our troops back home."" Cameron said the withdrawal is ""based on success, not based on failure."" France pulled its last combat units from Afghanistan over the weekend. About 1,500 French troops will remain the country through next year to remove equipment and help train Afghan forces, a French Defense Ministry spokesman said. Britain is the second-largest contributor of troops to the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, with the majority of its personnel operating in Helmand. Since Operation Enduring Freedom began in 2001, Britain has lost 438 troops, the highest of any coalition member behind the United States. The United States, whose troops make up the bulk of the force, has lost 2,162 troops in the NATO mission. Some 68,000 U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan. Coalition forces are working to get Afghan security forces ready to take charge of security after the NATO mission in Afghanistan concludes at the end of 2014.

"(CNN)  -- The second Test match between West Indies and England in Antigua has been abandoned after only 10 deliveries were bowled, with the match to be re-started on Sunday at a different ground on the island under the guise of the third Test. Umpires Rudi Koertzen and Tony Hill inspect the suspect Antigua outfield amid farcical scenes. Amid scenes of complete chaos, the heavily-sanded outfield played havoc with the bowlers' run-ups and --either side of a brief break for a shower -- the umpires and match referee had no alternative but to call off play for the day. In the short period of play possible, both West Indies opening bowlers Jerome Taylor and Fidel Edwards struggled to run to the crease. Match referee Alan Hurst was called into the middle by umpires Rudi Koertzen and Tony Hill and quickly made his decision. ""The bowlers are having problems with their footings,"" he told Sky Sports. ""They were having trouble getting any traction at all. The umpires have agreed with that. It is a health hazard for the players. Play has been abandoned for the day as the ground is unfit."" Much of the pre-match discussions had centered on the state of the ground at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, with Hurst admitting that no-one had tested the run ups. ""No-one had bowled on the wicket to test it out,"" he admitted. ""It would have been jumping the gun to say it was unfit before the start of play. In the long run we have to look at the health and safety of the players."" After much deliberating, officials concluded that the pitch would not be ready in time to resume proceedings on Saturday and made the decision to switch the match to the Antigua Recreation Ground -- leaving groundstaff a race against the clock to prepare the island's traditional international venue, which has not been used for Test cricket since 2006. England were seven without loss when match officials abandoned play and the tourists will now have to start from scratch at the ARG, where they had been training prior to Friday's debacle. The opening hour of the contest was reminiscent of the shambles of the 1998 Jamaica Test which was scrapped after just 10.1 overs due to an unsatisfactory pitch. Dr Julian Hunte, chairman of the West Indies Cricket Board, said: ""Let me apologize to everyone on behalf of the board for what is quite rightly called an 'embarrassment'. The ultimate responsibility lies with the board and we are not shirking it."" England are currently 1-0 down in the Test series after falling to an embarrassing innings and 23 run defeat at Jamaica in the first Test last week.","Second Test in Antigua has been abandoned after only 10 deliveries bowled .

"(CNN) -- The WBO said Wednesday it will review Timothy Bradley's controversial victory over Manny Pacquiao at the welterweight title fight. Saturday night's split decision rocked many who follow boxing and Pacquiao's home country of the Philippines. WBO President Francisco ""Paco"" ValcÃ¡rcel, in a statement, said the organization's championship committee will have ""five recognized international judges to evaluate the video of the match and agree to what emerges."" Pacquiao appeared to dominate Bradley during the fight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, but the judges felt otherwise. Two of the ringside judges had the fight 115-113 for Bradley while the other judge scored it 115-113 for Pacquiao. ""I want to clarify that in no way this says that we are doubting the capacity of these judges, which we consider as honest and competent judges,"" ValcÃ¡rcel said of the review. After the judges' scores were announced, most of the sold-out crowd at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas voiced its displeasure. Bradley, a native of Cathedral City, California, remained unbeaten with 29 wins, along with one no-contest. Pacquiao suffered his first loss since 2005. Now, the question is what Bradley's win or Pacquiao's loss will mean for boxing. After the bout, both announced they were interested in a rematch. Many fans have called for a potential showdown between Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather Jr. In the Philippines, where ""Pacman"" Pacquiao is worshipped, there have been accusations of foul play. A Filipino congressman called the fight ""rigged."" Rep. Joseph Victor Ejercito told the local media, ""It's obvious that Pacquiao was ahead. I can't see how he lost."" ""People were in shock and disbelief,"" said Lito Tacujan, sports editor of the Manila-based Philippine Star daily. ""Everybody felt furious with the result. They thought the match result was set up or scripted.""","WBO committee to review fight .

"(CNN) -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth II was discharged Monday from a London hospital, where she was treated for symptoms of gastroenteritis. The 86-year-old monarch had been taken to King Edward VII's Hospital on Sunday morning ""as a precautionary measure,"" a Buckingham Palace spokesman said, speaking with customary anonymity. The queen smiled as she left the hospital Monday. It was the first time the queen had been hospitalized in a decade. Her official engagements for the week were postponed or canceled Sunday. Elizabeth had already canceled a planned trip to Wales on Saturday after showing symptoms of the illness, Buckingham Palace said. Five things to know about gastroenteritis . Gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the lining of the stomach and intestines. Though commonly known as ""stomach flu,"" it is not caused by the influenza virus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The illness is usually caused by a virus and passed from person to person, said Dr. Corey Siegel, a gastroenterologist and professor at Dartmouth College's Geisel School of Medicine. But it can also be caused by bacteria, either foodborne or personally transmitted, he said. The bug usually has to run its course. But doctors often give hospitalized elderly patients intravenous fluids to prevent dehydration, which can lead to kidney problems, Siegel said. Queen's illness: Concern behind the castle walls . Elizabeth celebrated her 60th anniversary on the throne in 2012 and turns 87 in April. She was last hospitalized in 2003 for knee surgery. Her husband, the 92-year-old Prince Philip, was hospitalized three times between December 2011 and August 2012 -- once for treatment of a blocked coronary artery and twice for a bladder infection.

"(WIRED) -- Google's netbook-friendly Chrome OS takes direct aim at Microsoft, whose eight-year-old Windows XP leads the netbook market. But the odds are stacked against Google. Despite its buzz, the odds are stacked against Google's Chrome OS becoming a serious rival to Windows. In competing with Windows, Google Chrome OS will have to deal with many of the same challenges Linux has: compatibility, usability, and unfamiliarity. The record isn't good: In the past year, Linux-based netbooks have rapidly lost market share to Microsoft, as people find that Linux doesn't work as expected, may not support the applications or peripherals they're used to using, and is just plain different. ""The propeller heads or early adopters understood what Linux was about,"" says Richard Shim, an analyst with IDC, a market research company. ""But as netbooks have gone mainstream, users want the apps they are familiar with rather than the non-standard ones on Linux."" While sales of netbooks have exploded, Linux's market share on these devices has dramatically declined. In 2008, about 24.5% of netbooks shipped with an Linux operating system, estimates IDC. This year, it's expected to plunge to 4.5% and in 2010, only 3 percent of all netbooks will run a Linux OS. Even if it offers the same or better features than similarly-equipped Windows notebooks, Google Chrome OS will face the same uphill battle Linux has. Here's what Google needs to figure out to make Chrome OS a success. Compatibility with popular applications . Some of the earliest netbooks featuring Linux faced high rates of return because they did not support popular applications, says Shim. ""Many users found that the universe of applications compatible with Windows was much larger than those with Linux,"" Shim says. ""So when they looked at their Linux netbooks not only did it run non-standard apps but also a graphical interface they weren't familiar with."" Chrome OS will run on top of a Linux kernel, although Google has said that it will have an entirely new interface and will run all web applications rather than native Linux apps. Multimedia compatibility issues in some flavors of Linux helped add to early customer confusion, says Chris Kenyon, director of OEM services at Canonical, which supports Ubuntu. ""Some of those Linux netbooks that didn't have Flash preinstalled or multimedia codecs pre-installed faced lot of problems,"" he says. Translation: If a customer can't watch YouTube on her new netbook, she's more likely to return the netbook rather than install Adobe's Flash plugin for Linux. What Google must do: Google Chrome OS can't afford to make those mistakes. Flash support and the ability to play a wide variety of multimedia files will have to be standard. And where popular application support is missing, Google will have to ensure that it provides satisfying alternatives (such as Google Docs in place of Microsoft Word). Usability . User interface is a big factor for computer buyers. Many netbook buyers are first-time Linux users. And these newbies have often been stumped by the operating system's unusual interface. Even with very Windows-like and user-friendly Linux distributions, like Ubuntu, they often don't know how to perform simple system management or hardware configuration tasks. Options for those exist on the OS but new users have to put in the effort to learn, which can be a turnoff. Chrome OS will have to find a way to offer its customers a familiar graphical user interface that makes it easy to do the tasks they have been used to on a Windows operating system. ""UI is a very significant component for new operating systems,"" says Shim. ""You have to fight the first impression that this is different and then you have to sell people on why different is better."" What Google must do: Google needs to integrate Gmail, Google Docs and the Chrome web browser in a package that makes it easy to not just use these individual programs but also perform other routine tasks, such as installing new software or changing display configurations. Compatibility with popular hardware . Google will also be under pressure to ensure Chrome OS works flawlessly with gadgets such as cameras, printers, smartphones and e-book readers. So far, Linux netbooks have had a spotty record. Some such as Ubuntu or Red Hat offer better support for popular gadgets but still users have faced compatibility problems. A recent review from the Wall Street Journal complained that Linux-based netbooks could not load software drivers to print photos to Canon and Dell printers. The review also said there were problems loading pictures over a USB cable from the Canon PowerShot SD750 digital camera onto a Dell Mini 10 netbook running Ubuntu. Another big stumbling block for Google will be iTunes. The popularity of iPods means that many people expect their netbook to sync with their iPods. However, netbooks running Linux do not support iTunes, including Ubuntu, and that means no iPod or iPhone support. ""iTunes itself doesn't work on Ubuntu but you can use emulators,"" says Kenyon. ""It's something we would like to change."" It also has to be dead-simple to use hardware that's pre-installed on your netbook, such as a webcam, a Bluetooth connection, or a 3G wireless data card. What Google must do: Ubuntu and other Linux vendors may not have the clout to get Apple to support Linux, but Google could make it happen for Chrome OS. Google and Apple share a close relationship, and Google CEO Eric Schmidt is a member of Apple's board of directors. Also, drivers for Wi-Fi hardware or webcams in the netbooks come pre-loaded with Windows netbooks; Chrome OS will have to ensure it offers customers the same simplicity right out of the box. Resistance to change . PC users may complain about glitches in the Windows operating system, the viruses and the blue screen of death. But unhappy as they may be, they are not beating down the doors of any of the Linux vendors to get a new OS. More than 80 percent of the at least billion PCs worldwide run some version of Windows, and 96 percent of netbooks are running Windows, according to NPD Group. Changing consumer expectations has been one of the biggest challenges that Linux vendors face. Google will have to deal with this, too. What Google must do: Massive advertising. Fortunately for Google, this is a business it knows well. Support from netbook makers . One of Microsoft's biggest strengths is the relationships it has built with device makers such as Dell, HP, Lenovo and Asus. As a new entrant Google will have to work with these PC makers to ensure that netbooks come pre-loaded with Chrome OS. Google can probably swing a few early deals, as it has with Android, but to be a force to reckon with it needs to ensure widespread availability. So far, Linux vendors have found that difficult to get OEMs completely on board. PC makers don't want to jeopardize their relationship with Microsoft, which powers the higher-margin products such as desktops and notebooks. What Google must do: Wheel-and-deal to ensure that Google Chrome OS is available on as many netbooks as possible. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

"(CNN)  -- Lance Armstrong's bid for an eighth win in the Tour de France came to a sorry end on a dramatic eighth stage of the Tour de France won by Andy Schleck of Luxembourg. Australia's Cadel Evans took over the race leader's yellow jersey, leading Schleck by just 20 seconds, with defending champion Alberto Contador in third place, one minute and one second down. Armstrong, riding in his last Tour de France, crashed twice and also got held up as another rider took a tumble on a disastrous day for him and his Radioshack team. The 38-year-old American, sporting a bandage on his right arm, came in over 11 minute down on the leading group, crossing the line shortly after Sylvain Chavenel of France, who held the yellow jersey going into Sunday's stage. ""My Tour is over,"" Armstrong told AFP. ""But I will stay in the race. I will enjoy it, I'll try and take some pleasure out of it, to support the team. I'm not complaining."" Armstrong took his first tumble just after the start and the second, at high-speed, on the approach to the Col de la Ramaz. ""It's already hard to come back, hard on the body,"" he added. With Armstrong struggling,  Contador's Astana team set a ferocious pace on the final two climbs of the 189-km stage from Station des Rousses to Morzine-Avoriaz as they reeled in a breakaway group. But the Spaniard himself was  distanced in the final kilometer by Schleck and compatriot Samuel Sanchez. Saxo Bank team leader Schleck outsprinted Sanchez to take his first win of the year and establish himself as a major challenger to Contador for the overall honors. ""This puts me in a great position,"" he told Eurosport. World champion Evans and Contador finished in the nine-strong chasing group, 10 seconds behind, which contained most of the other leading contenders, but Britain's Bradley Wiggins, fourth last year, lost one minute 45 seconds after cracking three kilometers from the finish. Schleck, second behind Contador last year, saw his brother Frank crash out on the cobbled third stage in Belgium, but helped by teammate Fabian Cancellara, boosted his challenge by finishing in the leading group that day. Armstrong also lost valuable time on the third stage as he punctured at a crucial moment, but he went into Sunday's stage with hopes very much alive until the wheels came off in dramatic style. Teammate and compatriot Levi Leipheimer salvaged some pride for the Radioshack line-up by finishing eighth on the stage and their focus will now be on him for the remainder of the Tour.","Lance Armstrong's hopes of an eighth Tour de France victory in tatters .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A staged news conference during the California wildfires last month claimed the job of a second Federal Emergency Management Agency press official, as a review of the incident revealed ""a calamity of bad decision-making."" Aaron Walker, press secretary for FEMA, submitted his resignation to the administration's chief David Paulison Wednesday afternoon, according to a FEMA official. The official would not say whether Walker was asked to resign or did so voluntarily. His resignation becomes effective in early December. The official said Walker and John ""Pat"" Philbin, who was FEMA's director of external affairs, bore the ""greatest degree of responsibility for the planning and execution"" of the news conference. ""They had the greatest ability to stop that train from going down the track, and they didn't,"" said the official. Philbin left his job two days after the news conference to become head of public affairs for the Director of National Intelligence, Mike McConnell. That job offer, however, was rescinded as Philbin's role in the press conference became clearer. FEMA officials hurriedly called a press conference on October 23, giving media outlets only a few minutes notice. When no reporters were present for the conference, FEMA staffers asked questions of the agency's No. 2 official, Harvey Johnson. Reporters were allowed to call in for the conference, but they were kept in listen-only mode and not allowed to ask questions. In a phone interview with CNN Wednesday, Philbin said, ""It happened on my watch. I should have known better. I should have done more."" Philbin blamed a series of bad decisions. ""It wasn't done maliciously,"" he said. A just-completed review of events leading up to the press conference reached the same conclusion. ""There was no indication of malicious intent ... or any preconceived effort to deceive the media or the public,"" Russ Knocke, the Department of Homeland Security official who conducted the review, told CNN. Instead, Knock said, there was ""a calamity of bad decision-making."" The review uncovered an email sent by an unnamed staffer just minutes before the press conference telling employees of the FEMA press office to fill the empty seats in the auditorium and ""spur discussion."" In addition, as the press conference began, a member of FEMA's senior staff encouraged and even instructed other FEMA staffers to ask questions. Philbin said he is not that senior staff member. No one tried to stop the session, said Knocke, even though some employees did have misgivings. The review also discovered that the email advisory notifying the press of the news conference was delayed for about nine minutes while officials tried to confirm satellite coordinates for a live broadcast of the event. Software glitches further delayed the email's transmission, and some reporters only got the advisory at around the time the press conference was scheduled to begin, the review found. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff called the faux press conference ""one of the dumbest and most inappropriate things I've seen since I've been in government."" The incident prompted FEMA to issue new guidelines for dealing with the news media intended to prevent the incident from happening again. The new Standard Operating Procedures, issued Friday, bar government employees from asking questions at ""any Agency organized press event."" They also call for notification of the media at least two hours -- ""but at a minimum, no less than one hour"" -- prior to the start of a news conference. The new procedures also require two-way conference lines for media use when possible and say that ""listen-only"" lines will never be used. Knocke said employees of the FEMA press office will also be receiving training from public relations and press organizations on various subjects, including ethics.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- President Barack Obama is scheduled to visit the demilitarized zone that splits the Korean Peninsula in two for the first time on Sunday. His planned visit to the heavily fortified border is part of a three-day trip to South Korea to participate in a summit meeting about nuclear security in Seoul. Top officials from 54 countries including China and Russia will attend the summit meeting next week, but its message of international cooperation has been overshadowed by North Korea's announcement last week that it is planning to carry out a rocket-powered satellite launch in April. South Korea has said it considers the satellite launch an attempt to develop a nuclear-armed missile, while the United States has warned the move would jeopardize a food-aid agreement reached with Pyongyang in early March. North Korea says it has a right to a peaceful space program and has invited international space experts and journalists to witness the launch. Against that tense backdrop, Obama will visit the demilitarized zone and meet with some of the 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, two of his top national security advisers said Tuesday during a conference call. The ""fundamental message"" of the visit is ""underscoring the president's support for the American troops who are serving on the Korean Peninsula, and our support for the Republic of Korea, our very close and strong treaty ally,"" said Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser, using South Korea's official name. Although Obama himself has not been to the demilitarized zone during his two previous trips to South Korea as president, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton paid a visit to the area in 2010.

"(CNN) -- A French-Moroccan family of five was killed Saturday when their plane crashed near the French Alps, authorities said. It was not immediately clear why the twin-engine plane went down.

"(CNN) -- Britain's Independent Police Complaints Commission has initiated a criminal investigation into police misconduct in a 1989 tragedy at a soccer ground where 96 people died. The investigation follows a private inquiry that found serious failings by police and emergency services. The private report, released last month, reviewed thousands of documents and cast doubt on the original inquest's finding of accidental death. English FA offer apology on Hillsborough . The crush at Sheffield's Hillsborough Stadium on April 15, 1989, has cast a lasting shadow over Liverpool and the surrounding Merseyside area. The panel that compiled the private report also found evidence that indicated as many as 41 of those crushed could have survived. The Independent Police Complaints Commission, which oversees police complaints in England and Wales, said Friday that last month's report ""revealed extremely serious and troubling issues for the police."" ""Its contents provoked a demand for those responsible for the actions revealed in the report to be held to account,"" it said. The commission is reviewing hundreds of thousands of pages of evidence, and is paying special attention to allegations that police tampered with statements and that misleading information was passed to the media, among others. ""We have learned details of the run-up to the disaster including the unheeded warnings from previous incidents, the disaster itself, and its aftermath, including what appear to be attempts to distort the truth,"" the commission said. It said it does not know how many officers and retired officers will be investigated. The commission can investigate both criminal and misconduct offenses, even after an officer's retirement. The tragedy occurred when thousands of fans were let through a gate into an already crowded standing area, leading many to be crushed against metal fences and concrete walls. Horrifying images from the scene showed panicked men, women and children pushed and trampled with nowhere to go as police lost control of the crowd. Of some 25,000 Liverpool fans who had traveled to Sheffield to watch their team play, 96 never came home.","The Independent Police Complaints Commission started its own investigation .

"Tampa, Florida (CNN) -- Sitting on a corner of her brown sofa in a modest rental apartment, Miss M. Turner creates hand-made jewelry -- not quite the image you might expect from a public face in the nation's bitter fight over health care reform. What the health care ruling means to you . In the months leading up to Thursday's Supreme Court ruling about the White House-backed Heath Care Affordability Act, Turner's photo went viral across the political blogosphere, accompanied by the provocative headline ""I am Obamacare."" The high court ruled that the law's individual mandate -- the provision requiring all Americans to have health insurance -- will stand. Turner called the ruling ""historic,"" ""amazing"" and ""the right direction."" ""I have to admit I was worried because ... I thought they were going to strike down part of it, especially the individual mandate,"" Turner said. Read the ruling (pdf). The ruling is good news for millions of Americans like Turner who have a pre-existing health condition. Between 50 million and 129 million of them are younger than 65, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Last fall, Turner, 35, who is neither a politician nor a political operative, got noticed by grabbing a simple piece of paper and a blue Sharpie, and without even planning what to say, wrote, ""I discovered my uterus was full of tumors. I couldn't pay for surgery and because it was now a 'pre-existing condition' insurance companies could (and did!) turn me down for coverage."" The letter went on to praise the President Obama-supported pre-existing insurance plan for paying for most of her surgery. She set the timer on her small, red point-and-shoot camera and snapped a picture of herself holding the note and posted the photo on her blog www.giveneyestosee.com -- a site she's operated since 2001. Her photo has ""been all over the Web; that's crazy to me,"" said Turner, who prefers to be identified by her first initial only: M. It has been shared, praised, criticized, discussed, debated, dissected and dismissed on a wide swath of political forums both well-known and not-so-well-known, including DailyKos, MoveOn.org, Democratic Underground, Progressive Libertarianism, Mother Jones, The Health Care Blog and The Voices In Frank's Head. The praise has convinced her that she's had a hand in turning the very meaning of the word Obamacare on its ear. First used as a weapon by Obama opponents, the word has more recently been embraced by supporters of the president's plan. GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney said Thursday, ""Obamacare was bad policy yesterday, and it's bad policy today. Obamacare was bad law yesterday, and it's bad law today."" The ruling has prompted the Republican National Committee to launch a site called PeopleVObamacare.com. For Turner, her personal campaign has made her a bit of a target. ""Her hand written letter says nothing of her having the freedom to get the service and pay out of pocket, at possibly an outrageous cost, but get the life-saving service none-the-less,"" writes Susan Cassidy, at Progressive Libertarianism. ""Nor does it mention the fact that she could have asked for a self-pay discount and then worked out a payment schedule that she could handle. No, because of the culture we have grown up in, it is her RIGHT to receive this service and it is clearly someone else's responsibility to pay for it."" In 2014, the law will prevent insurance companies from discriminating or denying coverage because of a pre-existing condition, says CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. For now, the law offers the federal Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plan, which allowed Turner to have her surgery. Edmund Haislmaier, a health policy expert at the Heritage Foundation think tank, said the new regulations threaten to make the nation's health care problems worse and destabilize the market. ""Obamacare's radical changes to health insurance regulation were never necessary for expanding coverage for already sick patients"" because of the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) -- which limits how employer health care plans can exclude benefits based on pre-existing conditions. Turner understands going without insurance was a gamble, but like many Americans she struggles to pay her $237 monthly premium for the pre-existing coverage. ""It's not that I didn't want health insurance this whole time,"" she says. ""It's just a lot of money, and it's hard to come up with the money every month."" She laughs when she remembers sitting down last October to post her Obamacare photo online from her bedroom computer amid her collection of stuffed animals and small Disney figurines. Timeline of the health care law . ""I never thought a simple picture on my humble little blog would be all over the Web, go viral,"" said Turner, who shares her home with her fiance and two cats. ""(It) would shut down my website three times a month because of the traffic. It was insane,"" Turner laughed. ""One person said 'you're a hero' -- which made me blush because I didn't think I was a hero."" As a part-time national customer service representative working for the Nielson Co. in Tampa, Florida, Turner had no benefits. ""I was looking at being faced with tens of thousands of surgeries and no way to pay for it,"" she said. ""I cried -- woo I cried."" Health companies turned her down for her pre-existing condition and government assistance denied her coverage for making too much money. Breaking down the court's decision . A friend told her about the Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plan, insurance coverage under the Health Care Affordability Act, and Turner was accepted. To raise the $5,000 co-pay she needed for surgery, plus the $13,000 emergency room visit, Turner's friends and family staged a large garage sale. She also asked online supporters for donations. Another fundraising avenue for Turner was her hobby -- creating hand-made jewelry like her silver and gem-stone tree of life pendant. Today her hobby has become her primary source of income. Nielson laid Turner off after she took a long absence from work to have her surgery. Turner, a Democrat and self-described liberal, says she is grateful to Obama for his health care reform legislation because 51 million people like her are denied basic health care because they don't have health insurance. Although she was excited when her story was featured on Obama's re-election website, she's more excited by Thursday's announcement. ""We had to drag people forward for womenÂ¹s rights, civil rights. Equality in this country, discrimination in this country, these are issues people fought against -- and health care is just the latest,"" she said. ""I totally get that about the country: bad or good, you have to drag people kicking and screaming into the future."" Obama: Supreme Court ruling on health care a victory for all Americans .

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic saved five match points before beating defending Shanghai Masters champion Andy Murray in a three-set final of breathtaking intensity Sunday. Murray, who overcame the Serbian to win the U.S. Open title in another classic duel, was poised for an emphatic straight sets victory and his third successive title in the Chinese city. He led by a set and 5-4 and was 30 love to the good on his own service before the World No.2 changed the course of the match with an audacious between the legs shot. It helped him win the rally and although Murray then set up the first of his championship points later in the game, the force was now with Djokovic. In the ensuing tiebreaker, which lasted over 20 minutes, he saved a further four match points before taking it 13-11 to set up the decider. The typical fist-pumping celebration said it all, but Djokovic still had to win the third set. More classic play followed, but Murray was the first to crack as Djokovic broke to lead 4-3. Serving to save the match at 3-5 down, the Scot himself bravely saved a pair of match points before his opponent clinched victory after three hours 21 minutes of relentless pressure tennis. After his 5-7 7-6 6-3 triumph, Djokovic told the official ATP Tour website that it could have gone either way. ""When I faced those match points, I tried to focus on each individually. He was so close to the victory that I cannot say I was the better player."" Murray was left to reflect on defeat in a match he had in his grasp. ""It was a disappointing one to lose,"" he said . ""I've lost tougher matches than that before in the biggest events. So I'm sure I'll recover from it pretty well. "" The 25-year-old Djokovic, who was also beaten by Murray in the semifinals of the Olympic tennis tournament, came into the final in hot form after claiming the China Open in Beijing. He is closing on Roger Federer at the top of the rankings, heading into the Paris Masters and the ATP Tour Finals in London next month. Meanwhile, women's No.1 Victoria Azarenka claimed her sixth title this season when she beat German Julia Goerges in straight sets in Linz. The Belarusian won 6-3, 6-4 for a 14th career title, following on from her success in Beijing where she beat Maria Sharapova. And in the WTA event in Osaka, Heather Watson became the first British woman to win a Tour title in 24 years when she beat Chang Kai-chen in the Japan Open final.

Cale was a baseball player and Yelton a high school cheerleader, friends told The State. Yelton's high school friend Shannon McDaniel described Yelton as ""the definition of life,"" the paper reported. ""She was nice to everyone and always happy."" McDaniel told The State that Yelton had brought her into a circle of friends that included Cale and Anderson when she moved to Greenville in 2004.

South Carolina had played the Univesity of Tennessee on TV Saturday night. ""I'm sure they were (watching the game),"" the Star-News quoted Stephen Anderson as saying. The owner of the beach house said Monday that his family's ""lives were just changed forever"" by the tragedy. Chip Auman said his 18-year-old daughter survived the fire but was hospitalized and in stable condition because of complications from smoke inhalation. ""The thought of losing a child is unimaginable to me, and as a father my heart goes out to the families that lost a loved one in this situation,"" he said.

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Prosecutors officially filed terrorism charges against radical cleric Abu Bakar Bashir on Wednesday, charges that make him eligible for a death sentence. The charges include funding and inciting others to terrorism and planning and attempting acts of terrorism. Under the country's anti-terrorism law, some of these charges carry the maximum penalty of death, according to a statement by the Attorney General's Office. Bashir was first detained in August for his suspected links to a militant training camp raided by authorities in the province of Aceh in early 2010. Police say Bashir and his relatively new organization, the Jamaat Tawhid Anshoru or JAT, was involved in setting up the camp. The militants were preparing to launch attacks similar to the one in Mumbai 2008, and assassination attempts on Indonesian government officials, authorities have said. Under the law, Bashir's detention was set to expire on February 10. One of Bashir's lawyers, Adnan Wirawan, said the trial may start in about two to three weeks. He stressed that ""all the charges are very weak. This is again something that law enforcers fabricated,"" Wirawan said. In the past, authorities have tried but failed to directly link Bashir to some of the major terror attacks in Indonesia. This would be his third trial. In the first two trials, prosecutors tried to directly link the elderly cleric to the 2002 bombings in Bali and the 2003 JW Marriott bomb attack in Jakarta. The courts found him guilty of relatively minor charges. He was released in June 2006, after serving 25 months in jail. Bashir is known for his fiery rhetoric. He was accused of being the spiritual leader of Indonesia's homegrown terror network, Jemaah Islamiyah, who inspired many of those involved in the bombings. Bashir has always denied all the allegations and often blamed a U.S.-led conspiracy to put him behind bars.","Bashir is suspected of helping build a terror cell and military camp .

""I dragged my laptop over and with my feet I pried it open,"" she said. She then typed a message to her boyfriend, who happened to be online. ""HELP. Call police,"" the message read. Six minutes after Windom's boyfriend called 911, officers arrived and discovered Windom still tied to her bed, suffering a cut she sustained when the man struck her with his gun, according to Carlos Campos, a spokesman for the Atlanta Police Department. Campos said an investigation into the incident is under way. Windom's 2009 Acura has not been recovered, and authorities do not have a lead on the suspect. Campos told CNN that there is no evidence to believe Windom's story is a hoax, although all elements of the incident are under investigation.

"(CNN) -- Patience and persistence paid off for jockey Ryan Mania on Saturday as he helped Sue Smith to become only the third woman trainer to win Britain's most famous -- and most controversial -- steeplechase, the Grand National. The Scottish jockey, having his first ride in the race, briefly quit horse racing during a frustrating 2011 season. But in a fairytale turnaround, the 23-year-old, who only returned to the saddle this winter, rode 66-1 outsider Auroras Encore to victory in the four-and-a-half-mile marathon. After an almost flawless run, the 11-year-old stormed home ahead of Cappa Bleu and Teaforthree in front of a 70,000 crowd in Liverpool, watched by an estimated 600 million television audience. ""I couldn't have asked for a better ride and the old horse was loving it as well,"" said Mania, after winning by nine lengths on a horse who had failed to finish three of his last seven starts and was well off the pace in the other four. Mania started working with 65-year-old Smith and her husband Harvey after a six-month hiatus when his former boss lost his training license. ""I couldn't have come back without them,"" he said. ""The opportunities for jockeys up north are very limited and I am lucky to have such a good yard behind me."" There was further welcome news for racing fans as it was confirmed that all 40 of the horses and riders to start the race returned home unscathed -- although only 17 of those completed the course. The annual Aintree event had been under intense scrutiny from animals rights groups after recent editions of the race had been marred by a high number of equine fatalities -- 11 since 2002. That prompted race organizers to introduce a number of new safety measures this year, spending more than Â£1 million ($1.5 million) on alterations, including modifying the structure of the jumps themselves to make them safer and more forgiving and watering the ground the ensure going no faster than good-to-soft. However, there were two deaths in races in the first two days of this week's meeting, prompting criticism from animal welfare groups. ""We are delighted there have been no fatalities in today's big race,"" Dr. Mark Kennedy from the World Society for the Protection of Animals told CNN on Saturday . ""The (earlier) deaths of the horses Battlefront and Little Josh reflects current risk of fatalities in steeplechasing which needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. ""Horse deaths or fatalities at the Grand National are not freak accidents, but statistical probabilities. The risks prove to be high each year. We are not calling for a ban of the Grand National or a ban of horse racing, but merely to make the race safer for the horse and indeed the jockey."" In a nonetheless eventful race, on which in excess of Â£100 million ($150 million) was wagered by punters, Seabass, the 11-2 favorite and last year's third-placer, ran well for Katie Walsh until running out of steam with a handful of fences to jump, eventually fading to 13th. She was seeking to become the first woman rider to win the race, but caused controversy in the buildup when she claimed it would have been ""a lot worse if two jockeys had lost their lives"" in reference to the two fatalities at last year's Grand National. Her brother Ruby, riding the second favorite On His Own, was a casualty at Valentine's Brook, the 25th fence of 30. But fortune did smile on swashbuckling amateur jockey Sam Waley-Cohen, who finished a creditable fourth on Oscar Time, the runner-up in 2011.","Auroras Encore defies the odds to win Saturday's Grand National at Aintree .

"WASILLA, Alaska (CNN) -- The sports complex that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's supporters call her most visible legacy as mayor of her hometown left the town paying inflated prices for the land and huge legal bills, according to court records. Sarah Palin, Wasilla, Alaska's former mayor, is under fire for a sports complex she fought hard for. The complex features a soccer field, a running track and an indoor hockey rink with heated seats. Palin campaigned for a sales tax increase to finance the $14.7 million project, winning approval for the half-cent levy by a margin of 20 votes. Palin is now the Republican nominee for vice president. Her supporters call the arena the crowning achievement of her 1996-2002 tenure as mayor. ""She really was very, very passionate about this right from the start,"" Wasilla Recreation Manager Bruce Urban said. But the city never obtained clear property to the title until this year, after a lengthy court battle with developer Gary Lundgren, who owned part of the land on which the complex sits.  Watch more on the controversy » . ""When they started building, the title to the land was in my name,"" said Lundgren, who now lives in Panama. Diane Woodruff, a City Council member and longtime Palin critic, said that has left Palin's major campaign pitch -- to be a fiscally conservative reformer -- in question. ""She inherited the city with no debt, and suddenly we have a lot of debt,"" she said. ""I don't think that labels her as a true fiscal conservative."" In 1999, the Nature Conservancy was negotiating to sell the land to the city and Lundgren, but he says that although he signed a purchase agreement with the group, the city did not. Lundgren purchased 325 acres from the Nature Conservancy, but the city filed a lawsuit claiming ownership of land it believed it owned. In 2002, a federal court sided with Lundgren, finding that the city had never signed the proper papers. But by then, the 80-acre complex was under construction; Palin gave the go-ahead to begin while the issue was still in court. After Palin left office, the city sought to obtain the tract it needed for the sports complex through eminent domain, leading to another court battle. ""I'm curious as to why somebody in the previous administration didn't make sure that we had clear title before we started building, because certainly once we started building, we were over a barrel,"" Woodruff said. Wasilla eventually agreed to pay Lundgren more than $800,000 for the land, along with Lundgren's legal fees and interest: another $700,000. Lundgren said he offered to give the city a 20-acre parcel to avoid further lawsuits, but city officials turned him down. ""They said they needed more than 20 acres,"" he said. ""They had additional plans to build a softball field."" Attorney Kenneth Jacobus, who represented the city, said he had no recollection of an acceptable offer from Lundgren. The city originally paid $145,000 for part of the land. The rest of it was valued at about $21,000. It ended up paying more than $1.5 million, not counting its own legal fees. Palin's successor as mayor, Diane Keller, said the project has brought in more than $3 million in revenue for local businesses. ""I think this was a community dream. It may have been a part of Sarah Palin's dream, but it wasn't only her dream,"" Keller said. The complex is getting a lot of use, but it is not breaking even. Its operating costs are about $900,000 a year, Urban said, and city records show that the city has to pay about $100,000 of that. And Lundgren is still appealing the eminent domain case before Alaska's supreme court, arguing that Wasilla didn't meet the legal requirements for taking the land.","Records indicated Palin's Wasilla sport complex left city with legal bills .

"London (CNN) -- A Nepalese army colonel will appear in a British court Saturday to face torture charges linked to his alleged actions during his country's civil war, authorities said . Kumar Lama, 46, is accused of two counts of torture at an army barracks in the Nepalese Kapilvastu. He is accused of intentionally inflicting severe pain or suffering, according to London's Metropolitan Police. The alleged offenses occurred between April and October, 2005. Lama is serving as a military observer under the U.N. Mission in Southern Sudan and was on vacation in Britain, Nepalese state media said. His appearance at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London comes two days after his arrest at a property in St. Leonard's-on-Sea, on England's south coast. Officers from the Metropolitan Police's counter terrorism squad searched his home. The investigation into the torture allegations is being led by the squad, which also investigates alleged war crimes and human rights abuses. Lama was arrested under Britain's 1988 Criminal Justice Act, which allows it to meet its obligations under the U.N. Convention Against Torture to prosecute anyone on its territory responsible for torture anywhere in the world. Nepal summoned the British ambassador in Kathmandu on Friday to protest against the arrest, according to state-run Nepal Television. The government demanded the officer's immediate release, the broadcaster cited Deputy Prime Minister Narayankaji Shrestha as saying. The Nepalese embassy in London has also been told to lodge a protest with the British government, it said. Nepal's government is committed to ensuring justice, compensation and the human rights of torture victims, Shrestha is quoted as saying. From the mid-1990s, Maoist rebels in Nepal fought a 10-year civil war to end the country's autocratic rule by the monarchy. More than 13,000 people died in the fighting. The rebels signed a peace deal with the government in 2006, joined mainstream politics and won the most seats in a 2008 election for the Constituent Assembly. The victory transformed Nepal from a monarchy to a republic after 239 years of autocratic rule. However, international rights group Human Rights Watch has warned of a lack of progress on accountability for violations since the political process stalled in 2011. The group's Asia director, Brad Adams, welcomed Lama's arrest Thursday, saying it was ""an important step in enforcing the U.N. Convention against Torture. Those responsible for committing torture in Nepal can no longer assume they are beyond the reach of the law in other countries. ""The lesson for the Nepal government and army is that it is time to end the culture of impunity that has left victims waiting for justice for far too long,"" he said. Nepal has failed to prosecute anyone for torture committed during the civil war in the nearly seven years since it ended, the Human Rights Watch statement said. Political disputes continue to plague Nepal, which failed to agree on a new constitution by a May deadline and has yet to hold new elections. In December, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was deeply concerned about the continuing political deadlock in Nepal. He urged the country's political parties to resolve their differences and form a broad-based government. The U.N. said that despite the remaining challenges, there have been important achievements since the end of the civil war, including the integration of former Maoist rebels and removal of minefields.","NEW: Nepal has protested Kumar Lama's arrest, says it is committed to human rights .

"(CNN) -- A top Mexican drug trafficker has been arrested by Mexican police, authorities said Wednesday. Luis Rodriguez Olivera, alias ""El Guero,"" was arrested at Mexico City's airport Tuesday, federal police said in a statement. The United States was offering a $5 million reward for information leading to Rodriguez's capture. Rodriguez, 39, is accused of money laundering and importing, possessing and distributing cocaine into the United States. According to Mexico's Ministry of Public Security, Rodriguez and his brothers Esteban, Daniel and Miguel were part of a criminal ring known as Los Gueritos, who smuggled drugs into the United States between 1996 and 2008. The crew worked under the leadership of Mexico's most-wanted fugitive, Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, the leader of the Sinaloa cartel. Of the other brothers, Esteban was arrested in 2008, and Miguel was killed in a shootout in August, the ministry said. The Rodriguez brothers were indicted in New York in 2009 for drug trafficking. The U.S. State Department offered the hefty reward for Luis Rodriguez's capture. While Mexican authorities said Wednesday that Rodriguez was associated with the Sinaloa cartel, U.S. officials offered a slightly different biography of the trafficker. According to American authorities, Rodriguez and his gang broke away from El Chapo's federation around 2005 and tried to work independently. Eventually, pressured by the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels, the Rodriguez brothers moved their operations to Leon, Guanajuato, and established a strong relationship with the Zetas drug cartel. Rodriguez's arrest was the second important drug trafficking arrest made in two weeks. Last week, Mexican army special forces arrested a top lieutenant for El Chapo. Troops arrested Felipe Cabrera Sarabia in the northwestern state of Sinaloa. Cabrera, who was responsible for the activities of the Sinaloa cartel in Durango and the southern part of the state of Chihuahua, was detained after fleeing from Durango, officials said. He is charged with possessing firearms reserved for use by the army and falsification of a public document, officials said.","Luis Rodriguez Olivera was arrested Tuesday at Mexico City airport .

"(CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius' hopes of becoming the first disabled athlete to compete at the Olympics appear to be over after the man known as the ""Blade Runner"" failed to qualify for London 2012. The 25-year-old will defend his three Paralympic titles in the UK capital in August, but he was not able to achieve the required 400 meters time for the able-bodied event at the African Championships on Friday. His only hope is earning a place in South Africa's 4x400m relay squad, having clocked 45.52 seconds in finishing second in the final in Benin -- outside the 45.30 he needed to pass for a second time this season. Botswana's Isaac Makwala won in 45.25, with Pistorius' compatriot Willem De Beer third in 45.67. ""I am obviously disappointed that my time was just outside of the Olympic qualification time by two tenths of a second,"" said Pistorius, who timed 45.20 at the Gauteng North Provincial Championships on March 17. ""I had felt very strong coming into this competition as my fitness and speed has been continually improving. I was in good shape to set the time and believe my speed will only increase over the next few weeks. Blade Runner's Olympic ambition . ""I had a great early start to the season, setting the Olympic qualification time and I am hoping that there is still the opportunity for me to be selected to run for South Africa in the 4x400m relay."" Pistorius made history when he competed at the 2011 World Athletics Championships in Daegu, reaching the 400m semifinals and then helping South Africa reach the final of the relay. He was omitted from the final, but received a medal for his earlier efforts when the team won silver. It represented a major breakthrough for Pistorius, who had to take legal action after athletics' ruling body the IAAF banned him from able-bodied competition six months before the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Born without fibula in both legs, he had double amputations as a child and needs carbon-fiber prosthetic limbs to race. The IAAF ruled that the blades gave him an unfair advantage, but he overturned that ruling -- though not in time for him to qualify for Beijing. Pistorius did compete in the subsequent Paralympic event, winning gold in the 100, 200 and 400m.","South Africa's 'Blade Runner' fails to set qualifying time for London Olympics .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal has sent shockwaves throughout the tennis world after withdrawing from the Australian Open. The 11-times grand slam champion, who reached the final in Melbourne last year, had been expected to make his comeback from injury next month. Nadal's withdrawal means he will slip out of the top four for the first time in over seven years. After pulling out of an exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi this week with a stomach infection, Nadal was still expected to compete at the ATP event in Doha before making his way to Australia. The 26-year-old, who has not played since his shock second round defeat by world number 100 Lukas Rosol at Wimbledon, had hoped to make a return to action following a six-month absence with a knee injury. Nadal suffers comeback blow . But a virus has forced Nadal to pull out of both Doha and the Australian Open following discussions with doctors. He said: ""My knee is much better and the rehabilitation process has gone well as predicted by the doctors, but this virus didn't allow me to practice this past week and therefore I am sorry to announce that I will not play in Doha and the Australian Open, as we had initially scheduled. ""As my team and doctors say, the safest thing to do is to do things well and this virus has delayed my plans of playing these weeks. ""I will have to wait until the Acapulco tournament to compete again, although I could consider to play before at any other ATP event. ""I always said that my return to competition will be when I am in the right conditions to play and after all this time away from the courts I'd rather not accelerate the comeback and prefer to do things well."" Nadal has endured an injury-ravaged year, missing out on defending his Olympic title at London 2012 as well as sitting out the U.S. Open and Spain's Davis Cup final defeat in November. Coach and uncle Toni Nadal believes his nephew was left with little choice but to cancel his plans to compete in Melbourne after contracting the virus. Nadal to make long-awaited tennis return . He said: ""We consider not appropriate to play the Australian Open since we will not have enough preparation for a greater competition which is a Grand Slam tournament. ""It is simply not conceivable that his first event is a best of five sets event, he wouldn't be ready for that. ""It is true we have been quite unlucky with this but there is nothing we can do. ""After all this time it is better to do things well and the most professional thing to do is to start when we are ready."" While the Nadal camp is understandably saddened by the news, it will also leave his fellow professionals disappointed. World number one, Novak Djokovic, who beat Nadal in Melbourne last year, was looking forward to facing his old adversary once again. ""I was eager to see him play,"" said Djokovic. ""He has been off the tour for the past seven months and I am sure that all tennis fans and all sports fans want to see him back on the court, healthy and fit. ""I wish him, as a colleague, a fast recovery. ""It's unfortunate and I'm sure he feels the biggest need to play tennis out of everybody and hopefully he can bit for the Australian Open which is the most important experience."" Djokovic wins ATP World Tour Finals title . Meanwhile, Djokovic started his own season in style with a 6-0 6-3 win over Ferrer. The Serbia star, who won the tournament last year, cruised through the first set before Ferrer began to offer resistance in the second. Ferrer, ranked five in the world, led 3-1 in the second before Djokovic roared back to take the set. ""I love this court and the conditions here. I wish all the tournaments in the world were played here,"" Djokovic told ESPN. ""It's definitely a great surface. It's not too warm here, not too cold, it's ideal to prepare on. ""I am surprised with my game considering it's the first match of the official season. Hopefully I can play another good one tomorrow.""

"(CNN) -- The slayings of two super-yacht staff within two weeks have shaken the luxury yacht industry and sparked calls for crews to exercise extreme caution. Australian luxury yacht captain Drew Gollan was killed in January in English Harbor, Antigua. Both slayings occurred in popular yachting destinations in the Caribbean and involved violent attacks. Last week, U.S. luxury yacht chef Sara Kuszak, of Savannah, Georgia, was killed after being abducted during a morning run in Puerto Rico. The body of Kuszak, who was five months pregnant, was found with a slashed throat in a field. A local man has been arrested by police in connection with the incident. On January 22, Australian Drew Gollan, captain of Perini Navi yacht Perseus, was shot dead in what was described as a ""failed robbery"" in English Harbor, Antigua. Gollan, 38, was described as a ""widely respected member of the yachting community."" His death came less than a year after the double killing of a British couple on the island. Suspects have been arrested and charged with murder in both cases. Antigua, in particular, is highly dependent on the luxury yacht industry to boost its local economy -- and it appears news of the crimes is already having a negative impact. In a press release, the Antigua Charter Yacht Meeting acknowledged that ""a number of boats have decided to leave Antigua in the wake of this incident."" Further reports from yachting magazine SuperYachtWorld suggest several captains on the island have also decided to leave. Meanwhile, luxury yacht staff who are remaining in the Caribbean have been urged by industry Web site yotcru.com to ""exercise vigilant personal safety at all times."" After the death of Gollan, local Antigua politicians and yacht industry representatives held an emergency meeting to discuss the problem. At the meeting, the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, Baldwin Spencer, said: ""Antigua is still a safe place to be. It's an unfortunate situation, however we are all hoping that justice will be done,"" SuperYachtWorld reported. Spencer also pledged new security efforts to help prevent future crimes. An international charter company manager and luxury yacht industry expert, Els Bucknell, said yacht crews and clients were ""shocked and saddened"" by the deaths, and there would likely be a short-term impact on the Caribbean region. ""Most people assumed that this part of Antigua was safe and I think it has come as a shock,"" she said. ""Some boats have already left and I think you will see some of that."" However, Bucknell felt the incident would not affect the region in the long term. ""People do forget about these things over time ... and the local business people with police and other authorities have made a serious attempt to make it safer. ""The economy being the way it is has more to do with how business operates than these kind of things,"" she said.","Australian captain Drew Gollan shot dead in Antigua on January 22 .

"(CNN) -- Evangelist Billy Graham was at home Sunday after being discharged from an Asheville, North Carolina, hospital where he was treated for pneumonia, the hospital said. The 92-year old minister was admitted to the Mission Hospital early on Wednesday and returned to his home in the nearby town of Montreat, North Carolina, Sunday afternoon. His physicians said Graham's response to treatment has been good, but stressed his recovery will be slow. ""He has responded very well to treatment, with progressive improvement since his admission,"" said Lucian Rice, Graham's primary care physician. ""We expect continuing recuperation at home with very gradual recovery, returning to normal activities over several weeks. I'm delighted that he has come back this fast."" During his hospital stay, Graham watched television and remained in good spirits, spokesman A. Larry Ross said. He was visited Wednesday evening by his eldest daughter, Gigi, and met with his pastor, Dr. Don Wilton, Thursday morning. Ross said Graham will look forward to visits from close friends once he is stronger. Graham has been hospitalized or treated for several ailments over the years, including a head surgery, a fall, intestinal bleeding, prostate cancer and Parkinson's disease. According to Ross, Graham has remained in good health overall. Age-related conditions -- including macular degeneration and hearing loss -- have kept Graham at home in recent years, but the evangelist is involved in writing projects, including a manuscript for a book about aging, Ross said. The founder of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association has preached to millions of people over six decades, and has provided counsel to U.S. presidents, beginning with President Harry S. Truman. Graham's wife, Ruth Bell Graham, died in 2007.","His physician says Graham has responded very well to treatment .

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States is quickening the rate at which it is stepping back in Afghanistan. On Friday, President Barack Obama and Afghan President Hamid Karzai agreed to speed up the military transition in that country, meaning Afghan forces will take the lead in combat operations nationwide starting this spring. That transition was previously seen happening mid-year. ""What's going to happen this spring is that Afghans will be in the lead throughout the country. That doesn't mean that coalition forces including U.S. forces are no longer fighting,"" Obama said. ""They will still be fighting alongside Afghan troops. It does mean though that Afghans will have taken the lead and our presence, the nature of our work will be different. We will be in a training, assisting, advising role. ""It will be a historic moment and another step toward full Afghan sovereignty."" What's at stake in Afghanistan: 4 vital questions . The two presidents spoke to reporters in the White House East Room. The mood was cordial, belying the tense relationship of years past. Besides the accelerated timetable, Obama and Karzai agreed that the United States would hand over full control of Afghan prisoners. That demand had been a major sticking point for Karzai, who in return signaled he could be willing to consider immunity for U.S. forces beyond 2014. ""I can go to the Afghan people and argue for immunity for U.S. troops in Afghanistan in a way that Afghan sovereignty will not be compromised, in a way that Afghan law will not be compromised,"" he said. The United States plans to pull all combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of next year. There is discussion, however, of keeping a residual force there to help train security forces and conduct counterterrorism operations against al Qaeda. Obama has been insistent on legal protections. If there is no immunity agreement, the United States might find itself in a similar situation as when it left Iraq. The refusal by the Iraqi government to extend legal protections for U.S. troops after the end of the war there was a major reason the United States left the country with no residual military training force. There are currently some 66,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The war there is the longest in American history.","Afghan forces will take the lead in combat missions starting this spring .

"(CNN) -- Las Vegas police said photos they released of a ""person of interest"" sought in connection with a triple homicide show the wrong person. The photographs that police originally said depicted Tineesha Lashun Howard are instead of Tasha Malek, an account executive at a medical company who lives in Florida and appeared in the television series ""Bad Girls Club,"" the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said. Malek's attorney, Michael Grieco, told CNN that it took the police half an hour to realize that she was not the ""person of interest"" they were seeking once he told them that she was in Miami and sent them identifying information. According to Grieco, his client met the suspect in the killings two years ago when he lived in Miami and the two became friends, but they had not maintained contact. He said Malek does not know Howard. Ammar Harris, 26, is being sought in connection with Thursday's pre-dawn fatal shooting of Kenneth Cherry, an aspiring rapper known as Kenny Clutch. Clutch was driving his Maserati on Las Vegas Boulevard when he was struck by gunfire from a black Range Rover. The Maserati then collided with a taxi, which caught fire, killing the driver and a passenger. Police said the pictures of Malek were found in Harris' possession and that ""it appears Harris had obtained and downloaded images of this celebrity because of the identical resemblance to the person of interest and his known associate."" Howard, aka Yenesis Alfonso, is not a suspect in the shooting and accident, said Laura Meltzer, a Las Vegas police spokeswoman. ""She's somebody detectives would like to speak to in connection with this event."" Police say Howard has been identified as being inside the Range Rover at the time shots were fired from it; she is listed as missing and possibly endangered. Police have identified Harris as a suspect. He is at large; a black Range Rover police say he was driving early Thursday has been impounded. A woman who identified herself as Howard's mother told CNN that her daughter and Harris have been girlfriend and boyfriend for about a year. Miladys Garcia said she recognized Harris from an image that police issued but knew him by a different name. Garcia said she hasn't been in contact with her daughter since the shooting. She gave CNN with a phone number for Howard. A call to the number went to voice mail, and the mailbox was full. CNN's Cristy Lenz contributed to this report.","A woman sought in connection with a triple homicide was not the woman pictured .

"Editor's note: Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican, represents the 3rd District of Utah in Congress and is appearing in CNN.com's ""Freshman Year"" series, along with Rep. Jared Polis, a Democrat from Colorado. Here, his wife, Julie Chaffetz,  talks about how she copes with the challenges of her freshman year as a ""congressional spouse."" Julie Chaffetz and her husband, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, pose in front of a view of Washington. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- In reality, there's a lot more to serving in Congress than simply voting on the House floor. There are plenty of tasks -- technically optional -- that are essential for someone who wants to do this job well. No one makes you read the bills, but to do the job right, you must. There are constituents to meet with, letters to answer, staff to manage, media to respond to and new bills to research. These duties can eat up as much time as I can give. I'm learning to balance the workload. The real challenge for me is setting the work aside. My family is still the center of my life. I look forward to that flight home every single weekend. Through trial and error, Julie and I have learned some important strategies for making our family time count. I have learned to schedule time individually with each of my children. I also schedule time to date my wife. We met at a wedding in Arizona and started dating shortly after when I was a senior and Julie was a junior at Brigham Young University in 1989. We married in February 1991. Julie's challenges are different from mine. I'll let her explain what it's like to be a congressional spouse. Julie Chaffetz: As I sit down for a moment to type, I'm strangely aware that 10-finger typing is much harder than thumb texting -- a symptom of my life. Time seems to be flying, as the saying goes, and it is fun. Since Jason was elected to Congress, I have learned to adapt to many new challenges. Perspective is everything. Jason loves his job; I love my job. Raising three children to be healthy, happy contributors to society is my quest. Nurturing our 8, 13 and 16-year-olds is a lesson in constant motion -- or rather, commotion. It's important to me that they feel centered and cared for. Although I'm not a perfect mother, I've got great kids who reward me with hugs, smiles, occasional pouts and late-night chats. Planning is crucial. Before Congress, I tended to deal with things day-by-day. Now, time is precious. During our campaign I received some sage advice from Arizona Rep. Jeff Flake's wife, Cheryl. She recommended that when Jason is in Washington, I spend time doing the things I need to do on my own, such as errands, volunteering, time with friends, helping with homework, and home projects like learning how to repair a toilet -- and yes, I mastered this skill! So, when Jason is home, we can use our time as a family working, reconnecting and having fun. I'm a people person. Family and friends are a big part of my support. I'm the youngest of six and I have an amazing family. My parents and siblings are settled everywhere from Minnesota to Arizona. Fortunately, Utah is a great midpoint. We regularly have company; so much so that we've earned the nickname ""Hotel Chaffetz."" For day-to-day support, I'm lucky to have two very close friends. Our kids have grown up together and my friends are always there when I need anything: from picking my kids up from school if I'm running late, tending our dogs when we travel, or giving me a pep talk just when I need it. I also belong to a book club of six women. We have been laughing, counseling and spilling our guts to each other once a month for the past 16 years. And we still manage to read good books, too. One of my recent favorites is ""The Glass Castle"" by Jeannette Walls. Above all, I have learned to be flexible and keep my sense of humor. Recently, I was in Washington with Jason when he decided the right thing to do was to fly to Antigua and help some Americans out. Although I was tempted to be bugged, I chose to be flexible. I spent the rest of my day without Jason, flew home alone, and arranged for a ride home from the airport. Good friends are priceless. I'm the CEO of Utah Chaffetz and lovin' it! The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jason Chaffetz and Julie Chaffetz.","Rep. Chaffetz's wife, Julie, is raising three children; writes ""perspective is everything""

She also writes about her experiences on the campaign trail for the Web site, McCainBloggette.com. Meghan McCain said she was surprised, and now pleased, by her father's pick of Sarah Palin as running mate. Larry King: Why a children's book, I think aimed at five to 10-year-olds, about your father? Meghan McCain: I just thought it would be a really great way to make my father's story accessible to children. It is a really fascinating, patriotic American hero story and I had actually met a lot of people on the trail that weren't familiar with his story and -- . King: What kind of father is he? McCain: Great. I'm really lucky. I have a really great relationship with my dad. We have always been kindred spirits. My mom calls me ""John McCain in a dress."" We're a lot alike. We have a great relationship. King: What's the toughest part about writing a children's book? McCain: The illustrations were the hardest for me. How do you illustrate your father being tortured?  Watch McCain say what her parents think of the book » . King: What would your life be like if he's elected? You will have Secret Service protection. McCain: I know. I really don't want to do that. King: You don't like that? McCain: No, I really respect what they do, because obviously they're there to protect my family, but it's really weird. There are always people there to open up a room. I went with my mom to CVS and they had to check with CVS before we went in and there were people everywhere. King: Were you surprised of his selection for vice president? McCain: I think to a degree everyone was surprised because [Sarah Palin] was an unknown. But I'm very, very pleased with it. I love her. I'm really excited about it. King: What do you like about her? McCain: First of all, she's really chill. She's really nice, really friendly. She's really up on pop culture, which I always respect. She's very smart. She doesn't act entitled, which unfortunately sometimes you get with some politicians. She's just like your average girl, like just a mom. But she's very, very shrewd, very smart. I've heard her talking about issues.  Watch Larry King reveal what disappointed him in the interview » . King: They had fun with her on ""Saturday Night Live."" McCain: I saw. I used to intern there. King: You interned at ""Saturday Night Live?"" What was that like? McCain: It was incredible. I was there for the Ashlee Simpson lip synching incident. It was fantastic. King: You have blogged in support of Bristol Palin, who is with child, as we know. What made you speak out on that? McCain: I have grown up in politics forever. My father has been kind of pretty public. He ran for president when I was 14. I know what it's like to have children become a point of criticism or used as an example. She's 17 and she grew up in a small town in Alaska. I think people should support her and the media should lay off a little. She's very young and she's just trying to live her life. I don't think she should be an example of what to do or not to do. I just think she should be Governor Palin's daughter. King: What do you make of those who say that if you criticize Governor Palin, it's sexism? McCain: I don't think necessarily criticizing any candidate is sexism, but I do think that sexism has played a role with the governor and with Senator Clinton as well in this election. I don't think criticizing a candidate, no matter what gender, is necessarily sexism. King: You think Senator Clinton was a victim of it, too? McCain: I do. King: What do you think of Senator Obama? McCain: I think he's a really fantastic candidate as well. I really love that there's two such historical tickets right now. I think he's been respectful. I'm just really enjoying the election. King: What are your plans the rest of the campaign? McCain: Continue to blog. It's given me so much. I really enjoy doing it. It's a way for me to show the world what it's like to be on the campaign trail as a 23-year-old woman, when your father's [running for] president and it's been a way for me to show people what my parents are really like. I think journalists are not going to be in my mom's hotel room when she is in her pajamas. We put pictures of my mom in her pajamas on the blog. I love what it's done.","Meghan McCain has written children's book about her father, John McCain .

"(CNN) -- Football season is officially over. All 726 collegiate Bowl Games are in the books. The ink is dry on National Signing Day. And after a safety and ensuing punt officially closed the lights on the NFL season, sports lovers are left to ponder one extremely heavy-hearted question: ""Now what?"" With all due respect to the boys of summer, pigskin has shoved its way ahead of all other sports, using two heavily gloved hands to grab hold of the mantle as America's Pastime. But simply because football has taken a knee for a few months, that doesn't mean the average fan needs to go into hibernation. Here now, seven suitable substitutes to keep us all warm during the winter. 1. NHL -- In case you were unaware, which would be entirely understandable, relations have thawed between the world's best ice hockey players and those who sign their checks. (Note: It's likely that most financial transactions actually occur care of direct deposit, but let's not split hairs, especially when it comes to those sporting iconic mullets.) The business is no longer in the front, and the party is in fact back, because after a 113-day lockout, which cost the league some 625 games and more than half a season, in mid-January the NHL returned to rinks across North America. After long labor standoff, NHL players finally back on ice . Now with a condensed season (48 games for each club) that began roughly three weeks ago, each skate means that much more. ""Barns"" will be a rockin', and teeth will go a flyin', as goal-scorers and enforcers alike are forced to ratchet up their intensity and sharpen up their elbows. So pull your favorite team sweater out of the closet and dust off your abacus -- it's time to re-calculate ""plus-minus."" And toss the Gillette Fusion ProGlide back into your medicine cabinet, because it's never too early to start cultivating that playoff beard. 2. PGA -- We're still a handful of J.B. Holmes drives from hearing Jim Nantz's signature ""Hello Friends"" as the CBS mic-master welcomes us to The Masters in Augusta, reminding all that it remains ""a tradition unlike any other."" And while April and Amen Corner truly announce golf season, there are early signs to suggest the PGA is nearing full swing. On January 31, Phil Mickelson came within a breath of posting only the sixth sub-60 round of all-time, and three days later South Korean rookie James Hahn took the training wheels off golf's first celebratory Gangnam Style putting green jig. Certainly, we're a far cry from seeing PSY paired with Bill Murray at Pebble Beach, but weekends spent watching the world's best play 36 holes, against some of the world's most captivating backgrounds? That's one way to beat February's frozen tundra. Mickelson flirts with history in wire-to-wire Phoenix win . 3. College Basketball -- There is a prevailing theory that suggests the average fan doesn't begin paying attention to on-campus hoops until after the Super Bowl. OK then, here we go! With perennial powerhouses like Duke, Kansas, Indiana, Syracuse, Arizona and Michigan all littering the top 10, the rankings feel like a familiar throw blanket under which one might curl, as temperatures in Big East and Big 10 country drop to mirroring single digits. But with no undefeated or one-loss teams to be found, and four schools having claimed the No. 1 ranking in each of the last four weeks, expect the hardwood to heat up significantly as we dribble toward Selection Sunday. 4. The NBA's All-Star Weekend -- If you're feeling old, this won't help. On February 17, the greatest player to slip on sneakers turns 50. While Michael Jordan's Hall of Fame career often centered around an epic accumulation of numbers (more than 32,000 points, 10 scoring titles, 6 world championships,) seeing a sixth decade is an accomplishment unique unto itself, especially in as much as it will occur exactly on the evening of the game in which he starred 14 times. Beginning February 15, the NBA's All-Star Weekend blasts off from Houston, and ""His Airness"" figures to be prominently featured throughout the festivities. Long before ""King James"" and the ""Black Mamba"" had their own signature swoosh, every kid in America wanted to ""Be Like Mike"" 5. The Daytona 500 - Unofficially referred to as the ""Super Bowl of Racing,"" the green flag drops from Northern Florida on February 24, bringing about a season that will feature such fanciful phrases as ""restrictor plate racing"" and ""Boogity Boogity Boogity!!!"" Now why the sport holds its biggest event to begin the season is still as curious as the notion that NASCAR could list the left-directional as the sport's most important piece of equipment. Nonetheless, with ""The Great American Race"" just around the corner in Turn 3, it's time to refamiliarize ourselves with a world in which ""drafting"" has nothing to do with the Army, nor anyone's baseball keeper league. 6. The World Baseball Classic - Speaking of all things diamond, we're officially within a week from hearing the four most magical words in any baseball fan's vocabulary: ""Pitchers and catchers report."" But in the event that the start of spring training isn't enough for the average fungo fanatic, this years Grapefruit and Cactus League schedules will wrestle with the welcome interruption that comes care of the World Baseball Classic (first pitch, March 2). Created in 2005 as an answer to hardball being pulled from the Olympics, the 2013 tournament will be the third edition of the international event, and it arrives carrying a catcher's mitt full of story lines. Can anyone dethrone two-time champion Japan? How will opposing WBC pitchers deal with a loaded lineup coming out of Venezuela (Marco Scutaro, Pablo Sandoval, Miguel Cabrera and Carlos Gonzalez hitting 2-3-4-5)? And just how slick will a Dominican Republic infield be that could put Hanley Ramirez, Robinson Cano and Jose Reyes all on the lip of the grass at the same time? 7. NFL Combine - Even though fans will be without the pleasure of watching an actual, meaningful football game until after Labor Day, there will be plenty of tertiary topics to digest between now and the next series of opening kick-offs. Switching into a three-day format in 2010, and gobbling up a primetime position in the process, the popularity of the NFL draft has increased exponentially, comparing favorably with the vertical leap and 40-time of your average ""Mike"" linebacker. But before a single war room phone rings, and prior to the donning of any brand new Nike team caps, a week at the scouting combine in Indianapolis (February 20-26), gives football fans the chance to punch up the NFL Network and join stopwatch-toting GMs in evaluating the latest crop of linemen as though they were livestock. In the days that follow, avid NFL aficionados will wear out their index finger refreshing Mel Kiper Jr. and Todd McShay's latest mock drafts. And iPhones coast-to-coast will overflow with push notifications blasting the latest trade rumors. Come the April 25 draft fans will descend upon New York City's famed Radio City Music Hall in hopes of hearing their favorite club call the name of a left tackle who can protect their quarterback's blindside for the next decade. Until then, the Kansas City Chiefs are on the clock . For the rest of us, there's plenty to watch.","Football season is over, but CNN's Jason Kurtz has your guide to reasonable substitutes .

"(CNN) -- The three men spent 18 years behind bars for a brutal crime they said they did not commit. Locked away for life -- with one of them sentenced to death -- the men thought they would never experience freedom again. They had been imprisoned for the brutal 1993 murders of three young boys in West Memphis, Arkansas. Evidence against the men was circumstantial, however, and doubts grew over the years about their guilt. Finally, nearly two decades after the crime, the men were allowed to walk free last month, the result of a complicated plea agreement requiring them to plead guilty even while declaring their innocence. The men came to be known as the West Memphis Three. Two of them spoke to CNN's Piers Morgan in an interview that aired Thursday -- their first sit-down interview since their release. ""I hadn't seen daylight in almost a decade. I hadn't been exposed to sunlight ... for almost 10 years,"" Damien Echols told Morgan about his life on death row, where he lived in isolation in a concrete cell, his food passed to him through a slot in a solid steel door. ""The only thing you can do to maintain your sanity is to not think about the case and not think about what's happening to you,"" Echols said. ""You have to create your own world in there or you'll go insane from that stuff."" Echols still squints in bright light, the result of living for years in a dimly lit cell. When he left prison and saw daylight for the first time in a decade, Echols said, ""it was like having a spotlight turned right in your face. It was extremely bright."" Echols' friend and co-accused, Jason Baldwin, said he spent the first few years of incarceration being beaten up by fellow inmates, who targeted a man they thought was a child-killer. He said he suffered a shattered skull and broken collar bone, had teeth knocked out, and was left with scars on his face. ""But as the years progressed and people got to know me, and as the documentaries (about the men's plight) came out and stuff, the curses turned into prayers,"" Baldwin said. ""Those fights turned into hugs."" Baldwin, Echols, and a third man -- Jesse Misskelley, who declined to take part in the interview -- were imprisoned for the slayings of second-graders Steven Branch, Christopher Byers, and Michael Moore. The boys' mutilated bodies were left in a ditch, hogtied with their own shoelaces. Prosecutors argued that the defendants -- teenagers at the time -- were driven by satanic ritual and that Echols had been the ringleader. Echols and Baldwin said that at the time, they were targeted for being different from the rest of their peers in the small town where they lived. They read different books, wore different clothes, and had different haircuts. ""The evidence against us was our personal preferences in music,"" Baldwin said. ""I remember at one point during the trial, they lifted up a record, a Blue Oyster Cult record, and I think (prosecutor) John Fogleman said this was found in Damien's girlfriend's mother's house."" Critics of the case against the men argued that no direct evidence tied them to the murders, and that a knife recovered from a lake near the home of one of the men could not have caused the boys' wounds. More recent DNA testing also demonstrated no links, according to the men's supporters, who included actors Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder and singers Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam and Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks. Echols said their support was ""uplifting"" and brought attention to their case, ultimately leading to their release. Now, the men are having to get used to elements of modern life such as computers, the internet, and cell phones, things that most others take for granted. Even ordering a simple cup of coffee is different now. ""At one point, I went to a coffee shop and they were like, what kind of coffee do you want? And I'm like, kind of coffee?"" Baldwin said. The two have been out of prison for a month and a week. Baldwin says he now works for a construction company that's helping him get on his feet again, and he's learning how to drive. Echols says he hasn't yet found a job but is interested in pursuing visual art. He got married while in prison to Lorri Davis, a woman who took up his cause and started writing him letters in prison. She said they are still fighting for the real perpetrators to be brought to justice. ""We want to discover who did this,"" Davis said. ""That's the most important thing.""

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- A ferocious leopard may have killed 15 people in Nepal in a 15-month span, its latest victim a 4-year-old boy that the creature dragged away into the jungle to eat. The head of boy was found in the forest a kilometer from his home Saturday morning, said Kamal Prasad Kharel, the police chief of the Baitadi district, an area about 600 kilometers (373 miles) west of Kathmandu. The grisly discovery, which came after teams of people searched for the child, marks the 15th victim in the past 15 months in that remote district in western Nepal. The police chief suspects that a single man-eating leopard is responsible for the deaths. If not, there are at most two of the man-eating creatures around, he believes. Maheshwor Dhakal, an ecologist at the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation in Kathmandu, agreed that it is unusual to find more than one or two man-eating animals in one area. Most leopards live on wild prey. More human victims could also be expected if there were more than one or two man-eaters around, he said. ""Since human blood has more salt than animal blood, once wild animals get the taste of salty blood they do not like other animals like deer,"" Dhakal said. Kharel said he feared the actual number of people killed by the leopard could be higher than 15, because others have lost their life to leopard attacks in Uttarkhand state in northern India, which borders Baitadi district. ""It could be the same leopard,"" he said. Of the 15 victims in Nepal so far, two-thirds are children below the age of 10. The others are older children and a 29-year-old woman who had gone to collect fodder for domestic animals in the nearby forest, a common practice in Nepal. ""No adult male has been killed,"" Kharel said. All the victims are from villages bordering the dense forests in the district, he said. After killing its victim, the leopard takes the body away into the forest to eat. ""In the case of the children it just leaves behind the head, eating everything, but some parts of the adult body are left behind because it cannot finish it,"" Kharel added. The district administration has announced a Rs. 25,000 (about $300) reward to anyone who captures or kills the leopard. The local administration has sought to raise public awareness of the dangers of going alone into nearby forests and has mobilized the police, armed police force and local people who have licensed guns to hunt for the animal. Controlling this particular leopard has been a challenge for the wildlife officials in Kathmandu. ""We are sending a veterinary doctor to the district to understand the situation,"" Dhakal, the ecologist, said. ""There is no alternative but to kill the leopard."" The chief district administrator has granted permission for this particular leopard to be killed. Normally, it is illegal to kill wild animals. Leopards are common in the low mountain areas, as compared to the high Himalayas, across the country. While cases of leopards killing domestic animals are common, and there are sometimes instances of leopards killing people in Nepal, this case is ""extreme,"" Dhakal said.","A 4-year-old boy is the latest victim of a man-eating leopard, a local police chief says .
He suspects one leopard is behind the deaths of 15 people in the past 15 months .

"(CNN) -- More than 11 years after the start of the war in Afghanistan, there is some cause to celebrate and some reason to worry. But more than anything, maybe, there are questions. Those questions were on display Friday as Presidents Barack Obama and Hamid Karzai met in Washington to discuss the future of Afghanistan and the United States' role there. Some celebration is justified. Osama bin Laden is dead. Al Qaeda in Afghanistan is gasping for air. Before the United States invaded in 2001, the Taliban forbade women to even come out of their homes. Now women have more freedom -- more than 2 million girls are going to school. More than 300,000 Afghan children who live in the country are on Facebook. But it's not all good news. Military and civilian deaths continue. Contributing on the military side is the phenomenon dubbed ""green-on-blue"" or ""insider"" attacks. Of the more than 2,000 American deaths since the 2001 invasion, an increasing number have come at the hands of the Afghans they trusted and trained. It's worse for Afghans. Afghan National Security Forces are victims of a greater number of these insider attacks, a Department of Defense spokesman told CNN Friday. And consider some of the events of 2012: The year began with a video showing Marines urinating on dead Afghans. Published photos showed U.S. troops posing with corpses and U.S. soldiers burned Qurans at Bagram Air Force Base, apparently an act committed out of ignorance that it offended Islam. Protests ensued. Presidents agree to speed transition . Then there's U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, accused of rampaging through an Afghan village, murdering 17 Afghan civilians, including women and children. On Friday, the two presidents agreed to accelerate the military transition in Afghanistan. Afghan forces will take the lead in combat missions throughout the country starting in spring, instead of midyear as was previously expected. Even though Obama and Karzai agreed on some issues, others remain. Who's in control? First, Karzai isn't eligible to run for reelection in 2014. Because the country has a constitution and a working government, it's likely that at least some of the points he and Obama agree to could be carried out when he's out of power. But no one can say for sure, analysts note. So far, who would run for president after Karzai is unclear, though some intriguing names have been bandied around. On the ground, U.S. officials have said anywhere between zero to 9,000 U.S. forces could remain in Afghanistan past 2014. Not only will they perhaps have to operate in the tense green-on-blue environment, U.S. trainers who are teaching Afghan military enlistees how to fight say they are under enormous pressure to meet numbers at the sacrifice of quality, experts say. Gayle Lemmon, an American journalist who has spent years off and on in Afghanistan, most recently in December 2011, said a U.S. contractor who is training Afghan recruits complained to her that he doesn't have to thoroughly do his job. ""There has been a huge amount of pressure to put as many bodies in Afghani uniform as possible to meet 2013 deadlines,"" she said. ""He thought he had OK people but he didn't have time to pick out who was best and train the ones who needed extra help."" The ""overwhelming majority"" of them are coming from ""ordinary Afghans signing up for the military,"" experienced war correspondent Dexter Filkins has reported. What's the tab? This week, Karzai gave the Pentagon a wish list of hardware such as drones and helicopters that he said would help him continue to fight terrorists. No dollar amount has been decided. Estimates range from $1 billion to $10 billion a year -- and that includes military expenses, hardware and training, the whole deal that Afghanistan couldn't afford on its own. ""These are really funny numbers because no one knows the extent of what the U.S. is willing to offer,"" Lemmon notes. Whatever amount Obama administration floats will have to win approval from Congress. Former U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Ronald Neumann told CNN Friday that he thinks the total bill is going to depend on military presence. At a minimum, he figures, the United States will spend $5 billion in aid and military, not counting what would be spent for embassy costs. Those numbers cannot be calculated in a vacuum, either. As a discussion at the Brookings Institute involving the former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan noted, Afghanistan is facing a major economic downturn after 2014. A lot of money that has gone into Afghanistan has been wasted, numerous reports have shown. In 2011, one nonpartisan group told Congress that the United States was wasting $12 million a day among contracts issued to support American efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, CNN reported. Even Karzai, prompted by a question from a reporter, said Friday ""We have corruption."" Opinion: Abandon Afghanistan? A dumb idea . Who is the U.S. talking with and why? Last May, Obama made a surprise visit to Afghanistan, where he gave a speech about the end of the war. He said, ""We're pursuing a negotiated peace"" with the Taliban. To be clear, al Qaeda and the Taliban are two different entities, though there are ties. Al Qaeda is a terrorist group created by Osama bin Laden. The Taliban has provided shelter and support to al Qaeda. In its newest incarnation, the Taliban has new, and some younger-generation, members who say they want to find peace with the United States. In short, this is a complicated topic, as Foreign Policy detailed in December. Former Ambassador Neumann said it's wrong to call it a negotiation. Instead, he said, it's ""a group of multiple players we are only talking to. We are trying to see if there's negotiating room."" On the Afghan side, a November poll by the independent San Francisco-based group Asia Foundation found that more than half of Afghans felt that their country was moving in the right direction. That includes agreeing with the negotiation of government officials and those trying to work toward peace to talk with and find common ground with militants. Will the U.S. public stay interested? There were complaints during the U.S. presidential election that Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney did not talk enough about Afghanistan. But polls have shown that most Americans are tired of the war. A CNN/ORC International poll in September showed that only 3% named Afghanistan as one of the most important issues facing the United States. Earlier in 2012, CNN polling indicated that only 25% of Americans favored the war, and 55% said the United States should remove all of its troops before 2014. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta pushed back against that figure at the time, saying polls don't fight wars. And this week he reiterated his opposition to taking the number of troops in Afghanistan down to a paltry sum, and said zero is out of the question for him. If the United States military doesn't have a strong presence there, the chances of talking -- or negotiating -- with the Taliban is diminished, he argued. Neumann said he thinks the American public is disinterested in a war that has dragged on for so many years. That's a hurtful thing to hear for military families who have endured so much. Rebekah Sanderlin, a journalist and longtime military culture blogger, is disheartened by such talk. Her husband has done multiple tours in Afghanistan and is preparing to go back. ""It's offensive to me to hear that from people who haven't had skin in the game, that they are weary,"" she said. ""We still have troops fighting, sacrificing time with their families. All of that is much harder when you don't feel like your country is behind you."" Opinion: Obama should be honest with Karzai . Read more: Defense officials to press Karzai on what he needs .

"(CNN) -- The real referees were greeted with a standing ovation Thursday night as they returned to the field after a new contract was announced less than a day earlier. It may be the last time fans will voice their opinion on the recent NFL lockout that brought replacement referees to the football field. Thursday's 23 to 16 win by the Baltimore Ravens over the Cleveland Browns went on without much controversy, a far cry from the gaffe-filled display that punctuated the first three weeks of the professional football season. For NFL officials, it's a side job that requires a lot of work . Before Thursday's game NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said he was sorry the league felt it had to resort to the replacements, few of whom had any previous NFL officiating experience. Many were high school or low-level college officials who hold down myriad other jobs, from schoolteachers to attorneys. That ended Wednesday night when the NFL stuck a deal with officials. The eight-year deal, which must be ratified by union members, includes details about officials' pensions and retirement benefits, and adds a pay bump from $149,000 a year in 2011 to $173,000 in 2013. The pay will rise to $205,000 by 2019. It suspended the lockout that began before the league's preseason, leading to a series of gaffes that climaxed in a furor over a botched call that allowed the Seattle Seahawks to walk away with a victory in Monday night's nationally televised game against Green Bay. The league acknowledged Tuesday that the Packers should have won, but allowed the result of the game to stand. NFL chief apologizes about replacement refs . Goodell declined to criticize the replacements despite weeks of botched calls that raised the ire of fans nationwide. ""Everything they did, every call, was magnified,"" Goodell said. ""They kept the game going. They worked hard. They trained hard. They were incredibly focused and dedicated."" Henry Zaborniak, a fill-in line judge who lives in Ohio, said it was a hard job. ""We worked as hard as we could and we did the best we could,"" said Zaborniak, who spent 15 years as a Big Ten official,. ""None of us felt like we could replace the regular guys. You can't replace that sort of ability en masse."" What the refs were negotiating .","Fans give officials standing ovation before Thursday game at Baltimore .

"(CNN) -- In 2012, when people build farms on Facebook, kill pigs on their phones and gun down mutant space aliens on their home consoles, how do you define the word ""gamer""? It's not so easy, is it? The evolution of that question factors deeply in the plans of game hardware manufacturers and software development companies heading into this week's Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles. The annual convention, which kicks off Monday with a handful of press announcements, acts as a launching point for new games and improved gaming hardware in advance of the fall and holiday buying seasons. Because being a gamer has grown from someone playing for hours on a console to include people who may play only for short periods on a smartphone or tablet, designers and developers are scrambling to meet changing demands. In responding to this evolution of gamers, the companies say they have very distinct ideas about who they want to reach and how. Perhaps not so strangely, the player split -- between so-called traditional gamers and more casual ones -- begins in the living room. Wii U, 'Halo 4' boost anticipation for E3 . I spoke with five prominent gaming companies -- Sony, Microsoft, Electronic Arts, Bethesda and 2K Games -- who will be pulling back the curtain at E3 on their latest and greatest titles, features and plans. While they offered no big spoilers, they did explain how targeting different types of gamers weighed heavily into their decisions for E3. A fractured market . Some game makers are continuing to build powerhouse franchises, such as the ""Call of Duty"" series, that take hours to play. Others, like Electronic Arts, are leaning in the other direction to develop shorter, intense experiences -- sometimes with stand-alone titles or as smaller pieces of a larger game. ""We're going to be where the consumers are and, right now, they are basically everywhere,"" said Patrick Soderlund, executive vice president of EA Games Label, referring to the growth of mobile and social gaming. Soderlund said EA will be showcasing five console games during their Tuesday press conference, and most of the games will be deeply integrated with other products. ""We treat our games as a service,"" he said. ""We continue to listen to what consumers are telling us and what consumers want more of."" Sony is also prepared to broaden play beyond the traditional console, with software enhancements and games for its PS Vita handheld device. The company wants its PlayStation experience to be available at all points in the gamer's life. John Koller, director of PS Vita marketing, said the Vita is a foundation of Sony's strategy. Consumer trends since the handheld console's launch in February show an appetite for small, indie games that take less time to play, he said. ""'Escape Plan' is a good example of what I think we are going to see more of -- unique, Vita-specific content,"" he added, referring to the puzzle game that launched with the Vita. Targeting core gamers . If Sony and Electronic Arts want to capture gaming on the move, other companies want to appeal to gamers who want to stay inside. These companies recognize that mobile and social gaming are growing, but that doesn't stop them from pitching their games at core gamers. Microsoft is expected to show off enhancements to its Kinect motion controller, which the company hopes will transform the Xbox from a gaming device into an entertainment center for the entire family. ""From games to movies, TV and music -- how can we expand our footprint in that area?"" said David Dennis, Xbox product manager. ""What you'll see from us at E3 is certainly an expansion of that. We've got some amazing partnerships lined up to fully round out the different options of entertainment."" Two software companies, Bethesda Softworks and 2K Games, are positioning themselves at E3 to attract those players who want lengthy, immersive games that can take days to complete. Pete Hines, vice president of public relations and marketing for Bethesda, said their big titles for E3 are designed with the heavy-duty player in mind. Two of them are ""Elder Scrolls Online,"" a massively multiplayer online game with a medieval setting, and ""Dishonored,"" a new stealth action game with a steampunk look. ""People like to play good games,"" Hines said. ""We tend to focus more on that as opposed to what is our lineup of social games, what is our lineup of mobile games. That really isn't what Bethesda is about. We're not going to ... try and be somebody we're not because that's the new buzz in that type of gaming or audience,"" he said. 5 games to watch at E3 . Christoph Hartmann, president of 2K, believes their E3 lineup of games will appeal to the type of gamer who wants to spend a lot of time playing. Their three titles -- ""Borderlands 2,"" ""XCOM,"" and ""Spec Ops"" -- are existing franchises with deep fan bases. ""I think people are going for deeper and longer experiences,"" he said. ""Compare it to restaurants. Some people want a McDonald's world and others want a AAA Michelin star-rated restaurant. I think people really want to be engaged long term in a franchise or title."" So whether you want to spend hours gaming on a TV screen or just minutes on a smartphone, E3 is poised to show you new experiences. The trade show runs through Thursday and offers something for every gamer -- even if you don't stay in your living room to play.","Game developers must decide which kind of gamers to target .
This schism will be on display this week at the Electronic Entertainment Expo .

"New Bataan, Compostela Valley, Philippines (CNN) -- Two months ago, on December 4, Super Typhoon Bopha made landfall in the Philippines packing winds of 160 mph (260 km/h). It cut a swathe of destruction across the southern island of Mindanao, claimed the lives of over 1,000 people and affected over six million as it tracked across the Island. Coconut and banana plantations were flattened and 216,000 homes were damaged or destroyed. Today, more than 6,000 people in the worst affected provinces of Davao Oriental and Compostela Valley remain in evacuation centers, unable to go home. Since Bopha struck, Lydia Inungam, 38, has lived with her family in a tent provided by the Red Cross in the grounds of an elementary school in New Bataan Municipality in the Province of Compostela Valley. Altogether, 90 families live on the site and most won't be returning home any time soon as their homes were totally destroyed. Ten days ago Lydia gave birth to a daughter, her seventh child. ""I gave birth in a classroom because it was raining so hard and a storm was blowing outside,"" she said. ""I have never given birth away from my home and I was panicking when the labor pains started, I was afraid to give birth inside the tent."" For Lydia, nursing a newborn in the tent city isn't easy. ""It gets really hot in here,"" she said. ""At night the baby keeps on crying, she's not comfortable so we sleep at the classroom. We used to live in a cool breezy place by the river, unlike here."" A short walk away is the remains of Lydia's shattered village. Simple wood and bamboo huts lie crushed and splintered under the weight of fallen coconut palms. Lydia had a narrow escape. ""We first knew something was really wrong when the coconut trees started to fall and the river started to flood,"" she explained. ""As we ran to the rice fields the trees were thumping down all around us. The wind was so strong we had to crawl to the school building."" Driving through village after village in Compostela Valley, the massive scale of humanitarian needs is clearly evident. Partially collapsed houses line the roads, patched up with tarpaulins that serve as roof coverings and temporary walls. Tom Bamforth heads up the Shelter Cluster, an inter-agency coordination platform that brings together local and international humanitarian organizations that are responding to emergency shelter needs in Mindanao. He feels that support from the international community has been woefully inadequate. So far, only 20% of families have received any help to carry out emergency repairs on their homes. ""Donors don't seem to view shelter as the humanitarian priority here,"" he said. ""Ninety five per cent of those affected are living in their damaged homes or makeshift shelters, but the funding shortfall for shelter repair kits means that 54,000 families may not receive the help they need."" The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is one of the few agencies committed to providing tools, materials and technical training to families repairing their homes. Together with the Philippine Red Cross it also aims to help some whose houses were totally destroyed to rebuild from scratch. ""The current funding reality means that we can only provide a third of the 15,000 shelter repair kits that we included in our emergency appeal,"" explained Necephor Mghendi, the IFRC's head of operations in the Philippines. In terms of providing help to build more permanent shelter for families whose homes were totally destroyed, the IFRC is only able to support 700 out of target number of 4,000 families. Compared with other natural disasters of a similar scale, the donor response to Bopha has been muted, despite the Philippine government's appeal for international assistance. Even though it ranks as one of the most disaster-prone countries in Asia, the Philippines is widely perceived by donors as a middle-income country, less deserving of humanitarian assistance than some of its neighbors. The global financial crisis has also put the squeeze on humanitarian aid budgets and impacted levels of public giving to disasters overseas. Bopha didn't get much traction in the international media. Competing against Syria for the headlines, the story appeared to drop off TV screens within days. With scant media coverage, the job of NGO fundraisers was made even more difficult. Barely any British NGOs launched public appeals in the full knowledge that levels of public sympathy just weren't high enough. But if a category 5 super typhoon -- the largest on the scale -- does not warrant donor attention the future looks very bleak. Bamforth takes a hard line on the indifference shown by the international community to the disaster. ""The paradox is that while donors view the Philippines as more developed and less deserving, when a disaster like Bopha strikes, those development gains become very fragile as people's levels of vulnerability increase so dramatically,"" he said. Mindanao is one of the poorest regions of the country. Development has lagged behind other parts of the country, hindered in part by various long running insurgencies spanning four decades which have led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people. It has been the rural poor who have been hit hardest by Bopha. Areas such as Compostela Valley and Davao are the fruit bowl of the country exporting thousands of tons of bananas each year, but overnight the commercial plantations were decimated and thousands of workers lost their livelihoods. One worrying aspect of the social and economic impact of the losses inflicted by Bopha has been the increasing numbers of people seeking work overseas. ""Recruiters"" have begun to appear in some villages in Davao Oriental, targeting women to work as domestic help in the Middle East. Having lost much of their source of income as well as their major family asset -- their house -- many are prepared to face the risks and leave behind their children to support their families from afar. With no work, 63-year-old Rodrigo Palaga spends his days salvaging bits of debris to patch up his battered home in San Roque, New Bataan. But just as he fixed the corrugated iron roof, a wave of fresh flooding caused by heavy rains a week ago have left the shell of his home covered in a layer of stinking mud. With no running water since the typhoon, his daughter has no option but to bath their grandchild in bottled mineral water donated by an aid agency. As the house is still uninhabitable, at night the family of six sleeps in a tent at the bottom of his land made from a tarpaulin distributed by the Red Cross. ""We worry that the floods will come again, the children wake at the slightest sound outside,"" he said. ""We have been given some food supplies and household items but what I really need is plywood and tools to fix up the house."" There is no disputing that emergency relief is certainly needed by families such as Rodrigo's. But without support in all sectors, in particular shelter and livelihoods, already fragile communities will be left highly vulnerable to future disaster events and their situation will only keep deteriorating with the next storm season. For Bamforth, the priority is to provide households with the tools, materials and know-how to build back better. ""Unfortunately we are seeing the opposite situation,"" he said. Most NGO's are operating skeleton teams in the field and the funding gap has meant that humanitarian standards are being compromised. At the moment people might receive a tarpaulin and a piece of roof sheeting and are simply told 'that's it'.""","Philippines island Mindanao was hit hard by Typhoon Bopha .

"(CNN) -- We're going to feel a little guilty if this news gets you fired. But you can now play ""Angry Birds"" on Facebook. Rovio's ridiculously addictive mobile game, which has been downloaded more than 500 million times on multiple platforms since debuting on the iPhone in 2009, hit Facebook on Tuesday. While the company had leaked out news that the merger of the game's millions of fans and Facebook's hundreds of millions of users was coming, a Facebook ""launch event"" was scheduled for 6 p.m. ET on Tuesday. But players, including, presumably, the 15 million who were already fans of the game on Facebook, can start slingshotting their feathered friends now. In addition to allowing players to pay for special in-game tools, such as more powerful birds, the Facebook version of ""Angry Birds"" also adds a social-gaming element. Besides posting their scores to their News Feed, players can send in-game gifts to friends and get special rewards for earning some of the game's highest scores. Rovio's chief marketing officer (or ""Mighty Eagle"" in bird-speak) Peter Vesterbacka told the blog Penn Olson that the Finnish company hopes as many as 40% of players will pay for bonus items -- a far higher rate than for other social games like ""FarmVille"" or ""Mafia Wars."" Upgrades will cost 99 cents each. From an early look, the game appears to play much like the original version that appeared on iOS devices. The difference, obviously, is that players use a mouse instead of a finger to pull back the bird slingshot. They also must toggle the screen size up and down on a sliding scale instead of pinching a touchscreen. It's a play style that will be familiar to people who played the game on Google Chrome -- a version that rolled out last year. Players can switch to full-screen mode (which is sure to be noticed by your boss, unfortunately) and personalized avatars will be available soon, according to the company.","""Angry Birds"" makes its debut on Facebook .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- You wouldn't have expected Charlie Sheen to go quietly after his increasingly bizarre behavior prompted his TV bosses to fire him from ""Two and a Half Men,"" and Sheen would not want to disappoint you. He spewed an eight-and-a-half-minute, grandiloquent, profanity-laced tirade online late Tuesday, a day after he was sacked. At first Sheen comes across like a college student who's read too much of the Beat writers Jack Kerouac or Allen Ginsberg, referring to himself as the ""raven-wise, Gibson-shredding napalm poet before you, alone and unshackled. ""Oh how they once begged to attend my perfect banquet in the nude,"" Sheen intones. ""Now they just beg for the keys to my gold."" He calls himself the ""Malibu Messiah"" and repeatedly refers to himself as a warlock. But, clearly reading a prepared speech in video recorded live on Ustream.com, Sheen goes on long enough to make it hard for viewers to laugh off his rant. Chuck Lorre, the creator of the program that starred Sheen for eight years, comes in for the greatest abuse. ""I see you, you little worm, I see you behind your plastic smile, your bitchy pout, and your desperate need to be liked,"" Sheen says, calling the TV executive ""Chuck E. Cheese Ball,"" not using Lorre's full name. He accuses Lorre of ""narcissism, greed (and) hatred of yourself -- or women,"" one of several moments in the video that should give armchair psychiatrists plenty of material to mine. He says of CBS chief executive Les Moonves: ""You gave me your word so you gave me nothing. It must really suck being your missus,"" again mangling the name. ""A high treason has occurred,"" he concludes. ""The scales of justice are in a state of radical disarray. Together we must right this infantile wrong. Stay tuned, good soldiers. I'll see you all on the battlefield. Dogspeed."" The video ends with helicopter sound effects and a single person clapping. Warner Bros. Television fired Sheen Monday. ""After careful consideration, Warner Bros. Television has terminated Charlie Sheen's services on 'Two and a Half Men,' effective immediately,"" the company said in a statement. Sheen, 45, has been known for his highly publicized marital, legal and substance abuse problems as much as his acting. The show was put on hiatus after he entered a rehabilitation program in January, and production was halted after Sheen blasted Lorre and Alcoholics Anonymous in a February 24 radio interview. He has followed that up with a series of interviews in which he threatened to sue CBS for shutting down the show, demanded a raise from $2 million to $3 million per episode and insisted he was ""clean, focused and ready to get back to work."" ""I feel more alive, I feel more focused, I feel more energetic,"" Sheen told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" last week. ""I'm on a quest to claim absolute victory on every front."" Amid his professional squabbles with Warner Bros. and CBS, Sheen's estranged wife, Brooke Mueller, won a court order removing their twin sons from Sheen's home after she told authorities he had threatened to cut her head off, ""put it in a box and send it to your mom."" In an interview with NBC's ""Today Show,"" Sheen denied making the threat and insisted the quote was fabricated. Sheen earlier pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge involving Mueller in August 2010, receiving a sentence of 30 days probation, as well as rehabilitation and anger-management counseling. The following October, adult-film actress Capri Anderson accused Sheen of terrorizing her during a drunken rampage in a room at the Plaza Hotel in New York; Sheen sued her in November, claiming she tried to extort money from him. And Sheen's second wife, Denise Richards, accused Sheen of physically and verbally abusing her and threatening her life. She obtained a restraining order against him in 2006. The couple divorced that year, and Richards has custody of their two daughters. Warner Bros. Television is a division of Time Warner Inc., also the parent company of CNN.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan elders will decide whether any U.S. military who stay in the country after 2014 will be granted immunity from prosecution, President Hamid Karzai told reporters Monday in his palace. ""The issue of granting immunity to American soldiers is not a decision that could be made by Afghan government. This is a decision that the Afghan people can make,"" he said. ""This is a decision that should be made by the Afghan people in a Loya Jirga: whether they are granting immunity to them or not; if yes, how and under what conditions."" A Loya Jirga is a gathering of elders and peoples' representatives. Karzai was referring to a comment made last week during his meeting in Washington with U.S. President Barack Obama, who told him that the continued presence of any U.S. troops in Afghanistan after the planned withdrawal of NATO forces in 2014 would depend on their being granted immunity from prosecution by Afghan courts. ""The United States already has arrangements like this with countries all around the world, and nowhere does the U.S. have any kind of security agreement with a country without immunity for our troops,"" Obama said. But there is little doubt about what decision the Loya Jirga will reach, Karzai said Sunday in an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""I can tell you with relatively good confidence that they will say, 'All right, let's do it,'"" Karzai predicted. ""I could argue for it, I could sell it, and I'm sure they would understand. Loya Jirga is always reasonable."" Karzai said there was little chance the United States would remove all of its troops from Afghanistan after the pullout is completed at the end of 2014. ""The United States will continue to have the use of facilities in Afghanistan and, in order to run those facilities well for the purposes of continuing to fight al Qaeda and train and equip Afghan forces, the United States will need to have a limited number of forces in Afghanistan."" How many will remain is a decision that rests with U.S. officials, he said. But he predicted that domestic forces would prove capable of handling the responsibility. ""We have to provide for our own security; we have to provide for our own bread and butter, and I'm sure we are able and the Afghan people are willing overwhelmingly to do that."" Already, he said, stability has improved in areas vacated by departing international forces. Karzai also said that Afghanistan has turned the corner in terms of battling the Taliban. He predicted Islamic fundamentalists will not regain the strength to enforce their radical agenda, which has included the closing of girls' schools and the subjugation of women. ""I think there is now a critical mass in Afghanistan of the educated, of the Afghan people who want a future of progress and stability. And I think, also, that the Taliban have recognized that the corner has been turned.""

"(CNN) -- The U.S. State Department is offering $5 million for information leading to the ""arrest, transfer or conviction"" of three top leaders of the Lord's Resistance Army, the department announced Wednesday. One of those leaders, Joseph Kony, was the focus of a massive social media campaign called ""Kony 2012."" Kony is wanted by the International Criminal Court at the Hague for war crimes and crimes against humanity, stemming in part from allegations that he conscripted children as soldiers and sex slaves in his army, which operates in parts of Uganda and other parts of central Africa. A small number of U.S. special forces are advising and assisting regional military efforts authorized by the African Union, the State Department said. Some of those U.S. advisers have been operating in southeastern Central African Republic, according to the department.

"Washington (CNN) -- Living in a public park as a means of protest is not protected by the First Amendment, a federal judge said Tuesday in rejecting an Occupy DC demonstrator's request to keep park police from enforcing a ban on camping. Dane Charles Primarano sought a temporary restraining order prohibiting the National Park Service and its police department from taking action against protesters found sleeping in or in possession of camping gear in Washington's McPherson Park and Freedom Square. Primarano, who represented himself, argued that camping at the park is a form of constitutionally protected free speech. Judge James Boasberg disagreed, saying it is a matter of public policy, not constitutional law. The setback for protesters came on the first full day of the camping ban enforced by U.S. Park Police. Authorities told protesters Monday that they had to remove camping gear such as sleeping bags and housekeeping materials but could keep their tents so long as one flap remains open at all times. Protesters said Tuesday that police had told them they had ""a few hours"" to remove a large blue tarp they had draped over a statue of the park's namesake, Civil War Gen. James B. McPherson. Protesters have dubbed the tarp, covered with stars, the ""tent of dreams."" They decided later to let police decide what to do with the tarp. Authorities did not immediately remove it. Separately, a man attempted to tear the tarp down. He was stopped by protesters. Another man, or perhaps the same man, later cut some of the ropes holding up the tarp. He was removed by police. The tarp remained up. Protesters who had struggled to stay awake overnight vowed to stay strong early Tuesday. ""I had more fun in the park last night than the whole time I've been here,"" said demonstrator Amanda Rickard. ""We were out here playing guitar, singing, playing drums, Scrabble, card games, you know, just stuff to keep us busy so we can stay here and stay awake."" But one protester said he wouldn't be surprised if the mandate against camping gear and sleeping in the park takes its toll on protesters. ""To be honest, I don't know how long we can keep this up,"" Kevin Wiley said after a sleepless night. It was clear protesters did not like the rules. ""No justice, no sleep,"" one protester scrawled on a tent. Another sign, written in white paint on a blue tarp, said: ""Evicted from home by the banks. Evicted from the tent by the police. 99% has no safe place to rest."" But Wiley said they were trying to abide by the rules to ""show we are law-abiding citizens."" ""We're not out here just trying to have a good time. We are out here for a political message,"" he said. Protesters had made arrangements to sleep off-site in shifts, said Rickard, who acknowledged nodding off for about 10 minutes overnight. In another court hearing Tuesday on a case brought by Occupy DC protesters, Boasberg said he would rule within two days on a request that park officials be prohibited from seizing tents and other property without evidence of a crime, an emergency or a warrant. Occupy DC is part of a larger activist surge that began last year in New York and quickly spread across the country. While the protesters have highlighted a number of causes, the overarching theme has remained largely the same: populist anger over what activists portray as an out-of-touch corporate, financial and political elite. On Monday, City Hall in Oakland, California, reopened after a violent weekend clash between police and protesters that resulted in about 400 arrests. Authorities said protesters broke into the building and committed acts of vandalism inside. Police in Charlotte, North Carolina, also dismantled several tents at an Occupy camp there. ""We're doing the right thing, peacefully and quietly,"" protester Malachi Vinson told CNN affiliate WCNC. ""We're expressing ourselves in a better way than anyone else would."" CNN's Athena Jones, Joe Sutton, Courtney Battle, Paul Courson, Brian Todd, Dugald McConnell and Stacey Samuels contributed to this report.","A man attempts to tear down the ""tent of dreams"" tarp; protesters stop him .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- From the fingerprints and digital imaging stored on e-passports, to iris scanners set up at airport immigration, biometrics are a growing part of the traveller experience. Biometrics are a growing part of the traveller experience. It is estimated $7.3 million will be spent on them by 2013. Though some of the technology might seem like the stuff of science fiction fantasy (or nightmare, if you take the view of many civil liberty campaigners), the economics are very real. According to a recent study by market research firm ABI, investment in biometrics will drive global spending in the field to $7.3 billion by 2013, up from around $3 billion this year. The use of biometrics (broadly defined as technologies that identify people via physiological characteristics) has expanded rapidly in recent years. Almost every major hub airport has either begun using the technology, is trialling it or else has plans to do so. Biometric passports are fast becoming the norm with some countries like Germany storing fingerprint scans in chips on all new ones issued. In Britain, iris scanners have been introduced at a number of airports, including all five Heathrow Terminals to allow travellers to bypass normal border controls. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security plans to extend a program to fingerprint all foreign nationals entering the country. They are trialling it at Washington's Dulles airport and plan to roll it out to all international hubs by the end of the year. The concept of biometrics has existed for some time - the first commercial application of a fingerprint reader dates back to 1984. So why the sudden interest? It has been due in part to security concerns prompted by terrorist atrocities like the September 11 attacks in New York, and in part because of major advances in technology. ""In the last couple of years the technology has leapt forward in terms of its reliability, its accuracy and its robustness,"" says Nick Morse, from UK Biometrics, a supplier of biometrics technology to the British market. Certainly there is a dizzying amount of new technology being developed for the market. Iris-recognition scanners may eventually be superseded by retina scanners, which experts say provide a more accurate measure of identity. Meanwhile, fingerprinting scanners, which critics have blamed for inaccuracies, are being refined to scan below the skin, meaning that anyone wearing fake latex fingerprints would be detected. Other emerging technologies are palm and finger vein readers. Already in use in the banking sector in Japan, these scanners are thought to be more accurate than fingerprinting since a person's fingerprint alters in childhood whilst palm and finger vein patterns remain unchanged from the womb. The idea of having your identity tagged from birth brings many of us out in a cold sweat, and is the reason large swathes of the public remain vehemently opposed to the concept of biometrics. John Verdi, from the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a civil liberties NGO based in Washington, says one of the biggest concerns about biometrics is the risk of identity theft. ""The difference with biometrics and the reason it presents a substantial threat is that if your passport is stolen, the government can reissue you a new passport number and you can move on with your life,"" he tells CNN. ""If your biometrics are stolen, short of hacking off your finger there's no way for consumers or travellers to reacquire their identity."" Morse, from UK Biometrics, on the other hand, insists that much of the fear is borne out of a misunderstanding of the technology. Fingerprint scanners, for example, which his firm specializes in do not store fingerprints on a central database where they could be snooped on by governments and other agencies. The fingerprints are stored in a cryptic format on a standard PC, which he insists could not be reconstituted to create the actual print. Fears of Big Brother aside, the use of biometrics in air travel faces other more pressing logistical problems. Creating a harmonized system that speeds up rather than impedes the immigration process remains the biggest challenge. There have already been major teething troubles. According to the UK Border Agency, the new iris-recognition scanners installed at UK airports should get you through immigration in around 20 seconds. However, problems with their introduction, not least many more fliers than expected registering, have meant queues for the so-called ""fast-track"" scanners have often exceeded normal immigration. With so many different technologies being used to varying degrees by airport authorities around the world, getting everyone to adhere to a single global standard is another major obstacle. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the U.N. body that oversees air travel recognizes facial recognition as its primary biometric standard, with iris and fingerprints accepted as the two optional identifiers. Tony Concil, a spokesman for the International Air Transport Association (IATA) admits that implementing this global standard will not be easy. ""What we need to do is try and get these elements talking to each other, and also to start thinking of it as a complete process,"" he says. Morse believes this is easily achievable in the next few years and then, like it or loathe it, he says the age of biometrics will truly be upon us. ""I think the day of the almost totally biometric airport is very nearly with us.""","Biometric technology identifies people via physiological characteristics .
It is fast becoming a reality in most major airports worldwide .
Civil liberties groups say biometrics increase the risk of identity theft .
Facial recognition is accepted by the U.N. as the global biometric standard ."
"Atlanta (CNN) -- Ted Turner has donated $1 million to help save endangered gorillas in eastern Congo, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund announced. ""We may live on the opposite side of the planet from Africa, but what happens there can and will affect what happens here, and all around our fragile planet,"" he said Wednesday. He urged others to donate money to the cause, the Fossey Fund said in a statement.

His donation is aimed at helping to protect Grauer's gorillas in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, the fund said. The subspecies has ""received little protection and their numbers are plummeting,"" the fund said. The fund was founded by Fossey, the famous naturalist who was murdered in 1985 in Rwanda. The crime has never been solved. Turner's donation comes as the Fossey Fund works to build three new field stations and hire 30 new staff near the conflict zone in Congo, formerly called Zaire, that is the Grauer's habitat.

"(CNN) -- First-time Masters champion Bubba Watson admits he's still learning to control his emotions after a miraculous win left him bawling on the green. ""I'm just trying to figure out ways to calm down, to breathe differently to control me and keep me calm,"" the American told CNN's Shane O'Donoghue after Sunday's dramatic playoff win at Augusta National. ""I'm putting my head down between holes, not because I'm mad or disappointed, it's just because I'm trying to stay focused. ""If the crowd's cheering and I'm looking at them and talking, then I get so pumped up. The ball could go anywhere because I've got so much adrenalin pumping through my veins."" It was the first major tournament win for Gerry ""Bubba"" Watson Jr., who lost in a playoff at the PGA Championship in 2010. He became the 14th different winner in the last 14 major tournaments. After a miraculous escape out of woods to the right of the 10th fairway on the second hole of the playoff against Louis Oosthuizen on Sunday, Watson burst into tears. It was an emotional moment for the 33-year-old, who just two weeks ago adopted a baby boy, Caleb, with his wife. Watson's mother was the first person to greet him on the 10th hole, and he held her tight, crying on her shoulder. His father died right after Bubba played in the losing U.S. team at the 2010 Ryder Cup. Watson was more than 165 yards from the flag, his ball resting uncomfortably on pine needles following a wayward drive. But that didn't stop him hitting a hook shot 40 yards right, the ball rising 15 feet above the ground to sail through a small opening in the trees. The ball landed 10 feet from the hole, leaving Watson with two putts for the win after his South African opponent had bogeyed. The left-hander admitted relying heavily on his caddie for support during the astonishing shot. ""My caddie told me all the time, 'you're a good golfer. You're here for a reason. You can do this. You've done this all before. You just have to do it at this moment.' That's the thing; we've all hit these shots, it's just doing it at this moment. That's the trick,"" he said. Watson is now hoping the victory will pave the way for more major wins. ""As an athlete, as a golfer, this is the Mecca. This is what we strove for: to put on the green jackets,"" he said. ""As of less than two years ago, I didn't have a win. Now I've got four. My dream has always been to have 10 wins."" Oosthuizen, 29, had rocketed into the lead when he holed his second shot at the par-five second hole for only the fourth albatross in the history of the Masters. However, in the end, the 2010 British Open champion was no match for Watson. ""That was my first double eagle (albatross) ever, and to do it in a spot like Augusta, that's special,"" he said. ""I felt it was tough over the next four or five holes, but then when we turned, I felt very relaxed. I made a few great saves. I probably did very well to get in the playoff.""","Masters champion Bubba Watson is learning to control emotions after crying during win .

"(CNN) -- High tax is hurting European competitiveness in the energy sector, according to Iberdrola chief executive Ignacio Galan. Galan, boss of Spain's largest energy company, said European governments are over-taxing the industry because they believe utility businesses are ""too rich."" Galan added the industry: ""Is not as competitive as the American one... we are paying approximately 50% taxes when the American system is 10%."" Spain -- where Iberdrola is headquartered -- is the eurozone's fourth-largest economy with unemployment at 26.1%, second only to Greece in the single currency bloc, according to Eurostat data. Iberdrola combats some of that slump, Galan told CNN. the sector employs ""750,000 people directly so we can already help the governments to create wealth and to create jobs."" But in 2012, the company was hit by a 36% fall in earnings within Spain, despite investing 20 billion euros [$27 billion] into the country since 2001. And Galan stresses that European governments, not just Spain, should consider the impact of taxes on corporate cash flows and reinvestment. ""If they are already taking money in cash flows, in taxes, then this money cannot flow into investment."" Based in the Basque city of Bilbao, Iberdrola is also the world's largest producer of wind energy. Galan told CNN that today, less than 40% of the Iberdrola's business is dependent on the eurozone as the company diversifies its risk in other countries including the UK, U.S., Mexico and Brazil. He added that the taxes imposed by European Union governments are not making reinvestment in Europe an attractive option. ""If we are not generating enough cash flows, then we are not going to invest in those areas,"" he said.","Based in Bilbao, Iberdrola is also the world's largest producer of wind energy .

"(CNN) -- For most European clubs, qualifying for the Champions League is a reason for great celebration. For Arsene Wenger, if his Arsenal team can pull that off for a 16th successive season, then it will represent something of a ""Great Escape"" -- and strong dÃ©jÃ  vu from the last campaign. Saturday's 2-1 victory at West Brom lifted the London side up into the fourth and final qualifying place in England's Premier League, raising hopes among fans that they might yet again be watching top European football in 2013-14. London rivals Chelsea can reclaim that coveted position with victory at home to Sunderland on Sunday -- and even go third if Tottenham lose against sixth-placed Everton. And with runaway leaders Manchester United having all but sewn up a record-extending 20th title ahead of Monday's derby with second-placed champions City, the fight for minor placings is much more intriguing. Failure to qualify will be a bitter blow for any one of the capital trio -- for Spurs after last season's heartbreak; for Chelsea's ruthless owner Roman Abramovich after yet more big-scale investment in the team; and for Wenger as it would raise the chances of his 17-year reign coming to an end. Then there are the financial implications: just qualifying for the Champions League group stage this season was worth $11 million for each of the 32 teams, plus television money and a $1.3 million bonus for each match victory -- rising substantially until the final, where $13.5 million is on offer for next month's winner. ""It will be difficult and edgy until the end but the only thing I can say is that we are ready for a fight,"" Wenger said after two goals from Tomas Rosicky put Arsenal ahead against eighth-placed West Brom before defender Per Mertesacker's sending-off led to a penalty by James Morrison. ""We now we have one target -- to win our games. Then we do not have to look at Tottenham or at Chelsea. If we lose our games, you have always to look at the results of the others. ""That doesn't work in our job. You have to focus on you, and you win the games."" It happened last season when Tottenham blew a 10-point advantage to allow Arsenal into third place, and then missed out on the Champions League when fifth-placed Chelsea won the final in Munich. That gave Wenger a stay of execution, despite extending Arsenal's trophyless run to seven seasons, but this time the 63-year-old Frenchman has been under even more pressure after embarrassing exits to lower league sides in the domestic cup competitions and mixed EPL results. His team went out of the Champions League at the last-16 stage against Bayern Munich on away goals, though a defiant victory in Germany raised morale after a 3-1 mauling in the home leg. ""We have shown two aspects of our game today,"" Wenger said. ""One that was very in control and with technical quality, and one that is less known -- fighting spirit, a resolute attitude and battling qualities that reflect well the spirit we have in our side. ""I believe that since November we have been on a good run in the Premier League. We have made 22 points out of the last 27 but our target is to continue to do that until the end of the season."" In Saturday's other results, Aston Villa moved out of the bottom three with a 3-1 win at Stoke, as Belgium striker Christian Benteke wrapped it up with his 15th league goal this season and 19th overall. Reading stayed bottom on goal difference below Queens Park Rangers after losing 2-0 at home to new manager Nigel Adkins' former club Southampton -- who sacked him in January after a five-game unbeaten run. Southampton climbed up to 11th place, seven points clear of the relegation zone, after a third successive win for new Argentine manager Mauricio Pochettino. Ninth-placed Swansea came from behind to draw 2-2 with Norwich, as Spanish forward Michu scored his 17th league goal this season for the Welsh club before fellow striker Luke Moore earned a point.","Arsene Wenger praises Arsenal's attitude after claiming fourth place in EPL .

It is an object with many meanings and provides a link to a past that we all share and to a key moment in history that has shaped the world around us. As such it is an object of international significance and is about to start a tour of five major U.S. museums, debuting at the Smithsonian's Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington in March 2013. The tour is supported by the Iran Heritage Foundation. The Cylinder was buried under the walls of Babylon around 539 B.C. after the Persian king Cyrus had captured the city. It describes how Cyrus was able to defeat the Babylonian king Nabonidus with the aid of the Babylonian god Marduk, who had run out of patience with Nabonidus and his shortcomings. Once he had entered the city, Cyrus did not burn it to the ground (as usually happened with conquered cities at this period) but he freed the population from forced labor obligations, sent back to various shrines statues of gods, and allowed the people who had been brought to Babylon by the Babylonian kings to return to their homes. By this act, he was effectively allowing people to pursue unmolested their own religious practices. TED.com: The history of our world in 18 minutes . After it had been buried, the cylinder lay undisturbed for more than 2,400 years until it was dug up in 1879 by a British Museum excavation led by Hormuzd Rassam. When the Babylonian cuneiform was translated, it was immediately realized that the cylinder had a very special significance. Here was corroboration of one of the best-known stories in the Hebrew Bible, the liberation by Cyrus of the Jews deported to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar and their return to Jerusalem to build the Second Temple. Although the Jews are not mentioned by name in the cylinder, they clearly must have been among the people allowed to return home at this time, with their temple goods. The cylinder also confirmed existing impressions of Cyrus. In the Hebrew Bible he is variously described as the Lord's Shepherd and the Messiah, no doubt largely because of his favorable treatment of the Jews. Not only did he allow them to return to Jerusalem, but he also restituted the temple treasures seized by Nebuchadnezzar and provided royal funds to pay for the rebuilding of the temple. TED.com: Revealing the lost codex of Archimedes . In consequence, Cyrus has been favorably viewed by many Jewish writers, not least in the context of the foundation of the state of Israel. But it is not only in the Bible that Cyrus was revered. The Greek author Xenophon made him the subject of a political romance that seeks to establish the principles of good government, and his book ""Cyropaedia"" (the Education of Cyrus) is even said to have been consulted by Alexander the Great. In the 18th century ""Cyropaedia"" became required reading for all aspiring politicians, along with works such as ""The Prince"" by Machiavelli, and it certainly influenced the founding fathers of the United States. Thomas Jefferson is said to have owned two copies, one of which will be on view in the Washington exhibition. Amidst so many of democracy's icons and treasures, even before the discovery of the cylinder, therefore, Cyrus was a role model for many aspiring to govern. As Julian Raby, Tte Dame Jillian Sackler director of the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery and the Freer Gallery of Art, comments ""Cyrus was the very image of a virtuous ruler, so it is apt that the first time it will be seen in the U.S. is in Washington, D.C."" Just as Cyrus has long been a role model, the cylinder itself has now acquired iconic status for people around the world. It has even been described as the first declaration of human rights, and while this was never the intention of the document -- the modern concept of human rights scarcely existed in the ancient world -- it has come to embody the hopes and aspirations of many. TED.com: Ancient wonders captured in 3D . It has continued to feature in political debate, being the symbol of the celebration of 2,500 years of Iranian monarchy in 1971, and also celebrated by the Islamic Republic of Iran, as evidenced by its popularity during the recent exhibition in Tehran. The cylinder may still have a role to play on the international stage today. It advocates -- or can be argued to advocate -- religious tolerance and acceptance of diversity, in terms that derive exclusively from Middle Eastern traditions. As such the principles it embodies should be central to debates about the future of the Middle East and other regions. Note: After the display at the Sackler gallery, the Cyrus Cylinder will travel to the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York; the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco and will conclude at the J. Paul Getty Museum at the Getty Villa in Los Angeles in October.

"(CNN) -- World champion Jorge Lorenzo hailed MotoGP's new qualifying format after claiming pole position for Sunday's season-opening race in Qatar. The Spaniard headed off Britain's Cal Crutchlow in Saturday's new 15-minute session, involving just the top 12 riders, while last season's championship runnerup Dani Pedrosa was third to complete the front row. ""It's great to finish in pole position, especially knowing Cal was extremely fast over one lap,"" Lorenzo, who won last year's race from pole, told the MotoGP website. He said of the new qualifying format: ""It's very different to last year and I think more fun for the fans to watch. ""From the point of view of the riders, I feel more nervous and with more pressure on me because you know you have only four attempts for your last lap -- and not 15 like last year! So it's more important to go quickly and not make a mistake."" Italy's Andrea Dovizioso was fourth for Ducati ahead of German rider Stefan Bradl and Spanish rookie Marc Marquez, who had topped the practice times in his first outing for Honda Repsol. Lorenzo's new teammate Valentino Rossi continued his struggles of the past two years at Ducati as he could only qualify seventh. ""Qualifying was not fantastic for us,"" said the seven-time world champion, who has won three times in Qatar but not since his last season at Yamaha in 2010. ""Our performance in free practice was better than this, so we'll wait for tomorrow. Unfortunately in qualifying, on the second tire -- with which I could have improved -- I was stuck in traffic so could not improve my lap time and lost some positions. ""For sure, tomorrow becomes more difficult to start from further back, but we have good pace so we can be quite competitive."" Pedrosa is seeking to improve his record at Losail -- one of only two circuits on the current calendar where the Spaniard has yet to win in any category of bikes. ""It's important that we're on the front row,"" the Honda rider said. ""I think the Yamahas are strong, so I just hope to improve the bike a little bit more and then be on the pace for the race.""","Jorge Lorenzo sets the quickest time in qualifying for first race of MotoGP season .

"(CNN) -- He shouldn't even have been playing but Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic played a vital role in ensuring his side held Barcelona to a 2-2 draw in an engrossing Champions League quarterfinal in the French capital on Tuesday. The Swede was originally banned for the first leg but after winning an appeal with UEFA last week, the 31-year-old scored PSG's first equalizer before setting up their second for Blaise Matuidi, who scored with the very last kick of an entertaining game. Barcelona's sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta had raised questions about Ibrahimovic's eligibility before the match, after PSG succeeded in halving a two-game ban following the former Barca player's dismissal against Valencia in the Round of 16. Zubizarreta may have been shaking his head in knowing fashion at the end, as may coach Tito Vilanova who returned to the Barca bench for the first time in two months following cancer treatment as the French league leaders hosted their Spanish counterparts. The four-time European champions led at halftime with Lionel Messi having converted Dani Alves' exquisite pass after 38 minutes but Barca fans will be worried by the hamstring pull the Argentine suffered at the end of the first period. It prevented him from reappearing for the second half and in the absence of a player with 57 goals, Vilanova's side struggled to break down a PSG team who stuck to their game plan, one which featured a surprise call-up for former Real Madrid midfielder David Beckham. The England man, 37, was playing his first Champions League tie since appearing for Milan in 2010 and departed -- moments after being booked -- with 20 minutes to play, whereupon the drama began to unfold. Eleven minutes from time, Ibrahimovic -- who signed a five-year deal with Barcelona in 2009 but whose spell at the Nou Camp was so unhappy he left after just twelve months -- converted from close range, despite being in an offside position, as he reacted quickest to a towering header against the post by the outstanding Thiago Silva. With two minutes left, PSG's hard work seemed empty as Xavi converted a penalty but redemption came in the 94th minute as Ibrahimovic -- who had had a goal disallowed moments earlier -- guided a knockdown to Matuidi, who fired home thanks to a slight deflection. ""They have an amazing team who keep the ball very well but in the first half, we had some amazing chances and if we had put one of them away it could have been different,"" Beckham told ITV television after the match. ""I think we deserved the draw. I'm enjoying being part of these nights again. They are very special. They don't get better than this. We'll go to their place and it could be difficult, but there's no reason why we can't get a result."" ""We all hope Messi is fit and ready to go - we wish him the best,"" added Beckham, who had warmly embraced the Argentine before the game. The late equalizer ensured that PSG -- whose fortunes have immeasurably improved in recent times thanks to the significant spending of the club's Qatari owners -- defended their six-year unbeaten home record in Europe. Barcelona, meanwhile, have now won just three of their last 15 knock-out ties away from home in the Champions League. ""We have paid a heavy price because we lost Leo Messi and (Javier) Mascherano, who could be out for four to six weeks,"" said assistant Barca coch Jordi Roura. ""With Messi we shall see what the scans say on Wednesday."" ""There were also some questionable refereeing decisions and what is not up for debate is that we deserved better. Ibra's goal was certainly offside. I don't know what this will do for PSG's morale in that they twice came back but for us it is a favorable result."" The dramatic finale added extra gloss to a game which PSG, whose average attendances were worryingly low just two years ago, say they could have sold up to a million tickets for, with the club contesting a first Champions League quarterfinal in 18 years -- with the return leg coming next Wednesday. In Germany, it was business as usual for Bayern Munich as last year's Champions League runners up hosted Juventus three days after thrashing Hamburg 9-2 in the Bundesliga. Like the game in Paris, this clash also pitted league leaders against one another -- with Bayern demonstrating their strength in depth by starting with Claudio Pizarro, who netted four goals against Hamburg, on the bench. The hosts were the far stronger side in Munich and dominated proceedings in a 2-0 win, so much so that they may feel a little aggrieved to only lead by goals from David Alaba -- after 26 seconds -- and Thomas Mueller. ""It was a very intense game and our attacking players invested a lot into defensive work, which displayed great commitment,"" said goalscorer Mueller. ""It's a bit of a shame that we didn't score a third goal."" Bayern were also rocked by a groin injury to Toni Kroos, which could keep the midfielder out for six weeks. ""We know there is still the return leg to play and we can certainly hope for a comeback,"" rallied Juventus midfielder Andrea Pirlo. ""Bayern played better than us for the entire 90 minutes. It was very difficult for us to play our normal game."" By the time they meet again, Bayern may be the German champions as they can wrap up the title on Saturday should the Bundesliga leaders, who have a 20-point lead, win at Eintracht Frankfurt.","Ibrahimovic scores one and makes on as PSG hold Barcelona to a 2-2 draw in Paris .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- A legislator from Thailand's ruling party said Tuesday that he is proposing a new abortion law there after police found thousands of illegally aborted fetuses in a Buddhist temple. Abortion is illegal in Thailand, unless a woman is endangered by pregnancy or has been raped. The proposed law would allow unprepared, underage mothers and poor parents who can't afford to feed their children to get abortions, lawmaker Satit Pitutacha said. Satit said that he and other legislators would submit a bill for debate when the lower house convenes in January. The law would decrease the death rate of women during abortion and reduce the rate of deformed or disabled babies born during botched procedures, he said. ""I think this issue should be raised on the national agenda in order to let all parties discuss this sensitive topic, so we can find the optimal solution,"" he said. The issue surged to the forefront of public debate in the Southeast Asian country last week, after a smell of decay at the Phai-nguern Chotinaram temple in central Bangkok led investigators to more than 2,000 fetuses there. Police said the fetuses came from illegal abortion clinics. Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva weighed in with support for existing laws in his weekly address Sunday, the MCOT news agency reported. But a survey of 1,458 people living in Thailand's capital and neighboring provinces conducted by Suan Dusit Rajabhat University last week said 65.6 percent of respondents felt the abortion laws should be amended, because Thai society had changed radically. More than 62 percent of those surveyed said they did not understand why there were so many abortions, and about 15 percent said abortion was both a sin and illegal. But nearly half of respondents (47 percent) said it is an individual's right to have an abortion, if the need is shown. The poll's margin of error was 5 percent, according to the survey's administrators. After last week's investigation at the Buddhist temple, authorities arrested a woman on charges of performing illegal abortions and opening an unlicensed clinic, said Col. Sombat Milintachinda, chief of the investigation team. And two morticians have been charged with hiding bodies and faced about a year in jail if convicted, police said. CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.","A lawmaker says his proposal would decrease the death rate of women during procedures .

"(CNN) -- A 52-year-old California woman identified last month as one of two suspects sought in connection with a child pornography case linked to the San Fernando Valley was indicted Tuesday on federal charges. Letha Montemayor Tucker, also known as ""Butterfly,"" was named in the four-count indictment returned by a grand jury. It accuses her of conspiracy to produce child pornography, production of child pornography, conspiracy to engage in child sex trafficking, and sex trafficking of children. If convicted on all counts, Tucker would face from 10 years to life in prison. The woman's tattoos helped identify her. They include a sleeping, curled up cat on her right shoulder blade, a butterfly on her right-upper thigh and the word ""butterfly"" across her left outer wrist. Tucker's public defender, Myra Sun, said she had not seen the indictment and had no comment. The indictment comes a month after tips from the public led to Tucker's identification and arrest as one of two individuals allegedly involved in the production of child pornography images that were shot about 11 years ago. The pictures show an unidentified man and a woman, believed to be Tucker, sexually molesting a girl who was then 11 to 13 years of age, according to the indictment. The time estimate is based on a 2001 calendar visible in some some pictures. According to the seven-page indictment, Tucker and the girl -- identified in the indictment only as JMM -- lived together at about that time in a residential hotel in the Los Angeles area. Tucker worked as a prostitute, gave JMM -- who was born in 1988 -- crack cocaine and directed her to engage in sexual acts with Tucker's male clients, it says. In or about May 2001, Tucker contacted ""John Doe"" and asked if he would be interested in having sex with the girl in exchange for money, it says. Tucker then took the girl to his residence, where the girl and ""John Doe"" engaged in sex acts, which were photographed, it adds. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children concluded that the images were likely produced in the San Fernando Valley, a center for the production of pornography. Homeland Security agents discovered the images in 2007, but did not locate the victim or determine the identity of the woman until January, when they appealed to the public for help. Tucker is being held without bond and is scheduled to be arraigned in United States District Court on February 13. The victim, now an adult, ""is safe and is cooperating with the ongoing investigation,"" it said. ""The victim in this case was devastated when she learned from investigators that these sexually explicit images had been distributed over the Internet,"" said ICE Director John Morton. ""The reality is, every time such images are viewed, the children shown are exploited yet again. That is why we owe it to these young victims to vigorously pursue these cases and hold the perpetrators accountable for their reprehensible crimes."" The images of the victim remain on the Internet. ""They've been found in more than 300 separate locations,"" said Joey Blanch, the assistant U.S. attorney prosecuting the case and the deputy chief of the violent and organized crime section. ""They're just out there, and there's almost nothing we can do to get them back."" The name and whereabouts of ""John Doe"" -- who appears to be 40 to 50 years of age in the images -- have not been determined. His face is obscured in the images, Blanch said. ""If somebody knew him well, they might be able to recognize him from his hairline, and might recognize the apartment,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- In the midst of intense national gun debate, lawmakers in Pennsylvania proposed a tougher gun law -- but only for the city of Philadelphia. New legislation calls for a two-year minimum sentence for any illegal firearm possession in the city, bumping the current misdemeanor charge up to a felony. State Sen. Larry Farnese of Philadelphia, a Democrat, and Rep. John Taylor of Philadelphia, a Republican, joined with local officials to announce the proposal in hopes of decreasing violence in the city. In a news release issued Thursday, the day the legislation was introduced, Farnese said that ""it gives Philadelphia's law enforcement community an important new tool that will help curb gun violence and keep illegal weapons out of the hands of criminals."" Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams added that the change would ""make the message loud and clear -- if you carry an illegal gun in Philadelphia, you will go to prison."" Other state officials are positive about the proposal, even though it would apply only to Philadelphia. ""In urban areas, it's a much more chronic issue. I think we have to do something about the gun situation there,"" Sen. Stewart J. Greenleaf said Friday. Greenleaf, a Republican representing parts of Montgomery and Bucks counties, just outside the city, is a part of the Senate committee that will review the legislation. He said his only concern is the wording making the sentence mandatory, which he said might imprison people who don't belong in jail, such as those whose gun permits might have expired without their knowledge. A study by the Police Executive Research Forum last year called Philadelphia the nation's most violent city in the nation, with a homicide rate well above other municipalities. The proposal was made on the same day that neighboring Connecticut and Maryland passed sweeping gun legislation. Connecticut's new law bans some weapons as well as the sale or purchase of high-capacity magazines such as those used in the Newtown shooting in December that left 20 children and six adults dead in a school. It also requires background checks for all gun purchases. In Maryland, the legislation includes a ban on assault-style weapons and sets a 10-round limit for gun magazines. It also will require training for many first-time gun owners and bans some individuals with mental health issues from gun ownership. The proposed legislation will be reviewed by committees in the Pennsylvania Senate and House.","The new law would apply only to the city of Philadelphia .

"(TIME.com) -- Researchers report a breakthrough in generating powerful antibodies that can neutralize HIV. An HIV infection is really an intensive molecular arms race launched from the minute the virus infects a new host. AIDS progresses not because the body isn't capable of fighting off HIV -- it is. But the immune defenses eventually succumb to the virus in the final standoff. Now researchers led by Barton Haynes, director of the Duke University Human Vaccine Institute at Duke University School of Medicine, believe they have found a way to tip the odds in the immune system's favor. From the moment of infection, the immune system goes on alert and immediately generates antibodies designed to attach to and destroy HIV. And for the first few weeks, these antibodies are successful, eliminating all but a few viruses that remain hidden away from the body's surveillance systems. These viral stalwarts then mutate to escape detection and start to flourish, expanding until new antibodies are generated to dispatch them. That launches another wave of viral destruction that pushes HIV to mutate yet again, prompting another immune attack, and so on, until eventually the body isn't able to keep up with the virus and pushes out poor, or no more additional antibodies that can neutralize HIV. TIME.com: A newborn may be cured of HIV. Is the end of AIDS near? That's the scenario in about 80% of those who are infected with HIV. But in a fortunate 20%, this arms race is stacked in the host's favor, with antibodies that are able to neutralize not just the latest, specific mutated version of HIV but a broader range of viral marauders. Such broadly neutralizing antibodies are the holy grail of AIDS vaccine researchers, who hope to corral these agents in an immunization that can protect against infection. But most attempts to convince the body to churn out these antibodies haven't been successful, primarily because the antibodies take on an unusual shape that marks them for destruction by the very immune system that generated them. In addition, these antibodies can bind to and destroy healthy cells as well as HIV-infected ones, making them a potentially useful but unpredictable partner in fighting the virus. TIME.com: Study explains how the first effective HIV vaccine worked . But by carefully mapping the different mutations that HIV generates, and the resulting antibodies made against them in an African patient who is able to produce broadly neutralizing antibodies, Haynes and his colleagues believe they have come up with a way to drive the immune system to preferentially churn out these HIV-fighting immune cells. ""We followed individuals from the time of HIV infection to the time they generated broadly neutralizing antibodies, and mapped and isolated the virus at every step along the way so we now don't have to guess any more about what induced those antibodies,"" he says. ""We have a map on how to recreate the sequential (versions of HIV) that could drive particular antibody lineages."" The work, which was published in the journal Nature, was possible because Haynes had collected and saved blood samples over the course of about three years from roughly 400 patients, starting within weeks of their infection. Researchers found that the first round of broadly neutralizing antibodies generally appeared about 14 weeks after infection, and these were better able to bind to portions of HIV that the virus doesn't change as quickly or as frequently. That makes the antibodies useful weapons in attacking the virus' Achilles heel, and a potentially powerful target for an effective vaccine. TIME.com: Treatment as prevention: How the new way to control HIV came to be . ""Now we have a picture of how these antibodies developed, so what we are doing is figuring out how to use them to make a vaccine,"" says Haynes. The challenge will be to push the body to pump out these antibodies rather than the more specific ones aimed at the ever-changing portions of HIV. It turns out that most infected people do produce these antibodies, but HIV distracts the immune system into crowding them out with all the subsequent iterations they convince the body to make against the mutating virus. ""We are trying to take an unusual or rare event and make it more common,"" says Haynes. TIME.com: HIV drugs may prevent infection in healthy individuals . Ultimately, he adds, a vaccine will probably need to generate several of these broadly neutralizing antibodies; each person tends to make unique versions that have differing efficacy in stopping HIV. But there's precedent for such an approach, since the antiretroviral drugs that now control HIV infections are used in combination to hit the virus at more than one point in its life cycle. ""The hope is that by mapping individual pathways to generating broadly neutralizing antibodies, we can find some commonalities among people even though everyone is different, and that gives us hope for using these pathways in a vaccine,"" says Haynes. ""It's a huge effort but it looks like it's going to pay off."" This article was initially published on TIME.com. Anti-HIV antibodies may spur AIDS vaccine development . &copy 2012 TIME, Inc.

"(CNN) -- Somali lawmakers voted for a new president Monday, a key milestone for the war-torn nation as it establishes its first stable central government in decades. Parliament members picked Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, a political newcomer who has worked for the United Nations and several international organizations. The new president, who also served as a university professor, defeated the incumbent and some two dozen other candidates. The vote marks a milestone for the nation, which plunged into chaos after Dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown 21 years ago. Following his ouster, clan warlords and militants battled for control, sparking a civil war and mayhem nationwide. Somalia has not had an effective central government since then and has mostly remained under a shaky transitional federal government. ""Somali people have taken a great step forward on the path to peace and prosperity,"" said Augustine P. Mahiga, the U.N. envoy to the nation. ""Today, Somalia's parliamentarians â€” in a calm, dignified and contemplative mannerâ€” ended the transitional period decisively. Somalia has proved the doubters wrong and sent a powerful message of progress to all of Africa and indeed to the entire world."" The vote is the latest in a series of political transitions in the nation. In recent weeks, it has adopted a provisional constitution, selected members of parliament and appointed that body's speaker. ""It has not been easy getting us to this point,"" Mahiga said. ""There have been moments when all seemed lost and we have sometimes been on the brink of despair."" The White House congratulated the new president and called on Somali leaders ""to usher in a new era of governance that is responsive, representative and accountable."" ""The United States calls on the international community to reaffirm its commitment to Somalia, and to help realize a more secure and prosperous future for the Somali people,"" it said in a statement. Candidates in Monday's parliamentary vote included outgoing President Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, who has been in power since 2009, and his prime minister. Both have been accused of failing to crack down on corruption and Islamist militants in the nation. Over the years, gunbattles between militants and government troops became a common fixture in the capital of Mogadishu, forcing lawmakers to meet in neighboring nations for security reasons. Somalis have fled in record numbers, and are living as refugees in nearby nations. Somalia's problems have elevated into worldwide concerns as neighboring nations struggled to contain the influx of refugees and the instability fueled the growth of Islamist insurgents. This is the first time Somali politicians have picked a new leader at home because of security concerns, according to Hamza Mohamed, a Somali analyst based in London. ""Previous elections were held in Djibouti and Kenya,"" he said. ""Because of this, Somalis feel they're part of the process this time even though they're not voting in the president."" Despite the move toward a more permanent government, challenges remain. Large parts of the country are under the control of militants and pirates. And even though insurgents have fled the capital and guns have fallen silent, portions of the nation remain lawless. African Union and Somali troops are battling Al-Shabaab militants, an al Qaeda-linked group that controls part of the nation's south. The militant Islamist group has waged an insurgency against the weak transitional government since 2007 . In recent months, the troops have driven the militants out of Mogadishu, and the capital is slowly trickling back to normalcy. Coalition forces are exerting control in more areas, but the nation was not secure enough to hold a nationwide vote. ""The transition is over. Somalia must now focus on stabilization, reconciliation and building sustainable and accountable institutions of governance capable of providing services to its people,"" Mahiga said in a statement. The new president will serve a four-year term.","NEW: White House calls for ""a new era of governance"" from Somalia's leaders .

"San Diego (CNN) -- Who's afraid of a harmless course in Mexican-American studies? Arizonans. That's who. It figures. In the immigration debate, the state that has demonstrated that it is terrified of changing demographics and determined to run off Latinos seems afraid of its own cultural footprint. We're talking about courses in Mexican-American history being taught to high school students of all colors and backgrounds in the Tucson Unified School District. Concerned that teachers are presenting material in a biased and inflammatory manner, a posse of elected officials, education bureaucrats and school board trustees -- made up of Democrats and Republicans -- are trying to shut down the district's Mexican-American studies program. Those wrongheaded efforts got a boost last week when, at an administrative hearing, state Administrative Law Judge Lewis Kowal -- relying on auditors that had surveyed only a few classes -- found that the program was being taught in an inappropriate manner. It's rare that you find ethnic studies at the K-12 level. Maybe that's because parents and communities are sometimes uncomfortable with the subject matter. I bet you could go into most high schools in the United States, and you'd find U.S. history textbooks that make no mention of the Chicano Movement, the birth of the United Farm Workers union, the Zoot Suit Riots and a long list of other seminal events experienced by Mexican-Americans in this country. And given that Latinos account for 16% of the U.S. population and are projected to make up twice that percentage in a few decades -- and that Mexican and Mexican-Americans account for about two-thirds of the Latino population -- that sort of blind spot doesn't serve anyone's interests. Latinos have to learn about the culture and institutions of the mainstream. Why shouldn't those in the mainstream have to reciprocate and learn a little something about Latinos? That's not only fair, but also wise. These days, it's hard to be wise in Arizona. An ominous state law passed by the legislature in 2010 bans courses that teach ""racial resentment"" or are ""designed for a specific ethnic group"" or advocate ""ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals."" Under the law, the state can withhold 10% of the funding for a school district -- in the case of Tucson, about $15 million a year -- until the district changes the courses or eliminates them. In writing his opinion, Kowal charged right into the debate with the grace of, well, a right-wing radio talk show host. ""Teaching oppression objectively is quite different than actively presenting material in a biased, political, and emotionally charged manner,"" Kowal wrote. ""Teaching in such a manner promotes social or political activism against the white people, promotes racial resentment, and advocates ethnic solidarity, instead of treating pupils as individuals."" As an example of the harm supposedly done by such courses, he brought up one lesson that taught students that the historic treatment of Mexican-Americans was ""marked by the use of force, fraud and exploitation."" And so? Isn't that true? And isn't the same thing true of Asian-Americans, Native Americans and African-Americans? Are these the next groups to be bullied? So we won't teach the ugly chapters of American history. Why not just have the textbooks written by Hallmark? Here's what this is really about. A group of people is afraid that the tables are being turned, and that they will eventually lose power and suffer retaliation. So they're portraying themselves as victims of a new oppression. This view is shared by Republicans and Democrats alike. It makes no difference. This isn't about partisanship. It's about pettiness. And losing your place in line. Arizona, the problem child of the Southwest, has it backward again. In recent years, state officials have made it awfully clear where they believe Latinos belong in the social pecking order. The bottom. That was the message when artists hired to paint a mural at a school in Prescott were told to ""lighten"" the face of the child at the center of the drawing because people objected that the figure was obviously Latino -- before the school came to its senses and retracted the order. That was the message when state lawmakers passed a tough immigration bill that encouraged ethnic profiling by deputizing local and state police to enforce federal immigration law based on who they suspect is in the country illegally. And that was the message when state education officials went so far as to bar instructors who are determined to have heavy accents from teaching English language classes.

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin ordered a mandatory evacuation of the city beginning 8 a.m. Sunday but urged residents to consider escaping ""the mother of all storms"" before then. New Orleans residents leave Friday via Interstate 10 westbound ahead of Hurricane Gustav. ""You need to be scared,"" Nagin said of the Category 4 hurricane tearing along Cuba's western coast. ""You need to be concerned, and you need to get your butts moving out of New Orleans right now. This is the storm of the century."" The city's west bank is to evacuate at 8 a.m. Nagin said the city had evacuated roughly 10,000 people Saturday on buses, trains and planes, in addition to the thousands who left on their own. Buses from collection points would continue running until midnight and resume at 6 a.m. Sunday, he said.  Watch CNN's Don Lemon report on evacuations » . ""This storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day,"" Nagin said. ""I'm not sure we've seen anything like this."" At 8 p.m. ET, Gustav's eye was over western Cuba near Los Palacios, about 65 miles (105 kilometers) west-southwest of Havana, with sustained winds near 150 mph. Hurricanes are ranked 1 to 5 in intensity on the Saffir-Simpson scale. A Category 4 has winds of 131 to 155 mph and can cause extreme damage.  Watch a report on the hurricane watch » . ""This storm could be as bad as it gets,"" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said Saturday afternoon. ""We could see flooding even worse than we saw in Hurricane Katrina."" New Orleans joined the growing list of local governments in south Louisiana ordering mandatory evacuations on Saturday and Sunday as Gustav roared past Cuba and into the Gulf of Mexico. iReport.com: Leaving home? Share your story . Many parishes also were imposing tough dusk-to-dawn curfews, hoping to assure residents that they could evacuate without fear of their vacant homes being looted. Jindal did not order mandatory evacuations at a state level, but he urged residents to take the evacuations seriously. ""I wouldn't worry about whether the evacuation in your parish begins at 4 p.m. today or 8 a.m. tomorrow,"" he said. ""When it comes to evacuation, do it sooner rather than later."" Jindal said the state planned to begin ""contraflow"" procedures, opening both sides of interstates to outgoing traffic only, at 4 a.m. Sunday. Thousands of people had begun fleeing the coast by the time a hurricane watch was issued Saturday afternoon for southeastern Texas to the Alabama-Florida border. The watch, which means hurricane conditions are possible within 36 hours, was announced the day after many in the region marked the third anniversary of Katrina's landfall. In New Orleans, anxiety was high Saturday as residents fled, leaving behind a ghost town of boarded-up homes and empty streets.  Watch Nagin urge people to leave » . Hundreds of people lined up for buses and trains to take them out of New Orleans and thousands of other Gulf Coast residents drove inland, clogging major highways. At the Union Passenger Terminal in downtown New Orleans, people began arriving as early as 5:30 a.m., forming a line that snaked behind the main Amtrak terminal. Humvees circled the crowds of people, many who waited as long as 2½ hours, enduring the heat and relentless sun, unsure of their destination. New Orleans officials designated 17 sites for people without transportation to board buses to take them to the terminal, where they will be moved to shelters outside New Orleans. However, scores of residents went directly to the terminal, prompting confusion, as did a glitch in the computer system being used to register people.  Watch people flee New Orleans in buses » . Jindal suspended registration at the terminal and instructed people to register when they arrive at shelters. By Saturday afternoon, 1,100 to 1,200 people had left the city on those buses, Nagin said. ""I'm not sure where I'm going,"" Margie Hawkins of New Orleans said. ""My last 24 hours have been somewhat worrisome and very, very prayerful, because this is a very serious threat, and it's a lot of people to get to safe ground or be safe where they are."" The city also arranged with Amtrak for more than 7,000 seats to evacuate the elderly by train. About 1,500 people left for Memphis, Tennessee, Nagin said. There were also crowds at New Orleans' Louis Armstrong International Airport, which the city plans to keep open through 6 p.m. CT Sunday. Both Delta Air Lines and AirTran Airways said they planned to continue flights in and out of New Orleans until the airport is closed.  Watch residents prepare to leave the city » . Vehicles jammed Interstate 10 headed west toward Texas. Cars also clogged Interstates 55 and 59 heading north out of eastern Louisiana. Heavy volume was also reported on Interstates 65 and 59 as Mississippi evacuees streamed north. The hurricane is projected to pass over western Cuba and to move into the southern Gulf of Mexico early Sunday and into the central Gulf by early Monday, according to forecasters. Gustav could make landfall as a Category 3 or 4 on the U.S. Gulf Coast late Monday or Tuesday, the National Hurricane Center said. Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour announced Friday that Hurricane Katrina victims living in government-issued trailers or mobile homes along his state's coast would begin evacuating Saturday. The storm called up uneasy memories Friday of the deadly 2005 hurricane season, particularly of Katrina. When Katrina hit, more than 1,800 people died in five states, 1,577 of them in Louisiana. Unlike the situation during Katrina, there will be no ""shelter of last resort,"" the city said. In 2005, the city's Louisiana Superdome housed thousands of New Orleanians who couldn't, or didn't, heed the mandatory evacuation order.  Watch FEMA administrator talk about being proactive » . Nagin warned that all but a ""skeleton crew"" of city workers would be leaving the city and said local authorities could not promise help for those who choose to stay behind. ""This is very, very serious, and we need you to heed this warning,"" he said. ""We really don't have the resources to rescue you after this.""

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- In a very clever television advertisement, Delaware Senate candidate Christine O'Donnell looks directly at the camera and says to voters: ""I'm not a witch. ... I'm you."" In another ad, O'Donnell says that unlike her Democratic opponent Chris Coons, ""I didn't go to Yale. I didn't inherit millions like my opponent. I'm you."" This statement, in a nutshell, is the message of the Tea Party movement. O'Donnell promises that she will not follow the practices of Washington incumbents who believe that trading favors and making backroom deals are legitimate ways to stay in office. O'Donnell is not alone in advancing this message. In West Virginia, Democratic Gov. Joe Manchin is facing an unexpectedly difficult race against Republican John Raese to fill the seat of the late Sen. Robert Byrd. According to Politico, the casting call for an advertisement that was recently broadcast by the National Republican Senatorial Committee in West Virginia stated that they were searching for the "" 'Hicky' Blue Collar look. ... These characters are from West Virginia so think coal miners/trucker looks."" Many conservative candidates this year have been tapping into the tradition of conservative populism, a tradition that has animated right-wing politics since the 1970s. In their effort to challenge the legacy of the New Deal and the Great Society programs and to overcome the image of country club conservatism, many in the GOP have argued their party best represents average Americans. They have focused on social and cultural issues and anti-establishment rhetoric to claim this mantle. In 2008, Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a potential presidential candidate in 2012, talked about ""Sam's Club Republicans."" The problem they have to overcome is there is a major disconnect between their message and the record of the Republican Party in which they are running. When Ronald Reagan became president in 1981, he advanced the agenda of supply side economics and economic deregulation. His policies have defined the Republicans ever since. According to Reagan, economic policies that benefited the wealthiest Americans would have a trickle-down effect that eventually helped lower-income brackets. Regressive tax cuts that benefit wealthier Americans but generate deficits were also fine since, in the long run, more revenue would flow into the Treasury from rising wages. The voices of conservatives who were skeptical of the theory of supply-side economics rapidly faded away. That includes George H.W. Bush, who in 1980 called Reagan's proposals ""voodoo economics."" In his book ""Unequal Democracy,"" political scientist Larry Bartels has documented the effect of these policies. During the conservative era of American politics, the so-called Age of Reagan, the distribution of income and wages has become more unequal in the United States than in comparable countries. ""Under Democratic presidents,"" Bartels writes, ""poor families did slightly better than richer families (at least in proportional terms), producing a modest net decrease in income inequality; under Republican presidents, rich families did vastly better than poorer families, producing a considerable net increase in income inequality."" See more CNN.com opinion articles . While there are a number of factors behind these changes, public policy mattered very much. According to Bartels' persuasive account, rising inequality was not just a result of natural market forces such as globalization, but also a product of partisan choices about the direction of economic and fiscal policy. Americans, he shows, in all income brackets have enjoyed more economic success when Democrats inhabit the White House. Meanwhile, the economic policies of Republican presidents, such as regressive tax cuts, have disproportionately benefited the wealthy. In another book, political scientists Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson have reached a similar conclusion. They have shown how the mobilization of business in Washington during the 1970s profoundly effected inequality. Allying with the Republican Party, the business community pushed for the deregulation of numerous industries, tax cuts for the upper-income classes and policies that weakened organized labor. The result, according to Hacker and Pierson, were policies that left working- and middle-class Americans at the mercy of powerful market forces. Playing defense, many Democrats, including President Clinton, followed this agenda as well. Although President Obama has continued part of the centrist approach of Clinton on many economic issues, he has also pursued economic policies that have focused on working- and middle-class Americans. His economic stimulus program revolved around government spending for projects that would bring jobs to the unemployed and prevent other jobs from disappearing. His health care reform will expand coverage to more than 30 million Americans who have been left outside the market. He has pushed for an extension of the Bush tax cuts to all but the highest-income Americans. To be sure, he has been far from successful. The high unemployment rate is evidence that the success of Obama's policies have been limited, and the administration made compromises that avoided more stringent constraints on powerful interests. Given the history, O'Donnell's ad, as good as it is as a piece of political theater, has its problems. Her website suggests that O'Donnell, like most Tea Party candidates, will not depart that greatly from the GOP's economic policies of tax reductions, deregulation and the curtailment of government spending. It might very well be that O'Donnell is one of us, but her party's economic policies have tended to benefit a very narrow and well-off portion of the population. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Christine O'Donnell's campaign, ads stress populist theme of ""I'm You""

Ebro is a global producer of rice, pasta and sauces with a large international footprint -- its home Spanish market accounts for just 7% of its turnover. ""The war between the different currencies is an alarming situation,"" said CEO Antonio Hernández, ""we are still in a weak recovery; we need to export goods outside.""

""It could even be a problem for competition,"" said Hernández, ""a newcomer into the industry can now hire staff at lower levels."" Despite this, Ebro's sales increased in Spain in 2012, suggesting that the domestic appetite for branded food is finally returning.","Ebro is a global producer of rice, pasta and sauces with a large international footprint .

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- Sudan has asked for an emergency meeting of Arab foreign ministers ahead of the expected indictment of the country's president for genocide and crimes against humanity in Darfur, according to reports. The U.N. estimates 2.5 million have been forced from their homes in Darfur. CNN revealed Friday that International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo has scheduled a news conference Monday, just after he is expected to file the warrant with the court. If the warrant is issued it would make Omar Hassan al-Bashir the first sitting president to be indicted by the ICC for genocide. Arab League spokesman Abdel Aleem el-Abyad told The Associated Press Saturday that Arab League chief Amr Moussa, who is currently in Paris, was making phone calls to Arab foreign ministers to try to schedule a meeting. The Sudanese ambassador to the United Nations told CNN Friday that the ICC had indicated to Sudanese officials that al-Bashir may be charged over the five-year campaign of violence in the country's Darfur region.  Watch a tour of Darfur's deserted Northern Corridor » . ""We have been hearing that this prosecutor is going to announce some names, possibly the leadership of the country, that will be indicted,"" said Adbalmahmood Abdalhaleem Mohamad. ""It is a criminal move that should be resisted by all."" Such an indictment, Mohamad said, would be a destabilizing move that would ""take us back to square one."" Sudan, he said, is ""condemning it in the strongest possible terms"" and urged the international community to do likewise. ""We will resist it by all possible legal means,"" he said.  Watch actress and Darfur activist Mia Farrow speak on the issue » . The prosecutor said in a progress report last month to the Security Council that Sudan's ""whole state apparatus"" had been mobilized ""to plan, commit, and cover up crimes"" in Darfur.  Watch how some are concerned by the move » . ""For the last five years, the whole Darfur area has been a crime scene,"" Moreno-Ocampo said last month. The Darfur conflict began in 2003 when Darfurians rebelled against the central government over its alleged favoritism to Arabs over Africans. The government in Khartoum fought back allegedly unleashing the janjaweed militia to quell the uprising -- a claim the government denies. The authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents there, according to the United Nations, western governments and human rights organizations. Militias targeted civilian members of the tribes from which the African rebels draw strength. Human rights groups blame the janjaweed for most atrocities, including the use of rape as a weapon of war. Meanwhile, the chief U.N. humanitarian coordinator said aid workers are preparing for the effects of an indictment. ""We are taking precautions to make sure that people are aware of the risks and what we need to maintain our operations at the same time,"" said John Holmes. ""We're taking sensible precautions hoping nothing will happen, because humanitarian aid should continue whatever the political situation, whatever the political arguments."" The U.N. estimates that some 300,000 people have died in the conflict and more than 2.5 million have been forced from their homes since 2003. Sudanese officials say only 10,000 have died in the fighting and have rejected claims from the U.S. and others that genocide is taking place. Witnesses who spoke to CNN Correspondent Nic Robertson in May said that just four months ago, government airplanes and helicopters attacked defenseless civilians in their Darfur villages. They said the government struck in coordination with militiamen riding horses and camels -- a classic pattern that has unfolded around Darfur. More than 115 people were killed in that attack, they said, and nearly 58,000 people fled. In 2005, the Security Council cleared the way for possible Darfur war crime prosecutions by the ICC, a permanent tribunal set up to handle cases related to genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The court is based on a treaty signed by 106 nations -- excluding Sudan. Once the court indicts someone, authorities in that person's native country -- or the country in which the indicted person is located -- have the power to detain the indicted person for trial at the Hague. The ICC has already indicted two men for Darfur crimes -- one a government official and the other a militia leader. The cases are against Ali Kushayb, a militia leader, and Ahmad Harun, former minister of state for the interior in Sudan, who is now in charge of humanitarian affairs for the Sudanese government. Both face charges accusing them of murder, rape, forced displacement and other offenses in Darfur. An arrest warrant for Harun charges that he was involved in the murder, rape, torture and forced displacement of civilians. The court also says he encouraged such illegal acts in public speeches during his tenure as minister of state for the interior. The criminal court says Kushayb led several thousand militia members and personally participated in attacks against civilians. An arrest warrant outlines numerous cases of murder, rape and inhumane acts.","International Criminal Court may seek arrest of Sudan's president .

"(CNN) -- Maersk Line, the container division of AP Moller Maersk, holds 16% share of the world's seaborne freight business and is regarded as a barometer of global trade. Last year, the company downgraded its growth estimates from 4% to 3% as the global economic downturn and an oversupply of vessels hit the industry. It was indicative of industry-wide problems. ""Shipping is a tough area to be in at the moment,"" group chief executive Nils S. Andersen told CNN. ""We make money, but not a lot."" So, the company is looking to diversify. ""What we're doing now is trying to build up a set of parallel activities with equal importance, with the oil company being the most established and largest activity we have outside shipping,"" he said. Investment will be increased in the oil, drilling and port divisions, areas which have proven to have stronger growth and profit potential. By 2020 the company hopes to increase its oil production by 50%, which translates into an extra 400 000 barrels per day. Meanwhile, the Maersk Line division will focus on the frontiers of growth, in particular China, a market Andersen has dubbed ""the most dynamic trade development in the world."" A rise in domestic consumption in China has led to an increase in their imports and Andersen sees this as a key opportunity. ""We see exports out of Europe growing quite rapidly to China, and the same goes for the U.S.,"" said Andersen. ""It could be branded products, food stuff, or even raw materials for production -- more and more finished products go to China."" Andersen also pointed to the company's move toward mega-ships. The first Triple E vessel, made in Korea, will be introduced this year. ""It's going to be four hundred meters long and will be able to carry 18,000 containers. It's by far the largest vessels in the container trade,"" Andersen said. Maersk Line have ordered ten of the $190 million ships, a hefty investment in the short-term. However, in the long-term . Andersen hopes the ships will lower costs. ""I'd say the most exciting part of it may not even be the scale, but the fact that we will be able to transport containers from Asia to Europe with far less fuel."" Andersen noted fuel consumption could be cut by 30% to 50%. By reducing the company's fuel costs and refocusing investment in the oil and gas divisions, AP Moller Maesrk hopes for a future with less volatility and calmer seas.","Last year Maersk downgraded its growth estimates from 4% to 3% .

"(CNN) -- A proposal by European policymakers to cap bankers' bonuses will ""damage"" competitiveness, according to a top executive at Standard Chartered. The measures -- being imposed to stop banks paying bonuses for excessive risk taking and dodging financial regulations -- create an unfair burden on the London-based bank and could hit its ability to create top-level staff Richard Meddings, Standard Chartered chief financial officer, told CNN. Meddings' comments come amid a political crackdown on the banking sector after a series of scandals including allegations Standard Chartered breached U.S. regulations over its dealings with rogue states. In December the bank agreed to pay $327 million to U.S. authorities to settle charges it violated international sanctions on historic transactions with Iran, Burma, Libya and Sudan. Previous fines the bank had agreed to pay to regulators brought the total paid by the British banking giant to $667 million. When asked if the bank had failed in its ambitions to reach self-imposed value goals, Meddings told CNN's Richard Quest: ""We have apologized for the mistakes we made in our historic sanctions regime, and I am happy again to repeat those apologies...we are talking about a period some time ago, in the 2001 to 2007 period."" Meddings said the bank continued to focus on the values, which include responsiveness and trustworthiness, assessing employees against them and good performance. It remains vital to be able to reward employees competitively, Meddings said. ""We want to be able to pay our people for good performance."" Last week policymakers of the 27-nation European Union agreed a provisional deal to cap bonuses for bankers at a year's salary, or two years pending shareholder approval. The highly complex legislation has been heavily criticized by Britain Prime Minister David Cameron, who says it will unfairly impact London's financial sector -- the largest in Europe. Meddings added: ""We compete with banks in Asia and the American banks in Asia, the Middle East and Africa who will not be subject in the same way to those restrictions."" The London-based bank is concerned by that the new measures will hit its staff located outside the European Union as the policy will also apply to operations of EU-based banks in Asia and the U.S. This week the bank reported a pre-tax profit of almost $7 billion for 2012. In a statement made by the bank's chief executive, Peter Sands, he said the new regulations could hamper Standard Chartered's attempts to attract top talent. Meddings echoed Sands' comments by adding that lawmakers must ""make sure that regulation doesn't impede economic growth."" In an interview with Quest last week, European Member of Parliament Phillipe Lamberts said he would not be ""overly concerned"" if banker flight rids the European financial sector of excessive risk and circumvention of banking regulation.

"Washington (CNN) -- A high-profile appeal for help from the public to solve three child pornography cases has led to the arrest of two suspects, Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced Friday. ICE said it took Lance Robert Fries, 43, into custody Friday afternoon at his attorney's office in Tucson. He faces potential federal charges of production of child pornography and is expected to make his initial appearance in federal court Monday, ICE said. Thursday night, Letha Mae Montemayor, 52, was arrested outside a Los Angeles apartment building after law enforcement officials received multiple tips and located her, authorities said Friday. She is charged with one count of production of child pornography and one count of conspiracy to produce child pornography. The two arrests came after ICE asked for the public's help in identifying four suspects in three unsolved child pornography cases. Montemayor, previously known as ""Jane Doe,"" was allegedly involved in one of the cases along with an unidentified man. 245 arrested in U.S.-led child sex abuse operation . Fries, called ""John Doe"" until he was identified, was allegedly involved in a second case, ICE spokeswoman Gillian Christensen said. The suspect in the third case is still unidentified, she said. According to ICE, Montemayor was identified as a suspect through the tattoos and her facial appearance and was arrested less than 10 hours after the appeal for tips. Montemayor is expected to have an initial court appearance Monday. CNN was unable to learn whether she has a lawyer. ""This arrest would not have happened without the public's help, and it demonstrates how much individual citizens can do to help law enforcement attack crime,"" ICE Director John Morton said in a statement issued Friday. Her case involves the alleged sexual molestation of an unidentified girl. Investigators believe the abuse took place about 11 years ago when the girl was around 13 years old, but the pornographic images were widely circulated. ICE posted pictures on its website of an unidentified woman and man suspected of abusing the girl. The woman had very distinctive tattoos visible in the pictures. A criminal complaint alleged the woman is seen in about five images sexually abusing the girl. So far, law enforcement officials have not learned the name or location of the man suspected in the Jane Doe abuse case, and they are still seeking the public's help in finding him. The girl whom the pair allegedly abused also has not been identified. ICE officials said they believe she is now an adult. Nationwide child porn investigation leads to couple's arrest in Oregon . Morton made the appeal for identifying the suspects at a news conference Thursday in Washington, when he announced the results of Operation Sunflower. It is an international operation aimed at child pornography and sexual abuse in which 245 suspects were arrested and 123 victims of child exploitation were identified. Late Thursday night, special agents received a call to the ICE tip line regarding John Doe's possible identity. That case involved the sexual exploitation of a prepubescent boy by an adult male. Investigators were able to identify the victim and confirm that the boy is now safe. In order to protect the victim's privacy, ICE said it would release no details about his identity or relationship to the suspect. The pornographic images involving the girl were first discovered by ICE Homeland Security Investigations agents in Chicago in 2007. The pictures were submitted to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's Child Victim Identification Program. ICE determined the images were not related to any known case and the victim hadn't been identified. Through forensic analysis, agents determined the images were taken in the Los Angeles area. A 2001 wall calendar was visible in some pictures, helping officials determine the abuse happened 11 years ago. In the John Doe case, HSI special agents first discovered the images in Portland, Oregon, in 2006. The material was submitted to the Child Victim Identification Program, which determined the victim had not yet been identified and was not linked with other known child pornography images. ""This is truly a remarkable turn of events and it again demonstrates the collective power that can be brought to bear when law enforcement and the public team up to combat the sexual exploitation of children,"" Morton said. ""Those who produce and trade child pornography over the Internet believe they're protected by the anonymity of cyberspace. Through our collective efforts, we're proving these predators wrong and gaining justice for their innocent victims."" 18 rescued in child pornography raids, feds say .

It quoted a spokesman for the republic's emergencies service. RIA Novosti said preliminary information indicated the fire was caused by a short circuit. Plastic trimming on the exterior was destroyed. The building's interior was untouched, according to the news agency. Wednesday, officials told CNN that no one was living at the building at the time of the fire. It was not clear whether those evacuated were workers or others temporarily in the building. Most of the floors of the building -- the largest in Chechnya, and built just a few years ago, according to RIA Novosti -- were on fire, a police source told the news agency. More than 100 firefighters battled the blaze.","NEW: Apartment fire put out in Chechen capital .

"Washington (CNN) -- With South Dakota Democrat Tim Johnson's announcement this week that he will not seek re-election this year, the recent string of Senate retirements has the political class debating whether Republicans have a real shot at taking control of the upper chamber. But this biennial parlor game overlooks a stunning dynamic that has been developing on Capitol Hill over the past decade: massive turnover. Think back to late 2004, when a young hotshot from Illinois had just been elected to the Senate. National TV appearances led to obvious questions about his future political plans, but the senator-elect joked that he would finish out a full term, considering he was entering the upper chamber as its 99th-ranking member. Consider this: . â€¢ If Barack Obama had stayed in the Senate, he would be ranked 46th today. Given all the retirements that have been announced for the 2014 election cycle, he'd be ranked at least as high as 39th -- and maybe higher -- in early 2015. In other words, he would have taken a giant leap in seniority had he waited until 2016 to run for president. â€¢ Only 32 current senators were in office in 2001 for the September 11 attacks. That number will shrink to 28 -- perhaps even lower -- when the next Congress convenes in early 2015. â€¢ Since the Republicans last had the Senate majority headed into the 2006 midterm elections, 54 new senators have joined the chamber. (Fifteen new members have been sworn in since last fall's election; 14 new members joined after the 2010 election and another 15 after the 2008 election. There were 12 new senators as of the 2006 elections -- and 11 of those remain. Virginia Democrat Jim Webb served just one term and was succeeded by Democrat Tim Kaine.) A few lions of the Senate remain, like Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy. The Senate's most-senior member has served 38 years. But so many of his contemporaries have left the building. This year, West Virginia Democrat John Rockefeller, New Jersey Democrat Frank Lautenberg and Iowa Democrat Tom Harkin decided to call it quits after 30 years each. Michigan Democrat Carl Levin, who is also not seeking re-election next year, will have 36 years of Senate service to his name when his successor takes office in early 2015. Senate passes its first budget proposal in four years . Last cycle, it was North Dakota's Kent Conrad (D), Indiana's Richard Lugar (R), New Mexico's Jeff Bingaman (D) and Wisconsin's Herb Kohl (D), among many more. In recent years, the Senate has lost Edward Kennedy, Robert Byrd, Daniel Inouye and Craig Thomas to death in office. Other long-time senators like Joe Biden and John Kerry have moved to the executive branch. Consequently, a much different Senate is emerging. The first Japanese-American woman, Mazie Hirono, and the first openly gay woman, Tammy Baldwin, joined the Senate this year. The country's most exclusive club boasts a record number of women, 20; a Cuban-American Republican and an African-American Republican both in their 40s; and a growing number of senators with young children (and who still are many years away from grandchildren). Another case in point: If a Democrat succeeds Lautenberg in deep-blue New Jersey, it could be Newark Mayor Cory Booker, who is running for the open seat. Lautenberg at 89 years old is more than twice the age of Booker, who is 43. And on the other side of the aisle, aggressive conservatives are shaking things up, too. Already running for Johnson's seat in South Dakota is 58-year-old Republican Gov. Mike Rounds. But the Senate Conservatives Fund blasted Rounds on Tuesday for not being conservative enough. Republican campaign sources say the group has met with Republican Rep. Kristi Noem to recruit her into the race instead. Noem, a 41-year-old mother of three, is quietly considering the race. Of course, Democrats have their own younger options, like former Rep. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin, 42; or Johnson's son, U.S. attorney Brendan Johnson, 38. Even though party leaders on both sides of the aisle like to keep retirements each cycle to a minimum, Democratic operatives say they're not disappointed in the predicament this year, because those with access to early polling data in states like West Virginia and South Dakota say some of the younger, newer faces in those states are polling better against potential Republican opponents than the veteran senators did. Senate Historian Donald Ritchie says that overall, the trend is a cyclical one, but he acknowledges that the current dynamic stands out. ""We have 45 senators serving in their first six-year term,"" he said. ""It's quite remarkable. It's the largest turnover we've had since the late 1970s."" Ritchie remembers a long list of retirements in 1976 and 1978, followed by a rout of veteran senators in 1980. ""This is a very personality-driven institution,"" he said. ""When you change some of these larger-than-life personalities, it really changes the place."" Ritchie expects that some of the newer members will become veteran, seasoned members in time for a new generation, but he conceded that the brain drain in the upper chamber does infringe on some of the important expertise. Indeed, according to a handful of experienced Washingtonians who have worked in and around the Senate, the heavy turnover cuts both ways. Leadership aides close to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell say that he and some of his staff believe there's more energy in the upper chamber now and more of a willingness to fight for causes. Despite some of the nostalgia surrounding some of the old bulls who were more comfortable compromising and cutting deals, they believe the GOP conference is working harder than ever. Democratic Senate aides say a positive outcome of the Senate's changing face is that Americans may now find them more relatable. And it makes the tough task of recruiting new candidates easier with a diverse caucus because more potential recruits can actually see themselves in the Senate. Bob Stevenson, a Republican, and Jim Manley, a Democrat, were longtime and highly influential staffers within the Senate leadership. Warner joins fellow senators supporting same-sex marriage . Both harbor typical complaints about the opposing party, but they both long for the days of compromise, when some of the younger, newer members respected their elders. ""Making the Senate work requires cooperation and compromise,"" Stevenson said. ""Deal-making and compromise have never been 'easy,' but the leaders forced it on the rank-and-file. Not as much today."" Stevenson, who advised former Republican majority leader Bill Frist, continued, ""Sharp division in the country and 'compromise equals weakness' is reflected in the younger members. Great political strategy but not conducive to governing."" Manley advised the first Democratic majority leader after Frist, Harry Reid. Now outside the Senate, he complained about some of the same things: that the massive turnover also means a loss of institutional knowledge. ""There's no one to negotiate with in the House with a Republican caucus full of tea party types,"" he said. ""After 21 years in the Senate, I've come reluctantly to the conclusion that the process on Capitol Hill is broken."" Manley continued, ""Times have changed, and the Senate's changed. It's the influx of new members from the House that brought all the bad habits they developed in the House."" And citing Texas Republican Ted Cruz, he said, ""This is a potent group of freshmen who have no respect for the Senate as an institution, who would rather burn the place down so they can remake it again.""","With departures of long-serving members, a new Senate is emerging .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- For me, the issue of skyrocketing gasoline prices came into focus about four years ago, when the national average that Americans paid at the pump reached an all-time high of $4.11 a gallon. Today, the average -- up 30 cents in the last four weeks, and 13 cents in the last week alone -- is about $3.70. In the summer of 2008, I pulled up next to a gas pump off a major highway in Southern California where -- apparently, a few minutes earlier --  a recreational vehicle, which held more than 100 gallons, had stopped to fill up. The price was still on the screen: $500. Can you imagine paying $500 to put gas in your vehicle? For many of us, that's more like a monthly car payment. But for those who live in Southern California -- where the car is king, public transit is spotty and the carpool lane is almost always underused -- even a tab that size hardly raises an eyebrow. At the gas station closest to my home in San Diego, a gallon of gas is going for about $3.49, and a full tank costs me about $65. I shell that out three or four times a month. Prices are sky high in Los Angeles. With the average price here expected to reach as much as $5 a gallon by Memorial Day, it's not surprising to see more commuters jammed onto trains and hear that more of your friends are trying to work from home a few days a week. Although my friends on the East Coast like to think they have it easier with more options for public transportation, it's a mistake for people to assume that higher gas prices don't affect them. It's not about geography. We're all in this together. Have you noticed the price of groceries lately, as those companies that operate delivery trucks have to spend more to stack food on supermarket shelves? So you don't own a car. Maybe you take the subway to work. Swell. But if you have a mouth, and occasionally like to fill it with food, high gas prices should be hard to swallow. Meanwhile, political leaders -- in both parties -- need to fill up on courage and common sense in order to work on a solution. President Obama was right to say recently that there is little a chief executive can do about gas prices. That said, presidential candidates should stop promising otherwise. At the moment, our politicians seem to be running low on ideas and yet overflowing with an eagerness to exploit the uptick in prices for their own political benefit. Newt Gingrich is promising lower prices. He also pledges that, if elected president, he won't bow before a Saudi king. So what? What does that have to do with anything, beyond political rhetoric? At  the moment, our main concern -- and certainly that of our one true friend and ally in the Middle East, Israel -- isn't Saudi Arabia but Iran. As part of a small group of Latino journalists who visited Israel last month, I was reminded by Israeli officials in one briefing after another that -- were Iran to build a nuclear weapon -- the entire world would change. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad could block the Strait of Hormuz and the rest of the world would be too frightened to do anything about it. That's what we should be worried about, not whether U.S. presidents bow before the Saudis. It also wouldn't hurt to pay more attention to oil reserves in this hemisphere. Mexico is a major producer, and a friend and ally. The relationship between the United States and Mexico isn't perfect; tensions recur over immigration, drugs and trade. Each country has an annoying habit of blaming the other for its problems. But it's a strong marriage that will endure. Instead of chanting ""Drill, baby, drill,"" more of our leaders should be saying: ""Hola amigo."" The U.S. government should increase oil imports from Mexico. Not only is it better to deal with friends than adversaries, it's also a good way to help the Mexican government fund its war against the drug cartels -- a battle that is, let's not forget, fueled by another one of our addictions. Granted, in order for the United States to increase oil imports from Mexico, our neighbor may have to increase production. That's a slippery situation. Mexico nationalized the oil industry in the 20th century and foreign companies are prohibited from drilling. But that resistance seems to be weakening. Mexico's national oil company has allowed some private contracts and says its mature fields, which produce just 12,000 barrels of oil per day, could produce up to 220 million barrels of oil. We can have that conversation. And let's face it, the United States would rather work through that issue than work with countries that are hostile to Americans. Look at the polls, and you'll see that one of the major reasons everyday Americans think we need to become more energy self-sufficient and develop a better strategy for importing oil is that they're leery of becoming too dependent on countries in the Middle East that are often unwelcoming, undemocratic and unstable. After all, no matter how much we love our cars and need our gasoline, few things are scarier than breaking down in a bad neighborhood. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Californians are fatalistic about high gas prices, and remember 2008 .
Even if you take the bus, he says, high gas prices affect the cost of food, other goods .
Navarrette says presidential candidates' promises of lower gas prices are empty rhetoric .

"(CNN) -- They came from all over, police say, and at least one carried condoms in his pocket. A middle school teacher, a tourist visiting from Turkey, college students, a businessman from North Carolina. All of them were arrested in a week-long law enforcement operation, which ended Monday, that targeted men seeking sex with children. About 16 Florida law enforcement agencies came together to create the ruse that the suspects were chatting online with children or parents offering up their kids for sex. The men drove down to a pristine home in the city of Oviedo, about 19 miles from Orlando. Footage released by authorities captured their surprise as their illicit date turned into a rough tackle by a posse of officers. The black and white footage shows officers slamming the men against the wall of the home before cuffing them. At least one man led police on a brief footchase in the front yard before they took him down. One of the men, authorities said, was a Florida high school English teacher who arrived at the decoy home with condoms in his pocket planning to have sex with a 14-year-old girl. Before coming to the home, he sent photos of himself to the undercover officer, Florida detectives said. ""He said he had a lot to lose,"" Seminole County Maj. Dennis Lemma told reporters. A middle school science teacher arrived, planning to have sex with a 14-year-old boy, authorities said. Another man arrested was an elementary school interpreter for deaf children, investigators said, who had posted an online advertisement for a 13-year-old boy. A school janitor also turned up, police said. In all, 50 suspects where arrested. They ranged in ages of 19 to 60. 245 arrested in U.S.-led child sex abuse operation . 2 arrested in child porn cases after request for public's help .","Police: The men thought they were chatting with children .

"(CNN) -- On the London Underground there is a saying which has become synonymous with any tourist visit to the British capital. ""Mind the Gap"". It's up there with the Queen, a wonderfully indulgent cream tea, Beefeaters outside the Tower of London and all those quintessentially English pastimes which tend to draw those flocking from overseas. It is a saying which has been emblazoned across numerous t-shirts and posters, while children on the underground seem to delight in repeating the famous phrase. But now, in London at least, those three words have been hijacked by the supporters of Tottenham and Arsenal, who will now no doubt continue to mock each other until the end of the season. Following Tottenham's 2-1 win over its city rival Sunday, the ""gap"" is seven points with Andre Villas-Boas' side now occupying third place and more importantly, a qualification spot for next year's Champions League. But Arsenal has been here before. Last season, Tottenham blew a 10-point advantage to allow its fiercest foe to take third spot and a place in Europe's elite competition. Before Arsenal's astonishing comeback, which followed the 5-2 thrashing of Tottenham just over a year ago, it was those dressed in the blue and white which sang merrily about minding the gap. It was a song they would come to regret as Arsenal grew in strength while Spurs faltered, eventually leading to Harry Redknapp's exit and the failure to reach the promised land of the Champions League. But a year in football is a long time -- just ask Villas-Boas. A year ago Monday, the man known as ""AVB"" was sent packing from Chelsea with his reputation in ruin. Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich had paid $20 million to take the young Portuguese coach from Porto to Stamford Bridge less than 10 months earlier. But his spell in charge proved a disaster, leaving the club on the brink of exit from the Champions League, out of the Premier League title race and facing humiliation. Vilified for his team selections, his unorthodox style of crouching on the touchline and man-management skills, he was seen as ""Mourinho-lite"" and simply not in the same class as the ""Special One."" Villas-Boas confirmed as new Tottenham boss . But a year on since leaving west London, Villas-Boas is steadily building a team bursting with potential, led by the ever improving Gareth Bale. It was Bale, of course, who proved the man for the occasion, firing Tottenham ahead eight minutes before the break with a coolly taken finish -- his 20th of the season. With nine goals in his past seven club games, Bale continues to astound, rightly or wrongly allowing comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo and Leo Messi to gather pace. While his imperious run of form has been a joy for Tottenham supporters, it is also the new found steel which has been lacking in the past, which has made this side a far more accomplished proposition. AVB: Bayern is the perfect club for Guardiola . Once Aaron Lennon had added a second less than two minutes after Bale's opener, Arsenal was facing an uphill struggle. Suddenly that gap was increasing and Arsenal's apathetic attitude to defending gave little to suggest that anything but a widening chasm between the two clubs. Now unbeaten in 12 league games, Tottenham deserves to be taken seriously. ""Forever in our shadow"" was what Arsenal fans used to chant at their rivals -- and with justification following its domination of north London since Wenger's arrival. In fact, not since 1995 has Tottenham finished above Arsenal in England's top division, a statistic which will surely be consigned to history at the end of the current campaign. Yes, Arsenal did find a route back into the game after the interval when Bale inadvertently directed Per Mertesacker's header into his own net. Bale steals limelight . But Tottenham, marshaled by Michael Dawson and Jan Vertonghen, held out comfortably to claim a crucial victory in their quest for the Champions League and the domination of north London. ""It was very, very important for what it means, but obviously nothing is finished yet,"" Villas-Boas told Sky Sports. ""We have to believe that we still have to fight hard. Arsenal have to play Man City, we have to play Liverpool (next weekend). ""We try to profit from another important fixture and keep doing our job. It is important we gather as many points as we can to finish where we want to be. ""Last year, by this time, Arsenal made the difference of seven points to Tottenham and we know how it finished,"" Villas-Boas added. ""Motivations are now different. We are extremely confident. They are on a low at the moment. We have to continue to do our job."" Pressure grows on Wenger . For Arsenal and its beleaguered manager Arsene Wenger, the gap shows no sign of narrowing any time soon. For 16 years it has been the ruler of its own backyard, but the neighbor is beginning to stir. Without a trophy in eight years, on the brink of an exit from the Champions League, the Frenchman is facing the most difficult spell since he arrived at the club in October 1996. But Wenger refutes any suggestion that Tottenham has overtaken his side in terms of quality. ""That's not the impression I got from the game today,"" he told Sky Sports News. ""We were not efficient in those decisive zones, not at the back or up front. ""We were not cautious enough. On the two goals we played offside in a position where we shouldn't play offside. ""It is difficult to struggle with defeat because of the effort we put in and the energy level we put in over the 90 minutes was tremendous. ""We made it difficult for ourselves. We came back and dominated the game but the game was stop and go. ""It was difficult to get a flow in the final 20 minutes, we didn't find the second goal."" United march on . But as fans got back onto the London Underground this evening following the contest, the question marks over Wenger's future remain. Monday will mark his 6000th day in charge and while supporters may be losing faith, Wenger is adamant Arsenal can still qualify for next season's Champions League . He added: ""It's very frustrating, but we have to put the energy in every game like we did today and keep going, you never know. ""It would be absolutely terrible not to fight like mad because there are a lot of positives in the game. ""What happened today we have seen repeated so many times in big games that of course it's difficult."" Lazio punished for fourth racism . In Italy, Rodrigo Palacio spared Inter Milan any embarrassment with a late cameo performance to steal a 3-2 win at Catania. Trailing 2-0 at the break thanks to strikes from Gonzalo Bergessio and Giovanni Marchese, Inter fought back in the second half to turn the game on its head. Ricky Alvarez halved the deficit before Palacio fired home an equalizer with 20 minutes remaining. And with the contest entering the second minute of stoppage time, Palacio found space to drill home a dramatic winner. ""We had a terrible 20 minute period and were punished for our mistake on the first goal,"" coach Andrea Stramaccioni told Sky Italia. ""Luckily this team has thick skin and managed to fight their way back into the game. ""It's an important victory for us against a team which is in great form. Thankfully the real Inter emerged after the interval."" English managers on the brink? Elsewhere, Fiorentina gained a 2-1 win over Chievo, Bolgona defeated Cagliari 3-0 and Emanuel Icardi's 58th minute effort secured all three points for Sampdoria against Parma. Atalanta recorded a 2-0 win at Siena courtesy of Giacomo Bonaventura's double, while Torino and Palermo's game ended goalless. In the late game, Roma defeated Genoa 3-1 with Francesco Totti on target. Lewandowski brace earns Dortmund points . In Germany, Bayern Munich maintained its 17 point lead at the top of the Bundesliga following a 1-0 win over Hoffenheim. Mario Gomez's strike gave Bayern its 10th straight win, despite being given a difficult afternoon by the relegation threatened side. ""The game was very difficult because of the opponent's league predicament,"" coach Jupp Heynckes told reporters. ""We had to work hard for the win, it wasn't brilliant or glamorous, but in return for 90 minutes work, we got three points. ""We were a bit superficial; we weren't direct enough and not lively enough. It took a while to warm up the engine."" Meanwhile, Bayern has been drawn at home to face Wolfsburg in the German Cup semifinal, while Freiburg will travel to Stuttgart in the other fixture. In France, Lyon was held to a 1-1 draw at Brest, while Marseille reclaimed third place in Ligue 1 after coming from behind to defeat Troyes 2-1. Lille saw off Bordeaux 2-1 in the day's late game thanks to goals from Ronny Rodelin and Salomon Kalou. In Spain, Atletico Madrid was held to a goalless draw at Malaga as it missed out on the chance to close the gap on leader Barcelona. Granada suffered a 2-1 home defeat by Mallorca, Espanyol drew 0-0 with Valladolid and Real Sociedad shared a six-goal thriller with Real Betis as it ended 3-3.","Tottenham wins derby match against Arsenal 2-1 Sunday .
