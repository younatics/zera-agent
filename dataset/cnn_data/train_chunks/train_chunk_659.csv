Distraught, she called 911 and reporting officers discovered the woman's husband, Michael Woodruff, 40, and the family's dog dead o9f gunshot wounds in separate rooms. A .40 caliber Glock handgun was found next to Mr Woodruff's body. Scroll down for video . Horror: Chrishell Woodruff, pictured right, discovered her daughter Alix Norman in a pool of blood at the family's home. Her husband, Michael Woodruff, left, was dead in another room . Brigham City Police Lieutenant Michael Nelson believes Mr Woodruff shot Alix and the dog before killing himself, though a motive for the apparent murder suicide is not yet clear. Nelson said there was no suicide note and few clues in the home. He added that Mrs Woodruff wasn't even aware her husband owned a gun. Relatives told police they didn't know of any domestic problems, though the couple had been fighting. Neighbors described the family as 'wholesome, nice people.' Tragedy: Alix, pictured, attened all her classes on Tuesday before she was shot by her step-father at home, police say . 'The wife and the husband have had some problems, but to my knowledge, there hasn't been any domestic problems at all or anything like that,' Nelsen told Fox News. He added to the Deseret News: 'The relationship between the stepfather and the daughter was doing quite well. Everybody was just in total shock.' Alix's school said the teen attended all her classes on Tuesday. According to police, the home was undergoing renovations on the ground floor and the family was living in the basement where the bodies were discovered. Neighbor Rhonda Long said her boyfriend heard popping sounds 'like from a nail gun' and the dog barking earlier in the day but he assumed Mr Woodruff was working on the house. Dog: The family's pet dog, pictured, was also found dead by bullet wound . She said the entire neighborhood was in shock after the slaying. 'I didn't expect anything like that from anybody, especially that family,' she told the Deseret News. 'They just seemed like really wholesome, nice people.' Both bodies are undergoing autopsies and toxicology screenings to determine cause of death. Nelsen said the investigation was continuing. 'They're going through with a fine-toothed comb to make sure we don't leave anything uncovered, hopefully find some answers, but some of it may be left with them, too. It's hard to say whether we'll get the whole story.'","Chrishell Woodruff returned to her Brigham City, Utah, home at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday to find her daughter, Alix Norman's lifeless body in the basement .

It's the playground favourite that most of us left behind with our school books but now it seems the humble hula hoop has become a must-have for adults on a mission to get fit. Among the stars professing their love for the hula hoop are Kelly Osbourne, Beyonce, model Kelly Brook and now TOWIE fitness queen, Lucy Mecklenburgh. And so in love with hula hooping is Mecklenburgh, she's revealed that not only has she included it in one of her new fitness videos, she's totally 'hooked' on it. Hooked: TOWIE Lucy Mecklenburgh says she's a huge fan of the fitness benefits of hula hooping . Looking good: Kelly Osbourne says hula hooping helped her get her stunning slim physique . 'I loved hula hooping as a child but I'd completely forgotten how much fun it is,' said the reality TV star told MailOnline. '""Dance hooping"" takes it to a whole new level and it works out my entire body out, strengthening my core and burning calories as well as, if not better than, any other boring exercise.' 'I’m all about hula-hooping right now!' tweeted Kelly Osbourne in May. 'Five mins in the morning, five mins at night...' According to Osbourne, the humble hula not only shaved two inches off her waistline, it helped her lose an impressive 70lb to boot. Brook, meanwhile, has frequently been pictured showing off her whittled down waist while hula hooping, while singer Grace Jones credits a hula hoop fitness regime for her fabulous figure. What's more, unlike many celebrity fitness fads, the hula hoop routine has the blessing of the professionals to boot. 'I am a major fan of anything that gets people active and moving,' says Jéan LK, founder of central London gym, Timed Fitness. 'Throw in the fun factor and hula hooping is a great addition to a fitness regime.' He added: 'A hula hoop is a great, affordable, often forgotten, piece of fitness equipment. 'It engages your core and will help tone your upper and lower abs, as well as your obliques, which will help define your waistline. You can also use the hoop to bust bingo wings and tone your inner thighs.' Masterclass: Kelly Brook demonstrates her hula hoop spinning skills during an event this summer . And Jéan isn't the only fitness expert to sing the praises of the humble hula. According to the American Council on Exercise you can burn 210 calories per 30 minute session. Hula hooping website, Hooping.org, adds: 'The test subjects in that study were new hoopers and the better you get and the more 'active' you become while hooping will increase your caloric burn. 'You can burn more calories by increasing the intensity, focus on hold your core firm, and back straight to tone your stomach and improve your core stability,' adds Jéan. 'Many people forget that hula hoop can help with more than your waistline. Go for a full body work out by trying different moves like the orbit and bump.' Mecklenburgh, whose fabulously toned bikini body generated thousands of envious headlines over the summer, added: 'I'm hooked!' And with results like those, it's not hard to see why. Still trying to pull of the same hula moves you employed in the playground? As fitness expert Jéan LK explains, you need to up your game to get the full benefits. Here's how to do it: . UP YOUR SPEED . 'Try doing it at higher intensity as you get better at it,' he says. 'Go as fast as you can for 30 seconds the normal pace for 30.' DROP A (HOOP) SIZE . 'Get a child sized hoop,' suggests Jéan. 'The smaller the hoop, the harder you have to work to keep the momentum going.' ADD WEIGHTS TO YOUR HOOP . 'Weighted hoops will make it even more of a workout,' explains Jéan. DON'T JUST HOOP - EAT WELL TOO . 'Nutrition is a major factor when it comes to any type of exercise,' reveals Jéan, 'so stay on top of yours.' MIX IT UP . 'Be creative with your routine,' says Jéan. 'Try different stances to engage different muscles.' He suggests starting with your feet wide apart with your toes pointed outwards, then changing to feet shoulder width apart and ending with your feet together. For those who want a tougher workout, Jéan suggests mixing a core routine with hula. 'Do 30 second hula and then get straight down to do 30 second side plank, full plank or crunches,' he advises.","Hula fitness fans include Kelly Osbourne, Michelle Obama and Beyonce .

Spain has pledged a repeat of its disgraceful block of Gibraltar and insisted it will continue to stop-check vehicles despite William Hague's intervention. The Foreign Secretary phoned his Spanish counterpart after Civil Guards caused eight-hour traffic jams by stopping every car and motorbike trying to leave the British territory. But his call for a speedy resolution to the border problems fell on deaf ears as Madrid bragged it would continue with its controversial policy. Civil Guards caused eight-hour traffic jams by stopping every car and motorbike trying to leave the British territory . Spanish Foreign Secretary Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo allowed diplomats to brief journalists they would continue to carry out 'exhaustive checks' whenever they deemed it necessary. Slapping Hague down less than 24 hours after their phone call, he claimed Spain was obliged to uphold the law. One Spanish Foreign Office official, sticking to the country's familiar strategy of making the Rock out to be a criminal haven, said: 'Spain has the obligation to make sure EU laws on the movement of people and tax are upheld to try to prevent things like tax evasion and to fight against smuggling.' The comments signalled Spain's determination to bolster their bid to make life uncomfortable for local Gibraltarians and the hundreds of British day-trippers who cross the border every day, even if their own people are caught up in the chaos. Spanish police stopped every one of 10,000 vehicles leaving Gibraltar. William Hague spoke to his Spanish counterpart yesterday . Officers from the Royal Gibraltar Police were forced to impose diversions and create beachside holding areas as Spanish authorities 'choked' the border, causing massive tailbacks in 30C heat . Civil Guards stopped every one of 10,000 vehicles leaving Gibraltar for Spain last Friday after Spanish fishermen sparked a standoff with the Royal Navy as they tried to disrupt the creation of an artificial reef in the Bay of Gibraltar. They caused one of the worst traffic jams in the Rock's history. Officers from the Royal Gibraltar Police were forced to impose diversions and create beachside holding areas in 30C heat. Foreign Secretary William Hague phoned his Spanish counterpart to discuss the issues with the British territory . The local health authority provided people with thousands of bottles of water as they wilted in the high temperatures. Gibraltar's Government later accused Spain of 'torture.' On Sunday, after creating two days of queues for people trying to get out of Spain, Civil Guards switched tactics and targeted vehicles going the other way. A Gibraltar-based librarian cycling into Spain was arrested for alleged assault on police in a detention condemned by the Rock's Chief Minister as brutal and barbaric. Tensions between Spain and Britain over Gibraltar have increased since PM Mariano Rajoy's right-wing government took power in November 2011. Spanish fishermen say the artificial reef they are fighting against, will affect their catches. In November last year the Royal Navy's HMS Scimitar was scrambled to intercept a Spanish warship called Vencedora when it entered Britain's territorial waters. Gibraltar-based delivery driver Dale Cherry, 32, was shot at by police last month as he took a friend out on a jet-ski. Civil Guard officers later claimed they were pursuing cigarette smugglers and insisted no shots were fired.","Civil Guards caused eight-hour traffic jams by stopping every car .

The son of a former congressional candidate has miraculously survived after a grizzly bear he shot during a hunt in Alaska hid in bushes for 90 minutes before seeking revenge and attacking him. John O. Matson Jr., from Charlestown, Rhode Island, was listed in fair condition at an Anchorage hospital on Wednesday after suffering head and leg injuries and undergoing head surgery. The 46-year-old hunter was attacked by the bear on Monday during a guided hunt near Beaver Mountain, about 40 miles southwest of the interior town of McGrath. Attack: John Matson, 46, was attacked by a grizzly bear in Alaska, 90 minutes after he shot it (file picture) He is the son of John 'The Carpenter' Matson, Sr., who ran in the 2nd congressional district of Rhode Island for the House of Representatives last year - but missed out to incumbent Jim Langevin. He told the Associated Press on Wednesday that his son - one of his four children - was lucky to be alive and is now recovering from his surgery. Matson Jr was with another hunter and an assistant . guide near Beaver Mountain when they saw the bear feeding on berries about a mile away and moved toward . it. Matson fired and hit the bear, which then rolled into . bushes. It thrashed around for about a minute before it bolted out and ran into heavier brush, state troopers told the Anchorage Daily News. The men waited for around 90 minutes before approaching the bush but Matson was attacked. Family: He is believed to be the son of John O. Matson Sr, pictured, who ran for the House of Representatives . Scene: Matson was on a hunting trip with two others near Beaver mountain, pictured, when he was attacked and due to inclement weather, rescue crews could not reach him for a day . The assistant guide was around 30 feet away when he heard Matson scream and fire his gun. He and the other hunter fired . shots to distract the bear and it ran off and has not since been found. Matson was bleeding profusely from his head, but the assistant guide wrapped clothing around the wounds and called for help. But bad weather prevented rescuers from quickly reaching Matson's party. He was eventually rescued from the remote spot on Tuesday, suffering from bite marks on his head and leg. The aircraft flew Matson to McGrath and a LifeMed Alaska flight transported him 225 miles southeast to an Anchorage hospital, where he remains.","John Matson Jr. suffered head and leg bites after he approached the bear 90 minutes after he hit it - and the bear fought back .

A man has caused outrage after finding the world's oldest message in a bottle - and refusing to open it. Worn and battered, but still sealed, the elusive note has finally reached a reader - 1,115 miles and one century later. The green glass artefact was spotted sitting on the shore of the secluded Schooner's Cove in Tofino, Canada. The envelope, visible through the bottle, shows Earl Willard's address and where the letter was sent from . Strolling along the recently excavated beach on Monday morning, Steve Thurber noticed the bottle lying in the middle of an open stretch of sand. The note inside is signed by Earl Willard, who was 76 hours into a boat trip from San Francisco to Bellingham, Washington, when he 'posted' his note. It was a route that would take him around 10 days to two weeks if the ship stuck to its schedule. Hailing from a day when the delivery of . cross-country letters was something of a Russian roulette, the Earl will never have known if his note arrived. But Mr Thurber has infuriated people worldwide by refusing to open the letter. Determined to preserve what has stayed intact since September 29 1906, he has decided to leave the details of the message shrouded in mystery. All that can be read through the bottle - the cap of which is rusted over - is the date it was thrown into the sea, September 29 1906 and that it is signed by Earl Willard. It lists Willard's address and states that he was a passenger on a steamer from San Francisco to Washington and that he threw the bottle into the sea 76 hours into the voyage. The 107-year-old bottle was nestled in the sand of Schooner's Cove in Tofino, Canada . Outcry: Steve Thurber has infuriated people by refusing to open the artefact as a way to preserve it . Mystery, however, surrounds what the envelope inside contains - but Mr Thurber is refusing to open the bottle. He said: 'Maybe there was only one bottle that the guy sent out and I found it. It is like a one in a billion chance.' Online comments about the bottle include many from people who have seen local news reports in Canada, with a poster called Carol writing: 'WTF was the message?' Emily wrote: 'How can he not open it?' 'I hope they open it because it was meant to be read one day,' wrote Kevin Mackie. At 107 years old - almost to the day - the bottle looks set to be named the oldest ever found. The previous Guinness World Record for a message in a bottle was 98 years after Scottish fisherman Andrew Leaper found a bottle in Shetland last year. The bottle in Scotland contained a postcard offering a reward of sixpence to the finder. Mr Thurber added: 'I guess it is a chance that you find something that somebody sent out into the water. 'A hundred years later is just unreal.'","Steve Thurber, from Courtenay, Canada, found the bottle still sealed on a beach .

Just hours after marking the disastrous conclusion of his mayoral campaign by flipping off news reporters, Anthony Weiner re-emerged in the spotlight with a smile on his face. The former candidate appeared relaxed and in good spirits when a photographer caught up with him outside his apartment building on Park Avenue in Manhattan Wednesday. The disgraced ex-congressman and sexting aficionado appeared to have rallied after his crushing defeat in the Democratic primaries, finishing his run with only 5 per cent. Scroll down for video . Winning smile: Just hours after suffering a crushing defeat in the Democratic primaries, Anthony Weiner emerged from his apartment with a grin on his face and looking relaxed . Casual: Dressed in a white checkered button-down shirt and dark jeans, Mr Weiner appeared relaxed and in good spirits outside his home . Sporting a casual white checkered button-down shirt and dark jeans, Mr Weiner grinned and appeared animated while being photographed outside his home. On Wednesday, there was also a sighting of Mr Weiner's better half, Huma Abedin, who chose to skip his concession party the night before in favor of a Hamptons getaway – and in the process avoided running into her husband’s sexting partner. The mayoral candidate's wife emerged from the couple's tony apartment building this morning dressed to impress in a mint-green dress with a Louis Vuitton bag on her shoulder, and attempted to hail a cab, the New York Daily News reported. Miss Abedin largely disappeared from the public eye following revelations that her husband had continue exchanging X-rated messages with Sidney Leathers long after his resignation from the U.S. Congress. Another long-suffering spouse who was back in the spotlight one day after her husband's defeat was Silda Spitzer, who was photographed walking out of her Manhattan penthouse with a walking cast on her right leg. Now that her estranged husband's campaign for the office of comptroller is over, Mrs Spitzer allegedly plans to begin divorce proceedings, according to the New York Post. On Wednesday, she was depicted carrying an envelope under her arm bearing her husband's name. Poor showing: Weiner finished his race with only 5 per cent of the vote, knocking him out of contention for the mayor of New York City . What's next? With his reputation thoroughly tarnished by a sexting scandal, it remains to be seen if Mr Weiner would run for public office in the future . She's back: Huma Abedin, pictured here on August 27, emerged from the couple's apartment building this morning in a mint-green dress with a Louis Vuitton bag on her shoulder . Tuesday was a bad night for philandering New York City politicians, with both Mr Weiner and Mr Spitzer suffering loses in their respective primary races. Weiner concluded his race by showing the middle finger to the reporters who covered his scandal-ridden campaign. His wife Huma Abedin was not looking on as he gave his concession, and he didn't even thank his long-plagued wife in his remarks. Abedin was said to be hundreds of miles away in the Hamptons on Tuesday night but spotted coming out of the couple's Manhattan apartment Wednesday morning. Rather than bowing out gracefully, Weiner decided to throw one final insult at the voters by flipping his middle finger at the crowd as he drove off as captured by NY1 photographers. Instead of having his wife at the midtown bar where he and his supporters gathered Tuesday night, a different woman was attracting attention: Sydney Leathers, the woman with whom he had a sexting relationship, crashed his party. The mood was notably happier in Brooklyn where former public advocate Bill de Blasio celebrated his victory alongside his family, with the whole crew dancing next to one another in front of a cheering crowd.

'Sadly we did not win this time, but I . could not be more proud of the campaign that we ran,' Weiner said to . the crowd inside Connolly's Irish Pub just before 11 p.m., accepting his . defeat with just 5 percent of the vote. 'I . could not be more proud of you.' He went on: 'We had the best ideas. Sadly, I was an imperfect messenger.' Leathers was seen wandering around the pub- clearly as an uninvited  guest- giving statements to reporters . and showing off her widely publicized plastic surgeries including a breast augmentation and a nose job. Her presence delayed the evening's festivities as it took Weiner half an hour to avoid a confrontation and run through a nearby fast food restaurant. After stepping down from Congress in 2011 following his first sexting scandal, Weiner was . hoping that his campaign for mayor would be his chance to reenter public . office and clear his name.

Spitzer - who like Weiner, is married - was forced to resign five years ago after he admitted to hiring prostitutes. His wife Silda Spitzer was not at the Tuesday night event and never made any campaign appearances during his nine-week bid for comptroller. 'All along we knew it was going to be a close race,' Spitzer campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith told MailOnline at his party Tuesday night. 'Yes people know Eliot and he has name recognition but Scott Stringer has the entire political establishment behind him- every union, every business.' Striking a clear contrast to his failed colleagues, Bill de Blasio danced and blew simultaneous kisses to the crowd with his wife and two children at their victory party in Gowanus, Brooklyn. De Blasio won 40.2 per cent of the Democratic vote, and while there is a chance of a run off between him and the second place candidate, Bill Thompson, that seems unlikely. 'You made this campaign a cause, and I say thank you for elevating it to that level,' the former public advocate said to his supporters.

Happy: De Blasio's family was a much of his campaign as he was, with son Dante and daughter Chiara joining him on stage Tuesday night at their victory party . De Blasio's interracial family was displayed prominently throughout the campaign as he featured his son Dante and his large afro in a number of television ads while his daughter Chiara frequently spoke on her father's behalf at events, including the victory party last night. 'Some of you may already be familiar with my brother Dante. My brother, my little brother, may look good on TV – but there's only one de Blasio who got to vote for her dad today,' she said, referring to a clip of her condemning current mayor Michael Bloomberg's comments about de Blasio using his family as a part of the campaign. While many have pegged De Blasio as the 'populist' candidate who will be facing Republican Joe Lhota in November, Dante is undoubtedly the fan-favorite as he had a round of cheers all his own at the Brooklyn party. 'In her enthusiasm Chiara just attempted to touch the hair. Security was ready to intervene,' Mr De Blasio joked.","Anthony Weiner lost the mayor's race and didn't thank his wife Huma in his concession speech Tuesday night .

Bulgaria is closing its investigation into one of the most notorious Cold War assassinations - the killing of exiled dissident Georgy Markov with the poisoned tip of an umbrella on London's Waterloo Bridge. Markov, a writer, journalist and opponent of Bulgaria's then communist regime, died on September 11, 1978 after a stranger shot a poisoned pellet into his leg. Prosecutors have failed to identify, arrest or charge anybody for the crime, known as the 'Bulgarian umbrella', and so they announced today that the case would now be closed. Unsolved murder: For 35 years mystery has surrounded the whereabouts of Georgy Markov's killer, and now Bulgaria is closing the case on the assassination of the former BBC journalist . Bulgarian defector Markov, a broadcaster for the BBC overseas Service, was murdered on Sept 11, 1978 . 'The probe will be abandoned as of tomorrow, when the absolute statute of limitations of 35 years will expire,' the prosecutors' office spokeswoman Rumiana Arnaudova said. 'To overcome the statute of limitations, we need to have a suspect for the crime arrested, charged or put on a search list. As of the moment, we have not established the perpetrator and neither of the above actions are undertaken,' Arnaudova said. British police have their own investigation of the affair. According to accounts of the incident, Markov, who defected to the West in 1969, was waiting for a bus when he felt a sharp sting in his thigh. The bus stop (right) where Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov was murdered by a Ricin spiked umbrella in 1978 . A stranger fumbled behind him with an umbrella he had dropped and mumbled 'sorry' in a foreign accent before walking away, hailing a cab and disappearing. After the umbrella attack, Markov . returned to his office, but quickly fell ill and was taken to hospital . that night with a high fever. He died three days later of what is believed to be ricin poisoning, for which there is no antidote. Writer and dissident Markov had reportedly enraged the . Communist regime with broadcasts on the BBC's Bulgarian Service which . mocked dictator Todor Zhivkov. Georgi Markov was jabbed with an umbrella which fired a poison pellet into his leg as he crossed Waterloo Bridge . The home of Georgi Markov, murdered Bulgarian writer in Lynette Avenue, Clapham . Five years ago, the Bulgarian daily Dnevnik published an investigation into communist-era secret police files which identified Markov's suspected assassin as an agent code-named 'Piccadilly' . The files show how the agent had 'special training' from Bulgaria's secret police and received two medals, several free holidays and $30,000 after Markov's death, Dnevnik said, adding that Markov's case was discussed with the KGB in Moscow. In 2008, Bulgarian prosecutors extended the investigation by five years, hoping that access to communist era secret police files would help solve the case. And earlier this year, prime suspect Francesco Gullino, 66, who was known by his Communist handlers as 'Agent Piccadilly', was tracked down by a Bulgarian film-maker and interviewed. Georgi Markov, murdered Bulgarian writer, is pictured on his way to England on a train from Germany in 1971 . Georgi Markov, murdered Bulgarian writer is pictured with his wife, Annabel Markov at a Kensington Register Office in July 1975 . He lives in a rundown flat in Wels, a small Austrian town where he works as an antiques dealer. He . was named in Bulgarian files as their only agent in London when the . regime's secret services –  backed by the KGB –  had Markov . 'liquidated'. Gullino . left Britain the day after the attack and flew to Rome, where it is . alleged he stood in a particular spot in St Peter's Square in order to . send a signal to his Bulgarian handler. In March, in an interview with director Klaus Dexel,= for his documentary 'Silenced: The Writer Georgi Markov and The Umbrella Murder,' Gullino admitted . he was 'probably' in  London at the time of Markov's murder – although . he denies involvement in the plot. He . also refused to answer whether he was a spy – despite the huge evidence . in Bulgarian security archives – simply commenting that there were . 'thousands of Google searches' saying that he was one. Markov had lived . in Clapham, South London since fleeing Bulgaria in 1969. Francesco Gullino known as Agent Piccadilly was quizzed by a film-maker this year about his involvement in the assassination of Markov, which he repeatedly denied. Bulgaria said police files which led investigators to Gullino, brought no clarity over who was the killer . Asked by filmmakers if he is still in . contact with his Bulgarian contact from the 1970s, he declined to give a . straight answer, replying with a smile: 'This is an intimate question. Is it forbidden to talk to such people? Is it not good to work with . foreign countries' secret services?' Bulgarian . journalist Anthony Georgieff, who has also been on the trail of Gullino . for two decades, said: 'In reality, if the British authorities wanted . to arrest him they probably could. But there is a lot of embarrassment . surrounding this case. 'The . British allowed a defector to be murdered right under their noses and . then the killer escaped. I think that might explain  their reluctance to . vigorously pursue it.' But in spite of this new information coming to light, Bulgarian authorities say they have not reached any clarity about the identity of the killer.","Bulgarian dissident Georgy Markov died days after being jabbed with a poison-tipped umbrella as he crossed Waterloo Bridge in 1978 .

Scroll down for video... Charged: Former Precinct 4 Deputy, Jimmy Drummond, has been charged after allegedly using excessive force to arrest an entire family he claimed was speeding . The documents reveal Drummond, who has since left the force, was charged on Monday with official oppression, a misdemeanor. If found guilty, Drummond could face up to one year in jail and a fine of up to $4,000. The Scherz family are also campaigning for other deputies involved to face similar charges, according to abclocal.com. Backed by human rights lawyer Randall Kallinen, the family attended Harris County Criminal Courthouse, Houston, Texas, this week to urge the District Attorney's office to file criminal charges against all officers involved. Kallinen is quoted in abclocal.com saying: 'We're here today to make sure that the Harris County District Attorney's Office does not have any questions, does not have any more evidence that it needs.' Throwing mother? The footage first appears to show Drummond allegedly throwing Mrs Scherz across the road . The footage shows her land in the road where she remains for many minutes throughout the altercation . Now it has emerged, according to the New York Daily News, that Drummond was allegedly known for being a 'heavy handed' police officer. Mr Kallinen told the paper he had a history of excessive force, which his superiors were aware of. The incident happened in September 2011 outside the family's North Houston home, on Ridge Top Drive, after the son had pulled up and parked the car. He then appears to come running over to two other officers, directly in front of the vehicle, where they were holding Mr Scherz Jr face down on the ground . The heavy officer is then seen allegedly kicking the man on the ground five times . First the footage shows Drummond allegedly throwing Mrs Scherz across the road and onto the floor. It then shows Drummond running over to the detained driver, who is being held face-down on the ground to tow other officers, and allegedly kicking him five times. The heavy man then allegedly puts his knee on David's back who is lying face-down his hands cuffed behind his back. At one point a little white dog trots out from the family's driveway and sniffs around investigating. As it walked back towards the house, Drummond is seen allegedly kicking the dog away. Mr Scherz suffered one fractured rib and bruising and cuts on his face . A girl also runs out from the driveway and is seen slowly stepping backwards as an officer approaches her. When father David Scherz asked why Drummond was arresting his wife, the officer replied: 'Interference with an investigation,' according to abclocal.com. Mr Scherz then responds: 'Investigation of what? You are on our property, sir!' After the incident, all five members of the Scherz family were initially charged. But all charges were later dropped, according to the New York Daily News. The news service added that the family filed the complaint last month, nearly two years since the incident.","Former Deputy Jimmy Drummond was filmed by a police car's dash-cam .

"PUBLISHED: . 21:55 EST, 10 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:17 EST, 11 September 2013 . Rarely seen photographs catch the normally reserved Jackie Kennedy as she let loose while traveling abroad in 1962. Taken by her friend, photographer to the world's elite Benno Graziani, the black and white shots expose a side of the iconic first lady the public has almost never seen. Jackie et Moi collects the most riveting of the photographs Graziani took of Mrs. Kennedy while on an official White House trip to India and while vacationing in Italy. On holiday: Rarely seen photographs of Jackie Kennedy taken by Benno Graziani show a fun-loving side of the first lady . Close up: Graziani's unprecedented access to Kennedy shines through in the photos, which were taken while she vacationed in Italy in 1962, and on a White House trip to India . Graziani worked for French news and celebrity publication Paris Match in its legendary heyday. ‘Spend what you want’ and ‘live like kings,’ is what editors told Graziani and his colleagues. According to drkrm, where Graziani’s work has been displayed, that dictate came with the condition that the photographers produced high quality images. That’s just what Graziani did, and his closeness with mid-century luminaries helped boost his work. During his career, he became friends with stars like Kirk Douglas, Audrey Hepburn, Charlie Chaplin, Jane Fonda, Brigitte Bardot, and Grace Kelly. Old friends: Jackie et Moi shows the closeness shared by Kennedy and Graziani, who met while she was a reporter named Jackie Bouvier . 'Benno is a lot of fun, but he¿s always got a camera in his hand': President Kennedy worried Graziani might be a little too close to Kennedy and the public would see wine drinking, bikini-clad side of her that would hurt his reputation . Good life: Graziani worked for Paris Match, where he was urged to live the good life right along with his subjects so long as he produced excellent photographs, which he did . Repose: This photo was taken in Ravello, Italy in 1962 during a trip that Kennedy took with her sister . But his friendship with Jackie Kennedy allowed him a different sort of access, to a hybrid Hollywood celebrity and Washington star. ‘Benno is a lot of fun, but he’s always got a camera in his hand,’ the late John F. Kennedy warned Secret Service assigned to his wife during her time abroad. The president feared a backlash if the paparazzo’s photos showed the first lady having one glass of wine too many or showing too much skin while in Europe. Biggest star: Graziani was friends with other luminaries of the 50s, 60s, and 70s like Grace Kelly and Audrey Hepburn but his rapport with Kennedy gave him access to a even more storied world than Hollywood . Coiffed: Kennedy appears surprised as he checks out her hair in the mirror. Few photographers would be allowed to catch such a vulnerable moment . The photos are nothing if not tasteful, however. Jackie exhibits a tranquility and ease that cannot be so easily seen in photos where she wears suits and her signature pillbox hat. She is as stunning in her swimwear as she ever was in Chanel and Graziani's closeness with the mercurial first lady is evident in every photo and grants the viewer the same unprecedented access as the photographer. Kennedy and Graziani met while she was still a Bouvier. It was the 1950s and the young Jackie was a reporter for the Washington Times-Herald. ‘She began as a reporter-photographer and led a truly exceptional life, a fairy tale transformed into Greek tragedy. Today she is part of history,’ Graziani said. ‘There are people who make history, those who endure it, and there are those who tell about it. That's me.’ Jackie et 'Moi' shows September 7 through 28 at the Los Angeles exhibition space drkrm. At ease: Kennedy exhibits the same poise in Graziani's photos that can be seen in all photos of her, but with an added glint in her eyes that can't well be described . Cheese: Even buttoned up, she let loose in front of Graziani's lens and showed a rarely seen playful side . 'A lot of fun': President Kennedy is seen in the background as one of Graziani's fun moments is captured .","Benno Graziani photographed the biggest names of his day for Paris Match .

Accused: Mirella Dzioba, 33 has been arrested and placed on $10,000 bond for trying to extort $250,000 from a wealthy Detroit businessman . A former model and real estate agent is facing jail time for attempting to extort over $250,000 from a wealthy married Michigan businessman. Mirella Dzioba, 33, hatched a scheme to blackmail the 61-year-old executive after meeting him at a property sale close in July. Suggesting the pair went for drinks following the sale, Dzioba came onto the victim and flattered him on a dinner date by suggesting that she 'enjoyed strong men' and encouraged him to speak to her in a sexual manner. The man, who is named in FBI affidavits only as a 'wealthy businessman in the Detroit metropolitan area', followed the married mother-of-three's lead and 'was also encouraged by Dzioba to subsequently leave several similar voice messages'. The two agreed to a second date at which Dzioba, 'inquired about the extent of the victim's wealth' and brought him into her confidence by asking him to help her financially with a charity she was running. After this meeting, the FBI claims that the former model who is of Bosnian descent sent the victim, 'what could fairly be described as suggestive photographs'. There is no suggestion in the signed affidavit that the couple ever had entered into an intimate relationship. Extortion: Mirella Dzioba, 33, is facing extortion charges and up to five years in prison for trying to use her feminine charms to take money off the victim after recording their first meeting in a Rochester, Michigan restaurant . Following this, the victim alleges that Dzioba asked him for $1400 so that she could buy a laptop and pay for a real estate training course according to the Smoking Gun. The businessman did not reply to these text messages, which caused Dzioba to allegedly text, 'O forget it. Seriously, I'm done. Maybe I should call her.' The victim told the FBI that he took 'her' to mean his wife, who was totally unaware of their rendezvous. However, thinking that he could pay her off, the 61-year-old took $1400 to her offices at real estate agent Larry Williams Homes in August. However, on taking the cash from the man, Dzioba allegedly informed the man that she needed $250,000 or she would tell his wife. She told the victim that she had told her husband about his behavior and that he wanted her to get a lawyer involved. Text messages from her to the victim warn that 'If u think u can shut me up with $1400$ u r mistaken' (sic). 'All u got to do is pay and no one will ever know. Ever'. These are the offices of Larry Williams Homes in Rochester, Michigan where the money Dzioba allegedly attempted to extort from the victim changed hands . Realtor: Mirella Dzioba seen her in her official biography picture for Larry Williams Homes in Rochester, Michigan . It was then that she used a personal attorney to contact the victim with a tape recording of their first restaurant meeting where he spoke in a suggestive manner and the voicemail messages and threatened to contact the media too. Following this, the victim alleges that he began getting mysterious phone calls from restricted numbers to his home phone and late night phone calls which contained snippets from their first restaurant encounter. Freaked out by events spiraling out of control, the victim contacted the FBI according to the Smoking Gun. Beauty: Mirella Dzioba (left and right) worked as a model and is believed to be of Bosnian descent . Under their guidance the victim told her that he would give her only $100,000 delivered in $5,000 installments. So, last Tuesday, the 61-year-old met Dzioba in a parking lot outside her office and handed her an envelope containing $4,800 in $100 bills. She threatened him and said that 'The next five needs to be by the end of the week though.' On Monday, federal agents arrested her on extortion charges which could carry a maximum sentence of five years. According to her biography on Larry Williams Homes, Dzioba is a mother-of-three and 'loves to do volunteer work and to help others.' Additionally, she 'has done modeling in her past and is currently doing the news on the radio on weekends.'","Mirella Dzioba aka Mirella Moore is a 33-year-old married mother of three from Macomb, Michigan .

Former model and actress Miss Anthony, 49, who was once described as The Face of the Eighties, paid tribute to her 'beautiful' mother. Miss Anthony, who appeared in Woody Allen's Husbands and Wives, Auf Wiedersehen Pet and Three Up, Two Down, told the inquest: 'She was probably one of the kindest people I've ever known. 'She was so loving and so compassionate and so beautiful. 'The actor's life is a tough one and there were times when we were very, very poor and she did everything she could. 'She worked at Harrods just to give me everything she could. I'm just really proud to be her daughter.' Mrs Bennett, who used the stage name Bernadette Milnes, starred in more than 50 films and TV series between 1952 and 1990 including The Elephant Man, On The Buses, Z Cars, Steptoe and Son, The Sweeney and Hancock's Half Hour. Twice-divorced Mrs Bennett had lived in Norfolk for around ten years and was last seen by her daughter, her only child, about two weeks before she died. The inquest heard she had been smoking between about 40 and 60 cigarettes a day in the weeks leading up to her death. She was said to be careless in discarding bits of card or tapers that she used to light cigarettes, resulting in several scorch marks on both carpet and on her clothing. Her body was found in the lounge of her home shortly before 4pm on December 15 by taxi driver Gavin Dickson who had become firm friends with her, along with his wife Julie. An investigation by Norfolk Fire and Rescue Service found there was no electrical fault and that the most likely cause of the blaze was an open flame, cigarette or taper that set fire to her clothing. Actress Bernadette Milnes with her three-month-old daughter Anne Lysette Anthony after the baby's christening at the Church of Our Lady in St John's Wood . Actress Lysette Anthony, pictured starring in television programme Three Up, Two Down . Pathologist Dr Wayne Kinsey said that post-mortem examinations showed Mrs Bennett suffered from heart disease but he found no significant levels of carbon monoxide or of smoke inhalation. He concluded there were three possible scenarios which led to her death with the most likely being that she suffered 'a cardiac event' and collapsed and died while holding a lit taper or cigarette, which then ignited her clothing. Norfolk coroner William Armstrong recorded a narrative verdict, suggesting that the fire had started accidentally after she suffered a heart attack. He said: 'Bernadette Bennett was found dead after a house fire at her home which had been started by her accidentally and without the intention of causing harm to herself. 'It is more likely than not that she died from a cardiac event in the context of underlying natural heart disease and not from the effects of the fire. 'No third party was involved in the death.'","Bernadette Bennett was found dead after the fire at her seaside home .

If members of Congress want to know how much a military strike on Syria will cost, they'll have to wing it. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan has written on Monday that it's not capable of forecasting the price tag on what Secretary of State John Kerry has called an 'unbelievably small and limited' attack on sites related to dictator Bashar al-Assad's chemical weapons stockpiles. That declaration was published on Monday, hours before President Obama changed tack in a series of television news interviews that were expected to be rallying cries for war powers but instead became diplomatic dog-whistles. The turnaround followed an international flurry prompted by Kerry's gaffe-induced suggestion that Assad could avoid a military attack from the United States if he agreed to quickly turn his chemical weapons over to international control for destruction. War powers: The X-47B pilotless drone combat aircraft carries laser-guided bombs and can fly faster than 500 miles per hour at 40,000 feet. The Pentagon has spent an estimated $1.8 billion on research, development and testing . Warbucks: A single sea-launched tomahawk missile can cost upwards of $1.4 million . War drone: The U.S. Air Force MQ-1 Predator unmanned aerial vehicle carries an estimated price tag of $4 million, not including each $58,000 Hellfire anti-armor missile in its airborne arsenal . War winner: Syrian president Bashar al-Assad stands to lose much of his chemical weapons stockpiles but will likely remain in power, fighting his civil war with conventional weapons sent from Russia by the boatload . More than a week ago Obama proposed Senate Joint Resolution 21, a measure that Democrats have put on a temporary back-burner while a surprising Russia-brokered diplomatic solution plods its way forward. It would authorize the White House to attack Syrian sites if the president determined it is in America's national interest. 'I will not pursue an open-ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan' against Assad, Obama pledged in a televised national address on Tuesday. But without specifics, CBO declared on Monday, the price tag remains open-ended. 'The Administration has not detailed how it would use the authority that would be provided by this resolution,' read CBO's report, a little-noted one-page notice. '[T]hus, CBO has no basis for estimating the costs of implementing S. J. Res. 21.' During a Sept. 4 hearing in the House of Representatives, Florida Republican Rep. Ileana . Ros-Lehtinen asked Kerry to address the potential expenses related to . carrying out attacks on Syria if Congress were to authorize them. Following through on a use-of-force resolution, she said, 'could potentially cost ... billions.' On that same day, three different . defense and national security analysts gave MailOnline their 'educated guesswork' estimates of the cost of a 90-day . military action in Syria, a length of time corresponding to the longest period covered in the Senate's joint resolution. Those estimates ranged from $5 to $21 billion. Oops: Kerry's unintentional diplomatic offer to Syria on Monday in London singlehandedly shifted the Obama administration from an offensive to a defensive posture . Who stands taller now? Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) is suddenly in the driver's seat, with Obama forced to mute his military threats in favor of a drawn-out and possibly years-long diplomatic process in Syria . Kerry is en route to Geneva, Switzerland for two days of talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. The two will reportedly discuss a beginning framework for keeping Assad accountable as his chemical arms are slowly dismantled . They were based on a scenario that required providing . anti-Assad resistance groups with small arms, launching missiles and armed drones from the Mediterranean Sea, and flying Turkey-based military aircraft over Syria after chemical weapons launch sites and anti-aircraft positions are . destroyed. And while both Obama and Kerry have insisted that any U.S. plan would not involve 'boots on the ground,' a 2012 Pentagon estimate prepared for the White House's National Security Council found that securing Assad's chemical weapons themselves would require 75,000 ground troops. That scenario is decidedly on hold while Syria explores diplomatic options with Russia, its strongest ally. A Pentagon spokesman told CNN in 2012 that it costs $815,000 per year to pay, deploy, feed, house, arm and maintain each soldier on the ground in Afghanistan. Applying that figure to the 75,000 troops the Pentagon has said it would need to secure Syrian chemical weapons sites, a three-month deployment at similar costs would cost another $15.27 billion. Obama asked Congress on Tuesday night to keep his war-powers resolution open as a viable future option, calling on legislators to 'postpone,' not cancel, a scheduled vote in the Senate. If the measure should win future approval and the president wanted to launch a strike, CBO notes, he 'would be required to provide a determination to the Congress addressing several criteria to show that such action is necessary and in the national interest.' 'In addition, it would require the President to submit to the Congress a strategy for negotiating a political settlement to the Syrian conflict, a comprehensive review of U.S.policy towards Syria, and periodic reports on the progress of military operations.'","Congress' economic forecasters have written that they can't forecast how many billions of dollars a Syrian military campaign might consume .
Experts tell MailOnline that a 90-day mission, if needed, could carry a price tag as large as $21 billion .
Adding 'boots on the ground' sufficient to secure Bashar al-Assad's chemical weapons could add another $15 billion in personnel costs ."

Star quality: Scott Thorson, the one-time boyfriend of musical legend Liberace was spared jail time after testing positive for meth . An ex-lover of Liberace who was the subject of an HBO film on the life of the pianist got a lecture on Wednesday from a judge who said he was not impressed with his 'so-called celebrity status' but again agreed to spare him from prison time after testing positive for methamphetamine in violation of his probation. Scott Thorson, 54, acknowledged in Washoe District Court that he's a drug addict and insisted he's determined to get sober and avoid serving up to 20 years in prison for burglary and ID theft convictions. He said his goal is to write another book on the heels of his 'Behind the Candelabra,' which was used as the basis for the HBO film of the same name that's nominated for 15 Emmy Awards. 'I'm just asking for another chance,' a tearful Thorson told the judge. 'Getting sober is the most important thing to me. I'm up for 15 Emmys and that is important too. I'm becoming productive and feel good about myself.' 'I can't help who I am. I'm in show business. I attract these cameras,' he said in reference to TV coverage in the courtroom. 'I want to be sober.' In July, Judge Patrick Flanagan sentenced Thorson to eight to 20 years and suspended the sentence on the condition he complete a drug court program. Thorson was in compliance with the program for a month, passing all drug tests while staying with a support group in housing provided at a legal brothel in a neighboring county, his lawyer David Houston said. But as a result of a determination by probation officials that he must reside within Washoe County, Houston said Thorson was forced to move into a cheap downtown hotel in Reno where he relapsed. 'He was living in what I would refer to as a drug-infested area,' Houston said. 'If you put enough stress on an individual and make things seem helpless you do get a certain result - in this case a relapse.' Thorson, who is currently in remission . for anal cancer and had to have nasal surgery recently, asked not to be . tested so he could take needed medication. Thorson - who now goes by the alias Jess . Marlow - has consistently battled drug addiction, but it  wasn't until a . book he wrote about his life with Liberace was turned into a movie that . he received much attention. Behind the Candelabra: Thorson's memoir of his life with Liberace was recently turned into a movie on HBO starring Matt Damon as Thorson to Michael Douglas ' Liberace . Thorson was played by Matt Damon opposite Michael Douglas' Liberace in the HBO film 'Behind the Candelabra' The two were together for five years, starting in 1976 when Thorson was just 16 years old. But their relationship ended in a messy break-up. In 1982, Liberace kicked the job-less Thorson, whose drug habits started getting worse, out of his house. Eventually . Thorson sued Liberace for $113million, and the pianist settled out of . court for $75,000, giving up three cars and two pet dogs as well. Liberace died in 1987 after succumbing to an AIDS-related illness. Deputy . District Attorney John Helzer said Thorson, has been trying to . capitalize on his fame since he told arresting officers he couldn't . afford the bad publicity of going to jail on charges of stealing a . credit card from a motel next door to a Reno strip club last year. This past July, Thorson was sentenced to five years of probation after pleading guilty to burglary and identify theft charges. The end of the affair: Thorson dated Liberace for five years starting in 1976 when he was just 16 years old. The two eventually broke up when Thorson's drug habits started getting out of hand . 'His . perception of being a celebrity is his biggest wall. He's not a . celebrity. He's a story. It's one of accusation and manipulation and . failure,' Helzer said. 'He should go to prison.' Flanagan rejected the prosecution's motion to revoke probation and order Thorson to jail but said it would be his last chance. 'I'm . not impressed - I don't think anybody is - with this so-called . celebrity status,' the judge said. 'You're just like any other addict . who has committed a crime against a victim.'","Scott Thorson, 54, former lover of Liberace, plagued by drug addiction .

Lady Gaga, pictured this week outside the studio of 'Good Morning America' in New York, will face her former PA in court in November. Jennifer O'Neill claims the singer owes her unpaid overtime . A former roommate, friend and personal assistant of Lady Gaga who claimed the pop singer cheated her out of overtime wages will get to tell her story in court. A jury will decide whether Gaga's demands left Jennifer O'Neill any personal time or whether she was on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, as she claimed in her 2011 lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe said yesterday. A trial is set for November 4. O'Neill worked for the singer for one to two months in early 2009 and for 13 months beginning in February 2010. The judge said both sides agree she was expected to be available as needed throughout each hour of each day. Gardephe ruled that O'Neill's 'on-call' time potentially qualifies for overtime compensation. O'Neill said she was paid at a flat rate of about $50,000 annually when she was first hired and $75,000 annually the second time by the pop singer, who is estimated in a list published by Forbes magazine to have earned $80 million in the first six months of this year. Lawyers did not immediately comment. In his written decision, Gardephe noted that lawyers said Lady Gaga, listed in the litigation under her birth name - Stefani Germanotta - and O'Neill frequently slept in the same bed because O'Neill never had her own hotel room while on tour and was required to address Lady Gaga's needs throughout the night. O'Neill had testified in a deposition that if Lady Gaga was watching a DVD in the middle of the night and grew tired of it, she woke her up to take out and replace the DVD. 'Every day is a work day for her, so every day is a work day for the rest of us,' she said. 'There is no, ""We're going to stay in, we're going to sleep."" There is no, ""Let's put on sweatpants and go out to the movies and be girlfriends."" It doesn't work like that,' O'Neill said. She alleges that she she put in 7,168 hours of unpaid overtime and is now owed more than $380,000, according to a report in the New York Post. In her deposition testimony, Lady Gaga had testified: 'You don't get a schedule. You don't get a schedule that is like you punch in and you can play ... at your desk for four hours and then you punch out at the end of the day. This is when I need you, you're available.' O'Neill had testified she was responsible . for sometimes monitoring the singer's email and telephone . communications and for handling all her luggage - generally 20 bags - . including clothing, accessories, makeup and toiletries. Sharing a bed: Jennifer O’Neill, who is currently suing Lady Gaga for unpaid overtime, has revealed in court depositions . that she shared the same bed as Gaga during her Monster's Ball tour in . 2010, pictured . She was also responsible for making sure that 'special food' was available at every location and for making sure the singer arrived at performances on time and had ample time for hairstyling, makeup and voice warm-ups and that she appeared on stage on time, O'Neill said. She said she assisted with costume changes during performances and was responsible afterwards for arranging ice packs, tea and a shower, along with dinner and an exit from the venue. Lady Gaga has previously tweeted that O'Neill was her former 'best friend' from the age of 19, when they met in New York. The judge noted that the women met after Lady Gaga moved into O'Neill's apartment building on the Lower East Side of Manhattan before 2008, when they became roommates and friends. O'Neill was offered a position as her personal assistant because they were friends and she had experience in the music industry, court papers said.","Lady Gaga and Jennifer O'Neill met in 2008 when Gaga moved into O'Neill's Manhattan apartment building .

Belligerent: Vladimir Putin said the U.S. must back off from threatened air strikes before Russia would help make Syria hand . over chemical weapons stockpiles . Vladimir Putin said last night Barack Obama must withdraw the threat of US air strikes against Syria before Russia would back plans to make Bashar Assad hand over Syria’s vast chemical weapons arsenal. The Russian president delivered his ultimatum as the US, Britain and France prepared to table a UN Security Council resolution to force Syria to surrender an estimated 1,000 tonnes of poison gas. The Western allies are also expected to insist that Assad faces trial for war crimes in the International Criminal Court. President Putin’s intervention stepped up diplomatic pressure on Washington as a vote in Congress on missile strikes against Assad’s regime was postponed as a result of impromptu remarks by US Secretary of State John Kerry. Mr Kerry suggested air strikes could be avoided if Syria agreed to put its weapon stocks under ‘international control’. Diplomatic sources said Mr Kerry had blundered in making the suggestion on a visit to London. Although there had been some discussion of how to make safe Syria’s chemical weapons – the biggest stockpile in the world – Western leaders had envisaged such steps being taken after US-led military strikes. But as Russia – belligerent ally of Assad – seized on Mr Kerry’s remarks, the Syrian government quickly said it accepted its proposal on surrendering chemical weapons. Foreign minister Walid al-Moualem said Syria would declare its chemical weapons arsenal and sign the international chemical weapons convention. And the Russian president insisted the US renounce the option of taking military action in Syria to allow checks on Damascus’s chemical arsenal to go ahead. ‘It all makes sense and can work if the US side and all those who  support it renounce the use of force,’ Mr Putin said. Iran also said it was backing the plan. ‘We are offering President Obama a way out,’ its government said. Political pressure: President Barack Obama is . seen leaving a lunch with Senate Republicans yesterday where he tried to drum up . support for his administration's plans to launch punitive military . attacks on Syria . The US, UK and other allies say there is conclusive evidence that Syrian government forces carried out a sarin attack in Damascus on August 21, killing 1,429 people. But the West’s response has been thrown into turmoil by the British Parliament’s refusal to back military action, followed by President Obama’s decision to delay and hold a vote in Congress. After speaking by phone with the US President yesterday, David Cameron warned that the plan must not be a ‘distraction’ from ensuring that action is taking in response to the use of nerve gas against civilians. Blunder: A vote in Congress on missile strikes against . Syria was postponed as a result of remarks by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry . The Prime Minister told MPs the Russian plan was ‘an interesting proposal’, adding: ‘If it is a serious one, then it is one we should take very seriously, because it could achieve a major goal we have as a Government – to get rid of chemical weapons. ‘It is important to make sure that this isn’t some delaying tactic, that this isn’t some ruse. In the resolution, I think it’s quite important that we have some clarity about thresholds. 'We need to know that there’s a proper timetable for doing this, we need to know that there would be a proper process for doing it, and crucially there would have to be consequences if it wasn’t done.’ Mr Cameron said Syria’s chemical arsenal was the biggest in the world and the plan should mean that it is not only handed over to an international agency, but also destroyed. Mr Cameron added: ‘If this is a serious proposal, we should treat it accordingly. Of course we should be sceptical, of course we should not forget a war crime has been committed. ‘This could be a major step forward, but we need to test it out properly. I think we should also be clear that none of this would be happening if there wasn’t serious international pressure, led by the United States, on Syria over the issue of chemical weapons.’ Mr Cameron said the UN resolution would contain thresholds for Syrian action and a clear timetable. He added: ‘Standing back from this and looking at the overall picture, if we can achieve the removal and the destruction of the biggest chemical weapons arsenal in the world, that would be a significant step forward.’ President Obama said the proposal was ‘potentially a significant breakthrough’, but he remained sceptical that Syria would carry it out. The Syrian foreign minister said the move would ‘remove grounds for US aggression’.","Russian president's ultimatum comes as Western allies prepare UN deal .

"PUBLISHED: . 15:32 EST, 11 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:32 EST, 11 September 2013 . Fashion has presented a series of challenges for Lorry Newhouse, a designer who established her eponymous label only last year. They are learning curves, she says, that have not been helped by her relations to mega fashion magazine publishing house Condé Nast, which owns titles including Vogue and Glamour. Mrs Newhouse, the wife of Mark Newhouse (an Advanced Publications newspaper executive and cousin of Condé CEO Si Newhouse), started her brand last year as an impromptu career change, inspired by her love of fashion. ‘I was originally a painter, I actually came out of the film world, I went to Yale film school and [fashion] really evolved from my love of color and texture,’ she told MailOnline by phone on Tuesday. Bright spot: Lorry Newhouse's designs exhibit an uptown sensibility, and are often fabricated of bright or sequined fabrics to create a dramatic effect (seen here in two looks from her spring 2014 collection) ‘I was always making clothes and people started asking me “Where did you get that dress?” and it really evolved from that.’ In the last twelve months Mrs Newhouse has already placed her made-in-New York designs on Lana Del Rey, Barbara Streisand, and Alyssa Milano, among others. Ireland Baldwin wears one of her ball gowns in the latest issue of DuJour magazine. Mrs Newhouse’s line has a distinctively uptown flair, and is heavy on the kind of cocktail attire that feels at home within see-and-be-seen social circuit. Rather than citing historical figures or artists as reference points, Mrs Newhouse says that innovative textiles, predominantly sourced from Italy and France, are driving inspiration behind all of her work. ‘Honestly I get inspired by fabrics,’ she said. ‘I see colors and it has to shine or glow or have a fabulous texture.’ For fall that entails a palette of sequins, metallic taffetas, rich brocades, and assorted laces. Their combined effect may sound overwhelming, but the collection’s classic shapes accommodate Mrs Newhouse’s vision for textural decadence. On her own: Newhouse (right), says that she is prepared to work hard to create a sustainable fashion business . Her newest collection for spring 2014-- which debuted this week at New York Fashion Week --offers a smaller range of designs, these ones fabricated of candy-colored taffetas, watercolor florals, and again, more sequins. ‘It’s very Normal Norrell-esque,’ she said of her label’s overall aesthetic, referencing the mid-century American designer who found fame with a line of elegant, over-the-top clothes. Mrs Newhouse’s spring lookbook is modeled by family friends and relatives, which she says is ‘So much more fun than getting these stick kind of models.’ 'I think as a designer, you can . specialize in one area, make a name for yourself, and then expand later . on...' While amply comfortable in the eveningwear arena, Mrs Newhouse not yet found her design footing with everyday clothes. But to her, that is part of the plan. ‘I think as a designer, you can specialize in one area, make a name for yourself, and then expand later on,’ she said of her focus on cocktail attire. ‘In the end it’s about staying in the game as long as possible and getting your name out there.’ It’s a task that Mrs Newhouse says she . is tackling all on her own. ‘I married into the Newhouse family…it . really hasn’t helped that much, we have had great media coverage but . very little from Newhouse publications except WWD,’ she told us. Shiny stuff: Looks from Mrs Newhouse's fall 2013 (L and R) and spring 2014 (C) collections are filled with fabrics that she feels recall the designs of Norman Norrell . Mrs Newhouse also says that her label has taken more of an exhausting effort than she had perhaps expected. In New York, emerging fashion designers are typically quite young, a stigma that Mrs Newhouse attributes to the fact that ‘you do need that youth to have the stamina to be able to sustain the kind of energy it takes to do this.’ While she would not disclose her exact age (she did admit to being well past thirty), Mrs Newhouse says that she has found the fashion industry to be ‘on steroids right now.’ Elaborating she told us: ‘there is a lot of pressure to put out enough product and enough designs, which is why I keep this a really small enterprise right now. I’d be very happy keeping it small and less commercial.’ Her fashion week presentation, however, has attracted attention from department store buyers. At present, Mrs Newhouse is only retailed through a handful of specialty shops. She says that most of her sales come through private clients. ‘It’s sink or swim for me,’ she said. ‘The Newhouses are very ethical—there is business and there is family and the two don’t get combined ever,’ she continued. ‘That’s the only way to do a business.’","Fashion designer Lorry Newhouse, married to a cousin of Condé Nast CEO Si Newhouse, says that her familial tie to some of fashion's biggest magazines 'hasn't really helped all that much.'"

Andrea said: 'A tattoo is a bit more permanent and it is something we are always going to have. 'We have got ""I do"" and the date of the wedding as well so we never forget the date.' Speaking during the tattooing process, she added: 'It's very surreal and painful but I wanted to do something quirky and different for our wedding photos.' The wedding took place at St Paul's Church in Sketty and was followed by a reception for 96 guests in Norton House in Mumble.

A Canadian firm wants to replace all our computer passwords, screen locks on phones and tablets, car and house keys and even wallets with a single authentication band worn on the wrist. The Nymi bracelet reads and monitors the wearer's cardiac rhythm, which is as unique as a person's fingerprint, to authenticate who they are. A built-in proximity sensor can then detect where they are, and when the wearer is close to a paired computer, device or car, will automatically confirm their identity and unlock the required hardware or software. Scroll down for video . Canadian firm Bionym has created the Nymi bracelet, pictured, that identifies the wearer by tracking their unique heart rate, or cardiac rhythm. The bracelet can then be used to unlock paired computers and mobile devices and cars, for example . When the wearer clasps the Nymi around their wrist, the bracelet powers on. By placing a finger on the topside sensor while the wrist is in contact with the bottom sensor, it completes an electrical circuit. Nymi will then vibrate and built-in LEDs light up to tell the wearer the device has successfully authenticated them . When the wearer clasps the Nymi around their wrist, the bracelet powers on. By placing a finger on the topside sensor while the wrist is in contact with the bottom sensor, it completes an electrical circuit. Nymi will then vibrate and built-in LEDs light up to tell the wearer the device has successfully authenticated them. Users will stay authenticated until they remove their Nymi and the electrical circuit is broke. The Nymi functions on a 3-factor security system - the bracelent, a unique heartbeat and an Authorized Authentication Device (AAD), which is a smartphone or device registered with the app. Although other companies are also working on password replacements that use a person's biometric data such as an iris, face, or fingerprint, for example, Bionym founder, Dr. Karl Martin, claims Nymi is even more secure. He told The Verge: 'Your face, your iris — they're all physical features that can be stolen, that you leave everywhere.' The bracelet contains a HeartID that measures the amount of electrical power generated by a human heart, called a cardiac rhythm tracked on an electrocardiogram, or ECG. This ECG differs from person to person and depends on the location and size of the their heart. Nymi only works with a registered person's cardiac rhythm, meaning if the bracelet is stolen it can't be hacked. And unlike photos of people's faces and iris, or fingerprints left on surfaces, a heart can't be copied or stolen. Along with the HeartID and proximity sensors, the Nymi bracelet also has a motion sensor and connects to devices using Bluetooth. The motion sensor can be used to open car boots or doors wirelessly by moving the wrist in a certain direction, for example. Applications on smart TVs can also be controlled using flicks and spins of the wrist. Plus, Nymi can be used to pay for shopping wirelessly and securely. Although . the first Nymi release is a bracelet, Martin claims that the technology . could also be embedded into other accessories, such as a ring or belt - all the device needs is a connection that can be undone. Along with the HeartID and proximity sensor, the Nymi bracelet also has a motion sensor and connects to devices using Bluetooth. The motion sensor can be used to open car boots or doors as well as used to control certain applications on smart TVs, pictured . The bracelet only works with paired devices and once it has been joined to a smartphone, for example, it can vibrate and respond to notifications on the device such as a new email or text message. The product's site said: 'Nymi offers security without compromising convenience, putting you and only you in control of your identity. 'As you head out the door, you’ll be able to interact with the world around you through the power of simple gestures. 'With accurate and convenient authentication technology there is no end to the possibilities. The Nymi can replace everything from the PIN on your credit card to the account information on your gaming console without sacrificing security, privacy or convenience.

Staff at the San Diego Marriott Mission Valley hotel decided mini muffins would be an appropriate way for the hotel to commemorate the loss of nearly 3,000 people on this day in 2001. A poster was printed up and placed in the hotel which read: 'In remembrance of those we lost on 9/11 the hotel will provide complimentary coffee and mini muffins from 8.45 - 9.15am.’ Twitter user @eclectrica posted this photograph of a sign offering patrons free mini muffins and coffee 'in remembrance' of the people who lost their lives on 9/11 . On an emotional day for so many around the country, the San Diego Marriott Mission Valley hotel decided mini muffins would be an appropriate way for the hotel to commemorate the loss of nearly 3,000 people in 2001 . The timing of the free offer coincided almost exactly with 8:46 a.m., the time when the first plane hit the twin towers 12 years ago, and the same time as a moment of silence was being observed at ground zero by relatives of the victims of the terrorist atrocity and by the President and first lady at the White House. One guest at the hotel, stunned at the what they’d seen took a photo of the sign and posted it online using their twitter handle @eclectrica. The photo has attracted a barrage of negative reactions from Twitter users, and the idea of offering free anything in response to one of the darkest moments in America’s recent history has been described as a ‘marketing gaffe,’ ‘crass,’ ‘insensitive’ and ‘embarrassing.’ Other people have poked fun tweeting that it wasn’t even full-size muffins and they were free only for one half an hour.

Our ancestors (like the life-like figure pictured) used a network of small caves for occasional hunting expeditions before returning to a larger base, which they called home, new excavations have found . Neanderthals were a house-proud race who liked to return to a comfortable home after a long day of hunting, excavations of caves in Gibraltar have revealed. The new research found that our ancestors used a network of small caves for occasional hunting expeditions before returning to a larger base, which they called home. Scientists from Oxford University and Gibraltar museum worked together on the dig. They unearthed stone tools and camp fires featuring the remains of seals, ibex and red deer, dating back more than 24,000 years. By analysing the artefacts and the density in which they were found in each cave, a team of scientists was able to determine which site was used for what purpose. Among the tools found were hammers, scrapers and shucks for opening shellfish, another staple of the Neanderthal diet. The population would have foraged locally along a coastal plain, eating a varied diet including wild boar, rabbits, dolphins, birds, tortoises, fish and pine nuts. Gibraltar was inhabited by Neanderthals for 100,000 years, with radiocarbon dating suggesting they lived on the Rock possibly as recently as 24,000 years ago. The peninsula was the final stronghold of the early descendants of man and is where one of the first discoveries of Neanderthal skeletal remains was made in the 19th century. Gorham's Cave, the largest of those excavated by the scientists from Gibraltar Museum and Oxford University, was also once home to hyenas. An artist's drawing of a 30,000-year-old hyena den. Archeologists found hammers, scrapers and shucks for opening shellfish at Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar but did not find large bones, indicating that our ancestors were good at housekeeping . 'Gorham's Cave has a denser, more continuous sequence of lithic artefacts, with greater organic content in its sediments, corroborating the notion that the cave was more heavily utilised,' according to the paper published in the PLoS One journal. 'The paucity of large vertebrate remains from Gorham's Cave has been interpreted to be a consequence of housekeeping, thus implying longer-term occupation. 'Gorham's Cave is the largest of the four caves, and its high ceiling and exposure to sunlight make it the most suitable for habitation. Scientists are excited about their findings at Gorham's Cave. Gibraltar was inhabited by Neanderthals for 100,000 years, with radiocarbon dating suggesting they lived on the Rock possibly as recently as 24,000 years ago . The paper said: 'The dichotomy in occupation intensity between Gorham's and the other caves, suggests the southern Iberian Neanderthals may have practised a mobility pattern in which hominins would temporarily occupy various sites during the course of foraging, but would regularly return to a particular hub locality, such as Gorham's.' Excavations in Vanguard Cave - a sister to Gorham's Cave - show climatic evidence of alternating periods of drought and heavy rainfall, according to The Gibraltar Chronicle. The annual excavation of Gorham's Cave begins next week. Further finds could add to the call for a Neanderthal theme park, which would tell the story of our ancestors' way of life.","Our ancestors used a network of small caves for occasional hunting expeditions before returning to a larger base, which they called home .

The next generation: The new police car has a variety of gadgets to make crime fighting more efficient . Police car: The Robocop car is the latest in the development of the police vehicle and will make officers more able to predict accurately where crimes will happen . The £12,000 of state-of-the-art gadgetry, including three computers and six cameras, means the car can predict where crimes may happen and send the officers to the scene before any offence takes place. The vehicle has won backing from the Association of Chief Police Officers, which set its manufacturers the challenge of designing and building a police car for the future. High-definition cameras allow the Astra to capture every movement surrounding it, recording activity on the streets and scanning people’s faces using facial-recognition software. The car has been compared to futuristic police officer Robocop from the eighties movie of the same name . The car, which costs £21,020 and has a 122mph top speed, is also equipped with fast broadband internet so that officers can upload images and access CCTV footage and photos from the police national database, allowing up-to-the-second intelligence-sharing. A screen on the dashboard, which looks like a satnav, displays a stream of information about people and places outside. Vauxhall, which has a 70 per cent share of the police fleet market, claims the broadband bubble around the vehicle means officers can spend an extra two hours out in the field. After successfully completing its tests earlier this year, the Tourer is now being considered by forces all over the country. The car’s maker says it is an answer to Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe’s directives for the car to be the mobile office, so officers are always out in the field. The Tourer allows for the docking of rugged ‘Toughbook’ laptops and smartphones in the glove compartment and has an aircraft-style black box behind a floor panel in the boot which continuously collects data. Mounted on the front, rear and both sides of the roof are tiny cameras that can spot potential crime scenes as the car is moving. The cameras also provide automatic number-plate recognition, which flags up any vehicles linked to crimes. Two more cameras are fixed on the officers and the back seat so there is a visual record of a suspect’s evidence which can also be used to provide evidence in claims of police brutality. Dick Ellam, Vauxhall’s special vehicles manager, said: ‘This British-built and converted Astra will help make police officers more efficient. It allows them to spend more time fighting crime.’","High-tech ‘Robocop’ car uses face-recognition technology to identify known criminals .

Britain's millionaires are some of the youngest in the world with an average age of just 55, a survey of the super-rich has found. The UK sits well below the likes of France, Germany and America and beats the global average age of 57. It also has some of the youngest multimillionaires - those with $30 million (£19 million) or more - with an average age of 57 compared to the global average of 60 years of age. Some of Britain's youngest millionaires include Adele with a fortune of £30million and 17-year-old Nick D'Aloisio who sold his app Summly for £15million. The age of money: The average age of millionaires and multimillionaires in different countries around the world. The pink bars represent the average age of millionaires in each individual country while the red pars represent the average age of multimillionaires. The yellow dotted lines indicate the global average for millionaires and multimillionaires . Super-rich: Adele is one of Britain's youngest millionaires with an estimated fortune of £30 million . The figures mean Britain has the second youngest average . age for both millionaires and multimillionaires in the G8 and the third . youngest in the G20 after both Russia and China. Millionaires and multimillionaires tend to be younger in the UK than elsewhere in the Western world because of several factors, says Spear's magazine which carried out the research in association with leading wealth consultancy company WealthInsight. Spear's editor Josh Spero said: 'First, we have a long history of entrepreneurialism, building companies which grow to span the world. 'Whether these have been industrial businesses in the Victorian era or financial services today, we have strong examples and a culture which supports it. On the rich list: Award-winning actress Keira Knightley, who starred in Pirates of the Caribbean and Atonement, has a fortune of £30 million . Britain's richest: Daniel Radcliffe, 24, pictured left, has a £54 million fortune after shooting to fame in the Harry Potter films while Robert Pattinson, 27, pictured right, has a fortune of £45 million after starring in Twilight . 'Second, young Britons are often developers and early adopters of technologies, seizing on their potential for business. 'Finally, . we share an approach to business with America, where we try and . encourage people to make it rather than wrapping them up in red tape and . strangling them with high tax rates, as too often happens in Europe.' The average age of millionaires and multimillionaires reflects deeper trends in society. Rich and famous: Emma Watson, who also shot to fame in Harry Potter, now has a £28 million fortune . 'Japan and Italy have an ageing . population who live longer and keep hold of their money longer, . preventing it flowing down to successive generations, whereas Russia . experiences a free-for-all after the Soviet Union collapsed and . opportunistic young businessmen acted quickly to get hold of state . assets. 'Western countries, with greater access to technologies, will be creating millionaires younger too as they take advantage of these new fields of business. 'I hope we see Africa starting to produce generations of millionaires. Its population is young and booming, giving vitality and innovation and a huge potential market. 'Now that technology is reaching Africa much more effectively, its younger generations will be able to bring its benefits to the continent through smart start-ups. 'Added to this is the continent's growing middle class, who need products and services, which businesses will spring up to provide.' Argentina has the oldest average age of millionaire and multimillionaire in the G20 at 67.8 and 68.1 respectively, reflecting the economic crisis of the 1980s and 1990s which prevented young millionaire and multimillionaire growth. According to Oliver Williams, an analyst at WealthInsight, these statistics could well change over the next decade. 'We're likely to see a lower average age of millionaires in the UK as 452,000 new millionaires enter the picture between now and 2017.' However, it is not the same story for Russia: . 'The average age difference between millionaires and multimillionaires in Russia - already above average - will further separate as the original oligarchy hold on to their empires into old age.' Self-made millionaire: Nick D'Aloisio, 17, is one of the youngest self-made millionaires ever after selling his app Summly to Yahoo for £15 million . The 26-year-old heir to H&M, Tom Persson, topped the Sunday Times' 30 richest people under 30 list this year with a staggering estimated fortune of £300 million. Tom and his brother Karl-Johan are the London-based sons of the richest man in Sweden, Stefan Persson, whose father Erling Persson  founded H&M in Västerås, Sweden, in 1947. The family retain a 36 per cent stake in the business. Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe, 24, came second on the list with a fortune of £54 million. Radcliffe made his acting debut aged 10 in BBC One's 1999 television movie David Copperfield before being chosen to play Harry Potter in the film adaptations of the book when he was 11. He starred in the series for 10 years until the release of the eighth and final film in 2011. Radcliffe began to branch out to stage acting in 2007, starring in the London and New York productions of Equus, and in the 2011 Broadway revival of the musical How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. He went on to star in the 2012 horror film The Woman in Black and played beat poet Allen Ginsberg in the 2013 independent film Kill Your Darlings. Radcliffe's Harry Potter co-star Emma Watson, 23, also made the list with a fortune of £28 million. Watson was picked to play Hermione Granger at the age of nine, having previously acted only in school plays. She starred in all eight Harry Potter films, alongside Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint. Watson's work on the Harry Potter series alone has earned her several awards and more than £10 million. She went on to star in Stephen Chbosky's 2012 film adaptation of The Perks of Being a Wallflower, and was cast in the role of Ila in Darren Aronofsky's biblical epic Noah. Another Harry Potter star, Robert Pattinson, 27, came third with a fortune of £45 million following his success with the Twilight films. He secured his first major role as Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire before landing the leading role of Edward Cullen in the film adaptations of the Twilight novels by Stephenie Meyer. In 2010, Pattinson was named one of TIME magazine's 100 Most Influential People in The World, and also in the same year Forbes ranked him as one of the most powerful celebrities in the world in the Forbes Celebrity 100. Actress Keira Knightley, 28, who has starred in films in Pirates Of The Caribbean and Atonement, was fourth on the list with a reported £31 million fortune. She began acting as a child on television and made her film debut in 1995. Knightley had a supporting role as Sabé in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace before gaining her first significant role came in The Hole in 2001. She gained widespread recognition in 2002 after co-starring in the film Bend It Like Beckham and achieved international fame in 2003 as a result of appearing as Elizabeth Swann in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series. She has since starred in numerous films including Pride & Prejudice, Atonement, The Duchess, A Dangerous Method and Anna Karenina. Forbes has previously claimed she is the second highest paid actress in Hollywood. Singer Adele, 25, is Britain's richest musician under 30 with an estimated fortune of £30 million, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Adele rose to fame after a friend posted her demo on Myspace in 2006 and XL Recordings offered her contract. Her debut album, 19, was released in 2008 to much commercial and critical success. It certified four times platinum in the UK, and double platinum in the U.S. She is closely followed on the list by Cheryl Cole, 30, who has amassed a fortune of £14 million. Cheryl rose to fame in 2002 when she auditioned for the reality television show Popstars: The Rivals on ITV. The programme announced that Cole had won a place as a member of the girl group, Girls Aloud and she has remained a part of the band ever since. Girls Aloud has achieved 20 top-ten singles - including four number one singles - in the UK and six platinum albums. Cheryl has also managed to launch a successful solo singing career and a judge on X Factor. Although Sir Paul McCartney, 71, remained Britain's richest musician this year with a fortune of £680 million. Meanwhile 17-year-old Nick D'Aloisio, who was born in Australia but brought up in London, became one of Britain's youngest millionaires earlier this year after selling his Summly app to Yahoo for a reported £15 million in March. D'Aloisio first started working on the app, which is designed to condense online content into just a few words, when he was 15.

But today, ladies and gentlemen: step right up for Osbert Humperdinck Pumpernickle, the collie who never wobbles. The four-year-old cross - Ozzy for short - has rightly claimed his place as Britain’s most accomplished canine tightrope walker. Scroll down for video . The collie who never wobbles: Four-year-old Osbert Humperdinck Pumpernickle - known as Ozzy for short - holds the Guinness world record for the fastest crossing of a tightrope ever achieved by a dog . New trick: Ozzy crossed a 3.5m (11.4ft) rope in 18.22 seconds to secure his place in the record books . See how he balances on hind legs on a . highwire stretched between two trees! Marvel at his skill in traversing a . rope with no visible means of support! And . now - applaud as he picks up his coveted Guinness World Record award . for performing the fastest crossing of a tightrope ever to be achieved . by a dog (a category, it should be said, in which there was surprisingly . little competition). For the record, he crossed a 3.5m (11.4ft) rope in 18.22 seconds. The rare feat is just one of Ozzy’s many remarkable acrobatic acts, which also include swinging on a chain, freerunning along a narrow ledge, or balancing on his owner Nick Johnson’s shoulders as he cycles into town. For the avoidance of doubt, by the way, it’s Nick who does the cycling, not Ozzy - although it is surely only a matter of time before this particular dog masters two-wheel travel. Ozzy, a chocolate and white border collie and kelpie cross, was born on a farm in Anglesey, North Wales, before moving to Nick’s home in Norwich. He showed an early aptitude for balance and seemed keen to improve on that tired old repertoire of standard doggy tricks, such as shake-a-paw and fetch-a-stick. Aptitude for balance: The rare feat is just one of Ozzy’s many acrobatic acts, which include swinging on a chain, freerunning along a narrow ledge, or balancing on his owner’s shoulders as they cycle into town . Nick, a 51-year-old carpenter, bought a book called Puppies For Dummies before enrolling Ozzy on a six-week training course and taking some tips from celebrated ‘dog whisperer’ Zak George. His acrobatic antics were captured in a YouTube video that led to international acclaim and TV stardom. Yesterday Nick declared himself ‘so happy and proud’ at Ozzy’s place in world record history, adding: ‘Ozzy’s parents are working sheepdogs on a farm, so it’s in his blood to want to work closely with me. He’s most happy when he’s working on the tricks that we do - he regards it as a game. 'We only practice when Ozzy is in the mood, after he’s done all his important dog stuff like sniffing around and meeting other dogs.’ They might not rank among mankind's greatest achievements, and most of them certainly won't change the world. But there has always been a place in public's quest for knowledge of the biggest, the best, the bonkers and the bizarre.

McLoughlin's 13-year sentence for the killing was reduced to eight years on appeal, but within 17 months of his release, McLoughlin, a drifter from Barrow-in-Furness who is said to have worked as a rent boy, killed again in September 1990. Again, his victim was gay: Peter Halls, a . publican with whom McLoughlin had been living in Brighton.  He forced . him to lie face down on his bed and then stabbed him through the neck . with such force that the knife came out the other side.

She said she had spent more than 20 years trying to come to terms with her brother’s killing. She said: ‘I have tried to put Peter’s . killing behind me but you never forget. Now all the terrible emotions I . felt have come back to the surface. ‘McLoughlin has never shown a scrap of remorse for what he did to Peter. I would be happy if they gave him a lethal injection.’ Mr Buck leaves a wife, two sons, a . daughter and two grandchildren, and a wife from a previous marriage.

Nick Clegg today tore into the BBC for offering Premier League footballer pay deals to top staff. The Deputy Prime Minister warned the Corporation’s reputation has been ‘badly tarnished’ by the spectacle of executives trying to dodge the blame for signing off severance deals worth up to £1million. He said the use of taxpayers’ money to lavish huge salaries on BBC bosses meant they now had a ‘mountain to climb’ to restore public trust. Scroll down for video . Criticism: Nick Clegg said the BBC now has a 'mountain to climb' to restore public trust in the Corporation . Mr Clegg is the latest senior minister to lambast the Corporation for its handling of the pay-off scandal. On Monday, seven current and former BBC chiefs were called before MPs to explain why it handed £369million in severance deals to its staff, including £25million to 150 top managers. During almost three hours of furious questioning in Parliament, former Director-General Mark Thompson and BBC Trust Lord Patten repeatedly contradicted each other, notably over a £1million settlement for ex-deputy Director-General Mark Byford. MPs demanded to know why Mr Byford received double the £500,00 to which he was contractually entitled. The executives were called back to Parliament after giving different accounts about how the deals were agreed, and Mr Thompson, now chief executive of the New York Times, challenging claims by the BBC Trust that they were kept in the dark. Tense: Mr Thompson (circled left) was placed five seats away from BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten, with whom he is at loggerheads over whether the Trust knew about the payments . Mr Clegg condemned the size of the pay deals funded from the licence fee: ‘These are figures are just very, very high. 'This is taxpayers’ money going into the BBC and they can’t in a sense treat these payoffs like you might treat a pay-off for a Premier League footballer. 'They’re not in that category. These are public servants at the end of the day so I do think actually the BBC’s reputation - and I say this with real sorrow because I am a huge defender and advocate of the BBC - but the reputation’s been pretty badly tarnished this week.' Speaking on his LBC 97.3 radio phone-in, Mr Clegg said this week’s committee hearing had rocked his faith in the Corporation. ‘I’m a big, big supporter of the BBC. It’s recognised around the world as being an organisation that produces great drama, great programming, great news,’ he said. ‘But I have to say that they haven’t covered themselves in glory with one bit of the BBC saying one thing, the other bit saying something. ‘The left hand doesn’t seem to know what the right hand is saying.’ Defiant: Mark Thompson became increasingly animated during the grueling three-hour committee grilling . Dispute: BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten blamed a . 'culture' of extravagance at the Corporation which was used to justify . huge pay and perks . Kicking off Monday's committee evidence session, Ms . Hodge said it was an 'extraordinary occasion' for seven former and . serving BBC executives to have to be called back to Parliament. Mr Thompson and Lord Patten were . called to appear with BBC HR director Lucy Adams, Marcus Agius, the . former chairman of the BBC Executive Board Remuneration Committee, BBC . director Nicholas Kroll, BBC Trustee Anthony Fry and former BBC Trust . chairman Sir Michael Lyons. Ms Hodge said she hoped to 'establish . on behalf of both the public and licence-fee payer who knew what and at . what time and who is responsible for decisions taken by the BBC'. She said the deals led to ‘grossly excessive payments which most people now consider to be unacceptable’. One caller challenged Mr Clegg over whether the pay-offs breached the Bribery Act, but the Deputy PM insisted ‘any allegations of criminality [are] something for the police’. ‘But the wider point about needing to restore public trust in the way in which the BBC is run, the way in which people are remunerated, the way in which are paid off at the end of their contracts… . ‘Just to state the flaming obvious: the BBC have now got quite a mountain to climb to restore public trust in the way these things are handled.’ His comments come after Culture Secretary Maria Miller said the payouts raise ‘serious questions’ about the judgement of those in charge at the BBC. In a major speech to the RTS Television Convention last night, Mrs Miller said: ‘Monday was a grim day for its senior management. ‘There is a risk of events like this overshadowing the unstinting work of its staff. ‘This must not be allowed to happen. The corporate dramas of the BBC should never eclipse its actual dramas.’ In a further sign of government pressure on the BBC to get its house in order, she cleared the way for the National Audit Office to probe any area of its extravagant spending ‘without hindrance or delay’. She also warned that the BBC Trust structure remained under constant review. But Mr Clegg today insisted he did not back the idea of axing the Trust and handing regulation of the BBC to Ofcom. He added: ‘The Trust now needs to work very hard indeed and urgently to restore confidence in the way in which it discharges its duties.’ Defensive: Former Director-General Mark Thompson said he increased the pauout to Mark Buford by almost £500,000 to keep him focused on his job . Ex-Director-General Mark . Thompson today claimed his friend and deputy Mark Byford needed to be . paid £949,000 to remain 'focussed' on his job at the BBC. MPs demanded to know why the huge sum was agreed, when contractually Mr Byford was only entitled to £500,000. Mr Thompson denied there was any 'favouritism' in his decision to agree the deal. Mr Thompson told the committee that in . his view Mr Byford's severance package represented 'value for money' and he explained that he had been under 'ferocious pressure' from the . Trust to make savings. As part of the extraordinary deal, it . was decided in October 2010 that Mr Byford would not be told formally . that he was being made redundant until April the following year, . allowing him to continue drawing on his salary. Mr . Thompson said the huge sum was needed because the BBC wanted Mr Byford . to be 'fully focused' on his work during his last months in the job and . not 'worried about his future'. But . former Trust chairman Sir Michael Lyons agreed with the MPs that . payments like Mr Byford's 'look eye-watering' and he warned the Trust . had been 'damaged' but the crisis. Grilling: BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten walks through the Houses of Parliament to the hearing at the Public Accounts Committee . Lord Patten said he had been . repeatedly told the £949,000 deal for Mark Byford to leave the BBC was . 'contractual' and 'standard'. The . BBC Trust chairman told the committee: 'I am in a slightly difficult . position because I became chairman of the Trust six months after the . Byford payment. 'I'm accused of having misled the committee on something that I never knew and couldn't have been expected to know.' He . said he had been through his induction pack from May 2011 and . subsequent briefings, and there was no mention of the controversial . severance payments. One . briefing ahead of a press conference stated: 'These were contractual . payments which were essential in order to slim down the executive . board.' Lord Patten . complained that it is 'Mark's contention' that he should somehow have . deduced that the payment to Mr Byford was in excess of his contractual . minimum. He blamed a . 'cultural issue' for the slate of payouts at the Corporation which 'we . do have to recognise and apologise for and deal with very robustly'. He . said one of his first jobs was a meeting to discuss executive pay where . he made 'a very simple point that the best cultural director in the . world, Neil MacGregor, got £180,000 a year for running the British . Museum. How many people at the BBC get paid more than that and how can . we justify that?'. Lord . Patten cast doubt on a proposal that communications watchdog Ofcom . should regulate the corporation, saying: 'I can't imagine handing the . regulatory power to Ofcom and Ofcom wanting to be involved in . remuneration.'","Deputy Prime Minister warns BBC's reputation has been 'badly tarnished'

"By . James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 19:05 EST, 19 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:34 EST, 21 March 2012 . Exercise in transparency: Chancellor George Osborne out jogging yesterday . Every taxpayer is to get a personal annual statement revealing how each pound taken from them by the Revenue is spent. George Osborne will announce the radical move in tomorrow’s Budget, saying every worker has the right to know how their taxes are spent once the money enters the public purse. In some cases, the results are likely to prove startling. A higher-rate taxpayer earning £50,000 this year would be told they paid £14,183 in tax and National Insurance – of which around a third, £4,727.67, is spent on welfare. At the same time, £2,469.68 is spent on health, £1,848.73 on education, £818.52 on defence and £705.62 on public order and safety. A further £141.12 is given to foreign aid and £70.56 is handed to the EU. A Treasury source said: ‘It’s quite right that people know how much tax they pay and  what it’s spent on.’ The Chancellor believes that revealing exactly how the money from Britain’s 29million taxpayers is used will change for ever public attitudes to Government spending. Tory ministers are also hopeful that if the public is more aware of how much they really contribute, they will be more inclined to vote for parties which favour lower taxes. And they believe making more taxpayers aware that the basic rate is 31p, not 20p – once national insurance is included – would help transform voters’ relationship with the state. The Chancellor is also considering even more radical reform, which would see income tax and National Insurance merged. As well as saving businesses billions in administration costs, Labour would not be able to use increased National Insurance contributions as a politically cost-free way of raising money to spend in areas such as the NHS. Treasury Minister David Gauke said: ‘For a lot of people, the tax line on their pay slip is the only time they see just how much they’re paying in tax, but the Government doesn’t think that’s good enough. ‘We want to make tax more transparent and we want people to be more engaged with their own tax affairs. We plan to lift the lid on tax so that people understand how much they are paying, what their overall tax rate is and what they should be paying.’ Conservative MP Ben Gummer, who has championed the idea of personal statements, said: ‘Few of us would part with more than a few pence without a record of how it was spent. From supermarket receipts to electricity bills, we expect an itemised breakdown of where our money goes. ‘Yet for our largest monthly payment, to the taxman, we get just two numbers printed on a pay slip. We are not told the overall value of our taxation obligation. ‘We are not told what proportion of our income it represents. Crucially, we are not told how the Government spends the money we are made to give it. This must change. Breakdown: A mocked-up form for a Mr J Smith and released by the Treasury shows how the new style of personal statements which every taxpayer is set to receive could look . ‘Just as we are under an obligation to pay tax, the Government should be obliged to tell us how it spends our money. ‘It . is a simple idea that could change the way we do politics. For the . first time people will get a real feel for the relative distribution of . their taxes. ‘Tax statements could be implemented quickly and cheaply. They help the Government merge income tax and National Insurance and do more than anything else to help it achieve transparency in the tax system.’ In tomorrow’s Budget, the Chancellor will announce that from 2014/15, 20million taxpayers will receive an annual personal statement. They will be made up of the  eight million who fill out a self assessment form each year along with the 12million who receive a Treasury notice telling them of a change in their tax code. The scheme will then be rolled out to the remaining nine million taxpayers at a later date. Labour is likely to protest that the statements reveal nothing about the benefits they get from public spending, such as  NHS treatment or child benefit. Radical: Osborne will announce the move in tomorrow's Budget, saying every worker has the right to know how their taxes are spent . Breakdown of spending: A higher-rate taxpayer earning £50,000 this year will learn they paid £14,183 in tax and National Insurance - of which around a third, £4,727.67, goes on welfare . However, the Treasury will argue making such a calculation would be so complicated that it would be impossible to produce. Administering the new system is expected to cost around £800,000 a year. Yesterday it emerged that former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson was back in 11 Downing Street a fortnight ago to celebrate his 80th birthday and advise the Chancellor on tax reform. In his famous 1988 budget, Lord Lawson slashed the top rate of income tax from 60p to 40p – a move that caused such an outcry that the House of Commons sitting had to be suspended. The whole truth: The Chancellor, pictured visiting a branch of Barclays bank in London today, believes that revealing exactly how taxes are used will change public attitudes to Government spending . Your money: Mr Osborne, pictured talking to bank workers in South London, will announce that from 2014/15, 20million taxpayers will receive an annual personal statement . Money troubles: The Prime Minister, pictured at a Budget meeting with Treasury secretary Danny Alexander, is said to still be wavering over whether to indicate that top rate of tax will come down further to 40p in 2014 . Mr Osborne is tomorrow expected to announce he is cutting Labour’s 50p top rate to 45p from April next year, as well as raising the income tax threshold for 23million basic rate taxpayers to around £9,000. He is also expected to pledge a review of alternative wealth taxes to replace the 50p rate, which will hit the best off twice as  hard. The Lib Dems are pushing for a mansion tax on homes worth £2million or more, or a levy on ‘unearned wealth’. The Prime Minister and Mr Osborne were said last night to be wavering over whether to indicate they will bring the top rate of  tax down further to 40p in 2014, or leave it until the next Budget, following a mixed reaction to leaks of the plan. Government sources said the pair were still thrashing out final details of tomorrow’s Budget with Nick Clegg and Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander at a meeting yesterday.","Taxpayers earning £50,000 will have paid £14,183 in tax and National Insurance, with around a third, £4,727.67, going on welfare .

"By . Inderdeep Bains . PUBLISHED: . 07:44 EST, 11 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:16 EST, 11 September 2013 . A dedicated volunteer with the ambulance service has been sacked for breaking the speed limit during an emergency call-out. Godfrey Smith, who has been a ‘first responder’ for 15 years, was sent to help a man in July, but bosses who later examined his ambulance’s sat-nav sacked him when it revealed he drove at 33mph in a 20mph zone. Although Mr Smith drives a marked ambulance and provides life-saving care prior to the arrival of overstretched NHS paramedics, as a volunteer first responder he does not have the same rights to break road laws as fully-fledged ambulance drivers. In shock: Volunteer Community First Responder Godfrey Smith had his services dispensed with by South Central Ambulance Service for driving 33mph in a 20mph zone . Saving lives: Mr Smith doesn't deny speeding down an Oxford shopping street but says he was responding to an urgent patient call . Yesterday the 64-year-old said: ‘I’m absolutely devastated. My life has revolved around volunteering and helping people when they most need it. ‘It is soul-destroying being told I can no longer do it. I feel like my heart has been ripped out.’ He was called by controllers on July 23 and sent to the St Clement’s area of Oxford to give emergency treatment to a man who had collapsed with breathing problems. He jumped into his marked South Central Ambulance Service Land Rover to rush to the address, however, following a complaint, he was dismissed for ‘breaching road traffic law’. Bosses who investigated the incident found data on Mr Smith’s  satellite navigation system which showed he was travelling at 13mph faster than he should have done down a high street. He was also criticised for going to the right of a ‘keep left’ bollard. But Mr Smith said the sat-nav did not pick up that the road was a new 20mph zone and was still showing a 30mph limit, and that he drove around the bollard to get past traffic. He added: ‘If I thought it was dangerous, I wouldn’t have done it. There was no traffic coming the other way; the lights were on red.’Mr Smith received a letter last week notifying him of the ambulance service’s decision. Extenuating circumstances: Mr Smith received an urgent call and drove too quickly down High Street and Longwall Street, pictured, in Oxford. He also drove around a bollard to get ahead of traffic . He said: ‘There was no thanks whatsoever for my 15 years of service. I do not condone speeding but the punishment is brutal. ‘This has hit me harder than the death of my own parents. The ambulance service has broken my heart. I have shed tears over this. It meant everything.’ The decision to dismiss him comes just three months after the same ambulance service issued an urgent plea for volunteers after  its number of drivers dropped from 45 to 28. A spokesman for South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust said at the time that the county needed 90 extra ambulances to meet life-saving response times targets. During his time as a volunteer first responder, Mr Smith attended more than 2,000 call-outs and saved numerous lives, calling it the ‘most rewarding thing you can do’. He added: ‘If there is even a slim chance of saving someone then I am there – at least they will have a chance. I get people coming up to me in the street saying “you saved my child”, or “you helped my mum.” ’ Several hundred people in the Oxford area have now signed a petition calling for Mr Smith to be reinstated. One man whose life was saved by Mr Smith condemned the decision to sack him. Father-of-two David Hatton, who was treated by Mr Smith in 2007 when he suffered a massive heart attack at home, said yesterday: ‘It is very petty. If it was not for Gof I would not be walking around today and my children would not have a father.’ Support: At least 60 people have signed a petition supporting the sacked man since Monday . Mr Smith’s son, performing arts student Matthew, 19, who also worked as a first responder, has now resigned in support of his father. He said: ‘I had to stand by my father. He has dedicated a large part of his life to the service and I know it would be difficult for him. ‘As well as his job, he would do at least 20 hours a week volunteer work with the service, and most of it was overnight. He has spent most Christmases and New Year’s Eves going out to emergencies. I can’t even tell you the last time I spent a New Year’s Eve with my father, as he has always been out on calls.’ Ambulance drivers employed by the trust have to get to 75 per cent of most serious calls in eight minutes, and the latest figures, for July, show it hit 84 per cent of its target in Oxfordshire. A spokesman for campaign group Patient Concern said: ‘We think it’s outrageous. The priority is saving lives rather than complying with road regulations.’ A letter to Mr Smith from the trust said: ‘It is felt that your standard of driving on this occasion fell far below that required of someone driving a SCAS marked vehicle.’ SCAS refused to comment on Mr Smith’s case. Volunteer: Those supporting Godfrey Smith have said his dismissal will be a huge loss to South Central Ambulance Service .","First Responder Godfrey Smith was attending an urgent call in Oxford .

A golf instructor stabbed his ex-lover and their son to death just five days after he was freed by police following threats to kill them, an inquest heard yesterday. Andrew Cairns, 44, told Rachael Slack, 38, he would murder her after she told him she was expecting a child by another man. ‘You have no idea what I’m capable of,’ he said, adding: ‘I will kill you and take him (the child) with me.’ Andrew Cairns (left) had been arrested after he twice threatened to kill his former lover Rachael Slack (right) Detectives arrested him but he was released while officers made further inquiries, the inquest jury was told. The decision to free Cairns was made despite his having been known to psychiatric services for years. He was bailed with conditions not to contact Miss Slack or their son Auden and a file assessing her as at high risk of homicide was sent by police to social services. But five days later – on June 2, 2010 –  Cairns went to her home following a visit to the doctor for a headache. Screams were heard by a neighbour, who saw HR manager Miss Slack at a window with the ‘shadow of a man standing behind her’. Police arrived to find three bodies in the sitting room. A pathologist said he believed Cairns killed Miss Slack and their son Auden. Cairns was slumped on top of her with a knife lying between them. Auden, who was a month away from his second birthday, lay nearby. A court heard the bodies of Miss Slack, Cairns, 44, and their son Auden, who was a month off his second birthday, were discovered downstairs at her village home . He had a faint pulse and was airlifted to the Royal Derby Hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. His parents were pronounced dead at the scene. On May 26, Cairns had been sectioned under the Mental Health Act after Miss Slack drove him to a police station because he refused to get out of her car. The inquest heard he had threatened to kill her but an assessment found no evidence of mental illness and he was released on bail. The next day, Miss Slack told police Cairns was loitering outside her house and he was arrested that evening after threatening again to kill her and their son. Cairn was bailed with conditions not to contact Miss Slack or Auden and an assessment placed Rachael at a 'high risk of homicide' He warned her: ‘If you are going to make it difficult, I will make it more so.’ Cairns was interviewed the following day, on May 28, but gave a different version of events and  was released again. He warned his GP at the end of his consultation on June 2 that it would prove to be ‘the most important day of your career’. Cairns was then caught on CCTV catching a bus straight to Miss Slack’s home at Holbrook, Derbyshire. The murders took place shortly afterwards and Guy Rutty, a forensic pathologist who attended the scene, said Miss Slack suffered 32 injuries. She died from multiple stab wounds to the chest including two to her heart. Auden suffered 16 injuries, including four stab wounds to the back and five to the chest.Cairns, who was on antidepressants, also died from multiple stab wounds to the chest. Professor Rutty said the case was similar to others he had worked on in which a man murders members of his family and positions himself beside or on them as a ‘last act ... to be with the person’. He said that on the balance of probabilities he favoured the scenario that Cairns ‘was responsible (for the deaths of) the other two’. Miss Slack’s boyfriend at the time of the deaths, Robert Barlow, 41, attended the hearing and is due to give evidence today. The inquest, which heard that Miss Slack was 14 to 15 weeks  pregnant when she died, continues at Derby coroner’s court with an  11-strong jury. Cairns began threatening Rachael when she told him she was expecting another child with her new partner Robert Barlow .

Arthur Adlam, 31, had just drawn his disability allowance and had around £225 in his wallet when he accidentally left it behind on the bus. But his panic quickly turned to disbelief when he was told that though his property had been handed in, it would cost him almost £30 to get it back. Arthur Adlam, 31, from Dunfermline, who suffered an epileptic fit after Stagecoach charged him almost £30 to get his own wallet back . Father-of-four Arthur, 31, left the wallet on the seat of a Stagecoach bus in his home town of Dunfermline, Fife. But staff at the bus station told him it was company policy to take a 12 per cent cut plus a 50p 'admin fee' - a total of £27.50 - just to get it back. Furious Mr Adlam said: 'It’s an outrage. They told me they couldn’t give it back without charging me. 'They charged me for something that doesn’t belong to them. No one should pay to get their own money back.' Eventually he negotiated the fee down to . £10 - but now red-faced coach chiefs have offered to give the full . amount back and review their penny-pinching policy. Stagecoach, which posted pre-tax profits of £195.8million this year, initially ran buses . between London and Dundee but expanded rapidly throughout the nineties. It eventually diversified into trains and trams and moved into markets overseas, particularly in the United States and Canada. It . now operates South West Trains and its rail portfolio includes South . Western and East Midlands Trains - and also has a 49 per cent stake in Sir Richard . Branson’s Virgin Rail Group which operates the West Coast Main line. Mr Adlam said: 'I was on the bus taking the kids down to the nursery, but when I got off I didn’t notice the wallet was missing. 'I had withdrawn my disability allowance earlier that morning and wasn’t sure what I was going to do without the money.' Apologetic: Stagecoach have since offered to give Mr Adlam his money back and say they will review the policies on lost property . 'While I was at the nursery, I retraced my steps and the staff called up Stagecoach and the police, because I was panicking at that point.' Staff at Beanstalk nursery made phone calls on his behalf to trace the lost wallet and a few hours later the wallet turned up at the bus depot in Dunfermline. The bus company called up with the good news and the bad. His wallet had been handed in - but there was a charge. Mr Adlam added: 'A few hours later Stagecoach called up the nursery said they wanted a cut of 12 per cent and a 50p admin fee. 'They wanted to take £27.50 off me, but Beanstalk got them to reduce it to a tenner. 'Then they rang me at home and it just stressed me out. It was too much and I had a fit and fell to the floor. 'Luckily my partner was there until it was over. I’ve had epilepsy for 15 years and whenever I get hit on the head or too stressed I can suffer from fit.' Bus operators Stagecoach today agreed to refund Mr Adlam and review their policy, which appears only to be in operation in West Fife. A Stagecoach spokesman said: 'A local policy is in place in West Fife to charge a ""finder fee"" for the monies claimed from our lost property, with the fee going to the driver, or member of the public who has handed in any such items to us. 'We were not aware our local company had put this policy in place and we have instructed them to stop the practice. 'There was never any intention by the company to profit from lost property. 'We are sorry for the upset it has caused to the customer.' Knighted: Sir Brian was recognised for his humanitarian work . Stagecoach was founded by Scots brother and sister Brian Souter and Ann Gloag. They launched the company with their father's redundancy money in 1980. Initially the company ran buses between London and Dundee but expanded rapidly throughout the nineties and in 1993 was valued at £134million. It eventually diversified into trains and trams and moved into markets overseas, particularly in the United States and Canada. It now operates South West Trains and its rail portfolio includes South Western and East Midlands Trains it also has a 49% stake in Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Rail Group which operates the West Coast Main line. The company posted pre-tax profits of £195.8million this year, . In 2009 Souter received a £1.6million bonus but donated £900,000 of it to his own Christian-based charity which assists with humanitarian projects in the UK and around the world. Sir Brian is a major financial supporter of the Scottish National Party and has donated millions of pounds to the party over the years. Opponents have accused him being homophobic especially after he donated £1million to a campaign which discouraged local government in Scotland from 'promoting homosexuality.' In 2011 he was awarded a knighthood for services to the transport and voluntary sector. On 18 April 2012, Souter was inducted . into the British Travel and Hospitality Industry Hall of Fame. He is the . first public transport entrepreneur to receive the honour. Last year it was announced that he would step down as Chief Executive of Stagecoach and in May this year he took up the position of Chairman and was replaced by former finance director Martin Griffiths.","Arthur Adlam, 31, was told he would have to pay £30 to get his wallet back .

He had risen from humble beginnings to become a Harley Street doctor providing cosmetic surgery to millionaire clients. But when a lost wallet containing £2,500 was given to staff at Starbucks, Abdul Choudhuri spotted the opportunity to make more money and claimed it as his own – even though it was his wife who handed it in. When the lie was exposed and the doctor arrested, he continued to insist that the money was his – and claimed that he often carried up to 20 wallets in his ‘man bag’. Jailed: Doctor Abdul Choudhuri, 41, was found guilty of taking a wallet full of cash from a Starbucks, and right, pictured with his wife Fatima . Later, he even tried to wreck the trial by calling a witness and trying to trick her into believing it had been cancelled. Choudhuri, 41, was jailed for 30 months at Nottingham Crown Court yesterday after being convicted of fraud and two counts of attempting to pervert the course of justice. Prosecutors described him as ‘a thoroughly dishonest and highly manipulative individual who has gone to extreme lengths in order to avoid conviction’. The wallet belonged to a tourist from Singapore, who returned to the Nottingham Starbucks branch hours later – only to be told it had been claimed by another man. It had contained £2,500 and a 1,000 dollar Singapore note – worth around £500. Staff realised what had happened and phoned police to report the crime. High-flying: Choudhuri worked on the world-renowned Harley Street in Westminster, London (pictured) and claimed to treat Hollywood stars and foreign royalty . They didn’t have Choudhuri’s name but he was recognised by staff member Lisa Wright a month later when he returned to the branch, the court heard. Police arrived and arrested Choudhuri, who claimed to know a superintendent in the force and told the officers they would ‘lose their jobs’. When he was searched a 1,000 dollar Singapore note was found in the wallet he was carrying. Miss Wright, a witness in the trial, later received a call from Choudhuri or a man acting on his behalf claiming to be from the ‘witness protection scheme’ to inform her that the trial was cancelled. It was a ruse to stop the witness going to court to give evidence against him, the jury heard. The doctor also tried to set up a false alibi by pressuring his accountant into saying they had a meeting in the afternoon when in fact it took place in the morning. Choudhuri claimed that clients in his private medical practice included royalty from the Middle East, Hollywood stars and rich footballers’ wives. He said he believed the wallet in Starbucks was his as he routinely carried many with him. One on the day in question in October 2010 he claimed to have had 20 wallets in a ‘man bag’. Scene: The wallet went missing from the coffee shop in Nottingham city centre in October 2010 (file picture) Choudhuri said he was carrying the Singapore banknote when arrested because wealthy international clients often paid him in currency from their own countries. Asked by his barrister, David Dein, if he had ever broken the law, Choudhuri replied: ‘I’ve always made it my mantra to respect the police and stay out of trouble.’ However, the court was told after his arrest, he sent a text message to his wife that read: ‘If pigs ask you anything, it is always no comment. Don’t tell them anything.’ Choudhuri was also ordered to pay £23,395 prosecution costs and £4,000 compensation to the tourist. Mr Dein said taking the wallet was a ‘moment of inexplicable madness’. He added that Choudhuri’s career as a doctor was now over as it was ‘almost certain’ he would be struck off by the General Medical Council. Choudhuri, who was the only pupil from his comprehensive to go to university, ran a business called Body Perfect with his wife, Dr Fatima Jabbar. It has clinics in London, Nottingham, Beverly Hills and Monaco. Taken: The wallet taken by Dr Choudhuri contained a 1000 Singapore dollar note .

In the Great British Bake Off kitchens, innuendo is in the air. And the show’s legions of fans are swooning at every mention of soggy bottoms, beautiful wobbles or frothy peaks. Such cheeky catchphrases have even spawned Bake Off bingo, a game in which viewers, pens at the ready, tick off each mention on a card. Fruity: Legions of fans are playing Bake Off bingo as contestants and hosts alike utter titillating catchphrases. Pictured here, judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry . Some even turn the show into a drinking game, rather rashly downing a shot every time a judge, contestant or host utters the enduring favourite. On Tuesday night, some of the 5.4million watching must have been decidedly worse for wear as the bakers unleashed a barrage of ‘soggy bottoms’ while trying to impress judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry with their pies and tarts. A mere two minutes in and the episode’s star baker Kimberley Wilson declared: ‘The terror of a soggy bottom has been keeping me up all night. If my bottom is dry today, all will be well.’ Within the next 15 minutes, it was mentioned another ten times and went on briefly to become one of the most used phrases on Twitter. As another contestant embarked on the challenge to make an apple pie, host Sue Perkins warned:  ‘I hope Granny Smith doesn’t have a  damp bottom.’ Paul Hollywood, judging Christine Wallace’s efforts, issued a stern rebuke. She looked a little tearful after he declared: ‘One of my pet hates in a pie is a soggy bottom – you’ve managed to get a soggy top.’ On Twitter, they were loving every sugar-crusted moment. ‘The Great British Bake Off was pure gold for innuendo bingo tonight,’ one viewer wrote. Another said: ‘Do NOT play the Great British Bake Off drinking game unless you want to lose all your dignity, and especially not in pie week. Good Lord.’ It was not just the innuendo bingo that was a hit with the BBC2 show’s fans. Others delighted in counting off a string of puns. Introducing the show, Miss Perkins said it was ‘a life of pie’, referring to the hit film Life Of Pi. Later on, a contestant promised to produce a geometrical bake he dubbed ‘pie-thagoras’. Another said his Greek pastry would ‘throw a Spanakopita in the works’. Now in its fourth series, Bake Off  has seen its ratings grow year on year, prompting speculation it may soon move to BBC1. Yesterday electrical retailer Currys said it had seen a 65 per cent rise in sales of kitchen mixers, which it attributed to the popularity of the programme. Fans have been inspired to take to the kitchen and produce their own efforts – although care must be taken to avoid a soggy top. Something to avoid: None of the contestants on Bake Off want to be humiliated with a soggy bottom .","'Beautiful wobbles' and 'frothy peaks' ticked off by some in Bake Off bingo .

WPC Kelly Jones (pictured) filed the civil claim last year after responding to a 999 call reporting a suspected burglary . A policewoman who planned to sue the owner of a petrol station after tripping on a kerb while investigating a break-in has dropped her claim for damages. PC Kelly Jones has dropped her pursuit of damages in the hope that 'wider concerns the public may have' can be resolved, the Police Federation said today. Ms Jones faced controversy last year after she filed a civil claim against the garage owner in Thetford, Norfolk, demanding he reimburse the income she lost as a result of injuries sustained at the scene. A statement given by the Federation which represents 124,000 police officers . said today: 'Contrary to media reports at the time PC Jones was not . seeking a vast compensation payment, rather she was seeking monies that . covered the income she had lost as a result of her injury. 'She . will bear the financial loss with a hope that the wider concerns the . public might have can be resolved by government and the police service . for the future. 'This case . raised a very real issue in that police officers find themselves . financially disadvantaged when injured at work, with no other option . other than to seek financial redress just as any other employee in any . other industry would in the same circumstances.' Ms . Jones filed the claim against Steve Jones, the owner of the Nun's . Bridges Filling Station earlier this year, claiming he failed to ensure . she was 'reasonably safe' when after responding to a reported burglary. Mr . Jones and the officer were checking the outside of the building after . an alarm had gone off, when she was alleged to have fallen and hurt her . leg and wrist in August 2012. 'A victory for common sense': Mr Jones welcomed the news today that WPC Jones is dropping her claim for damages against him . Mr Jones said he was eager to move on from the ordeal which started when Ms Jones tripped on this 6in kerb at the garage in Thetford, Norfolk . The garage owner welcomed today's news describing it as 'a victory for common sense'. He told Heart Norfolk radio: 'I now wish to move on and concentrate on running my business'. The Police Federation, which represents members of the police up to the rank of chief inspector in England and Wales, funded the WPC Jones' legal costs last year. A month after she filed her claim Home Secretary Theresa May told the Federation’s annual conference that she wanted to see an end to 'frivolous' legal claims. She told delegates: 'I know that the vast majority of you are dedicated public servants of the best kind. 'But when a police officer sues a member of the public because they slipped on private property - that is simply not the sort of attitude police officers should exhibit. 'I want to work with the Federation to make sure police officers don’t make frivolous claims.'","WPC Kelly Jones has dropped her civil claim against garage owner Steve Jones .

Lawyer David Latham threw himself in front of a Tube train the day after he had warned a colleague he was going to kill himself . A partner at a top law firm who threw himself under a Tube train had warned a colleague he was going to kill himself the day before, an inquest has heard. Colleagues of David Latham, 58, a world-renowned trademark lawyer at Hogan and Lovells, had noticed he was 'inconsolable' as he worried over the fate of a big case. After weeks of sleepless nights, the father-of-three, from Kensington, west London, told a fellow partner that he was planning to kill himself but the remark was dismissed as a 'flippant comment'. The next day, on February 15 this year, Mr Latham jumped in front of a tube train in west London. His wife, Gillian Webb, told Westminster Coroner's Court more should have been done by his employers to help her husband. She said: 'If a person shows the signs as David clearly had, they should have something put in place to prevent such tragedies.' Ms Webb said Mr Latham's colleague only revealed his threat to kill himself after he had failed to show up for work the day he died. 'She said David came into the office and said I'm going to kill myself', she said. 'She said he went into the office and closed the door, which is normally lawyer-speak for ""this is important"".' Nicholas MacFarlane, another partner at the law firm, said Mr Latham was a 'perfectionist' who was beset with worries that a big case he was handling had come unstuck because of evidence problems. 'He was worried the whole thing would reflect badly on him', he said. 'He thought he had made a mistake and he was very concerned about that. Mr Latham was a world-renowned trademark lawyer at Hogan and Lovells . 'He definitely got very exercised about it, and I used the word inconsolable. However much we persuaded him that it wasn't important, he thought it was.' Mr MacFarlane said the threat to kill . himself had been dismissed as a 'flippant comment', but constant efforts . were made to reassure him the mistake did not matter and may not ever . have been discovered. He said: 'The firm is actively looking at how to give support to stressed lawyers. 'But not one of us said ""my God, he is near to the edge of suicide"". 'When he said he was going to kill himself, it was a flippant comment and unfortunately no one took any notice of it.' Ms Webb said her husband had complained of not being supported at work as the strain of the case took its toll. Westminster Coroner's Court heard how Mr Latham had struggled to sleep in the weeks before he jumped in front of a train . She said: 'The client had taken the stand and introduced evidence that wasn't in the affidavit, it had upset David and he had to go back and rewrite the affidavit and submit it to the court. 'He was very upset that it wasn't going to look good for him, but more importantly for the firm. 'I said you can't legislate for how people act on witness stand, it was out of his hands.' She said Mr Latham 'tossed and turned' at night for weeks, and had been on edge the night before he died during a Valentine's Day meal at Claridges. Mr Latham's wife Gillian Webb (pictured leaving Westminster Coroner's Court) told the hearing more should have been done by his employers to help her husband . His mobile phone received a steady stream of messages throughout the evening, she said, and he knew they were from work. 'He was looking at me, like this was supposed to be a nice meal but he knew it was communications coming through.' Ms Webb said the couple were planning to go on holiday in a week's time, and Mr Latham had promised to take her shoe shopping at the weekend before a night at the opera. But she added: 'He had trouble sleeping at night for several weeks. 'I saw him staring into space at times, and even the children noticed it at weekends.' She said she did not hear her husband leave the house early the next morning, and had no idea what he was planning. Coroner Jean Harkin ruled Mr Latham had committed suicide, after being satisfied that the balance of his mind was not affected when he died. 'It is clear that he was involved in a matter of work where he felt that he would be criticised and despite reassurances from partners and colleagues at work, he retained those thoughts', she said. 'At home he was greatly affected by events at work and felt unsupported. 'However, in evidence heard from Mr . MacFarlane, he was consistently reassured, and even leading counsel . reassured him that he hadn't done anything wrong and in any event it was . of no consequence.' She added: 'Mr Latham jumped in front of a train of his own accord. 'He was suffering from stress like . symptoms at work and he was deemed to be very worried about this case to . the point of being inconsolable, but that doesn't satisfy me that the . balance of his mind was affected.' Cambridge-educated . Mr Latham, who regularly featured in the Who's Who list of . International Trademark Lawyers, was made partner of law firm Hogan and . Lovells in 1988, just two years after joining, and ran the company's New . York office for many years. 'When he said he was going to kill himself, it was a flippant comment and unfortunately no one took any notice of it' - Nicholas MacFarlane, partner at Hogan and Lovells . The firm, with headquarters in London and Washington DC, has more than 2,500 lawyers working out of 40 offices around the world. In a statement after his death, colleagues described Mr Latham as an 'utterly charming man who was one of life's true gentlemen'. 'A likeable, modest man, David was not only an exceptional lawyer and consummate professional; he was also a great colleague, loyal partner and a friend to many at the firm', they said. 'He was one of the few people who could walk into a room and make sure he spoke to every person in it.'","David Latham had trouble sleeping for weeks as he worried about case .

So he posted his exchange with its ‘heartless’ customer service team on Facebook – and shamed the firm into an apology. Ben Fitchett, 14, had his BlackBerry with him when he fell to his death from a motorway bridge last month. Peter Fitchett, seen with son Ben, branded Orange a heartless money-grabbing profiteering company . But when his father asked Orange to . cancel the monthly bills, it refused and said he would need to pay off . the remainder of the contract – even suggesting he sold Ben’s phone to . recoup some of the cost. The . 50-year-old teacher was so furious that he posted the exchange on . Facebook under the heading: ‘Think maybe I’ve been too polite. Please . feel free to repost/share.’ Thousands . passed on the email conversation – and Orange caved in within hours, . cancelling the contract and issuing Mr Fitchett a full apology. Ben, . a hard-working student and talented musician, had just returned from an . adventure holiday in Switzerland when he fell from a bridge over the . M62 near his home in Rochdale on August 19. Police have said there are . no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death, and the matter has . been passed to the coroner. Ben Fitchett's father Peter was disgusted by the insensitive reaction of Orange, who refused to cancel his son's contract . Mr . Fitchett later contacted his local Orange shop asking for Ben’s phone . contract to be cancelled, but it refused as it had been taken out in . Peter’s name. In an email to . the network’s customer services team he complained: ‘My son’s sudden . death has been traumatic enough without this experience. It simply is . not good enough.’ He received an astonishing reply two days later from an employee who gave his name only as Joe. He . informed Mr Fitchett: ‘Unfortunately, as the contract will be under . your name and you are still able to pay for the agreement, it cannot be . cancelled. We really do appreciate the situation you are in and the very . emotional time you must be going through, but we can only offer . alternatives to your situation.’ He . suggested ‘buying out’ of the agreement, which would have cost over . £300 for a 12-month contract based on Orange’s basic BlackBerry package. The email continued: ‘Whilst we can understand you may wish to keep . your son’s phone, you could sell the handset, to offset the fee.’ Mr . Fitchett explained that police had not yet returned Ben’s handset, . adding: ‘Maybe it is in good condition after such a fall, although I . genuinely doubt it. Would you like to make me an offer?’ He . also pointed out that Orange’s shop staff had advised that the contract . be taken out in his name in the first place, due to Ben’s young age. He . suggested cuttingly: ‘Maybe you do this [so] in the eventuality of . children dying it won’t affect your profits.’ Ben was a hard working student, who enjoyed being a member of the local Explorer Scouts and a volunteer at the Beaver Scouts . Ben's father encountered trouble with Orange just days after his son's funeral when he went to a phone shop to cancel the teenager's contract . Ben Fitchett died after he was seen falling from a bridge on the M62 motorway eastbound near to junction 20 . Mr Fitchett said . yesterday: ‘The situation has been resolved but this is still a very, . very traumatic time for us.’ A . spokesman for Orange – now part of the EE network – said it had . policies for cancelling deceased users’ contracts and was investigating . why these hadn’t been followed. She . added: ‘We have been in contact with Mr Fitchett to offer our sincerest . apologies for any distress caused and can confirm that we have fully . resolved this matter with him.’ Mr Fitchett posted the emails to and from customers services on Facebook. Here are some extracts from the exchange: . My 14-year-old son has recently died, and we buried him this week... When we got his BlackBerry last year, we were advised to add him onto my account as he was a minor ... but upon trying to cancel the shop is now telling me it’s not possible and I am liable for the full term of the contract as it’s in my name!! We have been passed from pillar to post on the phone. It simply is not good enough, and I await a fairly quick reply please. Thank you, Peter Fitchett . We are extremely sorry to hear about your recent loss. Unfortunately, as the contract will be under your name and you are still able to pay for the agreement, it cannot be cancelled... There is always the buying-out of the agreement, and whilst we can understand you may wish to keep your son’s phone, you could sell the handset to offset the fee. Kindest regards, Joe . Yes, the contract is under my name, as advised by Orange. Maybe you do this [so] in the eventuality of children dying it won’t affect your profits. I’m sure my 14 year old son wasn’t really thinking about the repercussions – we would have to deal with such a heartless, money- grabbing, profiteering company – as he threw himself off a motorway bridge to commit suicide... Now, selling the handset to offset the fee. Maybe it is in good condition after such a fall, although I genuinely doubt it. Would you like to make me an offer? I suggest that you ask a SENIOR manager to contact me. I would love to hear their side of the story. I await your immediate response. P.S.

A furious row between a parish council chairman and a woman ex-chairman he was said to have mischievously enrolled on a dating website, is to be aired in public. A Crown Court judge today stepped into the harassment dispute between Councillor Douglas Staples and former councillor-turned-vigilante Marilyn Ray. The 62-year-old chairman of Enborne Parish Council, who has had a restraining order made against him to stop harassing 65-year-old Mrs Ray, successfully applied to have his conviction quashed. Here we go again: Douglas Staples has won the right to a retrial over allegations that he harassed Marilyn Ray . Judge Angela Morris agreed that Mr Staples’ guilty plea to charges of harassment should be rescinded and that he should face a retrial at magistrates’ court when all the evidence about the dating website will be heard again. The councillor successfully argued that he was given poor legal advice and was put under pressure by his former legal team into pleading guilty on the day of his trial. Judge Morris allowed his guilty plea to be vacated and ordered the case be returned to the magistrates’ court for retrial. She concluded: 'All I have read and heard in this case there is a doubt as to whether the applicant was properly informed about the nature of the charges and the nature of the offence.' A picture from a Parish Meeting in with both Marilyn Ray, seen in the centre, and Douglas Staples, right, before the harassment campaign started . The 62-year-old told Judge Morris, sitting at Reading Crown Court, that he was pushed into signing a document that stated under his own free will he had decided to enter a guilty plea. 'I didn’t want to sign it, but I signed it,' he said. 'I was pushed into signing it.' Coun. Staples is said to have fallen out with Mrs Ray after they had sat on the committee together for Enborne Parish Council, near Newbury, Berkshire. He took over as chairman from Mrs Ray but the relationship turned sour when she bombarded the council with more than 70 complaints about his behaviour and procedural council matters over a five-year period. She had resigned from her position as chairman on health grounds in January 2006 but continued to attend regular meetings in the capacity of a villager and took notes. Stormy waters: Idyllic Enborne is the scene of a intriguing web of suspected harassment . After five years of complaints Coun. Staples allegedly registered Mrs Ray of Enborne Street, with Match.com and two other dating agencies. The father-of-one also allegedly requested a fire safety assessment from the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service about Mrs Ray’s heritage-status cottage and was accused of misrepresenting their response. Both harassment incidents - which Coun. Staples had previously admitted in court - happened between October 26, 2010 and April 14, 2011. Coun. Staples of Vanners Lane, Enborne, was originally handed a bill for more than £700 pounds in fines and costs and made the subject of a restraining order. The new re-trial will be heard at Reading Magistrates’ Court for a date to be fixed.

An iconic British image known throughout the world has resumed production after being brought back from the brink by a Chinese automotive giant. The production line of distinctive black cabs began rolling again six months after the London Taxi Company (LTC) was rescued from administration by Geely. Once fully up and running the line will manufacture ten vehicles a day, five days a week. Geely said restarting the business had created 66 new jobs at LTC’s Coventry plant.

Geely chairman Li Shufu and Business Secretary Vince Cable watched the first vehicles rolling through the factory. Cable said that the Chinese firm’s investment 'has secured the future of the iconic black cabs company'. 'Geely's priority will be to re-establish the manufacture, sale and servicing of new and current vehicles on broadly the same basis as existed before the business went into administration,' Mr Li  said. 'This will include the continued assembly of the TX4 at Manganese Bronze's existing Coventry plant in the West Midlands.' The future of the Coventry-based company had previously been in doubt before the buy-out was agreed . Future: Steve Jenkins works on the assembly line inside the factory .

Detectives investigating the unsolved murder of a seven-year-old-girl who was stabbed 37 times and battered with a brick more than two decades ago are to make a fresh Crimewatch appeal tonight. Schoolgirl Nikki Allan was just seven years old when she was brutally killed just yards from her home in Sunderland in 1992 and her body dumped in a derelict warehouse. But no-one has ever been convicted of the murder and Northumbria Police hope that appearing on the BBC1 show may uncover new clues. Detective Superintendent Roger Ford, who leads the force’s Major Crime Teams, will appear on the show along with a reconstruction of Nikki's death. Nikki was found dead on October 7, 1992, in the then-derelict Old Exchange Building, near to her family home at Wear Garth, Sunderland. A number of people were arrested in connection with the investigation but no one was convicted. Detective Superintendent Ford said: 'This was an extremely brutal attack on a defenceless seven-year-old girl and 21 years after it happened it’s still talked about in Sunderland and the local area. 'Nikki’s family have been left devastated by what happened and we will never give up trying to find her killer. 'Technology and forensic investigation techniques are improving all of the time and it’s our hope that these advances along with new information from the public could lead to us finding out who murdered her. 'We want the Crimewatch reconstruction to reach as many people as possible in the hope it jogs someone’s memory, especially people who may be from Sunderland and have moved away over the years since the murder. 'We want to appeal directly to anyone who used the Old Exchange Building back in 1992. The building was a large, dark and derelict building, however we know it was used by drug takers, vagrants and local youths as somewhere to hide out. Not giving up: Nikki's mother Sharon Henderson hopes that the fresh appeal will provide new clues to help catch her daughter's killer . Heartbreak: Ms Henderson has said that she hopes her quest to find her daughter's killer would have made Nikki proud . 'Lots of people used to come and go from . the building and we want anyone who used to spend time there, for . whatever reason, to ring us and talk to us about what they remember . about the place - especially the names and details of anyone who they . know visited or spent time there.' Nikki’s mum Sharon Henderson, 48, who will also appear on the show, has spoken of her hopes that a fresh appeal could finally bring an end to her two decades of heartache. Sharon, of Ryhope, Sunderland, is reported to have said: 'I want to see the killer behind bars. 'I have never given up hope that justice will be done. I have fought for so long and I know Nikki would be proud of me.' Nikki vanished after leaving her grandparents’ flat, in Wear Garth, to walk the 150 yards to her home, on the same estate. Her shoes were discovered outside the Old Exchange building a few hundred yards away the next morning. Her body was found inside the building by a neighbour helping police with the search. The Crimewatch show will be broadcast on BBC1 at 9pm this evening.

Fun loving: Rosie Kremer pictured at her graduation from university of Cumbria in Health and Education in 2007, she was working as a nursery nurse when she died . A young mother died of an undiagnosed brain tumour six hours after her baby was born by emergency caesarean. Doctors had insisted throughout months of illness that Rosie Kremer, 24, had labyrinthitis – an inner ear infection. She lost two stone during pregnancy, was violently sick, slurred her speech and started to lose co-ordination in her limbs. Yet, according to Miss Kremer’s mother Lesley, at no point during the last two months of her life did any of the 23 doctors who looked at her case indicate that she was gravely ill. Mrs Kremer, 57, said she later learned that even an hour before her death her daughter could have made a full recovery if her condition had been correctly diagnosed and fluid had been drained from her brain. She is now suing North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust, which manages Cumberland Hospital in Carlisle. Mrs Kremer, of Penrith, Cumbria, a part-time teacher, has spoken of her daughter’s plight to promote organ donation. She helped save eight lives after her death. Miss Kremer, a nursery nurse who graduated from the University of Cumbria in health and education in 2007, began experiencing a loss of appetite, headaches, dizziness and sickness, early on in her pregnancy. She was declared brain dead at 10.30am on 29 May, 2012 at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Newcastle. She had been transferred there for the delivery after falling into a coma. Less than six hours earlier, at 4.30am, doctors had delivered her baby boy by emergency caesarean section, Bobby Peter, at 29 weeks. He weighed 2lb14oz. He was finally allowed home last August. Yesterday Mrs Kremer said  her daughter had been suffering from a haemoblastoma on the brain stem. This is not fatal and, had it been removed, she would have survived. The tumour could have been there for years, but it is believed the pregnancy accelerated its symptoms. She spent five weeks in her bedroom unable to move and her mother had to inject her with anti-coagulants. She was seen in person by 17 doctors, although the total, including phone consultations, was 23. Moving on: Lesley Kremer has stepped in to raise her grandson Bobby, 15 month, after her daughter Rosie died from an undiagnosed brain tumour just six hours after giving birth to him . Happier times: Rosie, left to right, with her mum Lesley and sisters Ruth and Jo on holiday in Lanzarote . The family said there appeared to be no communication between any of the medics and no one to oversee treatment. Mrs . Kremer said: ‘Rosie went from a beautiful, bright, vivacious girl into . someone who couldn’t move and just lay there like a vegetable. ‘Before . she died Bobby was brought to her bed and placed on her chest, so there . would at least be some contact with his mother. We took a photograph, . which is terribly harrowing but when he is older we will show it to him . to prove that he at least met his mother before she died.’ She added that the family were suing the trust because they want justice for Rosie’s son. Tragedy: The loss of Rosie's father to cancer 11 years ago made his family aware of the importance of organ donation, Rosie, pictured far left, saved the lives of eight people after her death, with her mum, Lesley, Ruth, dad Peter, and sister Jo . She . said: ‘You put your faith in people but you feel betrayed. The care . Rosie received was appalling. There was no joined-up care. There was a . note somewhere about cranial pressure, but despite all her symptoms . nobody ever diagnosed a tumour. Towards the end she was crying in pain . and begging to die. ‘Even then nobody was prepared to believe it was anything other than labyrinthitis. Mrs Kremer is bringing up Bobby as his legal guardian. His father sees him once a week.

Among the new generation of brewers is a higher number of women, known as 'brewster's . Beer lovers are enjoying a remarkable increase in choice with the establishment of hundreds of microbreweries, many of which are being opened my women. Almost 200 have opened in the past year, says the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) – and many of the latest generation of ale brewers and drinkers are young and, in many cases, female. Emma Gilleland, of brewer Marston’s, said: ‘These days brewers are far more expeimental and this has led to lighter beers with new aromas and tastes which are attracting more women.’ The number of women drinking real ale accounts for over a fifth of CAMRA’s membership, which is an increase of 20,000 over the past decade. Rather than the mass produced froth of the big brand lagers, which are . drunk cold and taste much the same, these beers are carefully crafted . and each has a unique taste. Historically, the idea of brewing beer on a small scale was the domain . of grey-haired men in cardigans, however the new generation is both . young and, increasingly, female. The rise of the small craft breweries appears contradictory when set against the fact the nation as a whole is drinking less beer, particularly in pubs. However, its success is being driven by the fact that each one offers a . different taste to consumers, who enjoy the idea of ‘real’ food and . drink from suppliers they know. Key to the brewery revival was a change in the tax laws in 2002 with the establishment the Progressive Beer Duty scheme. Under the 2002 Progressive Beer Duty scheme, brewers producing no more than 110,000 gallons per year only pay half the normal excise duty – 22p a pint rather than 44p. The editor of CAMRA’s Good Beer Guide 2014, Roger Protz, said: ‘There has been a boom in the growth of breweries over the last 12 months, resulting in a total of 1,147 breweries now producing beer in the UK - and with more breweries comes greater choice for the drinker and more opportunities to buy locally produced brews.’ In the last ten years 20,000 more women have started brewing ale in the UK, with many opening their own microbreweries . It is only in . modern times that men have overtaken women as the main brewers of beer, . as historically it was women who dominated brewing. ‘Traditionally known as ‘brewsters’, it is fantastic to see more women . rejoining the industry and in many cases giving the chaps a run for their money. One female owned and run brewery making a name for themselves nationally . is the award winning Mallinson’s brewery. Founded by CAMRA members Tara . Mallinson and Elaine Yendall at a small six barrel plant in . Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, in 2008, they moved to a larger 15 barrel . site in 2012 to help meet the growing demand. Tara said: ‘Brewing real ale is a great job, you get to experiment with . new hops, rebrew old favourites and hopefully give the people who drink . your beer a great pint.’ The number of breweries in London has doubled in the past year following the opening of 23 new establishments. On top of this one previously lost and much loved producer, the Truman Brewery, in Whitechapel, is re-opening this week after more than 20 years. Another area which has seen above average growth in breweries is West Yorkshire, with eight new starters taking the county’s total to 57 - the highest of any region in the UK. Breweries have been opened in a former dairy farm in Prestwoood, Buckinghamshire, and a converted school building in Warton, Lancashire.","Number of female brewers, or 'brewsters' has increased by 20,000 in ten years .

Casey Bowen was two decades ago dubbed ‘Pocket Money Boy’ after he was handed £60 a week by social services to deter him from a life of crime. Today came another nail in the coffin of that bizarre social experiment, as he admitted the latest in a long list of crimes. Bowen, of Churchdown, Gloucestershire, pleaded guilty at Gloucester Crown Court to a distraction burglary at an 81-year-old man’s house. 'Pocket money boy': Casey Bowen pictured leaving court in 2009, left, and in 1996, right. Despite being paid £60 a week by social services to discourage him from thieving, he today admitted his latest in a string of offences . The 33-year-old career criminal also admitted taking a car without consent and going equipped for burglary. Judge William Hart remanded Bowen in custody for a pre-sentence report. He will be sentenced on October 9 . Bowen was at the centre of a national outcry in the mid-Nineties when it emerged that social services were paying him £60 a week ‘pocket money’ in an effort to stop him committing crimes. They decided to give his family £60 a week to buy him the sorts of goods he was constantly stealing - like the latest in trainers and electronic games. He had committed a series of offences and had escaped from childrens homes all over the country when social services took the bizarre and controversial decision to pay him the allowance. The payments were revealed in the press and led to social services being condemned by politicians for paying what appeared to be a ‘reward for crime.’ Far from being steered away from the criminal lifestyle by his generous weekly allowance from the public purse Bowen went on to become a confirmed criminal in his home county. He had not long been out of prison when he committed his latest offences. In 2009 he was sentenced to five and a half years for armed robbery of a McColl’s store in Cheltenham. He hid his identity using a hood and balaclava when he burst into the store and hit a customer in the face to make him move out of the way. He then went into the office where he forced two staff, Philip Clements and Jemma Giesdorf, to open the safe. After stuffing the cash into a plastic container he made his getaway on a push bike. Today Bowen pleaded guilty to burglary on 14th July this year of a pensioner’s house in St Paul’s Street North, Cheltenham,, and theft of china, glassware and a clock. He also admitted taking a Rover 25 car on the same date and going equipped the next day with a pair of gloves. His denial of a charge of attempted burglary at a house in Southam, near Cheltenham, was not proceeded with by the prosecution. Remanded: Bowen, now 33, pleaded guilty at Gloucester Crown Court (pictured) to a distraction burglary at an 81-year-old man¿s house, as well as taking a car without consent and going out equipped for burglary . Bowen has previously absconded from children's homes all over the country, including the top-security Aycliffe home in County Durham where he got into trouble for assaulting staff. In 1996 he got his second custodial sentence in two months for a 3am burglary at the Cheltenham home of a 100-year-old woman. He stole her jewellery box and £40 and got just three months after his barrister pleaded with the judge: 'He is only just 16 and it is far too early to give up on this young man.' Aged 19, he was jailed for burgling the homes of two elderly women and was told by the judge: 'You have a dreadful record and nothing seems to have stopped you so far. 'Your own hardships are no excuse for burgling other people.' In May 2009, Bowen admitted threatening to kill police officers and their children after he stole alcohol and threatened staff at a Cheltenham supermarket. He was jailed for a week for a similar offence the previous October. In July 2005, he was jailed for a year for harassing a former girlfriend by bombarding her with 800 text messages. Asking for an adjournment for a full pre-sentence report, Lloyd Jenkins, defending, said of his client today: 'He is now showing signs of maturity. 'He was hoping to be sentenced today but he is very keen to have a report from his probation officer who is on leave until 25th September.'","Casey Bowen was beneficiary of bizarre mid-Nineties social experiment .

Lord Justice Underhill, pictured, rule that the mother had to allow her son contact with his father . A vegetarian mother refused to let her . five-year-old son have any contact with his father for more than a year . – because she feared he might feed him meat. A . judge heard that the mother  was so worried about her son’s diet that . she ‘put up the shutters’ and refused to allow him any contact with his . father. However, Lord . Justice Underhill ruled that the boy’s welfare outweighed his mother’s . fears, and warned her that her son will be sent to live with his father . if she failed to comply with the court’s decisions over parental access. The . judge, sitting at London’s Civil Appeal Court, said he was giving the . mother ‘a last opportunity’ to remain her son’s primary carer. In . August, a family judge in Bristol ordered a strict regime of contact . between father and son – including overnight and weekend visits – and . told the mother a residence order would be made in the father’s favour . if she put a foot out of line. The . mother, who is from the Bristol area, had been refusing to engage in . the court process and the father  had not seen his son for more than  a . year. The mother’s . barrister, Byron James, argued on appeal that the reintroduction of so . much contact after such a long break was ‘too sudden and too steep a . progression’ and was likely to cause both the boy and his mother . emotional harm. He said the boy’s father ‘insisted on calling him by . another name’ and that the mother had legitimate concerns that the . father would not comply with their son’s strict vegetarian diet or could . expose him to danger by failing to ensure he wore a car seatbelt. He claimed the family judge was wrong to inflict on the mother the ‘latent threat’ of her son’s removal from her home. The hearing, at the Civil Court of Appeal, sat in the Royal Courts of Justice in London . Lord . Justice Underhill recognised the bitterness between the parents and . said that it was not the court’s purpose to ‘punish’ the mother, but to . ensure that the five-year-old had a positive relationship with his . father as he grew up. Refusing the mother permission to appeal, he said there was ‘nothing even arguably wrong’ with the contact order. However disruptive the son’s reintroduction to his father might be, the family judge had been entitled to ‘take the plunge’. The . threat of the boy’s removal from his mother had had the desired effect . and, although she may not have done so willingly, she had complied with . the contact order since August, he added. Recognising . that contact between father and son had been ‘very painful and . distressing’ for the mother, the judge said he hoped there would be . ‘civilised interactions’ between the parents in the future and that . issues, including his diet, could be ‘sensibly negotiated’. He added: ‘I do, for this five-year-old boy’s sake, wish the mother and father the best in doing their best for their son.’","Mother, from Bristol area, blocked contact between her five-year-old son and his father for over a year .

A grieving mother was devastated when she tried to collect her dead son’s clothes from police, but was given a bag full of rubbish instead. Diane Down, 49, thought she was going to collect the possessions of her son Sam Down, who died aged 18 in mysterious circumstances in 2007. Sam was staying at a friend’s house when he was found slumped unconscious with a cut on his head, and was later pronounced dead. Diane Down, 49, (left) was given a sack of old rubbish seized as evidence, instead of clothes that had belonged to her 18-year-old son Sam (right) Mrs Down said receiving the bag of rubbish from police was 'heart-breaking' and 'insulting' Mrs Down was expecting to pick up the clothes her son was wearing when he died, but was instead confronted by a mess of dirty tissues, cigarette butts, grubby newspapers, food wrappers and empty cans and bottles. Bungling members of Thames Valley Police had given her a bag of rubbish from the house where he died, which was used as evidence. Mrs Down, who has fought for years to find out more about her son’s death, described the blunder as ‘heart-breaking’. The black sack of rubbish was recovered from the house where Sam died, and was given to Mrs Down by mistake . She said: ‘I’m absolutely distraught. I had plucked up the courage to finally go and pick up my son’s possessions and this is what they have given me to remember him by. ‘There is nothing here even remotely connected to my son for me to treasure. ‘I thought it was going to be his clothes and they would smell of him. It was a very personal thing for me - I wanted to be able to touch them and hold them again. The blunder was another blow to Mrs Down, who has tried for years to find out more about how her son died . ‘But they literally gave me a bag of stinking rubbish. It’s just heart-breaking.’ The police mistake came after Mrs Down, who also has four daughters had fought a six-year battle to get answers about how her son died unexpectedly in October 2007. Sam, a trainee scaffolder, was found . dead the day after a party at a friend’s house close to his family home . in Stantonbury, near Milton Keynes. An . inquest into his death heard how Sam’s friend, Elliot Cooper-Carroll, . woke up in the morning and noticed he was slumped unconscious on the . floor with a cut on his head. But Elliot and his mother did . not call an ambulance until four hours after they noticed Sam’s . injuries, the inquest heard. In the meantime, . the family had bagged up rubbish from the night before and even sat down . to eat bacon sandwiches for lunch before eventually calling 999. Eighteen-year-old Sam Down was a trainee scaffolder, and died after going to a party at a friend's house . Sam was pronounced dead as soon as he arrived at hospital. A coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death for Sam, which Diane has been fighting ever since. Mrs Down opened her own investigation . into her son’s death and even hired a private toxicology expert to . disprove that Sam had been high on drugs. The . Independent Police Complaints Commission later ruled that Thames Valley . Police had made mistakes in their original inquiry, but the case has . never been re-opened. The rubbish was collected as evidence from the house where Sam died in 2007 . Mrs Down took her case to the High Court, but it was ruled that a fresh inquest could not be held because vital forensic evidence had been destroyed. Once she had exhausted all her options to pursue answers, she asked to collect Sam’s possessions which had been left with police. Describing the moment she collected . the bag, she said: ‘The woman put it on the table and I felt the sealed . bag. I expected it to be soft because I was expecting clothes. ‘But . it felt hard so I said to her “what is it?” She said “I don’t know”. It . had Sam’s name and case number on a tag, though, so I took it. Mrs Down thought the bag contained Sam's clothes as it was labelled with his name and case number . 'I didn’t want to open it there because I wanted privacy. I know he was wearing a blue hoodie, jeans and a black Ted Baker tee shirt because I washed them all ready for him to go out that night.' 'To be given a bag of rubbish is just insulting.' Superintendent Barry Halliday apologised for the mistake, and pledged to deliver the correct package to the distraught mother. He said: 'I express my sincere apologies for this situation'. 'My staff fully understand how difficult this must be for families and all efforts are made to examine the contents fully before release but on this occasion, for understandable reasons, this was not possible. 'Having reviewed this case carefully, the police still have an item of clothing belonging to Sam and I will ensure this is delivered to Mrs Down as soon as possible.'","Diane Down, 49, wanted clothes that had belonged to her son Sam, 18 .

A scandal-hit NHS trust where up to 16 babies died because of poor care has apologised after it emerged management sent an 'insulting' email about an inquest into a child's death. Liza and Simon Brady lost their son, Alex Davey-Brady, in September 2008 asphyxiated at birth amid claims that midwives at Furness General Hospital delayed his delivery . The couple secured the release of a dossier of emails referring to the couple and the inquest into Alex's death. Tragedy: Liza and Simon Brady lost their son, Alex Davey-Brady, in September 2008 amid claims that midwives at Furness General Hospital delayed his delivery . Controversial: The hospital has apologised to the family of baby Alex, after an internal email brought the 'bad news' of his inquest . It suggests that staff at the Barrow in Furness hospital 'briefed' witnesses ahead of inquests and were concerned about bad publicity. In one memo dating back to June 18 2009, Ranu Rowan, head of legal services, said: 'I am sorry to be the bearer of bad news but I have this morning received a letter from the coroner informing me that the Davey-Brady inquest has been listed on July 2. 'This means we now have four inquests in Barrow next month which have a potential for adverse publicity (and I have a further 10 witnesses to brief in addition to the 10 I already had).' The email was sent to disgraced former chief executive Tony Halsall, medical director Peter Dyer and chief of nursing Jackie Holt. Mrs Brady said: 'Why do they need to be the 'bearer of bad news'? 'The way they write things it's like you are a number rather than an actual person or a family. 'They say 'the bearer of bad news', but to me the inquest is an opportunity to learn. 'I always knew they were very closed - but to have it in black and white is a different feeling. 'It has left my angry and asking how can we take confidence that things are being put right.' Inquiry: A probe has been launched after as many as 16 babies died in a decade within the trust running Furness General Hospital in Cumbria . The trust has a history of staff abusing grieving parents. Last year it emerged staff at the trust had made a number of cruel jibes about James Titcombe, whose son Joshua died. The trust later apologised for any distress caused by the remarks. Mr Titcombe was also subject to cruel emails on a previous occasions from midwives he had reported to the Nirsing and Midwifery Council. In a statement John Cowdall, chairman of the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'The email released to Mrs Brady under the Data Protection Act was sent in 2009 from the head of legal services to the former chief executive, medical director and director of nursing to make them aware of an upcoming inquest. 'The member of staff was highlighting the number of upcoming inquests in a short period of time, and the potential impact these could have on public and staff confidence in the trust. Prabas Misra, an obstetrician and gynaecologist at the hospital, wrote a damning letter to bosses after Alex's death alleging midwives appeared to be rejecting doctors' advice. Mr Cowdall added: 'We take each inquest very seriously and are truly sorry that the email has subsequently upset Mrs Brady and her family. 'When it was sent in 2009, the email was meant as an internal communication to ensure that senior board members were aware of the situation and the possible effect on staff and public confidence. We do not believe it was meant to belittle the importance of the inquest.'","Liza and Simon Brady lost their son, Alex Davey-Brady, in September 2008 .

Eating Disorder: Bradley Squires, five, with mum, Kerri, 23, outside Bradley's school, Dunston Primary School in Chesterfield . A five-year-old boy with a rare eating disorder has been banned from eating his required diet of mash, custard and yoghurt at school because of health and safety regulations. Bradley Squires suffers from oral hypersensitivity, which means he can only eat foods which have a smooth texture. His special requirements includes three bags of frozen mash potato and 40 yoghurts a day at a cost of £77 a week. But staff at his primary school have barred his mother Kerri, 23, from bringing in the prepared meals in a thermos flask. The unemployed mother also asked if staff could put together the specific meals in the school kitchen, but they refused the request because teachers have not had 'appropriate hygiene training'. Miss Smith, who lives in Chesterfield, said: 'We came across a thermos flask and it would keep the food at the same temperature but they said it was a health and safety issue. 'Just letting him take it in a thermal flask could change Bradley’s life and change mine.' She has been forced to make and deliver Bradley’s lunch to Dunston Primary School in Chesterfield everyday for more than a year. Miss Smith has made more than 200 trips to the school, costing more than £4,000 a year, and thought she had found a solution with a heated thermos flask. The youngster is violently sick if he . eats anything lumpy and was advised by doctors to eat mashed potato for . lunch everyday at school. His illness is so bad that he is sometimes sick when he sees other people chewing food. Her son's everyday needs has also meant she has not been able to find a job and is struggling to pay for the food as a result. She added: 'I am angry and upset because I have been doing this for years for nothing. 'I had to make him sandwiches that he wouldn’t eat and then he had to come home for dinner. 'This has made me and Bradley suffer for two years because he has not been doing the same as the other children. 'It’s just really hard, it has been a struggle. Special Diet: Bradley Squires, 5, can only eat frozen mash potato, Amrbosia custard and yogurt . 'His food costs me so much and I’m not getting any help. 'I’m angry, upset and disappointed with the school as I think they could have been more helpful and supportive.' Kerri got a letter from the headteacher at the end of last term saying it was ‘not appropriate for the school to prepare food’ and it did not have a ‘facility appropriate to meet all the safety standards for food preparation and storage.’ Letter: Bradley's primary school have said it would 'not be appropriate' to prepare food for his specific diet because the school does not have the facilities and staff have not received the correct training . The letter stated: 'It is not appropriate for the school to prepare food as has been requested by yourself.” Staff do not have the hygiene training to prepare Bradley’s lunches, it added. Miss Smith said: 'It costs me £11 a day. He can eat up to 40 yogurts and three bags of Aunt Bessie’s frozen mash a day. School gates: Staff at Dunston Primary, Chesterfield, have said Bradley already has food he likes in his packed lunch and it did not require his mother to bring in mashed potato . 'I can’t buy myself any shopping. 'It’s ridiculous the amount of money it costs to feed him. 'I’m having to live off cheap foods such as noodles and soup. I am spending more than I have got coming in.' Bradley has suffered from allergies and psychological eating difficulties since he was a baby and has constantly been in and out of hospital. 'Some days he is really weak and poorly through it and others he eats constantly,' Miss Smith added. 'I just worry about his health. I worry that he is going to be weak. Hypersensitivity . is characterised by reactions to specific sensations such as food . touching the back of the throat, causing a gag reflex. It makes feeding very uncomfortable and unpleasant for children, . Hypersensitivity . may also cause other reactions in the body, such as, muscle stiffening which limits the bodies movement . patterns. Children with severe or long term hypersensitivity may develop adverse reactions to feeding. For example, the sight of a spoon may cause a spasm or turning of the head, the smell of food may cause a gag reflex. Some children may also develop responses to meal times and refuse all food, regardless of whether they touch or taste it. 'He only tried mashed potato because the texture was so smooth. If he finds a lump he would be sick. 'From the age of two-and-half he has eaten nothing but mashed potato, fromage frais and custard. The single mum goes through a gruelling daily routine in a bid to improve Bradley’s relationship with his food. 'He tries to touch it, feel it and smell it and I am trying to get him to handle food every day,' she said. 'I was hoping they would have sent me a letter to arrange something for the start of the new term. 'Someone needs to help us because me and Bradley will be homeless if they don’t. If they don’t give me the decision I need at the school I can’t get a job. 'If they don’t say that they can cook his food on site then I don’t know what I am going to do.' Bradley has to go to Chesterfield Royal Hospital regularly, where his condition is monitored. He is given iron and vitamin supplements to help his diet and cannot be referred for mental health treatment until he is seven. 'It has taken three-and a-half-years to get him to bite a custard cream. If the biscuit is broken he won’t eat it.' Dunston Primary and Nursery School acting headteacher Paul Burgess said: 'We’ve been working closely with this child’s family to accommodate his special dietary needs and will arrange a meeting with them to try to resolve the issue.' Miss Smith now hopes to resolve the issue in a meeting with the school.","Bradley Squires suffers from eating disorder called oral hypersensitivity .

Miss Burch, from Havant, Hampshire, said: 'Sophie and I were playing in the pool when a young male lifeguard told me I had to take the top off. 'I was a lifeguard for eight years so when I was told to take the vest off I knew it was nothing to do with health and safety. 'I took it off anyway because I didn’t want to have an argument, but the next moment two other women walked in with vests and full-length leggings. Miss Burch, a former lifeguard, said she was humiliated but obeyed the lifeguard's order so she could stay with her daughter in the pool . 'I asked another lifeguard why they were allowed and he said it was on religious grounds. 'He said the only way you were allowed to wear extra clothes was on medical or religious grounds. I was 32 weeks' pregnant. 'I complained and put the top back on, but the supervisor said I couldn’t wear it and I had to take it off again for health and safety reasons. 'I felt very humiliated and embarrassed. I don’t want to come across as racist but I don’t see why there should be one rule for them and one for me. 'It's definitely discrimination and I don’t think it’s fair.' The incident happened at the Pyramids Centre in Southsea, Hampshire. Miss Burch, a school cook, said: 'I was totally humiliated and embarrassed. Gary Milne, the chief operating officer of the Pyramids Centre, said common sense should have been applied to Miss Burch's situation . 'I wore the top because even my tankini did not cover everything. The vest top is a maternity vest top. Miss Burch is not the only person to be ordered to follow health and safety rules. Mother Stephanie Wilby was humiliated when pool staff threatened to throw her out of a pool unless she stopped breastfeeding her baby. The 22-year-old was in the water from her waist down feeding her four-month-old son Leo in the corner of a toddler pool as other children and their parents splashed about. When Mrs Wilby, who was in the pool with husband Alan and 17-month-old daughter Harmonie, asked why, she claims she was told it was not hygienic. Bosses at the state-of-the-art Manchester Aquatics Centre, a training venue for last year's Olympics and Paralympics, have apologised about the incident in August. 'I know I’m not the first person this has happened to at the swimming pool - I've got friends who were trying to cover up just days before giving birth. 'This was very unfair. 'I wouldn't have worn the top if I wasn’t pregnant and I wanted the pool to show a little bit of discretion.' Miss Burch is due to give birth to hers and partner Tony Saunderson's baby girl on October 25. Gary Milne, the chief operating officer of the Pyramids Centre, said policy only permits swimwear in the pools, except for bona fide medical reasons or on religious grounds. Mr Milne said: 'In these circumstances, the swimmer is made aware of the potential risks and even in these cases if the lifeguard is not satisfied that it is safe to continue, then they will not permit this. 'The swimmers’ safety is always the first concern.' But he added that common sense needed to be used and Miss Burch’s situation seemed 'perfectly reasonable' and the incident will be investigated. He added: 'We would like to apologise for any upset caused to Miss Burch.'","Amanda Burch, 41, wore a vest to cover her 32-week pregnancy bump .

A 12-year-old girl has been banned from class after shaving her head for charity - because the drastic style was against school rules. Charlotte Duggan raised £1,000 to have her hair chopped off for Breast Cancer Campaign after being inspired by her own grandmother's successful battle with the deadly disease nine years ago. She returned to school in Basingstoke, Hampshire expecting to be praised for her selflessness, but instead was left 'upset' and 'humiliated' when teachers banished her into isolation for two days. Charlotte was also prohibited from mixing with her classmates and going out at lunch and breaktimes - with teachers at Cranbourne Business and Enterprise College allowing her only a brief trip to the canteen.

Detectives investigating the 20-year-old murder of grammar school girl Claire Tiltman are searching a house today as part of the on-going case. Claire, 16, was stabbed to death in an alleyway in January 1993 as she went to a friend’s house to study in Dartford, Kent. The youngster was stabbed in a frenzied attack and she staggered out onto a main road where she collapsed. She was seen by a passer by who raised the alarm. She died at the scene. Despite a huge police investigation, Claire’s killer has never been brought to justice. Kent Police announced today they were carrying out a search warrant on a house in Stone, near Dartford, Kent. It is thought the address was where Colin Ash-Smith lived at the time of Claire's murder. Ash-Smith was questioned by Police in 1993 but never charged. No arrests have been made during the current investigation. A Kent Police spokesman said: 'Officers from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate Cold Case Investigation Team conducted a search warrant at an address in Myrtle Place, Stone, near Dartford, Kent, on Thursday September 12 as part of their on-going enquiries into the historic murder of Claire Tiltman. 'It is standard practice that undetected murders such as Claire’s will be reviewed regularly. The activity on Thursday September 12 is part of that ongoing review.' Investigation: Police today search a house in Myrtle Place, Stone, in connection to the murder of Clare Tiltman . Inquiry: The house is thought to . be where Colin Ash-Smith lived at the time of Claire's murder. Mr Ash-Smith was questioned after Claire's death but never charged . Early this morning, five police vans arrived at the property, which is in a quiet cul-de-sac, and forensic officers began their search. Neighbour James Monks, 65, a retired salesman said: 'I looked outside at about 8am and saw all these police vans parked outside, then more and more police turned up. 'I've no idea what was happening but now I know it's to do with Claire Tiltman.' Throughout the morning, police removed several evidence . bags and put them into the back of a police van at the semi-detached . cottage-style property. The father of Colin Ash-Smith still lives in the house, but there is no suggestion any of the occupants are under suspicion. Today, . Aubrey Ash-Smith, stuck two fingers up to reporters who were gathered . outside his house and said: 'The police have searched here twice before. I wish they would stop hounding us and leave us alone.' Evidence: Officers take several bags from the property during the raid . Search: Boxes of evidence are taken from the semi-detached property earlier today . Mr Ash-Smith also protested his son's innocence. Claire’s parents Cliff and Linda never gave up hope their daughter’s killer would be convicted. Linda died from cancer in 2008 aged 56 and Cliff died of cancer in September last year aged 63. Claire was their only child. Family: Aubrey Ash-Smith outside the house police investigated this morning . Speaking from his bed in a nursing home in January 2012, Mr Tiltman said: 'It would mean everything to me to find out, after all these years, who did this to Claire. 'It has been a long time, but I’ve never given up hope and never will. 'I can’t begin to put into words how this has affected our family. 'Claire has gone and her mum has gone - there is now only me.' Kent Police said that no arrests have been made today. The force marked the 20th anniversary of Claire's murder in January this year with a renewed appeal for information. Loss: Linda and Cliff Tiltman, the parents of Claire pictured here at the time of her death in 1993, died not knowing the killer of their daughter . Chief Superintendent Neil Jerome, the divisional commander for North Kent was a police constable on patrol in Stone when Claire was killed. He said in January: 'I remember getting the initial call and being told it was an accident that had happened. 'Obviously when we arrived at the scene things quickly changed to a serious assault. 'There was very little to go on in the early stages, . 'I was tasked to look around the neighbourhood to see if there was anyone around, anyone covered in blood, any witnesses, but there was nothing.' Scene: An archive photograph taken in 1993 shows bunches of flowers left at the place of Claire's murder in Dartford, Kent . He added he was also on duty during Claire's funeral and believes there is someone out there who knows what happened to her. He said: 'A huge amount of effort went into those early stages, it was a busy night, an area which would have mainly been used by local people. 'It's sad that an entire family has been wiped out. Claire's parents have gone to their graves not knowing who killed their daughter. 'There must be witnesses who haven't come forward, who are getting older now. Do they want to go to their graves with that vital piece of information?' Location: A photograph taken in 1993 of a police tape cordon at the scene the scene of Claire's murder . Claire's best friend Lisa Gribbin, who said Claire was often known as Tilt, said: 'We have a strong feeling that with both Claire's parents now gone, there is a need to carry on the fight to find her killer and finally get some justice for our dear friend. 'My eldest daughter has just turned 16 and I look at her and realise just how young Tilt was and how much she had taken away from her and her family and also us as her friends. She had her whole life ahead of her. 'You can never get over or forget what happened. Your life is forever changed. 'Our hope is that the person who knows what happened on that day will come forward allowing Claire, Lin and Cliff to finally get justice and for Tilt's murderer to be punished for taking her life so cruelly and destroying her family. Search: Officers search for clues near to the site of Claire's death a few days after her murder . To mark the 20th anniverary of Claire's murder, Detective Superintendent Rob Vinson from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate who is leading the cold case investigation into Claire's murder said: 'I have always maintained that the killer was a local person and that someone knows who he or she is. 'Last year, a good man [Cliff, Claire's father] went to his grave without ever seeing justice being served for the murder of his only daughter. 'This isn't the end of our investigation; we have always maintained that someone has information about this murder and we will continue to investigate it. 'I hope that this event may prompt someone to finally come forward with the key piece of information that we need to identify Claire's killer and help us bring this case to a successful conclusion.'","Claire Tiltman, 16, stabbed to death in an alleyway in Dartford, Kent .

Bravery: Gary O'Donnell won his medals for his exceptional bravery as he defused Taliban bombs, his widow Toni has now taken the equally courageous decision to sell his medals to provide for their children . Warrant Officer O’Donnell left wife . Toni and four children – teenagers Cayleigh and Dylan from a former . marriage and Toni’s children Aidan and Ben, who was just eight weeks old . when his father died. Now Mrs O’Donnell, 44, has made the difficult decision to sell the unique set of awards. The . heroism of bomb disposal experts such as Warrant Officer O’Donnell was . captured in the Oscar-winning film The Hurt Locker. His medals are . expected to fetch £60,000. Pierce . Noonan, of auctioneers Dix Noonan Webb, said: ‘Her reasons for selling . the medals are simply that she has a young family to provide for. ‘It has been an extremely difficult . decision for her but because the value of them is between £50,000 and . £60,000 the money is more useful to her and her family now. 'The medals are unique as they are the only George Medal and Bar to be awarded to a servicemen in the modern era.’ Warrant . Officer O’Donnell’s first honour came in 2006 for ‘persistent courage’ in Iraq and the second award was made for two incidents in Afghanistan. In . May 2008 he worked nine hours to defuse eight devices in 40°C heat and . in July he spent 24 hours defusing 11 Taliban bombs, one of which was . triggered as he approached it but failed to go off.

I wouldn’t have changed what he did because it . made him who he was. I’m so proud of him.’ When . the posthumous award was made in 2009, Lieutenant General Sir Graeme . Lamb said Warrant Officer O’Donnell was ‘brave as a lion’. He said 'Gary O’Donnell was extremely brave . but what you have to bear in mind with bomb disposal experts is that it . is pre-meditated bravery, not on the spur of the moment. 'It must be a long and lonely walk for these people to make knowing that it could be the last thing they do.' WO . O’Donnell, from Edinburgh, was part of the Royal Logistics Corps’ elite . bomb disposal unit and served in Sierra Leone before going to Iraq in . 2006. He won his first . George Medal - the second highest award for gallantry not in the face of . the enemy - for his persistent courage in defusing numerous bombs. Warrant Officer Gary O'Donnell had an astonishingly successful career as an army bomb disposal expert prior to his death in Afghanistan in September 2008 .

The . citation for his second George Medal – the second highest award for . gallantry not in the face of the enemy – stated that Warrant Officer . O’Donnell was flown into a convoy after its bomb disposal operator . collapsed exhausted. It . read: ‘The convoy was stationary and vulnerable. Without hesitation . O’Donnell deployed to the scene of an IED and rendered it safe. ‘Over the next 24 hours, under increasing pressure and immense fatigue, he rendered safe a total of 11 IEDs.

"By . Associated Press and Alex Greig . PUBLISHED: . 13:02 EST, 12 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:23 EST, 12 September 2013 . An Ohio woman has been arrested for inventing her four-year-old son's cancer diagnosis and convincing the boy and others that he was dying, to scam donations, gifts and attention from good Samaritans. Authorities say Emily Creno-King, 31, pretended to friends, family, and strangers alike that her son JJ was dying of cancer, and shaved his head and made him wear a surgical mask to perpetuate the lie. Creno-King, of Utica, is charged with felony child endangerment and could face additional charges when her case is submitted before a grand jury. Master deceiver: Emily Creno-King managed to fool everyone except a fellow mother whose child really does suffer from cancer . The mother-of-two began soliciting donations, ostensibly to help her manage with the costs of her son's illness, in December 2012. Numerous Facebook groups, including Champions for the Creno Family, were set up to update followers on the child's condition and encourage donations for the single mother. The page contains a lengthy description of King's trials and her selflessness. In 2012, says the third-person description, she left her husband to 'save the lives of her and her children.' 'Emily has been so brave, courageous, and a true fighter during her struggle. She has a drive that only a mother fighting for her children can have, and it shows through every moment of every day... Through it all, Emily has not once asked for material or monetary donations, only prayers,' it reads. Medical abuse: Creno-King subjected her son to rigorous medical testing including more than 20 blood tests, even though he was perfectly healthy . Not sick: Court records state that Creno-King's son never suffered any discernible illness . Detective Damian Smith told NBC4 that many concerned people became involved with Creno-King following the revelations her son's lung tumors. Smith said that when people who had suffered similar traumas began to ask her questions she couldn't answer, she would remove them from the Facebook group. Sick: Emily Creno-King played the part of the selfless single mother, when in reality she was duping generous people out of money and gifts and letting her small son believe he was desperately ill . The father of Creno-King's children John Creno says he wasn't sure about his son's illness - evidence of which he'd never witnessed - but that his estranged wife managed to pull the wool over his eyes too. 'There was always a doubt in my mind,' Creno told NBC4. 'But once all the medicines started coming with him on weekends, I thought, ""Ok, he really does have it.""' The medications Creno is referring to were given to the four-year-old to treat the seizures Creno-King alleged he was having. The ruse was discovered when a mother whose child really is suffering from cancer made contact with Creno-King. During subsequent correspondence, she became suspicious that Creno-King was lying about her son's illness and contacted the authorities. Utica detectives received confirmation from several doctors at Nationwide Children's Hospital that Creno-King's claims were fraudulent. The Newark Advocate reports that . Creno-King repeatedly brought her son to the the Nationwide Children's . Hospital claiming he was suffering seizures and breathing difficulty. Court . papers state: 'Each time [the child] was brought into the hospital, . staff was unable to find any signs or symptoms of medical distress.' According to the hospital, Creno-King's son is the victim of medical child abuse by his mother - not cancer. '[JJ] always begs me to tell the doctor to please take [the medication] away; and now I can finally tell him the doctor's going to be taking it away. He's out running and playing. He doesn't have to have a mask on anymore and he's thrilled about that because he hated the mask,' Creno told NBC4 . The Newark Advocate reports that Creno didn't comment in court Wednesday as her bond was set at $50,000. Court records listed no attorney for her. She was also forbidden from having unsupervised contact with her son during the hearing. According to NBC4, Creno-King is undergoing a mental health evaluation at a Dublin treatment center. It is unknown whether this is a case of Münchausen Syndrome by proxy, a well-documented disorder in which parents make their children ill for attention. The prosecutor wouldn't discuss the possibility of more charges. Authorities say the alleged hoax began late last year. Another Facebook page was set up for Creno-King's children following the revelations. According to that page, the two children are currently in the care of their paternal grandfather.","Emily Creno-King, 31, told friends, family and strangers that her son was suffering cancer .

Planning minister Nick Boles said areas such as the Lake District, Snowdonia and Dartmoor were in danger of becoming ¿embalmed¿ . Strict planning rules protecting national parks are to be reviewed, after a minister claimed that beauty spots are being turned into ‘museum pieces’. Planning minister Nick Boles said areas such as the Lake District, Snowdonia and Dartmoor were in danger of becoming ‘embalmed’ because of the special planning laws that have protected them from unsightly developments for decades. Mr Boles told MPs yesterday he was asking his officials to ‘work up proposals’ for reform following complaints from developers and business that planning rules in national parks are an ‘obstacle’ to economic recovery in the countryside. He wants to examine ‘the balance between growth, economic and social development and the protection of the landscape, and whether current legislation properly captures what we are trying to achieve’. Rural campaigners last night accused Mr Boles of ‘peddling misconceptions’ about national parks – and warned he would have a fight on his hands if he attempted to tear up their special protections. His comments will also alarm the millions who visit the country’s 15 national parks. Mr Boles has infuriated campaigners – and irritated many Tory MPs – with a string of outspoken comments on the planning system. Within weeks of being appointed in September last year, he attacked the National Trust and others as ‘latter-day Luddites’ for opposing all building on the Green Belt. In November, he suggested two million acres of greenfield land would have to be sacrificed to satisfy housing demand, almost half of it driven by immigration. Speaking in the Commons yesterday, Mr Boles said it was right that national parks had ‘slightly different’ planning rules in recognition of their status as ‘some of the most beautiful parts of the country’. But there was a ‘danger of making rural communities into museum pieces, not so much protected as embalmed’. The comments made by Nick Boles will also alarm the millions who visit the country¿s 15 national parks . ‘That applies to many communities within national parks – they will retain their life and appeal only if they are allowed to change and develop, and if people can get jobs and set up businesses. ‘That is a necessary underpinning to national parks, not just as wildernesses, but as living, breathing sets of communities.’ National parks have their own planning authorities which are exempt from the sweeping planning reforms brought in by the Coalition in a bid to boost growth. Emma Marrington, of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, condemned Mr Boles’s comments and warned against any change to protections afforded to national parks. She said national parks received 90million visitors a year, generating more than £10billion in revenue. She added: ‘These figures suggest that instead of national park status being a block to small businesses, they attract more money into the local economy. ‘Far from national park being museum pieces, they are exemplars of sustainable development. ‘Many of the misconceptions being peddled in the debate today – and there were quite a few – were not based on the evidence. ‘They were an assault on the essence of what makes our national parks special.’","Planning minister Nick Boles said areas such as the Lake District, Snowdonia and Dartmoor were in danger of becoming ‘embalmed’

Sadly, the zero-carbon building is not quite as sustainable as the designers had hoped. 'One of the greenest schools in Britain': Dartington Primary School's eco-building, near Totnes in Devon, needs 'significant' repairs just three years after opening because it has been leaking water . In fact, thanks to a series of water . leaks and mouldy walls, pupils are now being taught in tents erected in . the school grounds.

The new site was . praised for being ‘stunning’ and ‘extremely environmentally friendly’. Its design featured four buildings made from ‘sustainable’ timber, with . solar panels providing electricity and heat. The roof was supposedly . weather-proofed with strips of sweet chestnut grown nearby and angled so . rainwater could be collected and used to flush the toilets.

Tania Mountney, whose son attends the school, said: ‘There’s . been leaking there ever since it opened.

Heartbreak: Natalie Griffiths, pictured with a photograph of murdered Steven Paynter, spent 10 years searching for her father . A daughter who spent ten years looking for her long-lost father finally found him - just four days after he was murdered. Natalie Griffiths, 24, last saw her father Steven Paynter, 46, when she was four years old following the breakdown of her parents' marriage. For years, the shopworker from Bridgend, South Wales, trawled through online databases for any information about her father - and she was thrilled when a member of her family finally managed to locate him. But tragically Natalie discovered he had been murdered just four days before. Natalie said: 'Finding out where he was should have been a happy moment - I’d dreamed about how it would be. 'I’d wanted to know for so long but the reality was a bitter shock. 'I was heartbroken to know he was murdered.' Steven, known as Taffy to friends, left the family home in 1993. Natalie said: 'I was only little but I remember him playing outside with me and carrying me on his shoulders. He was a good dad. 'I was so desperate for answers. Why didn’t he visit? How could he just leave? 'As a teenager I saw all my friends with their dads and knew I was missing out on something. 'I tried everything I could to find dad, starting on Facebook and with family. I just wasn’t getting anywhere. Family: Steven, left, moved out of the family home in 1993 when Natalie, pictured as a newborn with her mother and father right, was just four years old. He moved 60 miles away following his marriage breakdown . Natalie asked all her relatives if they had any ideas or clues where her father - who was also known as Wayne - had moved. And she was excited when her aunt Joanne Griffiths asked to see her with information about her father. Her aunt told her that Steven had moved 60 miles away to Hereford - but had tragically been found dead and police were trying to track down his next of kin. On August 7 police confirmed that jobless Steven had been murdered at an address in Hereford on August 3. Natalie, who was forced out of work because of the ordeal, said: 'I just couldn’t believe it. It felt I had been kicked in the stomach.'Grieving Natalie was then faced with organising a funeral for the father she had barely known as an adult. Grief: Natalie was forced to leave her job after she was told about her father's murder . Natalie said: 'I wanted to do it for him as a goodbye. 'I met friends of his at the funeral who told me I’d never been far from his thoughts - they reassured me that he talked about me all the time. 'That was nice but I’d have rather heard it from him. I will never know the answers now.' Police were called to reports of an attack at a house in Hereford on August 3. Three people have been remanded in custody charged with the murder of the former factory worker.

But far from being a bunch of thoughtless thugs, these revellers were actually public-spirited Good Samaritans who were repairing a damaged rack. The high-spirited group were caught on CCTV repairing a broken bike rack after a night out - using a team effort to heave the stand back into place. Scroll down for video . All together! The group of lads abandon their takeaways to try and pull back the severely bent bike rack . Heave-ho! The group can be seen gritting their teeth as they embark on their good deed . The damage had been reported to the council but the young men stepped in before it was repaired - and one ended up completely beneath it as he strained to pull it back to its original shape . The rack, which had been damaged for several weeks, caught their attention as they queued for Kebabs in Boston Market Place in the early hours of the morning. Footage shows the group putting down their take aways and planning a repair strategy, before using their muscles to unbend the thick metal hoop which had been damaged when a car reversed into it. The group can be seen discussing their tactics before spending almost 13 minutes straightening the metal hook at 3am.

'We are both cyclists and had noticed it hadn't been fixed for a few weeks, we were a bit inebriated, so decided to mend it. 'We started pulling it this way and went ""this isn't happening"", so we tried various ways and put our legs into it. 'The feedback we have had has been ridiculous. Random people have sent us messages saying well done. Its come as a bit of a shock.

The grieving parents of a policeman killed by a yob whilst out celebrating his birthday told today how the tragedy had robbed them of their lives as well. PC Gareth Francis, 28, hit his head on the cobbles of a pavement after he got inadvertently caught up in a petty feud and was struck with a single punch in the street. The off-duty officer was knocked unconscious by the force of the impact and died later in hospital from fatal head injuries. Westley Holland, 21, (left) killed PC Gareth Francis, 28, (right) who was out celebrating his birthday, with a single  punch and then played Xbox. Holland is today beginning a four-and-a-half-year jail term for manslaughter . His killer Westley Holland, 21, who played an Xbox computer game after the fatal attack in Stockport, told a friend: 'I have just hit the lad, I think I have killed him.' When police caught up with him he falsely blamed Greater Manchester PC Francis for the tragedy and said: 'So that guy has died has he, what do you expect when they front you up? I’m not gonna stand there am I?' Today as Holland began four-and-a-half-years in jail after being convicted of manslaughter, PC Francis' parents Roy and Rita, both 55, said even 1,000 years in jail would not be enough. In a statement they said: 'In one single punch, a solitary criminal act and a moment of madness, Westley Holland not only took Gareth’s life but he took ours too. 'Life as we knew it also died that terrible night because our lives have never been the same since. 'In fact we consider our lives in two separate entities; life before Gareth died and life after. There are few similarities between the two. Life before Gareth died was perfect. 'The life we have now is the polar opposite of this perfection. It is so extreme it hardly bears resemblance to our ‘before Gareth died’ life. It feels like it has all gone. 'Everything we did revolved around our family. The drive we had in life was all to do with providing for our children and now that drive has gone because our family has lost its key component, our only son. A police tent at the scene in Stockport, where off-duty police officer Gareth Francis, 28, was killed after being punched by Westley Holland, 21 . 'We accept no sentence passed can ever bring Gareth back but we needed to see some justice done. 'We understand the sentence can’t be 1,000 years in prison and even if it was it would not provide even an ounce of comfort because our grief is too intense for any relief. We are simply inconsolable. 'We want Westley Holland to realise the very great human cost and catastrophic lifelong consequences for those left to grieve, of a split second decision to throw one single punch which took the life of our beautiful son.' The tragedy occurred on January 20 after PC Francis who worked for Greater Manchester Police based at West Didsbury and described as a 'consummate professional police officer' had gone out to celebrate his birthday with friends. The group were about to go home at the end of the evening after being dropped off by taxi when one of the officer’s friends James Bell bumped into Holland by chance. Bell and Holland were said to have a 'long history of ill feeling' and began eyeballing each other before violence broke out. The coffin of PC Gareth Francis, who was described as a 'consummate professional police officer', is escorted to St George Church in Stockport . Holland lashed out and 'used his fist in anger' upon PC Francis who was looking on as 'his way of having the last word,' said prosecutors at Manchester Crown Court. In their statement PC Francis’ father, a director of an electrical company added: 'We were present as our son’s last moments were played out in public in court on CCTV, we have listened as our son’s killer told lies after lies. 'I have had to watch my wife and daughter’s pain as we struggle as a family to comprehend how someone can kill such an amazing man and then go and play on a Playstation game - entirely indifferent to the fact that our beautiful Gareth lay dying in the street where he left him. 'It is the height of disrespect. Our loss is so great that we can never forgive him.' Sir Peter Fahy, Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police (far left), and colleagues at the funeral of PC Gareth Francis at St George Church in Stockport . Holland was arrested at a friend’s home at 4.25am, just over three hours after PC Francis’ collapse. He said he had been playing the Xbox game to 'take his mind off the fight'. During the trial he denied unlawful killing claiming he feared PC Francis was about to attack him when he threw the fateful punch. He told the jury: 'He was coming at me. It could have been me on the floor. I thought he was going to hit me, it could have been me. I acted in self-defence. He come at me and I threw a punch.' But passing sentence Judge Michael Henshell told him: 'Gareth was a much loved son and his parents were at the stage of their life where they expect they would watch him develop as an adult and live a successful and fruitful life. 'The whole family has been devastated by his death and you caused it. You meant to strike him and the consequences were tragic. You wanted to take advantage of the surprise attack and you did. He was hit unawares. 'You have a capacity for confrontation and aggressive behaviour which was demonstrated in this case. You did not intend the harm but the harm was of the highest level. There was no remorse evident during the trial.' After the case Charlotte Rimmer, District Crown Prosecutor for CPS North West said: 'Westley Holland’s violent actions caused the needless death of Gareth Francis, whose chosen career was to dutifully serve the public as a police officer. 'This case demonstrates just how much damage one punch can cause, and although no outcome can compensate Gareth’s family and friends for their devastating loss.' Senior Investigating Officer Duncan Thorpe of Greater Manchester Police said: 'The consequences of what Holland did have been devastating for both Gareth’s family, his partner, friends and for his colleagues in the police force. 'His single punch has led to a tragic waste of a young life and he will now spend the rest of his life living with the consequences. 'This case once again demonstrates the dreadful outcomes possible when people try to settle disputes with their fists.'","PC Gareth Francis, 28, had been out celebrating his birthday .

John Major, Theo Paphitis and Chris Moyles all started their successful careers from the humble beginnings of doing the office tea rounds. But those now entering the world of work spend up to an hour every day getting coffee and tea for their superiors, new research has revealed. A study showed that the average graduate worker spends a total of five hours every week making coffee and tea for their colleagues. Graduates starting out spend around 258 hours per year – 12 per cent of their time at work - making hot drinks for other members of staff. And employees in the north have a rougher deal, with graduates in Yorkshire dedicating more than seven hours a week to getting drinks – amounting to nearly one working day per week. But in Scotland graduates spent almost half as long – around three hours each week - fetching teas in the workplace. The survey showed men spent longer than women making hot beverages. But it was unclear whether they did more rounds or simply took longer ferrying drinks than their female colleagues. When not making tea, research by Allianz Insurance revealed graduates are often expected to perform administrative duties such as photocopying and diary keeping. Each year graduates spend 334 hours scanning and printing documents and 346 hours on tasks like taking minutes in meetings. Amanda Haig, of Allianz Insurance, said a positive attitude is important for getting ahead in the workplace but that employers should not overlook the abilities of their graduate members of staff. She said: ‘It’s important that graduates are given opportunities that stretch them as individuals but getting along with colleagues and showing a willingness to get stuck in can see graduates go far.’ Tea boys: Former Prime Minister John Major, left, and businessman Theo Pathitis, right, both began their successful careers doing office tea rounds .","Study finds that graduates starting out spend 258 hours a year making tea .

A shop owner has been jailed after he enticed underage schoolgirls to parties at his office he called 'Aladdin’s Cave' and plied them with drink and drugs. Ala Uddin - known to friends as Aladdin - paid a 15-year-old girl in cannabis to do chores such as ironing for him - and offered others the chance to deal drugs for him, a court heard. Businessman Uddin, 32, enticed the 'vulnerable' teenage girls - all known by social services - to his office he called Aladdin’s Cave. He was jailed for four years for drugs offences but cleared by a jury of rape and sexual assault on the girls. Uddin, from Cardiff, South Wales, began bringing the girls to his office after having a brief affair with one of their mothers. Judge Stephen Hopkins QC told him: 'That relationship lasted no more than weeks but somewhat bizarrely you kept in Facebook contact with the daughter - who would then have been 13 or 14. 'She took to calling at your business to see you and so did friends of hers. They were all vulnerable and had troubled lives. 'You were exploiting that by allowing them to come there and providing them with drink, usually spirits, and offering drugs. 'Later you would deny it and say they were all lying.' Cardiff Crown Court heard a teenage girl was 'paid' in cannabis to do chores such as ironing . Uddin asked one 15-year-old if she wanted to supply drugs to others for him and said they would split the profits - but she refused. Cardiff Crown Court heard another was 'paid' in cannabis to do chores such as ironing. Judge Hopkins said: 'They were enticed with the promise of alcohol and drugs and the premises became a magnet. 'The reason why you allowed them to come is not clear, but in my view was certainly inappropriate and more likely, sinister.' Christopher Rees, defending, said Uddin had not corrupted the vulnerable schoolgirls into drug taking because all were already using illegal substances. Mr Rees said: 'He never behaved inappropriately towards these girls or towards others in their presence.' Uddin was found guilty of three offences of offering to supply drugs and one of encouraging an offence by making the drug dealing request. He was also convicted of possessing both cannabis and amphetamine with intent to supply. Uddin had been charged with rape and sexual assault on the girls but was cleared after a trial. Judge Hopkins told Uddin his offences were aggravated by the fact the girls were all young and vulnerable - as their social services files confirmed. Uddin was jailed for four years and a Proceeds of Crime hearing will be held at the end of the year.

The BBC is under growing pressure to fire its director of human resources after she was accused of lying to MPs about the severance pay scandal. Lucy Adams, who earns £320,000 a year, said she could not recall using the word in a leaked email which was discussed at the Commons Public Accounts Committee this week. But when asked if she had used the term, Adams replied: 'I may have used the term by means of an incentive to get a swift resolution.' Adams has already said she will leave the BBC in April but there are calls for her resign now. Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘She should go now. She has been proved to be incompetent and she misled the committee. After her performance this week, the BBC has significant grounds to let her go immediately. ‘Here you have a highly paid woman who hasn’t been behaving in the way that she should, but is allowed to dictate the terms of her own departure. ‘If the BBC is to regain the public trust, it needs to get a grip and start disciplinary proceedings against all those who signed off excessive severance payments.’ Cheers reportedly rang out in the BBC newsroom on Monday when Adams was branded a liar by MPs. Miss Adams protested the verdict on her was unfair, but committee chairman Margaret Hodge declared: 'You're developing a habit of changing your evidence.' Miss Adams was accused of completely contradicting herself. At one point, Mrs Hodge told her: 'I'm not having any more lies this afternoon.' The outburst apparently sparked a wave of disloyal jubilation within the Corporation as staff watched the exchange on live television. The BBC’s own media correspondent, the respected Nick Higham, tweeted: ‘There was an audible cheer in the BBC newsroom when Margaret Hodge accused BBC HR director Lucy Adams of lying to the PAC.’ Conservative MP Stephen Barclay, who also a member of the committee, says he obtained the email. He said: ‘The email shines a light on the real culture of the HR department which saw payments [that went beyond] contractual terms as simply perks of the job. The Commons Public Accounts Committee met this week to discuss severance payouts . ‘Clearly the decision to leave the BBC removed some of the need for further questioning, but it was clear she had lost the confidence of the committee in the accuracy of her recollections.’ He added: ‘I think her position is untenable and it is surprising that she will be continuing at the BBC until next spring when it is clear that, on more than one occasion, she denied any knowledge of material documents that she wrote before parliament. ‘I found it a very sad day to see an institution with so many talented and hard-working staff being led by people paid telephone-number salaries and performing in a way that fell far short of what those staff deserve.’ Another MP on the committee, Guto Bebb, said the ‘sweetener’ email was a ‘clear sign of the attitude of senior executives at the BBC to these above-contract payments’. He added: ‘Whilst concern about sweeteners for senior officers was expressed, the evidence from the NAO shows that as you go down the ‘food chain’ your chances of an above-contract deal receded.’ A BBC spokeswoman said: ‘Although the BBC has not seen the email, Lucy Adams explained the context in which this term might be used at the hearing.’","Lucy Adams earns £320,000 a year as HR director of the BBC .

Two leaders of the English Defence League are to stand trial next month for obstructing police officers while trying to march to the scene of the murder of Lee Rigby. Tommy Robinson, 30, the leader of the far-right group, allegedly wanted to defy a police ban by marching past a mosque to Woolwich Barracks in southeast London. The EDL supremo - real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon - and his deputy Kevin Carroll, 44, were arrested when they tried to enter the borough of Tower Hamlets on June 29. Charged: English Defence League leaders Kevin Carroll, left, and Tommy Robinson are accused of obstructing police by trying to defy a ban on marching to the scene of Fusilier Lee Rigby's murder via the East London Mosque on June 29 . Denial: Both men, who appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court today, denied a single charge of obstructing a police officer at the march . Upcoming trial: Tommy Robinson - real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon - and Deputy Leader Kevin Carroll, right, will go on trial next month . The pair are accused of deviating from a specific route laid down by the police which prevented them from entering the borough. Robinson and Carroll appeared together in the dock today at Westminster Magistrates Court. Carroll entered a not guilty plea to the single charge of obstructing a police officer, while Robinson had denied the charge at an earlier hearing. The two men claim they were on a charity walk that day, culminating with the laying of flowers in Woolwich where Drummer Rigby was killed.

The Commons Deputy Speaker who quit after being after being charged with a series of sex offences against seven men is in line for a £9,000 pay-off from the taxpayer. Nigel Evans, who delivered an extraordinary personal statement in the Commons yesterday, resigned his £36,000 post vowing to ‘robustly defend my innocence and seek acquittal’. He has been charged with the . rape of a man between March 29 and April 1, 2013, five sexual assaults . dating back to 2009 and two indecent assaults dating back to 2002. Scroll down for video . Speech: Nigel Evans addressed MPs in a personal statement after Prime Minister's Questions . Under parliamentary rules, when ministers and Commons officials stand down they are entitled to a 'severance payment' worth a quarter of their annual salary. It means Mr Evans must be offered £9,090 of his £36,360 salary for serving as deputy to Commons speaker John Bercow. Elected as a Conservative, Mr Evans has vowed to continue as an independent MP for Ribble Valley which comes with a separate salary of £65,738. Robert Oxley, Campaign director of the Taxpayers' Alliance, called for the severance deals to be scrapped. He added: 'Politicians resigning from a post should not receive a payoff. 'This wouldn’t happen in the private sector so why should it be any different when taxpayers are footing the bill?' In his personal statement to the Commons yesterday, Mr Evans quoted Churchill and he referred to the death of his mother and the spiritual . support of Parliament’s chaplain before thanking fellow MPs for their . ‘hugs, prayers and good wishes’. Speaking immediately after Prime . Minster’s Questions, he told a packed Commons chamber: ‘I hope you will . bear with me while I make this statement, it’s been a few years since I . made a speech in this chamber and I’m sad to say this is the speech. ‘As many of you will know following . recent allegations, I was charged with alleged offences yesterday. I now . have the opportunity to robustly defend my innocence and seek . acquittal. ‘I have therefore . decided the best course of action is for me to return to the . backbenches and this is a decision I have made myself after careful . consideration.’ When he left . Preston police station on Tuesday night, he gave a short statement before . saying he ‘will not be making any further comment until after the case . concludes’. But in the Commons he spoke at length about the impact of the case on his life. Thanks: Evans listed the many people he says have shown him 'compassionate consideration' Evans said: ‘It was one of the happiest days of my life when I was elected deputy speaker in 2010, it was an endorsement of my abilities to do the job by my colleagues and for that I am grateful. ‘Since these allegations, I have not been able to fully fulfil my duties in the chair, which left me in a land of limbo. ‘None of us were elected to the fine office of Member of Parliament to be put in that invidious position, unable to fully fulfil the reason why we were sent here.’ He said he was ‘grateful’ for the ‘unstinting support’ he has received from Mr Bercow and the other two deputy speakers, Lindsay Hoyle and Dawn Primarolo. Evans went on: ‘When I told Ms Primarolo on Saturday my decision, I even got a hug from her - thank you Dawn. ‘I have had so many hugs, prayers and good wishes since May 4 and I would like to thank everyone who has shown me such compassionate consideration, my family particularly, my association, who have been marvellous, and even seasoned, crusty journalists have displayed a heart I have never before witnessed. ‘I was told I would soon see who my real friends are and that has been true. But the truth is there have been so many of them - so thank you to my dearest loyal friends, including loyal members of my staff at Westminster and the Ribble Valley. Grateful: Speaker John Bercow paid tribute to Mr Evans twice in the Commons . ‘And to you, my colleagues, on all sides of the House who have spoken with me, looked after me and just shown loving attention. Party divisions disappear in times like this and they have, thank you. ‘Rose Hudson-Wilkin, the Speaker’s chaplain, and Andrew Tremlett, the canon of Westminster Abbey, have given me superb spiritual guidance which has given me the one thing everyone in this world needs, alongside air, water and food: that is hope. ‘Hope is that essential key to giving us a fulfilled life and they have ensured I have retained that hope.’ Evans said: ‘This is clearly the most painful thing I have endured in my life alongside the loss of my mother in 2009 and the loss of my brother earlier this year. ‘Winston Churchill said when you are going through hell, keep going. Sage advice. And so I will see this through to the end with the support of the people that mean so much to me.’ The Ribble Valley MP added: ‘Returning to the backbenches gives me the opportunity to speak out on issues such as the over-building of new homes in the Ribble Valley, threats to the Slaidburn doctors’ surgery and cuts to rural bus services. ‘It’s the bread and butter of politics, giving support to the people who put me in the mother of parliaments, my home for the past 21 years and a place that has meant so much to me. ‘I am proud to serve the people of the Ribble Valley and the best tribute I can give them now is to get on with the job that they sent me here to do.’ Tory MP Nadine Dorries placed a hand on Evans’s shoulder as he sat down after his statement. Earlier, at the start of Commons session, Mr Bercow said: ‘I have received his resignation with sadness. I wish to thank Nigel for his three years of service to the House as deputy speaker, in which he has proved to be highly competent, fair and good-humoured. ‘He has been a loyal and valued member of the team of deputy speakers who assist me in chairing our proceedings. I am warmly grateful to him.’ Evans will appear before magistrates in Preston on September 18. The indecent assaults are alleged to have been committed between January 1, 2002 and January 1, 2004; the sexual assaults between January 1, 2009 and April 1 this year; and the rape between March 29 and April 1 this year. Evans's initial arrest in early May related to offences alleged to have been committed in Pendleton, Lancashire . Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer said: ‘Following an investigation by Lancashire police, the Crown Prosecution Service has received a file of evidence in the case of Mr Nigel Evans MP which concerns allegations of a sexual nature. ‘After careful consideration, we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and that it is in the public interest to prosecute Evans. ‘Lancashire Constabulary has therefore been authorised to charge two counts of indecent assault, five counts of sexual assault and one count of rape relating to a total of seven alleged victims. ‘The decision in this case was taken by Joanne Cunliffe, an experienced specialist rape prosecutor, in consultation with John Dilworth, head of the CPS North West Complex Casework Unit and in consultation with an external and highly experienced criminal QC. ‘I have also been consulted on this case. The decision has been taken in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors and the CPS legal guidance on rape and sexual offences.’ Evans, from Pendleton, Lancashire, stepped aside from his deputy speaker duties after his arrest but had continued to work as an MP. He was one of three deputy speakers elected in a secret ballot of MPs in 2010. Later that year he came out as gay, saying he was ‘’tired of living a lie’’. He was a vice chairman of the Conservative Party from 1999 to 2001. When Iain Duncan Smith became party leader in 2001, he was promoted to the shadow cabinet as shadow Welsh secretary - a post he held for two years.

Milton Tharmalingam, 36, suffered a serious wound to his head after being attacked with a machete . At this point the gang decide to abandon the raid, although one of the men then attacks Milton with the machete. The CCTV footage shows the thug . lifting the machete into the air and bringing it down on his face and . head as the gang flee empty-handed. Milton said: 'The chains were very thick and heavy.

Two members of the gang entered the back office and forced a worker to hand over cash at knife point. He thrust a large kitchen knife toward the woman’s face and then flashed it inches from her face when he was leaving. Police said the two incidents could be linked because of the short time and distance between them. The four offenders are described as white and were wearing mainly dark clothing.","Milton Tharmalingam was beaten with a chain and slashed with a machete .

Fraudsters allgedly posted fake adverts for work at Harrods on a website as part of a £1 million scam to trick desperate job hunters of their savings, a court heard today. The Nigerian gang recruited a British computer whizzkid Tyrone Ellis to write 'Trojan' malware which were hidden in job application pack downloads posted on the free website Gumtree. Once embedded on computers, the software copied bank log on and security details of those seeking work before forwarding them on to the gang, the court was told. Outside the Harrods department store in Knightsbridge, established in 1834 it has become an international symbol of all things British . The gang would then empty the accounts taking everything they had, which in some cases amounted to just £400 and in other cases £4,700, the Old Bailey said. 'Mules' were then hired to go to banks and withdraw the cash or the gang would go on an online shopping spree, it was heard. The fraud was uncovered when job seekers complained to Harrods that their computers had become infected when they downloaded an application form, the court heard. The store’s director of security Gregory Faulkener then responded to an advert, downloaded and quarantined the application pack and called in American 'phishing' experts. Finding the malware, he then contacted Scotland Yard’s economic crime unit while sending an e-mail warning the gang to stop using Harrods name. Undeterred the gang continued to post over 415 further fake job adverts for other jobs such as a £25,000 sales assistant with Securestore. Tracing the unique IP addresses used to post the jobs free online with Gumtree, police raided homes connected to the gang over nine months after the first fake job adverts were posted in late August 2010. But only in 2012 were the whole gang be rounded up - from the number of emails, accounts and texts it is estimated they scammed their victims out of 'in excess of £1 million.' The jury at the Old Bailey heard that the gang made 'in excess of £1million' from the scam . Walton Hornsby, prosecuting, told the jury the gang themselves even referred to the scam as the 'Gumtree fraud.' He said: 'It specifically targeted people looking for jobs. 'A decision was made someone applying for a job is perhaps more keen to cooperate and comply with any instructions given by someone that seems to be positively responding to their application by inviting them to download an application pack. 'In August and early September 2010 a number of adverts appeared on Gumtree advertising various jobs at Harrods, a rather attractive post you may think.' Those responding were in return then sent an e-mail pretending to be from the respected Blue Arrow recruitment agency inviting them 'to fill in that application pack for further consideration.' Mr Hornsby said: 'Although a number of persons had doubts about downloading an application pack, many did so. Almost immediately there started to appear to be problems with their computers. 'What in fact happened that application pack was no application pack at all. 'It was a virus that had been specifically programmed to be released onto the computers once you have clicked on that application and downloaded it.' Once embedded the software waited until the user tried to access their online bank accounts. The unsuspecting user would then be redirected to fake sites 'which looked all the world that it was a genuine bank site they were trying to contact' before the gang’s software stole log on details. However, he added: 'In late summer and early Autumn 2010 a number of individuals complained to Harrods that they had applied for job adverts and downloaded an application pack and a virus was released onto their computer.' The court heard the suspected fraudsters were originally from Nigeria and were close friends all living in south London and all were studying or had studied IT. Gumtree: The free advertising website where people were tricked into applying for attractive jobs at Harrods by downloading software which then corrupted their computers and stole their security details . It is alleged the malware was mainly written by whizz kid Ellis, 27, with the help of brothers Southampton Solent University graduate Ajibola Akinlabi, 26; Portsmouth University graduate Babatunde Akinlabi, 28; Damilare Oduwole, 26; and Olalekan Awosile, 27. The five plus Awosile’s 48-year-old care worker mother Folasade Balogun, whose internet connection was used to post some of the job adverts, deny conspiracy to defraud. Ellis denies developing second generation phishing programmes for mobile smart phones and paypal when arrested. Awosile alos denies conspiracy to commit fraud by abuse of position with his girlfriend Nadine Windley who worked as a Santander cashier who passed on bank details of account holders with more than £100,000.

Tragic: Luke Griffin, 20, drowned after falling over a 100ft cliff following a night out in Newquay, Cornwall in June 2012 . An amateur footballer on a night out with team mates drowned on a Cornish beach after falling over a 100ft cliff following a drink and drugs binge. Luke Griffin, 20, was discovered on the sand in Newquay while on an end-of-season tour with 19 friends in the notorious party town in June last year. The builder had been involved in a scuffle with two men in a car park before he stumbled over a wall and on to the Great Western beach. At an inquest into his death in Truro, Cornwall, coroner Andrew Cox ruled that Luke 'drowned while under the influence of alcohol and cocaine following a recent head injury’. Recording an accidental death verdict, Mr Cox urged youngsters visiting the town to act responsible while having fun. He said: 'Luke isn’t the first young man who has died in Newquay falling over cliffs after consuming too much alcohol or drugs. 'I don’t want to have any more distressed family and friends appearing before me, mourning the loss of a youngster. 'This wont change unless the culture of drinking to excess also changes. Come to Newquay, have a good time but drink responsibly and get home safely.' The inquest heard that Luke had downed several cans of lager and snorted cocaine while on a minibus taking the group from Gloucester to Cornwall. He had become separated from his friends . during the night out and become embroiled in a fight with two men in a . car park, when his head was stamped on in the brawl. Police were called but Luke refused . medical help and walked off towards the direction of his surf lodge . accommodation, which is when he fell over the cliff. Experts . said he was still alive when he hit the beach but was soon drowned by . the incoming tide. His body was found by a dog walker the next morning. Discovered: Luke's body was found on the Great Western Beach by a dog walker. His death has been ruled an accident by a coroner in Truro, Cornwall . It is unclear whether his injuries, which included a broken nose, where sustained in the fall or the fight. Two men were arrested on suspicion of assault but were later released without charge. Paying tribute to the tragic 20 year old, his grandmother Angela Earwaker, 63, said: 'He was a loveable rogue, kind, caring and compassionate. He had just got player of the year. We collected his trophy after he passed away. 'They just loved his smile - that’s how we want to remember him.' His death is just one of many tragedies which have blighted the coastal town, which famously attracts gangs of youngsters in the summer months, as well as hen and stag parties. In the summer of 2009 Andrew Curwell, 19, and Paddy Higgins, 16, fell to their deaths from cliffs in separate incidents whilst celebrating the end of their exams. The deaths led to the introduction of a security plan for the resort, including the confiscation of alcohol carried by under-age drinkers and police patrols on trains. In January, 26-year-old medic Oliver Doy was found on Newquay beach six days after he vanished during a night out in the town.","Luke Griffin, 20, drowned after falling over a wall during a night out with team mates in Newquay .

A woman is suing a medical centre in Libertyville, Illinois, for 'physically abusing' her with a vaginal probe causing internal injuries and leaving her with recurring nightmares. Marianne Keith, 52, who is not pictured in this story, went to the Advocate Condell Medical Center with severe abdominal pain in February. The physician recommended that she have a transvaginal ultrasound to diagnose the problem. The procedure is normally used by doctors to detect a fetal heartbeat early in a pregnancy. Abusive: Marianne Keith, 52, (not pictured) said the transvaginal ultrasound was 'physically abusive' at the Advocate Condell Medical Center in Libertyville, Illinois . Lawsuit: Marianne Keith is suing the Advocate Condell Medical Center for medical battery . According to Keith, a full hour of brutal physical abuse ensued that left her with internal injuries and recurring nightmares. ‘It felt like I was being raped,’ she told The Huffington Post. ‘Like somebody was intentionally hurting me.’ Keith, who has sued the centre for medical battery, claims in the lawsuit that the hospital technician ‘repeatedly jammed the probe in to various internal portions of [her] vagina, including her cervix’, for an hour. She says she suffered physical injuries to her vagina and cervix and continues to experience symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Hospital nightmare: Marianne Keith (not pictured) said she was abusively probed with a vaginal instrument normally used to detect a fetal heartbeat early in a pregnancy . Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager for the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research organisation, said 10 states have mandatory ultrasound laws . ‘I have nightmares about being trapped and going through this procedure again,’ she said. She also admitted that she has stopped having intimacy with her husband because ‘I don't want anybody touching me’. She said she ‘can’t even go to the doctor anymore’. A spokesperson for the Advocate Condell Medical Center said it does not comment on pending lawsuits. Transvaginal ultrasounds have made headlines in the past few years because several states have debated or passed legislation forcing women to undergo the procedure before getting an abortion. Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager for . the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research organisation, . said half of the 10 states that have mandatory ultrasound laws require a . vaginal ultrasound because those laws mandate making the fetal . heartbeat audible or require specific information for gestational age. ‘Early in pregnancy, the only way to make the fetal heartbeat audible is to use a transvaginal ultrasound,’ said Nash to the The Huffington Post. The four states with laws implicitly requiring transvaginal ultrasounds for women seeking abortions are Arizona, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas. Virginia lawmakers had a high-profile debate in 2012 over mandating the procedure for such women. Democrats likened the procedure to ""state-sponsored rape,"" prompting Republicans to rewrite the bill to allow women to opt out.","Marianne Keith, 52, said the physician at the Advocate Condell Medical Center in Libertyville, Illinois, 'physically abused' her for one hour with the vaginal probe .

Mr Barroso said his opponents risk taking Europe back to a time of ‘war and trenches’. Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured in Downing Street today, hit back at the extraordinary remarks by European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso . Despite being a supposedly neutral public servant, Mr Barroso – a former prime minister of Portugal – suggested UKIP would beat the Conservatives in next year’s European Parliament elections because ‘when it comes to being against Europe, people prefer the original to the copy’. But Mr Cameron said the President had gone beyond his remit and must respect one of the leading parties in European Parliament. Speaking on LBC 97.3, the Prime . Minister said: ‘The Barroso thing did annoy me because frankly, his job . is to serve the members of the European Union and the British . Conservatives in the European Parliament are an important party. ‘They are the governing party of the United Kingdom and he should be respecting their views rather than trying to lecture them. ‘They’ve got an important contribution to make and I think he got it wrong, and I’ll tell him that.’ Mr Cameron, who met entrepreneurs including Jonie Worton, right, mad clear his anger at the attack on Eurosceptics . 'Let me say this to all those who rejoice in Europe’s difficulties and who want to roll back our integration and go back to isolation - the pre-integrated Europe of the divisions, the war, the trenches, is not what people desire and deserve. ‘The European continent has never in its history known such a long period of peace as since the creation of the European Community. It is our duty to preserve it and deepen it. To Tory MEP Martin Callanan: . ‘Your party is looking like UKIP. UKIP may finish first in Britain. 'I have some doubts whether you are going to be elected in Britain or if it is not UKIP that will be the first force in British elections. ‘Because when it comes to be against Europe people prefer the original to the copy. ‘That is probably why they are going to vote for (Nigel) Farage. I don’t say this with any kind of satisfaction.' He said that while he has a ‘good relationship’ with Mr Barroso he plans a ‘pretty robust exchange’ on the issue the next time he sees him. Mr Barroso’s comments came in his annual address to the European Parliament. In a thinly veiled attack on Mr Cameron, he insisted Europe needed ‘more integration’, not less. He said: ‘Let me say this to all those who rejoice in Europe’s difficulties and who want to roll back our integration and go back to isolation – the pre-integrated Europe of the divisions, the war, the trenches, is not what people desire and deserve. ‘The European continent has never in its . history known such a long period of peace as since the creation of the .

And although she rarely leaves the cab of the lorry, Mr Bloor makes the cross breed West Highland Terrier wear a tiny high-visibility jacket while at work - just in case. Safety first! 10-year-old Tilly the dog wears her Hi-Vis jacket to work everyday . Standing out: Although Tilly, a cross-breed West Highland Terrier, rarely leaves the cab of the lorry Mr Bloor likes to make sure she is safe by wearing her jacket . Mr Bloor, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, says Tilly usually sits in the passenger seat looking out of the window as he delivers bricks and concrete. He says she is great company for his 12-hour shifts, and he couldn't imagine life on the road without her. Speaking on Thursday, Mr Bloor said: 'I put her jacket on at 6am, she looks quite funny in it but she needs it for health and safety reasons, and then we both jump in the lorry and off we go until 6pm that evening. 'I have to take Tilly to work with me as I am single and have no one to look after her at home - but I love it. 'People love her, she’s so friendly and she loves the ride, she doesn’t go to sleep, she is quite a nosy dog so sticks her head out the window most of the time. 'Obviously on some days we hit a bit of traffic and if we pull up alongside a family with kids, they love her and she loves them, she’s just so friendly and great company. Man's best friend: Mr Bloor says Tilly certainly turns heads in her jacket . 'We’re together for 24 hours a day, we’re best mates, she is just like a child to me and is like a mascot for the firm. 'I’ve had her since she was born, I bred her, so we have a strong bond. 'But she isn’t just a delight to be with when she’s with me, all the guys at work love her too.

Frain has been jailed for three months after he was unmasked as a bigamist after his first wife saw the photographs of his second wedding on Facebook . A bigamist whose deception was uncovered when his first wife saw photographs of his second wedding on Facebook has been jailed for three months. Brian Frain, 36, was caught out when Anne-Marie Sim spotted the pictures while attempting to track him down and tell him she wanted a divorce. Ms Sim recognised that the 2009 ceremony took place at Dukinfield Register Office in Manchester - the same venue where she had married Frain 10 years previously. When she contacted the registrar, it was confirmed that Frain had not declared that he was still married. It later emerged that Margaret Meredith, who thought she was marrying Frain, was also not aware he had wed before. Rachel Faux, prosecuting, told Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court that Frain’s first marriage had only lasted a couple of months and both parties went their separate ways. Ms Sim commenced divorce proceedings in 2004 but was unable to make any contact with the defendant through her solicitors. The prosecutor said: 'Two years ago she contacted her solicitor to see if there had been any progress. She was told there was none and she was still married. 'Because of her own plans to marry that year she undertook her own research on Facebook and found photographs of the defendant being married on September 25, 2009.' Frain, from Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, was arrested and confirmed he had married both women. Already taken: Brian Frain had not divorced his first wife when he married Margaret Louise Meredith in 2009 . 'He said due to the amount of time that had passed he assumed he was no longer married to her (Ms Sym),' Ms Faux said. Ms Meredith told police she was unaware Frain had been married before. She later had to give evidence at Tameside Magistrates’ Court to confirm she had no knowledge of Frain’s previous life because he claimed she did know. A district judge ruled she was telling the truth and Frain was convicted of bigamy in August. The couple, who went on to have twins, later split up themselves. Frain was now in another relationship, the court heard. His fiancee, mother-of-four Donna Darwent, 33, wept as she vowed to stand by him after he was jailed. Bigamist Brian Frain, 36, with his new partner mother-of-four Donna Darwent, 33, who wept after he was jailed for three months and vowed to stand by him . Frain had a string of previous convictions for dishonesty, including benefit fraud, and also violence. Sentencing him, Judge Maurice Greene said: 'The seriousness of the matter is the distress you caused in the second marriage by giving a status to which she was not entitled to because you lied to her. 'And you also lied to officers of the state. When asked to fill in a form you told a lie to the registrar and you said you had not been married before and was not married, which was not true.' Frain will serve half his sentence in custody. He has previously reportedly said he wishes to marry his new partner. Speaking afterwards, his new partner Ms Darwent said: 'I’m absolutely devastated he’s gone to prison but I’m not surprised. 'What I’m most worried about is telling my four kids. I don’t know how I’m going to tell them. 'When this is all dealt with we hope to pick up where we left off and get our lives back. 'I always said I would never marry. But I have never been settled before and never met my perfect partner. Then Brian came along and he has changed completely. My kids love him to bits. They see him as their father. I am committed enough to marry him.' The sentencing came after Frain himself went public about his cheating saying he could not wait to marry Ms Darwent. He said: ‘I will take my punishment, because I know when I come out of prison, I will be with the love of my life. I have done the crime, so I have to take the punishment. 'Donna has made me grow up a lot. She has helped me through my ups and downs and made me a better person. 'I want to move on and I plan to marry Donna. I regret all that has happened.

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . PUBLISHED: . 17:51 EST, 11 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:02 EST, 11 September 2013 . Claims: Patrick McLoughlin, who commissioned the report . Ministers hired accountants to ‘dress up’ figures that would show the HS2 rail project providing a £15billion a year economic boost, it was claimed yesterday. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin commissioned a report by KPMG which said the £43billion scheme would rapidly ‘pay for itself’. But critics of the plan said the 92-page document was a ‘paid-for analysis that gives the “right answer”.’ It was also described as a ‘desperate attempt to justify a seriously flawed project’, while the TaxPayers’ Alliance said Mr McLoughlin was simply getting sharp accountants to dress up the figures based on ‘dodgy assumptions’. Economic modellers at KPMG drew up their assessment on the high speed rail project at a cost of more than £240,000. Mr McLoughlin said it provided the ‘hard evidence’ needed to convince sceptics. The £15billion a year benefits cited in the report meant the £43billion line – plus £7billion for trains – will ‘pay for itself’ in just a few years, he added. Speaking at the Institute of Civil Engineers in London, he shrugged off Treasury claims that the true cost would be £73billion, and dismissed other estimates of up to £100billion. Protest: The STOP HS2 pressure group outside Parliament in London with a 10 foot high inflatable white elephant as the Secretary of State for Transport Philip Hammond and staff of HS2 Ltd give evidence to the Transport Select Committee inquiry of HS2 . However, briefing notes prepared ahead of the report’s launch instructed its authors how best to respond to awkward questions including: ‘Have you fiddled the figures?’. Richard Threlfall of KPMG insisted they had not been ‘fiddled’ to please their Government client. Ministers and accountants at KPMG say their HS2 report looks only at the economic benefits of the high speed rail scheme - which they calculate to be £15billion a year by 2037  – not the costs .And they admit they took an ‘alternative’ approach to doing that calculation – which could be at odds with more ‘conventional’ ways of measuring economic benefits.Ministers say the conventional Whitehall analysis fails to take account of the full benefits to the regions which the new KPMG study has addressed.Littered with complex mathematical formulae, the KPMG  report  explains its methodology by saying: ’The analysis focuses on the  potential impact of investment in HS2 on the structure of regional economies in the longer term. ‘It is therefore different from conventional approaches to  the appraisal of transport schemes, which are based on the  monetary value of time and cost changes.’The report stresses: ’It does not seek to value time and cost changes directly.‘Instead, it aims to understand how these changes to travel times and  costs influence regional economic performance, both in terms of overall economic productivity and the location of economic activity.’It says: ’The analysis provides an alternative approach to conventional transport appraisal, and the estimated net benefits should not be considered as comparable or additional to those estimated by  conventional  appraisal techniques.’But critics and campaigners say his is gobbledegook. He said: ‘No, absolutely not. You would . not expect a respected accountancy firm to put their reputation on the . line by doing any such thing.’ He added that the report was ‘robust’, had been peer-reviewed by independent economists and would ‘withstand academic scrutiny’. The analysis also ‘shows beyond reasonable doubt that HS2 brings net benefits to the country of many times the scheme’s cost’. However, the Institute of Economic Affairs called the project ‘a high speed gravy train’, branding the accountants’ analysis ‘one-sided and unconvincing’. Head of transport Dr Richard Wellings said: ‘Its conclusions are based on highly questionable assumptions.’ Standard cost-benefit analysis shows it to be ‘extremely poor value for money’, he added. Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said the report was ‘an expensive propaganda exercise’, adding: ‘The Government has squandered taxpayers’ money on a cynical attempt to win over the many, many people who think this white elephant is the wrong way to spend tens of billions of pounds of their money.’ The HS2 Action Alliance said the new report ‘stretches credibility’, did not use ‘mainstream’ methodology and ‘makes a host of other questionable assumptions’. The protest group’s director Hilary Wharf said: ‘This latest report is a rabbit out of the hat. But like all conjuring tricks it lacks real substance. ‘They have abandoned respected approaches and paid for an analysis that’s only virtue is it gives the “right answer”.’ The 351-mile project, which aims to link London to Birmingham and beyond by running 225mph trains through Tory heartlands in Warwickshire and Buckinghamshire, is mired in controversy. The Commons’ public accounts committee has already accused ministers of failing to make a ‘value for money’ case for the scheme.","A report by KPMG which said the £43billion scheme would .

Her lengthy CV lists countless qualifications, civic achievements, books and publications – but Raquel Rolnik makes no mention of dabbling in witchcraft. Yet the architect and urban planner appears to be an avid follower of Candomble, an African-Brazilian religion that originated during the slave trade. The academic, brought up a Marxist, actually offered an animal sacrifice to Karl Marx when she was studying for her Masters degree in architecture so ‘he would leave her alone’ to study in peace. The academic, brought up a Marxist, actually offered an animal sacrifice to Karl Marx . According to her elder sister Suely, a well-known Brazilian psychoanalyst and intellectual, Raquel had become ‘contaminated’ by other philosophies and offered the sacrifice to appease the German revolutionary socialist. The UN special rapporteur’s fascination with Candomble rekindled memories of another controversial figure’s links with the religion that worships African gods. In 2001, Peter Mandelson was ridiculed when reports emerged that his Brazilian partner, Reinaldo Avila da Silva, had engaged a Candomble witch doctor to put a hex on political enemies in a ceremony involving the slaughter of a chicken. It was claimed that the Labour spin doctor – now a peer – held a live chicken by the neck while a priest in Rio de Janeiro cut off its head, splashing Mr Mandelson with blood. Mother-of-two Mrs Rolnik lives in Sao Paulo, Brazil’s biggest city, and is a professor at the city university’s faculty of Architecture and Urbanism. Her Polish grandfather died in the Holocaust and her parents emigrated to Brazil. She has held various government positions, speaks six languages, and was appointed to her UN post in 2008. In an interview, her sister Suely gave more clues about Raquel’s upbringing and background. She said: ‘My little sister –  who is much younger than me – and I have always felt the same. MPs pointed out that in Brazil tens of millions of people are condemned to living in shanty towns, or favelas . 'I was born in Belenzinho [a poor area of Sao Paulo], my parents are immigrants and we never tried to hide this, we do not feel well in high class, bourgeois places. ‘She was always brilliant academically. So she wanted to show that these forms of housing, including tenement houses, favela housing etc, aren’t the only solutions to poverty. She wanted to show that there were other alternatives. ‘She lived in communes at the time, she went to Africa, the Caribbean, Colombia, she went to the houses of African witch doctors to find out what was the memory of housing in Africa, during slavery. But the university didn’t accept her thesis. ‘I greatly admire her work, her courage, the work she is doing with the UN is fantastic, she is very precocious.’ Suely said Raquel came to live with her in Paris in the 1970s and became interested in French philosophers. ‘When she went to do her Masters, she offered an ebo – an animal sacrifice – to Marx, so he would leave her in peace. ‘Because, as well as having a Marxist formation at the university, when we were small our parents put us in the Leftist Zionist movement. ‘Raquel had a really solid Marxist formation. So she had to give an ebo to Marx in Candomble so he would leave her alone.’","Academic brought up a Marxist and offered an animal sacrifice to Karl Marx .

Quit: NHS boss Mike Farrar has decided to leave his job weeks before an inquiry that will look at his role in a baby deaths scandal . A senior Health Service boss has resigned ahead of a major inquiry into the needless deaths of mothers and babies. Mike Farrar will stand down at the end of this month as the £200,000-a-year head of the NHS Confederation. He is expected to face criticism during the inquiry starting next month into poor care at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay in Cumbria. Two mothers and 14 babies are feared to have died from 2002 to 2012 while another nine suffered brain damage. Yesterday grieving families accused Mr Farrar of ‘coincidentally’ leaving before the truth about the scandal comes to light. James Titcombe, whose son Joshua died at the maternity unit in 2008 at only nine days old, said: ‘He’s stepping down without accepting any responsibility. ‘It’s hard to believe it’s a coincidence he is leaving now.’ Liza Brady’s son Alex also died there in 2008. ‘It’s absolutely  ridiculous. It’s just too much of a coincidence that he is stepping down before the investigation goes ahead,’ she said. Mr Farrar, previously head of the regional health body supervising the hospital, is accused of failing to take action. Mrs Brady, 28, added: ‘He was chief executive of the strategic health authority when Morecambe Bay was at its worst. ‘These failed NHS bosses are like a group of second-hand car salesmen. They form their own group helping each other out. ‘The truth about Morecambe Bay will come out and hopefully the NHS will be able to move forward.’ Mr Farrar leaves the confederation, which represents NHS managers, on a £1million taxpayer-funded pension pot paying-out £65,000 a year when he retires. The 53-year-old  plans to set up a consultancy which will almost  certainly see him earn more NHS money by advising hospitals and health trusts how to improve care. Quality of care: Up to 16 babies and two mothers may have died due to poor care since 2001 at the Barrow-in-Furness hospital (pictured), sparking an upcoming inquiry . Today ministers are set to announce . further details about the inquiry which is expected to last several . months. These include the specific failings to be examined, who will be . called to give evidence and where it will take place. In . a statement announcing his departure, Mr Farrar failed to make any . reference to the scandal or the timing of his resignation. Instead, he . told of his ‘enormous privilege’ to have worked in the NHS for more than . two decades. He added: ‘The . real sense of career satisfaction is to have been able to shape and see . real improvements in patient care, delivered according to need and . never ability to pay.’ Mr . Farrar is accused of repeatedly ignoring the concerns of grieving . families when chief executive of the North West Strategic Health . Authority from 2007 to 2011. A number of reports were commissioned into . possible failings but the findings were never made public. In . 2010, Mr Farrar is reported to have reassured the Care Quality .

Squeaky clean Richard Tipper has staked his claim as Britain’s most prolific car washer after tending to more than 25,000 supercars at up to £1,200-a-time. Dedicated Mr Tipper started cleaning motors as a 14-year-old charging £2-a-go to wash his neighbours’ vehicles. Twenty-eight years later, he has become a professional cleaner, or car ‘detailer’, travelling around the UK polishing supercars and classics worth in excess of £20 million. Machine: Richard Tipper, 41 from London, claims his 30-year career with a bucket and sponge has seen him clean 25,000 cars . Dedication: He will spend a whole day to make sure his customers' vehicles are spotless and sometimes will polish the motors for up to a week . He will typically spend a whole day making each car look shinier than when it left the showroom and once spent a whole week cleaning a Ferrari F50. Mr Tipper believes he has now washed upwards of 25,000 cars and used 2.5 million litres of water - enough to fill an Olympic swimming pool.He has gone through 1,800 lambswool wash mitts, 1,200 drying towels, ten litres of pure wax and 100 litres of polish. The valeter’s big step came in 1989 when he saved up enough money to buy a Vauxhall Rascal van and went full-time with his company, Perfection Valet. He started working on fleet cars, cleaning up to 300 per week and, by the mid-1990s, was moving onto more exotic motors such as Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Porsches. Today, Mr Tipper is the go to man for a number of magazines, high-end dealers and classic car enthusiasts. A conventional valet costs £350 while his top notch ‘concours’ detail has a £1,200 price-tag, with the owner getting a hardback photo book to accompany the completed service. Record: Mr Tipper believes he has now washed upwards of 25,000 cars and used 2.5 million litres of water - enough to fill an Olympic swimming pool . Despite the eye-opening price-tag, Richard’s skills are something customers are willing to pay for, particularly if the car is worth upwards of £20 million like the Ferrari 250 GTO he has worked on. Mr Tipper, from North London, said: 'Strict instructions were handed down to us by the owner clearly stating ‘she’ must not be enhanced in anyway, but must be merely maintained in her current condition. 'With such a significant history, a transformation of her ""patina"" could have had a dramatic and detrimental effect on the value. Success: The professional 'detailer' once spent a whole week tirelessly cleaning a Ferrari F50 . 'The car was an original Series 1 from 1963 and the hairs still stand up on the back of my neck when I think of how lucky I was to have looked after her. 'It was certainly a career high for me. I often wonder if I’ll ever get the chance to work on another. I live in hope.' Mr Tipper arrives at his clients’ properties in a customised van packed full of specialist cleaning products, waxes and polishes with one setting him back a staggering £3,000. He has now ‘detailed’ everything from standard family cars to vintage vehicles from as far back as 1905. Career: Since the age of 14 he has perfected the art of making the paint job look as if it has just come out of the show room . The meticulous valeter has worked on 52 different models of Ferrari and has also detailed the Le Mans-winning Jaguar XJR-9 and a Ferrari 312 T4 F1 car driven by the legendary Gilles Villeneuve. Away from the world of cleaning supercars, the married father-of-two drives a Vauxhall Zafira people carrier. He added: 'It is a tremendously tiring and physical job and my body and mind has had to adapt to the long hours, harsh weather conditions and general anxiety felt by a conscientious person trying to provide a service to his clients. Commitment: Mr Tipper works day and night working on his customers' cars, including this Porsche . 'But I’ve had few interesting experiences over the years. On one occasion, I was cleaning a client’s car when I removed the boot mats to find a stash of pornographic magazines. 'I was also working on a lady’s Porsche and when I found a bag containing 2,000 pound coins. 'She had hidden the money when moving home and, a year later, had completely forgotten about them.'","Richard Tipper, 41, has made a career out of making cars shinier than when they came out of the showroom .

Unhappy: Holly-Mae Donaldson, 13, was sent home from her school in Cheltenham because her skirt, above, was made of banned 'stretchy' material . A 13-year-old schoolgirl was sent home on the first day of term because her skirt was ‘too stretchy’. Holly-Mae Donaldson, a pupil at All Saints Academy in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, had to go home yesterday because her skirt conflicted with the school’s uniform code. The skirt, which was not too short, was deemed unacceptable because it was made of a banned ‘stretchy’ material. Rules for girls say all skirts must be knee-length without splits or pleats, and not stretch. But Holly-Mae has also accused the school of singling her out, as she said other girls wear the exact same skirt but were not punished. She said: ‘I really think it’s pathetic. It’s just the material, and it doesn’t affect my learning. I felt singled out by the teachers, and it’s only the first day of school. ‘I know other girls who have the same skirt as I do, but they haven’t been told they would be put in isolation or sent home. ‘I really enjoyed going to school at the start, but late last year, the teachers seem to be thinking more about uniforms.’ Her mother Diane Donaldson said the decision was ‘appalling’ and that it was almost impossible to find a skirt for her daughter which complies with the rules. ‘I couldn’t believe it when the school called me up. How is the skirt too short, when it goes to her knees?’ she said. ‘They told me it was made of stretchy . material, and not acceptable. I spent the entire summer holidays trying . to find one to fit her as she is so small. ‘Now . they’ve told her they would let her return if she wears the same . trousers which they said last year were unacceptable! It’s really a case . of double standards. I just don’t understand it. Not impressed: Holly-Mae's mother Diane Donaldson (left) attacked the decision to send her daughter home, and said it was difficult to find a skirt that complies with the rules . ‘The school really needs to concentrate more on the education, and less on the pupils’ uniform. I think she is old enough and sensible enough to decide what she wants to wear to school.’ As well as Holly-Mae, All Saints Academy sent two other students home on their first day for having inappropriately dyed hair. The school, which an Ofsted . inspection this year said 'requires improvement', has been criticised . before for sending home a student for wearing the wrong shoes, even . though he had broken his toe the previous day. Principal Peter Kingham said: ‘We have been very clear with our students about uniform expectations. Education: All Saints Academy, pictured, has a strict uniform policy, but inspectors have warned it about poor performance . ‘We have demonstrated what is acceptable and what is not. We have had assemblies on this and written to parents. 'I really think it’s pathetic. I felt singled out by the teachers, and it’s only the first day of school' Holly-Mae Donaldson . ‘The academy has high standards which we are intent on maintaining. We have a parents’ forum where issues such as this can be raised and we encourage parents to join this. ‘Alongside this, we have a procedure for any complaints from parents that we encourage them to follow whenever necessary. ‘Out of 1,000 students in the academy, the vast majority adhere to our policies and practices and accept them fully.’","Holly-Mae Donaldson sent home from All Saints Academy in Cheltenham .

Odzhan, dubbed the Siberian Mowgli, said he is happy living in the wilderness and does not want to move to the city . A young man dubbed the 'Siberian Mowgli' after being raised in the Russian wilderness said he is happy and does not want to move back to the city. He spoke to people living near the town of Belokurikha this week for the first time in 16 years. He has lived with his parents Alexander and Elena in an isolated one-room hut and has missed all formal schooling. But Odzhan says he wants to remain in the small house and does not want to live near other people. He told The Siberian Times: 'We are living well. This is the reality we have that we live here, and it's quite a good reality. 'To . move closer towards the city? For that we need to have a more cultural . society, and of course to change how the cities smell and the pollution. 'I am happy here.' The . family have survived by occasionally selling mushrooms or his artist . father's paintings to the few people they come in contact with. His parents have taught him to read and write and he has even learned to speak English from a dictionary. Odzhan said the only thing he craves is to practice his language skills with a native speaker. He . told the newspaper: 'Of course, I need to have practice - if only I . could have a chance to communicate with somebody who speaks no words on . Russia - at least for a month.' The young man said he spends the rest of his time painting or reading other books. His parents rejected conventional society in the early 90s following the collapse of the Soviet regime. They said they only wanted their son to be a 'clever, kind and true man'.

Roman Fomin, a local . prosecutor, told AFP that a local woman had brought the young man to . authorities out of fear that he may need help through the cold winter, . but the man then had gone back to his hiding place in the forest. Officials . from Mr Fomin's office, alarmed that he may have to spend winter alone . in the wild, appealed in court to have his identification documents . re-established so the man, who has not been named, can seek state support. Mr Fomin said: 'I am not sure if he needs all this attention. 'He looked normal and healthy. 'He only spoke slowly, since he doesn't communicate as often as most people.'

Two Northern California men accused of sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl and keeping her captive in a metal box on their marijuana farm, have pleaded not guilty to federal drug charges. Ryan Balletto, 30, and Patrick Pearmain, 24, were shackled and wearing jail garb when they denied the charges today in a San Francisco federal court. Federal prosecutors have charged Balletto and Pearmain with growing more than 1,000 marijuana plants on a remote Lake County farm. Toolbox: A harrowing picture of the four foot metal box, above, two marijuana growers kept a 15-year-old girl they used as a sex slave has been released for the first time . Captors: 30-year-old Ryan Balletto, left, and 25-year-old Patrick Pearmain, right, were arrested in May after the girl they kidnapped called police, and authorities traced the call to a motel in Sacramento . Both are also charged with coercing the teenage runaway to help with their alleged operation. Balletto denied the charges even though federal prosecutors allege in court documents that he confessed. His lawyer denied comment after the hearing. At Balletto's pot farm, officers . found 'equipment consistent with sexual bondage and sadomasochism,' including a rack 'presumably used to attach a human to the device and . immobilize them.' Near the rack officers found a towel with blood . stains. Prosecutors had said earlier that Balletto confessed, according to court . documents arguing Balletto and Pearmain should remain behind bars during . the case. 'The . government... has a recorded, Mirandized confession by Balletto, a . recorded statement from the minor victim, and multiple recorded . statements from others who were working on the grow site,' prosecutors . wrote. Authorities in Lake . County learned about the case when the Los Angeles Police Department . advised that Balletto might have kidnapped her. Deputies . visited Balletto's home asking about the missing girl April 29, the . complaint said, and she called authorities the next day to say she was . OK and in Sacramento. LAPD . investigators traced the call and police located the girl at a West . Sacramento hotel, where authorities arrested Pearmain, the complaint . said. The girl, described as a runaway from the Los Angeles area, told investigators she was locked in a 4-by-2-by-2-foot box. Kidnapped: A girl who went missing in April in Los Angeles ended up being used as a sex slave on a marijuana farm in Northern California until she was rescued on May 1 . Prisoner: Balletto and Pearmain kept the girl locked in a 4-foot by 2-foot metal toolbox, sometimes for days at a time . Holes . had been drilled in the box, and water was run through the box, held at . an angle, to wash her without letting her out, the complaint said. Investigators found human hair inside the box, where prosecutors said the girl was imprisoned 'on multiple occasions, for days.' A . message left Friday morning for Balletto's attorney, Jodi Linker of the . Office of the Federal Public Defender, was not immediately returned. Pearmain's lawyer, Robert Waggener, also did not return a call. Hundreds . of marijuana plants and several firearms, including AR-15-style assault . rifles and body armor were found as part of the investigation. Prosecutors described Balletto as an ex-Marine who was preparing for an extended battle. 'The . presence of so many weapons on the grow site, including two assault . rifles and eleven loaded 20- and 30-round magazines ... indicate that . Balletto was prepared to engage in an extended gun battle,' prosecutors . wrote. The two men face charges of conspiracy to manufacture and distribute more than 1,000 marijuana plants. Trooper: According to the criminal complaint, Balletto called the girl a 'trooper' for not screaming in the box .

They all look so jolly on television, forging friendships in the basement and occasionally nipping upstairs to lay the table or snuff out a candle. But the truth of how most servants lived in Britain at the beginning of the twentieth century is a far cry from the soft-centred fiction portrayed in period dramas such as Downton Abbey, Upstairs Downstairs and Gosford Park. Clipping your master's toenails, ironing his shoelaces, spending 17-hour days doing back-breaking work with no employment rights were just some of the realities facing servants in late Victorian and early Edwardian Britain, according to a new BBC series. Then and now: A young 'tweeny' maid, left, in late nineteenth century Britain, and Downton Abbey's scullery maid Daisy, played by Sophie McShera. Servants: the True Story Of Life Below . Stairs explores the reality of life as a servant in Britain from the . Victorian era through to the Second World War. And it wasn't exactly like Carson, Anna, Bates and Daisy have it in Downton Abbey. Upon entering service, new servants were often given 'acceptable', easy to remember and generic names - Henry, John and William were popular choices for men, while many female servants were frequently named Sarah or Emma. Moreover, if female servants received unwanted advances from their masters, they had little power to stop them. In her new, eye-opening three-part series, social . historian Dr Pamela Cox - herself the great-granddaughter of servants - . explains that life for these people was much less 'cosy' than is . imagined in television period dramas.

And instead of partaking in a lively, jolly dinner after serving the family upstairs, these servants would live and eat alone in Britain's dark, damp, . dirty basement kitchens. Servants in grand houses fared little better. Staff in stately homes were kept hidden from the 'polite' eyes of their masters with complex mazes of hidden passages throughout the home, helpful when trying to enforce complete segregation. Moreover, strict servant hierarchy even separated staff from each other. Dr Cox explains that in 1901 one in four people were domestic servants, mostly women, and that these people were seldom seen as 'working-class heroes'. Servants tended to work seven days a week, often from as early as 5am until as late as 10pm, for very little money. And, unlike the kind and empathetic Crawley family of Downton Abbey, employers were unlikely to take pity on staff who were overworked, exhausted or ill - even if they were just children.

Prince William, wearing a blanket to keep warm, arrives at the Semongkong Children's Centre in Lesoth in 2010 . After a particularly trying day, some of us might unwind with a cup of tea or a hot bath. But Prince William, it seems, has a slightly wilder solution. The Duke of Cambridge has revealed he listens to animal noises on his iPhone to relax – inspired by the love of Africa he inherited from his mother. While his father Prince Charles has admitted he talks to plants while indulging in a little gardening, William confessed to having several hundred sound effects – such as crickets and buffalos – on his mobile phone, which remind him of the country where he proposed to wife Kate. In an interview about his love for Africa and his charity work there, Prince William said: ‘I regularly daydream. 'Africa is definitely one of the places I go to ... I have hundreds of animals on my iPhone. So if I am ever having quite a stressful day ... you can put a buffalo on in the background or a cricket.‘It takes you back instantly to the bush. And it does completely settle me down.’ Prince William revealed how his mother Princess Diana inspired his passion, saying her ‘infectious enthusiasm and energy’ for Africa and its people could not fail to rub off on him. He said: ‘She would come back with all these stories  and full of excitement and  just passion for what she had been doing and I sort of used to sit there, quite a sort of  surprised little boy at the time, taking it all in.’ And his connection to the continent is so strong that he chose to propose while on holiday in Kenya in 2010. He said: ‘I didn’t really plan it that far in advance. I just knew I wanted it to feel comfortable where I did it and I wanted it to mean something, other than just the act of getting engaged. ‘[Kate] understands what it means to me being in Africa.’ William was speaking in a documentary, Prince William’s Passion: New Father, New Hope, which looks at his commitment to conservation in Africa. The Prince, who is royal patron of conservation organisation Tusk Trust, said his ‘protective’ instinct has kicked in since the birth of Prince George in July. He said he has been spurred on to do more to protect ‘vulnerable’ wildlife, such as cheetahs, one of his favourite animals. He said: ‘Suddenly you start thinking of like, wow, there is stuff you want to safeguard for the future. I’ve always believed it, but to actually really feel it as well, it’s coming through powerfully now as well.’ He also revealed how he has become more emotional since the birth of his son. Listen up: William plays buffalo cries to help him 'settle down' and relax . Prince William is following in the footsteps of both of his parents in terms of his love for Africa, but particularly Charles who fell for the continent partly thanks to his close friendship with South African writer Laurens Van der Post. It was even once reported that Van der Post, Charles's spiritual guru, taught the Prince of Wales how to talk to plants. When Charles and Diana announced who would be godparents of Prince William, it was Prince Charles' spiritual guru who made the cut. Sir Laurens Van der Post was a South African writer and long time friend of the Queen Mother's family, the Bowes-Lyons. He grew up on a South African farm in Philippolis but emigrated to London when he was 21. Despite this, his heart remained in Africa and 11 of his 20 books are about the continent. Van der Post died in 1996 aged 90 but his legacy seems to be living on in the two Princes. ‘The last few weeks have been a very . different emotional experience – something I never thought I would feel . for myself,’ he said. ‘I find, even though it’s only been a short period, that a lot of things affect me now.’ In the interview, William admitted that his visits to Africa help him to indulge the side of his character that craves a sense of normality, away from the maelstrom of royal life. ‘It’s escaping to a kind of different world where I am just who I normally am anyway, and I can let that side, that sort of slightly immature, silly person come out a bit more than I normally do,’ he said. ‘There’s not sycophants or anything like that. You’re very much treated as one of the team, and if you’re not pulling your weight, you’re told to man up and get on with it.’ But he might have to wait a while for his next trip to Africa. ‘I think as soon as George grows up a little bit more [I’ll go],’ he said, before joking: ‘I will be hung [sic] if I go now ... [but] it’s definitely a plan of mine to go back.’ The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will make their first red carpet appearance together since the birth of their son on Thursday at the Tusk Trust’s Conservation Awards in London, where the Duke will present the Prince William Award for Conservation in Africa. Prince William’s Passion: New Father, New Hope will be shown on ITV at 6pm on Sunday September 15 and on CNN International at 3am, 6am, 12pm, and 8pm on Monday September 16.","The Duke of Cambridge has revealed he listens to animal noises on his iPhone to relax .

From Mariah Carey's purple-only eating plan to Beyonce's maple syrup cleanse, bizarre celebrity menus are a regular cause of controversy. But while Hollywood's food crazes are usually assumed to be a modern phenomenon, the January 1929 issue of American magazine Photoplay, unearthed by Jezebel.com, proves that there's nothing new about fad diets. In an article entitled Diet - The Menace Of Hollywood, writer Katherine Albert explains why eating like Joan Crawford and other period stars could prove problematic. On Hollywood's unappetising menu is a breakfast of hot water (0 calories) and eight tablespoons of consomme . Actress Joan Crawford looking svelte for the 1955 film Johnny Guitar . 'Diet!,' Albert writes. 'It has put one world famous star in her grave, has caused the illness of many others, has wrecked careers and has become, largely through its practice in Hollywood, the Great American Menace!' Albert then goes on to compare the 'star diet' to a correct diet compiled by one Dr Willis 'from works of the most famous authorities on diet'. On Hollywood's unappetising menu is a breakfast of hot water (000 calories, says Dr Willis) and eight tablespoons of consomme [clear soup], two saltine crackers and a quarter of a pound of tomatoes for lunch - total calorific intake, a meagre 138. For supper, the 1929 A-list diet consists of cottage cheese, two ounces of pineapple and a glass of buttermilk, which together bring the total day's calories to a skinny 305. By contrast, the diet recommended by Dr Willis, which, he says, will have you dropping between two and three pounds per week, includes roast beef lunches and a breakfast of scalloped cod and stewed tomatoes. Albert alleges that actress Pola Negri 'took 10 pounds off' with a 'spinach and egg' diet . The writer blames Hollywood's diet demands for the death of actress Barbara LaMarr, who died aged 29 . Breakfast: . Cup of hot water (calories - 0) Luncheon: . 8 tablespoons of consomme (13Kcal) Two saltine crackers (100Kcal) 1/4lb tomatoes (25Kcal) Dinner: . Cottage cheese (50Kcal) 2oz pineapple (50Kcal) 1 glass buttermilk (67Kcal) Total: 305 . * Don't try this at home . Albert goes on to fulminate against 'Shylock' producers who when they demand a pound of flesh from their actresses, also 'demand a part of the lifespan of the star'. What's more she adds, the Hollywood diet craze is responsible for increasing numbers of tuberculosis cases and will 'produce a race of anaemic tubercular weaklings' if allowed to continue. She also blames Hollywood's diet demands for the death of actress Barbara LaMarr, who died aged 29 of tuberculosis in 1926. Another anecdote concerns Joan Crawford, who, the writer claims, she saw having a lunch composed of just 'a few tablespoonfuls of cold consomme, a dish of rhubarb and half a dozen crackers thickly spread with mustard.' Albert also alleges that actress Pola Negri 'took 10 pounds off' with a 'spinach and egg' diet, comprised of six ounces of spinach and a hardboiled egg for breakfast, lunch and supper. Interestingly, another part of the article deals with camera trickery - blamed for promoting an unrealistic image long before Photoshop was invented. 'A skillful cameraman may arrange his lights so this condition is helped,' she complains. She even writes of a primitive version of liposuction undergone by actress Molly O' Day, who, says Albert, 'suffered acutely' in the aftermath of the operation. Modern Hollywood and its madcap diet crazes might appear to be a chilling modern phenomenon, but as Albert's article shows, celebrity diets have a long and inglorious history. The diet recommended to have you dropping two to three pounds per week, includes roast beef . Breakfast - 374 calories . 1/2 large grapefruit, scalloped codfish, stewed tomatoes, saltine crackers, one cup of coffee, one teaspoon of butter, one teaspoon of sugar . Luncheon - 654 calories .

Try to imagine a Jacuzzi crossed with a bicycle and you'll have some idea of what Hydrofit, the latest trend in aqua-fitness, is all about. Pitched as the perfect exercise for anyone - especially those whose joints can't handle hitting the treadmill - a leisurely spin on a bubble-bath bike sounds so much more like a spa treatment than a gruelling fitness class that I couldn't put my name down fast enough. If you're familiar with spinning - indoor cycling classes on exercise bikes, where instructors bark orders over deafening car alarm-style music - you'll know that cycling is hugely effective when it comes to improving cardiovascular fitness and burning calories (on average, 450 of them in 45 minutes). Water workout: Nicole tries the Hydrofit . But, thankfully, while Hydrofit also involves a static bike, that's where the similarities with this shouty and stress-inducing form of exercise end. Instead, Hydrofit takes place in private 'pods', which look more like giant high-tech baths, accessed through a half-height door. You enter a private treatment room, strip down to your swimming costume (a pair of shorts is also recommended, to protect your legs from rubbing against the saddle), don a pair of rubber 'aqua shoes' to stop your feet slipping off the pedals, climb in and begin. Frenchwoman Delphine Riahi-Botbol is responsible for importing the concept, which originated in Italy where it was used as a rehab tool in hospitals and clinics. 'As the doctors watched their patients use it, they noticed an unexpected side-effect,' says Delphine. 'Patients' skin tone improved. Their cellulite disappeared. It was really amazing.' Before long, the Aqua Bike - as it is known in France - was made available as a commercial product and 85 drop-in studios have sprung up on French high streets since its launch there three years ago. Now, thousands of notoriously svelte French women credit the machines with improving the tone of their legs, burning calories, improving cardiovascular fitness, eliminating water retention and puffiness, boosting circulation and even eliminating cellulite. So it's not hard to see why underwater spinning is now set to take this country by storm, too - with the first London clinic open, and clinics nationwide set to follow. Giant high-tech baths: Hydrofit takes place in private 'pods', accessed through a half-height door . Best of all, unlike land-locked spinning, it's still suitable if you're recovering from injury or keen on low-impact training. 'Traditional spin classes can be hard on the ankles and the knees,' says Delphine. 'Some people also feel lower back twinges, as it's easy to have poor posture on the bikes - especially when doing high resistance work. 'But the cushioning effects of the water minimise this in Hydrofit, meaning it's suitable for more people than standard spinning.' Before training, you're taken through a detailed assessment so that the machine can be set to provide a targeted workout. 'Generally, women do not want big legs,' she says. 'And as 90 per cent of our clients are women, we normally set the bicycle's resistance quite low. We want long, lean muscles and smooth toned skin. These bikes can give you all that.' To ensure you get the most out of your workout and don't just fall asleep in the bath, you're carefully supervised. A Hydrofit helper escorts me to a private room containing the magical bike pod, complimentary towels and bottled water. She adjusts the saddle and shows me how everything works. I'm handed a pair of posh headphones, which are wirelessly connected to a wall-mounted widescreen television. I settle for Saturday Kitchen; very relaxing. Once I'm comfortable, the door is closed and the pod begins to fill up with - let's call it 'refreshing' - water treated with Ozone (an effective form of antiseptic less harsh than chlorine). Water is never recycled, and each pod is thoroughly cleaned after each session. 'There are different settings depending upon what the client needs,' Delphine says. 'The water can be warmer if you want to build up a sweat and detox, or if you're using the bikes more for rehabilitation work.' Once the water reaches waist-height, things get interesting. There are lots of bubbles. Strategically placed jets pump out air and suddenly it's like riding a bike in a Jacuzzi. Although this isn't something I ever fantasised about doing, it's really fun. Of course, the bubbles are about more than just fun; they're there to improve your circulation, increase resistance and stimulate lymphatic drainage. As I'm getting into my stride, I start seeing coloured lights in the water. Thankfully, I'm not about to faint, there actually are coloured lights in the water. Chromatherapy (colour therapy) is another of feature of Hydrofit. It's based on the theory that the seven colours of the rainbow relate to the body's seven internal chakras and we are all drawn to the colour that balances our mental state. I'm not sure about that, but it gives the session a nice disco feel. Aqua Bike: Cheaper than liposuction - and certainly much less harrowing than a spinning class at a gym . One of the best things about HydroFit is that while it doesn't feel like exercise, there's a serious side to all this jiggery pokery. I am aiming to cycle 9km in the half-hour session and to vary my pace by alternating 15 second bursts of fast sprinting (where you stand up on the pedals) with a minute at a slow steady pace. A digital screen on the bike tracks my speed, resistance, distance and time, and my little helper pops in every five minutes or so to check I'm sticking to the plan. The resistance of the water is 12 times higher than air, so it's a pretty tough workout. Delphine tells me that although I won't feel tired in the water, my legs will feel wobbly when I get out - and she's right. I was sceptical that something that was so much fun could be taxing, but I did feel a bit knock-kneed after climbing out of the pod, and the following day my legs and bottom definitely ached. 'I recommend people come twice a week for 30 minutes a time,' says Delphine. 'Do two sessions a week and within a month you'll see a big improvement in the look of your legs and the tone of your skin.' I'm almost sold, but here's the catch; perfect legs don't come cheap. One half-hour session costs £30, and if you're doing the recommended two, that's £60 a week - although there are discounted rates if you book packages. At least it's cheaper than liposuction - and certainly much less harrowing than a spinning class at a gym. If money were no object, I would be there twice a week, giving it another whirl. hydrofit.co.uk, 020 7352 2546.","The Hydrofit is like riding a bike in a Jacuzzi .

A major alert is underway after it was discovered that a retired healthcare worker unknowingly had Hepatitis C while employed by the NHS. Thousands of people across the UK are being contacted after the obstetrics and gynaecology worker was discovered to have infected two patients with the virus. It is known the healthcare worker, who was infect for decades, infected two patients with the virus while working at a hospital in Wales, Public Health Wales (PHW) said. A major alert is under way after it was discovered a retired healthcare worker unknowingly had Hepatitis C while employed by the NHS. Image shows an artist's impression of the hepatitis C virus . At least 3,000 former patients are being contacted by letter informing them of the risk and a series of confidential helplines and a support service have been set up. Several hundred patients in other areas of Wales who may have come into contact with the health worker are also being contacted. In England, about 400 former patients are being contacted, while urgent steps are being taken to check historic patient records in Scotland and Northern Ireland. ‘It has recently come to light that the healthcare worker is known to have transmitted the virus to two patients while working at a hospital in Wales from 1984 until they ceased clinical practice in 2002,’ a PHW spokesman said. ‘A “lookback” patient notification exercise involving the review of at least 3,000 former hospital patients’ notes and records from the Caerphilly District Miners' Hospital has been announced by the Aneurin Bevan Health Board today. ‘Around 200 former hospital patients from two other hospitals in Wales where the healthcare worker practised for a short time are also being contacted. ‘Those patients identified as exposed or possibly exposed to Hepatitis C are being sent individual letters and asked to call a special confidential helpline, inviting them to attend a hospital clinic or, if they have moved away from the area, their GP for a blood test.’ England - from September 1975 until December 1983: . Wales - up until 2003: . Northern Ireland - from January to November 1979: . Scotland - from March 25 to July 3 1981: . He added: ‘Effective treatments are available for Hepatitis C and further information and advice will also be provided to anyone who needs it. ‘There is only a small chance that a patient might acquire Hepatitis C virus infection through surgical contact with an infected healthcare worker. ‘The risk is very low as this can only occur if the healthcare worker is infectious and leads or assists in an operation or procedure on the patient. However, even in such circumstances transmission is very rare.’ The healthcare worker is known to have worked at other hospitals across the UK prior to working in Wales, including 11 hospitals in England from 1975 to 1983. ‘Similar “lookback” exercises are taking place in parallel across all the hospitals in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland where the healthcare worker practised,’ the spokesman said. ‘Less than 400 women in England have so far been identified as having definitely or possibly had operations conducted by the affected healthcare worker. ‘They will be contacted directly by letter inviting them to call a confidential helpline, to discuss whether they would like to have a blood test arranged at their GP practice.’ As it has been almost 30 years since the individual worked in hospitals in England, records of women who may be at risk are in some cases incomplete, for example if the hospital has been renamed or patients have moved around the country, PHE said. In England, the helpline and support service (0800 121 4400) will also be in place from Thursday, for any woman who is concerned because they had an obstetric or gynaecological operation, or they gave birth, at one of the 11 hospitals during the specified periods. Dr Paul Cosford, medical director at PHE, said: ‘We have worked hard to identify women in England who might have been at risk of contracting infection with Hepatitis C from this healthcare worker and are contacting them to offer advice and a blood test for Hepatitis C, should they wish to have one. ‘I want to emphasise that the risk of infection is very small and that we are offering them testing purely as a precaution. ‘Around one in 250 adults in England have chronic Hepatitis C infection and it does not automatically lead to health problems. ‘Treatment can help clear the infection in up to 80 per cent of cases, which is why it’s important to identify anyone who may be at risk of having been infected so treatment can be started if necessary.’ A 'lookback' patient notification exercise involving the review of at least 3,000 former hospital patients' notes and records from the Caerphilly District Miners' Hospital (pictured) has been announced . The healthcare worker in question was infected with Hepatitis C but, in kind with most cases, suffered no symptoms and was unaware of the infection. As soon as the risk of infection was recognised, and a transmission was confirmed, a process of tracing their occupational history began, PHE said. Hepatitis C is a virus which can lead . to inflammation of the liver and cause chronic liver disease and, very . rarely if untreated, cancer of the liver. Most . people are unaware of their infection because the liver can still . operate when damaged and the virus does not cause any symptoms.

The drunk driver who made an online video confessing to causing a fatal wrong-way crash has turned himself in after being charged with aggravated vehicular homicide. Matthew Cordle posted a video confession on Thursday where he admitted killing Vincent Canzani in a hit-and-run in an unsolved June 22 accident in Ohio. Franklin County prosecutor Ron O'Brien says the 22-year-old faces up to 8 1/2 years in prison if convicted. Officials in the Franklin County Sheriff's department confirmed to MailOnline that he turned himself in on Monday afternoon shortly after the charge was announced. Cordle also is charged with a misdemeanor count of operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol. Cordle will be arraigned Tuesday. SCROLL DOWN FOR THE VIDEO . Video confession: The 3.5 minute video starts out with his face blurred and voice altered as he explains how he was driving drunk when he killed someone . Moment of truth: Matthew Cordle identifies himself when the effects are taken away and says that he will plead guilty to any charges that he faces stemming from the June 22 accident . The indictment alleges Cordle's blood-alcohol level was more than twice the level at which the state generally considers a driver to be impaired. The indictment comes days after the victim's daughter spoke out against Cordle, saying that the reason he made the confession publicly was so that he could try to get a lighter prison sentence. Angela Canzani believes Matthew Cordle, who says he hit and killed Vincent Canzani, 61, on June 22 in, was ‘totally misleading’ with his confession because he was already suspected of the crime. The accusation comes just a day after Canzani’s own ex-wife applauded Cordle’s decision to confess, calling him an ‘honest man.’ ‘There was a traffic cam. There was a . third car involved,’ Canzani told NBC News. ‘So people are kind of . looking at this like he’s just coming out of nowhere…Like he’s some hero . or something.’ Victim: Vincent Canzani was 61 at the time of his death (pictured recently at right) and previously served in the Navy (seen in his uniform in an undated photo at left) A hero is exactly how Canzani says her father’s confessed killer is hoping to appear. Cordle . has not yet been charged, but likely will be charged with aggravated . vehicular homicide with an alcohol specification, which carries a . maximum of eight years in prison upon conviction. ‘It’s . making it look like he’s confessing to a crime,’ Canzani said of . Cordle’s video, which was released this week to promote a not-for-profit . web start up called 'Because I Said I Would' which promotes the use of . 'promise cards' where individuals set goals for themselves. Though Cordle has received widespread praise since his confession hit YouTube, Canzani remain dubious. ‘If . he wanted to raise awareness, I mean, I would’ve commended him for that . down the road, but the video is totally misleading. The motives, I . believe, are so he’ll get a lighter sentence. Throwing stones? Angela Canzani, pictured here in an undated Ohio mugshot, says her father's confessed killer is no hero and is only looking to lighten his jail sentence . ‘There’s a way to go about it and that wasn’t it.’ On Friday, the . ex-wife of Mr Canzini told MailOnline she 'applauded' the decision of . Cordle - who now faces criminal charges brought by the county prosecutor. Cordle . says in the video he 'made a mistake' when he decided to drive his . truck home after 'drinking heavily' and hit the other car, killing Mr . Canzani, of suburban Columbus. The . video begins with Cordle's face blurred as he describes how he has . struggled with depression and was simply trying to have a good time with . friends going 'from bar to bar' the night of the accident. Cordle's face becomes clear as he reveals his name and confesses to killing Mr Canzani. 'When . I get charged I'll plead guilty and take full responsibility for . everything I've done to Vincent and his family,' Cordle says. Later, . he says he understands that by releasing the video he's giving . prosecutors 'everything they need to put me away for a very long time.' The . video was released in connection to a start-up called Because I Said I . Would, a non-profit aimed at encouraging individuals to stay true to . their personal commitments. An obituary for Mr Canzani says that he served as a missile technician for a submarine from 1980 to 1986. Since leaving the Navy, he flourished . as 'a gifted photographer' and was survived by two daughters and three . great grandchildren. Today, . Cheryl Olcott, who was married to Mr Canzani for 10 years, said that . she is praying for him - and even forgave him for not coming forward for . two months. Problems: The county prosecutor said that Matthew Cordle was considered a suspect in the case but had not been charged. In light of the video, he will presumably be charged with aggravated vehicular homicide . Mrs Olcott, . said: 'I applaud Matt for stepping up to the plate. He's taken full . responsibility. He is an honest man who has spoken the truth. It's . unfortunate that the whole cycle of events has happened this way. I pray . for Matthew Cordle.' Asked . if she would have preferred it if Cordle had admitted his guilt right . away, she said: 'You can't change what's happened, that's all I know. I'm not a judge. There's only one judge and that's the big guy upstairs. Matthew is a good man. I commend him for that'. Mrs . Oclott, who love in Norwalk, Ohio, said she'd followed the case closely . and remembered their time together fondly. 'There were a lot of good . times,' she said. She added Mr Canzani was an only child whose parents have died and said that he was estranged from his two grown-up daughters. She said: 'He had no-one. He hasn't spoken with his daughters his whole life. He didn't raise them.' Franklin County prosecutor Ron O'Brien on Thursday said Cordle was a suspect in the deadly crash but hadn't been charged. O'Brien said he saw the video on Wednesday and will ask a grand jury to indict Cordle for aggravated vehicular homicide. O'Brien said Cordle's blood sample from the night of the crash tested positive for alcohol and negative for drugs. In the video, Cordle says that at the time of the accident he consulted with some ‘high-powered attorneys who told me similar cases where the drivers got off.’ ‘They were convinced that they could get my blood test thrown out and all I would have to do for that was lie,’ he said. His pledge: Cordle, 22, said that he was fully aware of the legal implications of making the video . Defense attorney George Breitmayer III said the video 'is a strong testament' to Cordle's character. He said Cordle intends to co-operate with prosecutors. Police in June said Canzani, of Gahanna, died at the scene after his Jeep was struck on Interstate 670. Cordle ends the video confession by 'begging' viewers to not drink and drive. 'I can't bring Mr Canzani back, and I can't erase what I've done, but you can still be saved. Your victims can still be saved,’ he said. The video was released in conjunction with a not-for-profit start up called Because I Said I Would, which is focused around having individuals make commitments to themselves and their goals using index cards. A fan: Cleveland kidnap victim Gina DeJesus posed for a picture with the group's shirt after the founder met with her mother . Its website says that it aims to become a 'a social movement dedicated to bettering humanity through the power of a promise'. The organization was founded by Alex Sheen who was inspired by his father, who died of lung cancer last September. At his father's funeral, they handed out promise cards in tribute to how his father always kept his promises. In a message that was posted on the group's website when the confession video was published, Mr Sheen says that Mr Cordle was the one to reach out to him via Facebook message about the hit-and-run. 'After getting to know Matt, I can say with confidence that he truly regrets his decision that night. He describes the guilt he has as “insurmountable,”' Mr Sheen wrote in the post. 'Against all legal advice, Matthew decided to make this video and release it prior to any charges being filed against him. His goal is to raise awareness about the terrible consequences that drunk driving can have on innocent people.' Cordle's confession is not the only high-profile action the group has been involved with. After the three young women were . discovered in Ariel Castro's Cleveland home, Mr Sheen was moved to . launch a ten-day walking campaign across the state in their honor. Movement: The group's founder, Alex Sheen (seen closest to the camera) was inspired to go on a 10-day state-wide walk to raise awareness for sexual abuse victims after DeJesus, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight were found . Big finish: He ended the walk by being greeted by Gina DeJesus' mother at the site of the 'House of Horrors', which is just six miles away from where Sheen lives . He said that he lives six miles away from the now-razed 'House of Horrors' and was moved by the girls' perseverance. He used the walk as a way to raise awareness about sexual assault, and at the end, he was greeted by Gina DeJesus' mother. Mr Sheen gave her a number of t-shirts with the organization's name printed on them, and in return, she later sent him a picture of Gina wearing the shirt.","Matthew Cordle, 22, admitted to killing Vincent Canzani, 61, during a June drunken hit-and-run accident in in Ohio .

A popular British couple who were pillars of their local community have been killed in a horrific crash on holiday in the United States. Paddy Heazell, 77, and his wife, Julyan, 74, died when their rental van careered off the road and smashed into a tree on Sunday afternoon. The tragedy happened after the devoted parents and grandparents - married for 51 years - had been hiking in stunning Mount Washington Valley in New Hampshire, New England. Paddy Heazell (left) and his wife, Julyan (right), died when their rental van careered off the road and smashed into a tree in New Hampshire on Sunday afternoon . Paddy's brother Gareth, who is believed to have been driving the van, and his wife, Pamela, are recovering . The Heazells were travelling with Paddy’s brother Gareth, 62, who is believed to have been driving the van, and his wife, Pamela, also 62. They are understood to be recovering in hospital from injuries not thought to be life-threatening but have been left deeply shocked by the crash. Heartfelt tributes have been pouring in for Mr and Mrs Heazell, of Snape, near Aldeburgh, Suffolk. The well-known, well-liked couple regularly volunteered to help prestigious local organisation Aldeburgh Music and were passionate supporters of both RSPB Minsmere and Suffolk Wildlife Trust (SWT). Mr and Mrs Heazell’s three grown-up children were too distraught to comment last night as they tried to come to terms with the devastating accident. But they released a message through the Rev Canon Nigel Hartley, vicar of Aldeburgh Church, where their parents were married back in 1962 and still played a very active role. Mr Heazell (pictured) and his wife were much-loved members of their Suffolk community . Mr and Mrs Heazell, who also had one grandchild, frequently attended services at the church and sang in the choir. They were also members of Aldeburgh Music Club. Mr Heazell was treasurer and concert manager of the club for many years until recently. Canon Hartley, who had known the couple for the last nine years, said: ‘Paddy and Julyan have been very faithful members of our congregation. ‘Paddy carried the cross for us almost every Sunday in recent years. I have learnt a great deal from him in terms of singing. He was a very talented bass singer. ‘They were involved in so many different aspects of the town and will be greatly missed.’ He added: ‘They were prominent members of so many areas of church life and much loved by all who knew them. ‘They will be very sadly missed by so many people in the congregation because they touched so many lives. ‘Their contributions to the town and church are something that will be remembered for many years.’ A close family friend, who didn’t want to be named, said: ‘Paddy and Julyan were two of the kindest, most generous people I have ever met and the gap this leaves in the lives of so many will be enormous.’ Mrs Heazell’s parents, Arthur and Muffet Harrison, were personal friends of iconic composer Benjamin Britten. Muffet was heavily involved in the early years of the area’s famous Aldeburgh Festival. It was here that Mrs Heazell met her husband-to-be and the couple carried on the tradition, helping out whenever they could. Harry Young, general manager at Aldeburgh Music, said: ‘I last saw Paddy 10 days ago. He was giving his time by invigilating an exhibition of printmaking in our gallery - a role normally carried out by new volunteers wishing to become concert hall ushers. ‘That Paddy should be doing this after decades of managing the front of house was entirely typical of such a generous man. He had an almost elder statesman-like role within the 150-strong body of ushers. ‘Paddy would always make a speech at the annual eve-of-festival dinner, where he would entertain and rally the volunteers. ‘We will miss them both hugely - kind, giving, cultured people who played a significant role here and who provided a precious link to the earliest days of the Aldeburgh Festival.’ Mr Heazell was headmaster of top London preparatory school, The Hall, from 1976 to 1991. He also served as president and chairman of the Independent Association of Prep Schools. Paddy was a keen local historian and writer. He featured in his local newspaper, the East Anglian Daily Times, last year after writing the well received The Hidden History of Orford Ness, a secret wartime military weapons~ testing site. Enthusiastic bird-watcher Mrs Heazell volunteered at RSPB Minsmere nature reserve and was also a leading member of Suffolk Wildlife Trust’s Alde and Blyth local group. Adam Rowlands, senior site manager at Minsmere, said: ‘Julyan was a valued member of the volunteer team for a number of years, welcoming visitors to the site and providing them with information to enhance their visit. ‘Her interest and passion for the natural world was an inspiration. She was well known locally and will be sadly missed.’ Julian Roughton, chief executive of Suffolk Wildlife Trust, said: ‘They were very active, community-minded people. ‘Julyan had been involved with the trust for nearly 25 years. She was a very warm and enthusiastic person who was just a pleasure to have as a supporter. ‘She was very much involved in her local group and was passionate about helping the trust - both in terms of raising funds and increasing its profile.’","Paddy Heazell, 77, and wife, Julyan, 74, were being driven by a relative ."

Matt Lauer has spoken out about Ann Curry's rocky departure from the Today Show saying that he purposefully tried to keep quiet in the aftermath even though many saw him as the reason for her departure. The anchor said that while he was 'disappointed' by the way the ousting of Curry was handled publicly, he knew that there was nothing he could do. 'Does anyone want to see a person who’s making the money that the newspapers say I’m making complaining, “Woe is me, my life is terrible, and people are being unfair”? No one would’ve had any patience for that. I wouldn’t have any patience for that,' he told Esquire magazine. Tense: Matt Lauer said that he was 'incredibly frustrated' over the past two years since he was largely blamed for the forced departure of his co-anchor Ann Curry . That was the only time he mentioned the anchoring upheaval specifically, though there were two other very clear digs at his former colleague. In one, he said that if he were to offer up-and-coming broadcasters his career, they would all take it in a heartbeat. The interesting part of the anecdote came in the way that he described the offer, and in turn, his time at NBC. He told the hypothetical newcomers: 'You’re going to have twenty years as host of the Today show, and eighteen of those years are going to be so unbelievably fantastic that you’re going to think you’re living in a fantasy world. And one or two of those years is going to be incredibly frustrating and challenging'. There was no mention of his current co-anchor, Savannah Guthrie, but he did circle back to Katie Couric, who was at the couch beside him in the 1990s through to 2006. The replacement: Savannah Guthrie came in to take over for Curry in June 2011 . Connection: Lauer said that his relationship with Katie Couric was more than just 'chemistry', it was a bond that came from covering stories like the attacks of September 11, 2001 . 'There’s a difference between good chemistry and a bond. Chemistry is something you have with somebody you meet — or you don’t. It’s an intangible. It may be superficial. It’s much harder to put your finger on than a bond. Broadcasting through 9/11 together, like Katie Couric and I did, creates a bond,' he said. The interview, which came more in the form of a series of espoused wisdom than an article, included the 55-year-old's reflections on his father and mother, but most saccharine moment came when he spoke about his children. 'If I feel like I’ve done a great job during an interview with the president of the United States live in the Oval Office, it doesn’t give me a tenth of the good feeling of going to the school play and making eye contact with my kids as they’re onstage delivering their lines. Nothing compares with that moment of connection,' he said. Doting: Lauer said that no interview is as good as a shared connection with his children- seen holding his daughter Romy's hand (he also has two sons named Jack and Thijs who are not pictured) Ever since Ann Curry made her weepy departure from the Today Show in June 2011, and Lauer has tried to remain tight-lipped throughout it all. He gave one interview to New York magazine in March where he said that he had not spoken to Curry since his departure because his mind was elsewhere. 'Because I’m concentrating on doing the show, not concentrating on spinning the damage and trying to end the negativity on a daily basis,' he told the magazine.","Matt Lauer's former co-anchor Ann Curry was fired in June 2011 and many placed the blame on Lauer .

It's not clear why he lost consciousness, Detective John Cleary said. He was taken, unresponsive, to Hackensack University Medical Center and died Wednesday night. A co-worker at the plant, Kalifi Thomas, tried to save Campbell and managed to pull him off the vat but couldn't revive him. Thomas of Elizabeth was treated and released. Dennis Monks, Carlstadt’s emergency services chief, told NJ.com that the vat contained the chemical toluene and was capable of holding at least 500 gallons. The accident occurred in a tank located behind a two-story, concrete manufacturing building, witnesses told the website. Hospital: Campbell was taken, unresponsive, to Hackensack University Medical Center, pictured, and died Wednesday night . Monks said firefighters hosed down the two men to decontaminate them and emergency medical workers administered first aid. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration arrived on the scene around 5 p.m. and is investigating the incident. The Bergen County Hazmat Team were also called. According to the news website, Hartin Paint was cited in 2007 for serious violations involving flammable liquids and the storage of materials that created a hazard and a number of 'less than serious' violations involving flammable liquids and respirators, which are used to protect workers. The company was initially fined $3,000, but eventually entered into a settlement that allowed it to pay $1,350.

An award-winning film-maker has launched a blistering attack on BBC bureaucrats who treat experienced producers like beginners and would not know a good programme ‘if it hit them in the face’. Tony Palmer, who has made dozens of acclaimed films, warns that creativity is being stifled by a culture of ‘arrogance’ among commissioners of arts programmes, who prefer form-filling to film-making. Mr Palmer made the comments after being asked by his friend Tony Hall, the BBC’s new director-general, to prepare a brief on what  is wrong with the BBC’s arts department. Outspoken: Film director Tony Palmer launched a blistering attack on BBC bureaucrats . The written response could not have been more scathing. Mr Palmer wrote: ‘I speak on behalf of legions of hard-pressed independent producers. The rudeness and arrogance of many of your commissioning editors beggars belief. ‘I could give countless examples of phone calls made, letters written, emails sent, which are ignored –  my experience is common to every single independent [film-maker] I know, and that’s lots. ‘The present lot give the impression, at least in the arts, that they couldn’t care less, except if it reflects well on them.’ He finished his diatribe by saying: ‘Along with most people I know we are all hoping you rescue the place, so GOOD LUCK!!!’ Request: New BBC director general Tony Hall, pictured on his first day in the job, asked Mr Palmer for advice on how to revive arts programming . Mr Palmer has been showered with Baftas and international awards for his films on arts figures. His 1983 production on composer Richard Wagner, starring Richard Burton, was described by the Los Angeles Times as ‘one of the most beautiful films ever made’. Mr Palmer sent the letter a few weeks ago. The director-general has reassured him: ‘I’m doing my best.’ Ironically, Mr Palmer has since received a routine invitation from the Corporation that he judged so patronising he opted not to attend the event in question. Acclaim: Mr Palmer's 1983 production on composer Richard Wagner, starring Richard Burton (pictured in the film) was described as 'one of the most beautiful films ever made' The invitation, to a general meeting on how to pitch factual ideas to BBC commissioning editors, advised recipients to ‘think about the audience’. Mr Palmer said the main criteria for commissioning a programme used to be whether the film-maker could convey passion for the subject, but now the BBC relies too heavily on focus groups. Creativity is further stifled by form-filling. Mr Palmer said he was asked on one form if he understood the relationship between the BBC Trust and BBC management. He was not able to submit it until he ticked ‘yes’. ‘An invitation to pitch [ideas] is just box-ticking,’ he said. ‘Some idiot – probably paid £200,000 a year – has devised this, and some idiot – also paid £200,000 – is checking it.’ He described Lord Hall as ‘the best hope they’ve got’, but added: ‘I just hope he doesn’t get overwhelmed  by the size of the problem.’ Lord Hall was unavailable for comment, but his spokesman said: ‘The BBC has a rigorous commissioning process and all producers are asked to pitch in the same way so that everyone has an equal opportunity to put forward ideas. This is an extremely successful system.’ Mr Palmer also criticised Sky Arts for its handling of two recent films of his. He is furious that editors cut political content from Falls The Shadow: The Life And Times Of Athol Fugard. He has also been told that Sky wants to edit the anti-war content of Nocturne, his new film on Benjamin Britten. The public can at least see the film at BFI Southbank on September 2. A Sky spokesman insisted that any changes to Nocturne will ‘comply with Ofcom guidelines’. The BBC boss who was forced to resign over the ‘Sachsgate’ scandal was given a secret six-figure payoff, writes Miles Goslett. Lesley Douglas, the former controller of Radio 2, received  the payout even though she personally authorised the broadcast of the prerecorded radio show in which Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross left obscene voicemail messages for Fawlty Towers actor Andrew Sachs. MPs last night branded the payment an abuse of licence fee payers’ money. Payoff: Former Radio 2 controller Lesley Douglas . The radio show, which aired in October 2008, sparked more than 42,000 complaints, an Ofcom fine of £150,000 and the resignations  of Mr Brand and Ms Douglas. Tory MP Stephen Barclay last night said: ‘It can’t be right that the senior executive responsible for one the biggest BBC scandals in recent years  has been rewarded with a six-figure payoff.’ Ms Douglas declined to comment. A BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC does not publicly discuss individual contracts.’","Tony Palmer was asked for advisor by new director general Tony Hall .

Tragedy: Federica Iammatteo, pictured with her baby brother, died a day after getting a new tattoo . An ‘energetic and sporty’ 23-year-old has died hours after getting a tattoo. Federica Iammatteo, a student from Milan, was said to be ‘in perfect health’, before getting a new design inked onto her body. But the next morning she went into septic shock, haemorrhaging. That night her heart stopped and she died. Ms Iammatteo had visited a specialist tattoo parlour on Thursday afternoon to get the new drawing - to the right of her spine. She already had other tattoos in the centre of her back. But by Friday morning she felt shivery and had pins and needles in her hands and feet. She texted a friend saying she thought she had a fever. Her symptoms rapidly got worse prompting her family to seek medical help. She was seen by doctors at the San Giuseppe hospital in Milan, but as soon as she arrived she began to haemorrhage and was immediately transferred to the Policlinica, Milan’s top hospital. Medical staff advised her family to go home and that they would call if there was any change for the worse. Her father Agostino Iammatteo told Corriere della Sera: ‘As soon as we got to hospital she was put on a tube and the doctors did not hide the seriousness of the situation. 'We wanted to stay near but the doctor said there was no need, that they would call us if she got worse.’ Then on Saturday morning at 3am they were called by staff who told them she had died. Now her devastated family are seeking answers. Mr Iammatteo said: ‘You don’t die like this at 23 years old. She was full of energy, sporty. We want to know what happened.’ Visit: Ms Iammatteo, with her father Agostino, had visited a specialist tattoo parlour on Thursday afternoon to get the new picture inked onto her back . Sporty: The student was transferred to the Policlinica, Milan's top hospital, where she died .

Days before her death she had posted a picture of herself riding her red Ducati bike on Facebook. ‘So cool. you are the bomb!’ one friend wrote. Another wrote: ’Here comes the blonde. You are fantastic!!!!’ A Milan prosecutor has opened a manslaughter investigation into ‘persons unknown’, ordering an autopsy to take place this week.

His fans adored him, especially women. The most devoted, who followed him round the circuit of literary festivals, were dubbed the ‘Heaney-Boppers’. And with his majestic voice, and the twinkle in his slanting eyes – one friend joked that he looked like a drunken Eskimo – Seamus Heaney was a man who exuded kindness and warmth. But the Nobel Prize-winning poet, who died yesterday aged 74 after a short illness, had a tougher side too. He fought harder than anyone to reverse the decline in how we speak and write English. In an era of text-speak and Americanisms, when schools were busily scrapping rules on grammar, spelling and vocabulary, Heaney taught people to love English by encouraging them to learn its poetry by heart. With Ted Hughes, the future Poet Laureate, he compiled a glorious collection, The Rattle Bag, which since it appeared in 1982 has become the best-loved schoolbook in Britain. His ambition was to collect a panorama of poems that could easily be committed to memory into a single volume. He and Hughes had an infallible instinct for lines that, once read, would never be forgotten. When Education Secretary Michael Gove was widely criticised for saying children should learn poetry by rote, Heaney leapt to his defence. ‘I believe in people learning poetry by heart – definitely,’ Heaney said. ‘Most poets have chunks of poetry memorised.’ Scroll down for video . Family man: Heaney is survived by his wife, Marie, (pictured) and children, Christopher, Michael and Catherine Ann . Special In 1995 Irish writer and poet Seamus Heaney poses with the Nobel Prize for Literature for his work, which in later years included an acclaimed translation of Beowulf . 'A gift to the world': Former U.S. president . Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary, the former secretary of state, said . they were saddened to learn of the death of a 'friend' they described as . 'a true son of Northern Ireland' Heaney, a Catholic, was born on the . family farm in Londonderry in 1939. At 12 he won a scholarship to St . Columb’s College, a Roman Catholic boarding school, where budding . politician John Hume was also a pupil. Both men would go on to win a . Nobel Prize; Heaney got his for literature in 1995. While . at St Columb’s, tragedy struck when Heaney’s younger brother, . Christopher, was knocked down by a car and killed. Ten years later, in a . 1966 collection of his poems, Death Of A Naturalist, Heaney remembered . seeing the four-year-old boy’s little body in its coffin: ‘Wearing a . poppy bruise on the left temple/ He lay in the four foot box as in a . cot... A four foot box, a foot for every year.’ The . image is stark and the language is simple. Heaney prided himself on . plain poetry that was never pretentious. That didn’t always impress his . contemporaries, who were writing wild streams of consciousness and . hallucinatory blank verse. Heaney was ‘far from unfathomable,’ said one . critic tartly, as if being unfathomable were a virtue. But . Heaney ignored the critics, continuing to write in his own clear, . rational style. ‘In the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties,’ he admitted, . ‘there was a notion that order and discipline meant you were a dictator . in the making and certainly you were supporting [the war in] Vietnam.’ In fact, said Heaney, ‘Formal verse is easier. It’s freedom.’ Much loved: Heaney's work made him world famous but it was his sense of humour that also won him a great deal of affection . He . believed in the power of poetry to change the world. ‘When there’s a . crisis like 9/11, a bomb or something like that, there is a wish for a . language that will help, not comprehension but acceptance or standing up . to it.’ Though Heaney . fiercely loved the English language and its history, he didn’t take . kindly to being called an Englishman. He refused the offer to become . Poet Laureate after Hughes died, and responded in furious verse when his . work was included in an anthology of British poets. ‘Be . advised, my passport’s green/ No glass of ours was ever raised/ To . toast the Queen,’ he warned, before signing off, ‘British, no, the . name’s not right./ Yours truly, Seamus.’ He wrote elegies for friends killed in the Troubles but refused to condone the violence, and kept his distance from politics. Life: Heaney was born in April 1939, the eldest of nine children, and went on to forge a fantastic writing career, pictured right reading a poem at an event in June . Meeting: Heaney is introduced to the Queen by Irish President Mary McAleese during Her Majesty's historic visit to Ireland in 2011 . 'Between my finger and my thumb, The squat pen rests; snug as a gun' - from his poem Digging. 'Wearing a poppy bruise on the left temple, He lay in the four foot box . as in a cot. No gaudy scars, the bumper knocked him clear. A four foot . box, a foot for every year' - from his poem Mid-term Break. 'When History says, don't hope, On this side of the grave. But then, once in a lifetime The longed-for tidal wave Of justice can rise up, And hope and history rhyme' - from the play The Cure At Troy and quoted by then US president Bill Clinton in a speech about the Northern Ireland peace process delivered in Londonderry in 1995. 'It's like being a little foothill at the bottom of a mountain range, you hope you just live up to it' - Heaney on receiving the Nobel Prize and being regarded as the equal of WB Yeats . 'It was like opening the back door of our own house, looking out on the fields' - Heaney on the influence of reading his fellow poet, Patrick Kavanagh. 'The life of poetry at its most vital is a life of fear I think and panic that it will leave' - Heaney describing his worry that his poetic inspiration might run out. He . once said he had ‘an early warning system telling me to get back inside . my own head’ whenever politics was discussed. Though he left the . countryside and taught English first in Belfast and then in Dublin as a . young man, he did not forget his farming roots. He . fondly remembered watching his grandfather cutting turf for peat, and . taking a bottle of milk to the old man who would straighten up just long . enough to drink it before bending over his spade again. He pictured . himself working in the same way, digging out words with the nib of his . pen. Unfortunately for his besotted female fans, he was – almost uniquely among poets – a happily married family man. He . had two sons and a daughter with his wife Marie. He and Marie met in . 1962, and they fell in love during evenings spent with Ted Hughes and . his then lover Assia Wevill, drinking ‘poteen’ – home-brewed potato . whiskey – and reciting poems, while Marie sang folk songs. Unlike . many literary men, Heaney did not enjoy feuds. He was amiable and quick . to give praise, which won him friends. Even the notoriously grumpy . Hughes was happy to work with him. When Hughes died, Heaney gave the . eulogy at Westminster Abbey and said that no death outside his own . family had grieved him so deeply. But there was one notable enmity. Heaney disliked the downbeat poetry of Philip Larkin. A . poet’s job, said Heaney, was to lift up a lyre, or harp, and play music . to the gods. Larkin’s work, he implied, was more like someone drumming . on a kitchen sink. He . continued to win over fans until the end of his life. At one recent . reading, a young student was heard lamenting, ‘I love Seamus Heaney! I . just want him to give me a hug!’ With . his passion for poetry and his genius for selecting verses we all could . learn easily by heart, Heaney gave us much more than the promise of a . hug. He restored our love of the English language.","Irish writer had suffered ill health for some time and has died in Dublin .

Karen Corcoran Walsh is alleged to have left her 11-year-old step daughter home alone after storming out of her Florida home following an argument with her husband . Walsh, who runs the Inspiration for Youth and Families Center which helps teens addicted to drugs, was arrested on child abuse charges. The 51-year-old later told local media she was the victim of wrongful arrest and her lawyer said he hoped the charge would be dropped. According to a police report the incident began after Walsh and her husband Christopher had an argument at their home. During the row Walsh broke her husband's cell phone and told him to leave the house. After he left, Walsh also walked out leaving her step daughter alone in the gated community. Karen Corcoran Walsh and husband Christopher on Dr. Phil in 2010: She has been arrested on a child cruelty charge that began with an argument between her and her husband at their home . Dr. Phil McGraw: Karen Corcoran Walsh and her husband Christopher appeared on his show in 2010 . The arrest report said the girl was 'scared, when she walked out of the bedroom to find herself home alone. 'She had no cell phone, no house phone, no house key or no note left saying where her mother had left to. (The girl) explained she left the home unlocked and proceeded to walk down the road to the guard gate barefoot. The road was very dark and unsafe for a child to walk at night alone.' The guard called Boca Raton Police who located Karen Walsh and placed her under arrest - charging her with 'Neglect of a Child.' Walsh later posted $3,000 bond. In an interview with the Sun Sentinel newspaper she denied any wrongdoing. 'There was no wrongdoing on my part, and I would really like my name to be cleared,' Karen Walsh said. 'I did the best that I could in this . situation and that's it. Unfortunately, I feel that the investigation . was not thorough and had they given it its due time, they would have . found that there was no wrongdoing on my part.' Walsh, a former teacher, is known for her work with troubled children. Her fame led her to being invited on to the Dr. Phil where she talked about her work with teens and addiction treatment. With her husband she also owns an adult therapy treatment center in Fort Lauderdale. Karen Corcoran Walsh runs the Inspiration for Youth and Families Center which helps teens addicted to drugs . Walsh's attorney, Leah Mayersohn, said she's working with the police to resolve the issue and have the charges dropped. 'Why they arrested Karen is absolutely beyond me,' Mayersohn said. 'She certainly extricated herself from a situation that could potentially have been escalating, which was the right thing to do under those circumstances.' She said the child was left alone in a safe, gated community for 20 minutes or less, and that Karen and Christopher Walsh each thought she was with the other. Mayersohn said Walsh's arrest could affect her future ability to work with troubled children. 'She provides very valuable services to children and to adults in Florida who have suffered these issues,' she said, 'and this is a really terrible accusation.'","Karen Corcoran Walsh is alleged to have .

Furious: Military veteran Michael Matwyuk, 57, is suing the state of Michigan for violating his fee speech rights after rejecting his request for 'infidel' personalized license plates . A 57-year-old army veteran is suing the state for rejecting his request for a personalized license plate based on the word 'infidel'. Michael Matwyuk, a combat soldier in the Iraq war, has accused the state of Michigan of violating his free speech rights after denying his application for 'INFDL' or 'INF1DL' plates. While he considered the word a 'badge of pride', the state insists it 'might carry a connotation offensive to . good taste or decency', which is illegal in Michigan. Matwyuk was deployed to Iraq in 2004 and 2005 with an engineer detachment . and was hurt in Fallujah. He reportedly suffered brain injuries and hearing loss during combat. According to the lawsuit, filed in Grand Rapids yesterday by The . American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, Matwyuk and fellow U.S. soldiers embraced the word infidel - even tattooing it on their bodies - after insurgents constantly used it to insult them. 'We embraced it, we joked about it, we laughed about it, we called each other ‘infidel,’ ' Matwyuk, from Kingston, Michigan,  told Army Times. 'We’re . infidels, we’re absolutely that and we were there who did not subscribe . to the doctrine or belief system [the enemy] was trying to impose. 'We don’t subscribe to terrorism, Shariah . law and oppression. We are champions of freedom, and if that makes us . infidels good for me and good for the rest of us.' Defiant: Army veteran Michael Matwyuk (far right) said in his lawsuit he and fellow troops 'embraced' the word 'infidel' after insurgents constantly used the term as an insult . Matwyuk said he applied for the plate on the Secretary of State website late last year. His first request - INFIDL - was denied, but the website accepted his second request, INF1DL, according to MLive.com. However the state refused to issue the plate, saying it might contravene a Michigan statute banning plates that might cause offense. While the state allows plates that express various religious sentiments, it does not allow plates with offensive connotations. In a letter to Matwyuk, a department manager allegedly said the word infidel can be offensive 'because of the way it’s being used by radical elements', according to Army Times. Action: The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan filed a federal lawsuit in Grand Rapids on behalf of Michael Matwyuk . Rejected: Michael Matwyuk applied for the personalized plates on the Secretary of State website late last year but was rejected . Fred Woodhams, a spokesman for the Michigan Secretary of State, said he could not comment on specifics of the lawsuit because the Department of State had not yet reviewed it. 'We believe we have a well-established, long-standing process that balances a person’s desire to express themselves with the department’s obligation under state law to not allow plates that might be considered offensive,' Woodhams told Army Times. However Matwyuk insists he wasn't trying to offend anyone, as the word simply means non-believer, like the word atheist. 'It was because people overseas are saying, ‘Death to infidels.’ So who are we going to offend? Them?' Matwyuk said. 'They tried to kill me for a year, so I’m not worried about offending them. I already did.' Matwyuk claims in his suit that the ban is unconstitutional, violating his rights under the First . and Fourteenth Amendments. The suit argues the state law is 'unconstitutionally overbroad, vague and content-based, meaning it . allows some words, but denies others based solely on their message.' 'As a way to cope, we decided to take this word — meant to hurt and demean us — as our own,' Matwyuk said in a statement distributed by the ACLU. 'It’s a point of pride and patriotism that many of us identify with, just as we would identify with the word ‘soldier.’ This license plate is simply an expression of my service as an Iraqi combat veteran.'","Army veteran Michael Matwyuk, 57, is suing the state of Michigan for violating his free speech rights .

Queen guitarist Brian May has been criticised by Jewish leaders after describing the cull of around 5,000 badgers in south west England as 'genocide in the countryside'. Mr May made the comments during a visit to Gloucestershire to show his opposition to the cull in the county and Somerset to protect cattle from bovine TB. He likened the measure to genocide - a word usually used to describe the mass murder of people. 'Offensive': Queen guitarist Brian May, pictured at a protest against the cull last year, has offended the Jewish community by comparing the cull of 5,000 badgers to genocide . Anger: The cull of badgers in Somerset and Gloucestershire has sparked fierce protest . But he faced an immediate backlash after his comments were reported online, with local Jews describing his comparison as 'dreadful' and 'inflammatory'. Rabbi Anna Gerrard of the Gloucestershire Liberal Jewish Community said apart from being potentially offensive, using the term was incorrect. She said: 'The use of the word 'genocide' in this context is simply wrong. From an etymological point of view genocide means ""killing of people"". 'In particular I think high profile people need to be careful when they take a word like that out of context, especially when using it to emote others. 'From a Jewish perspective obviously . it makes people think of the Holocaust, in which not only were many . people killed but they were dehumanised to make that killing seem . acceptable. 'It has the potential to cause offence but I think that most people would just see it as a ridiculous thing to say.' Protection: The cull of badgers is the only way to stop the spread of bovine TB to cows, claim farmers . Jenny Silverstone, chairwoman of the Cheltenham Hebrew Congregation, said that Mr May's choice of words was ill-advised. 'Brian May obviously feels very passionately about the badger cull and we must not fault that,' she said. 'But the Holocaust was a terrible thing. I can understand if some of our members are upset by his ill-advised use of the term genocide. 'Let's put it into perspective though. He misused a word - I'm sure he didn't mean to say something atrocious.' The . badger cull is an attempt to tackle bovine tuberculosis, which is . transmitted by badgers and has led to the death of more than 305,000 . cattle in the UK over the past decade. Connection: Rabbi Anna Gerrard of the Gloucestershire Liberal Jewish Community said that the word genocide made Jewish people think of the Holocaust . The past 15 years has seen a boom in the disease, which is transmitted by badgers urinating on grass which is then eaten by cows. Farmers say a cull is the only way to protect their livestock, and the Government has approved a trial in west Somerset and west Gloucestershire that could see as many as 5,000 badgers killed. The current scheme, which will last for six weeks, is due to be repeated every year for the next four years, and is predicted to cut bovine TB by some 16 per cent. Two companies have been given the licence to carry out the culling. Defra and Natural England have kept their identities confidential, in case activists target them directly. Animal rights groups, which have received support from Mr May and Dame Judi Dench, say the authorities should vaccinate badgers instead.","Brian May made the comments during a protest visit to Gloucestershire .

The cheeky cub can be seen tugging on his father's mane, chewing on his fur and even smacking him on the end of the nose in a bid to entice him to play. But while the father initially returned his son's affections, he soon lost patience with the playful cub and snapped - baring his teeth at the startled cub. I warned you, boy... Luke the lion makes it clear he has had enough of his son's fun and games . The images were taken by photographer Paul Sutherland, 54, at the National Zoological Park in Washington, Columbia, US. He said: 'I'm connected with a number of people at the zoo and they invited me to come along when the lion cubs were born. 'Having been an editorial photographer I like to create images which tell a story or send a message. 'I spent a lot of time photographing the cubs, I went whenever I could. Every time the cubs came out there was a question mark over what they would do.

So much for my lie-in: Luke's nap is a no-no as far as the youngster is concerned . Seriously, son, take the hint: Luke looks like he is enjoying a cuddle...but that out-stretched paw is getting ready to swipe . 'When the adult male lion, Luke, is in the yard the cubs come out with the female lions. 'Interestingly many of the cubs head straight for dad, they're like ""hey dad look at me"". 'The cubs would jump on Luke to try and get his attention, just being playful really. 'But if Luke is grumpy he'll roar and as he does the mother lion gives him a telling off. He's a bit of a wimp compared to other lions so if he gets a telling off he'll tolerate the cubs a little longer. 'They would get five to ten minutes' interaction with dad before he would get tired and there'd be a roar. 'And if one of the cubs would make the mistake of grabbing his tail, Luke would get really angry. 'It's really just nature in action. Humans do it too. You annoy your dad that much, he'll snap and be like ""that's enough"".' Right, that's it! The cub takes a bite out of Luke's chin... and he's not happy about it . Fine, I'll leave you alone!

Some people struggle to pull off a sultry wink at the right moment, or, worse still, use them willy nilly at inappropriate times. But some animals, it seems, have no problem flashing a wink when they choose. Whether or not they are communicating with their single-blinks, however, remains to be seen. Trying to communicate? The thought of a giant polar bear trying to communicate with a sultry wink will probably fill you with dread. But one photographer finds it hard not to wonder if there's any meaning in it . But for one photographer who has collected a plethora of pictures of winking animals, it's difficult not to wonder if there's any meaning in it. Snapper  and Exodus tour guide Paul Goldstein might be forgiven for thinking the animal kingdom are trying tell him something with a tally of SIX creatures giving him the wink. They include a polar bear, a cheetah cub and an owl appearing to be passing on a conspiratorial wink. Squint or wink? Given the sun is shining directly at this lion, it's quite likely he's simply squinting, but there's always the chance he's communicating through winking . 'It would be easy to be anthropomorphic about this but I am beginning to think this is not co-incidence,' said photographer Paul Goldstein . The winking cheetah was snapped while chasing a Thomson's gazelle fawn . Paul, from Wimbledon, said: 'I have seen many extraordinary moments in the wildlife world from lion kills to drinking jaguars and cheetah and polar bear hunts to tiny tiger cubs. 'However in the last two years I seemingly have been pursued by winking animals. 'It would be easy to be anthropomorphic about this but I am beginning to think this is not co-incidence. Even cheetah cubs appear to be able to flash a perfect wink . 'It is almost as if they are checking that I have my camera settings correct, they then give me a conspiratorial wink as if to say 'you are doing it right and behaving sensitively towards me, here's your reward'. 'This is obviously humanising nonsense, but it does add a quirky edge to the photographs. Utter winkers, the lot of them.' Exodus tour guide Paul Goldstein might be forgiven for thinking the animal kingdom are trying tell him something with a tally of SIX creatures giving him the wink, including this owl .

If I'd know then what would happen to my tummy after four pregnancies, I'd have gone to work dressed as Madonna circa her Blonde Ambition tour, says middle-aged Lorraine . Underwear has dominated the week, making a guest appearance in most areas of my life. What can  I say? Things get unpredictable in a relentless heatwave. On Sunday, my two-year-old firmly rejected her much-delayed move from nappies to knickers. ‘No, thank you. I’m busy,’ she said when I repeatedly asked if she fancied a trip to the loo. Her preferred venue is the lawn. Anyone’s lawn. She stubbornly put her pile of new Marks & Spencer pants by the back door. The dog stood staring at Cinderella’s little face on the mat for ages. Just as I’m trying to get the smallest child into knickers, I’m delicately persuading the eldest she needs a bra. It’s becoming an emergency situation, frankly. But she finds talking to me about this so excruciatingly embarrassing that I think she’d prefer it if the supermarket checkout man relayed the news to her. Then I notice that the ever-so pretty young women at work appear to have introduced ‘wear your bikini to work’  day, soaked in heat as we are right now. Given that most of them are prettier versions of Gloria from Modern Family, this is depressing. Not for them - they look amazing in their tiny crop-tops and city shorts. But for me in the week I turned 45, it was further proof that my underwear must stay hidden for evermore. I curse the fact that I didn’t wear shorter skirts, tighter tops and fewer clothes generally in my 20s. If I’d know then what would happen to my tummy after four pregnancies, I’d have gone to work dressed as Madonna circa her Blonde Ambition tour. Really, I would. So, in celebration of being more than halfway through my life, statistically speaking, I had all my hair chopped off. The crisis of the underwear drove me to do something for me - that, and the ridiculous pressure of the to-do list that dominates a working mum’s build-up to the summer holidays. There are activity clubs, play dates, birthdays and craft wotsits to factor in. The days when school’s out are a non-stop, multi-layered programme of activity. And at this time of year, I always celebrate something more important than just being one year older. Yes, dear reader, I rejoice in the sisterhood. Surprised? You shouldn’t be - women are the glue that holds together the fabric of society. When needs must, we really do pull it out of the bag. School's out for summer: But while the children celebrate, parents must go into overdrive to entertain them . It’s the sisterhood that gets mums through school holidays. Without other mums metaphorically stepping into each other’s shoes, the whole darn system would collapse. Top of the class . Fifteen-year-olds in England get 950 hours of compulsory education over a year - more than the global average . The rota of collecting, dropping off and generally ‘just minding’ is a work of some genius - further proof that if we did run the world, the whole thing would be more peaceful and profitable. The school holidays are women at their best - a support network of fiercely organised thoughtfulness. It’s a wonder to behold. Petty school-gate niggles are forgotten, thorny PTA debates abandoned, the whole working versus non-working riddle is rendered irrelevant in the face of a schedule filled with free activities. We speed around the  country, laden down with children, before texting and phoning through locations and times to each other with remarkable accuracy. It’s an all-conquering system as we mentally download all the information on each other’s children and their holiday schedules. If you asked us to land a lunar rover on the moon during these weeks, we’d simply insert that into our plans, accomplish it and move on to the next task. This school break is like bootcamp for parents: we have to be ready, we have to be prepared and we have to be fit for purpose! It’s the ultimate debit/credit scheme of favours, without an official record book. And it works a treat. Embrace it, I implore you, and share what you learn over the years, please. If we’d run the economy like mums run the school holidays, we’d all be millionaires today. To quote Beyonce, and I feel one must every now and again: ‘Who run the world? Girls!’ Lorraine Candy is editor in chief of Elle magazine.","If only I'd know what would happen to my .

Defying mummy: Toddler Mabel loves running around without her sun hat (posed by model) We're in Cornwall on holiday for a week and for the first time in a million years of 'staycationing' here, the weather is actually on our side. Tagging along is a friend who doesn’t have children but has foolishly agreed to come with us. Our family routine baffles her. Why, she asks me on day three, does it take two adults and four children several hours to leave the holiday house? I have no answer. Whole species could crawl out of the sea, evolve and then become extinct in the time it takes for us to pack for the beach. I don't understand the delay because I start the exit countdown while everyone is still in their PJs. I even turn off the telly. No one moves except the toddler who inexplicably asks: 'What is Michael Buble?' While I cram everything into a bag, Mr Candy finds the buckets and spades. My friend packs her book. 'You won’t need that,' I say. 'No one with children under ten takes a book to the beach.' The toddler is the only child who has started to get ready. She's naked and running round shouting 'Bitch! Bitch!' No matter how many times we correct her she still can't say 'beach'. 'Get dressed NOW,' I instruct the other three who are still lying on the sofa. My friend is standing by the door reading her book. Finally, when we are all ready, Mr Candy decides to disappear to the loo. 'We leave without him,' I command, the captain abandoning one of the troops. Model family: Lorraine wishes she could get a perfectly posed holiday shot like her Facebook friends . Outside the toddler is lying star-shaped, face-down and howling. She can't find her purple shoe. 'We can’t leave without her though, can we?' my friend asks, confused by family etiquette and looking at her watch. 'Nope,' I reply before instructing the eldest to get the two-year-old's shoe out of the pan cupboard where she hides things. Make a splash . Experts say three is the best age to start teaching children to swim - any younger and they struggle to take instructions . At last we all leave. It's midday by now, and we're on the way to the seaside in blazing sun. Mabel removes her hat three times before we leave the garden. I lumber up the path after her struggling with my enormous bag, like a Blackpool donkey saddled with an overweight tourist. By this point the tide has come in and gone out. I'm dripping with sweat and about as patient as Gordon Ramsay. 'Put that hat back on now, Mabel,' I plead through gritted teeth. She refuses four times. Finally I say: 'Put it on now or a crocodile will come and eat you.' The six-year-old looks behind him nervously and my friend looks shocked. 'I bet that's not in the Gina Ford book on parenting,' she mutters. 'No,' I concede. 'But if you can find me a mum who has never used a similar threat in extremis, you can have the first shower when we get back before the kids use up all the hot water.' There's a pause. 'I haven’t slept properly for ten years,' I say to no one in particular. 'Something's got to give.' I notice Gracie-in-the-middle is wearing her home-made T-shirt. On the front it says: 'It's what's on the inside that matters.' On the back she's written: 'I'm a monster on the inside.' Despite the heat, my son has dressed himself in thick jogging bottoms and a long-sleeved shirt. He's also wearing socks. My eldest is in a wetsuit, as she refuses to apply sun tan lotion. We look like an oddly-dressed circus act on our way to a festival. This is when I realise the reason I'm not one of those mums who can post hundreds of beautiful family pictures on Facebook is because I've recklessly encouraged free will among my offspring! The neighbours sunbathing in their garden try not to stare at my noisy, motley crew. Their two children are top to toe in Mini-Boden, sitting on the lawn in their sunhats - a perfect Facebook family. Mabel throws her hat in the air as high as she can. 'Now the crocodile is coming to eat you,' she yells defiantly, then runs off giggling wildly. And we all collapse with laughter. We might be late, but we're happy. Lorraine Candy is editor-in-chief of Elle magazine .","The Candy family have been on holiday in Cornwall .

On Saturday morning, the ancient cuckoo clock on our kitchen wall marked a momentous change in our family life. As the moth-eaten bird hurtled out of its hole at 9am, I realised something was missing among the pile of Cheerios, spilt milk and general breakfast chaos: my eldest child. The baby that didn't sleep for the first five years of her life (and rose any time around 5am thereafter) was still in her bed, dead to the world under a pile of old soft toys and discarded clothes. And when she finally tumbled downstairs onto the sofa with a sigh, a new era dawned. Mother doesn't know best: Lorraine's pre-teen daughter has become grumpier and doesn't do as she's told (posed by models) She'd gone to bed as a little girl and woken up as a teenager. Really, she had. You may not believe it, but it was like witnessing the opposite formula of Honey, I Shrunk The Kids. Anyway, overnight everything changed, because my daughter had broken my heart. To use the teenage vernacular, I'd been dumped (or whatever the maternal equivalent of being dumped is). She'd grown up and I was no longer needed. Growing up fast: Lorraine wonders where her little girl has gone (posed by model) This reduced me to a simpering mess, trailing around behind her, desperate for some morsel of attention, a sign that she still wanted me in her life. I was like a lovesick ex. Right now I'd give anything just to clasp her hand in mine again, to cuddle her in her nightie or, God forbid, to kiss the pale freckles on her nose (the ones that she hates, but I love). We all know motherhood is a painful series of 'letting go' moments as your offspring speed towards adulthood - but this stage is a particularly cruel and brutal parting. Where the hell is my little ruby-haired toddler? Who has nabbed the roly-poly newborn I used to sing You Are My Sunshine to in the early hours of the new day? Will I ever see the proud, smiley face that I photographed in her uniform on her very first day at school again? I have suddenly acquired a quieter, more self-conscious version of my first born. Enter the ever-so-slightly grumpy queen of the one-word answer. I don't recognise her. Later, I try to talk to this sulky new model of my beloved toddler to find out how I might be able to win her heart again. I practise a sensible, rational conversation in my head, but as I get close to her while she watches TV, I just blurt out, 'Cuddle me!' It's not that she’s difficult or argumentative (though I fear this is what I would see if I peeked over the precipice into the dark valley of teenagerdom). She has simply become more grown up. This is, of course, my problem, not hers. She wants more time alone. Sleep tight . The NHS recommends the average four-year-old should get 11.5 hours of sleep per night . If I walk into a room when she's with her friends, they instantly stop talking. If I ask her to brush her hair, she flounces off in the manner of Joan Collins and doesn't brush her hair for days. I've lost count of the illogical things she's done since Saturday in order to prove the point that I am wrong about everything. 'That's so her,' I hear her saying to her sister one night after one of my maternal crimes (the bed-before-midnight rule, probably). So, fellow mothers, have I lost her forever just two weeks before her 11th birthday? Tell me, what are the rules for pre-teen girls? The arrival of this new personality has pushed me into the arms of another - my two-year-old daughter Mabel. She cannot get or give enough love. She is up for a cuddle every second of every minute, showering me in her addictive, slobbery kisses. Bliss. Her love is like a drug, which on the one hand satisfies my needy maternal urges, but on the other reminds me of what I have lost with my eldest, the one where the parental journey began. There’s no cure for the 'mummy blues' is there? There is no mood booster for the grief of letting the world's most wonderful memories slip through your fingers, lost in the sands of time? There are no more babies, so what's the solution to this temporary sadness? Doughnuts? Just as I'm figuring it all out, the smallest of my four provides me with some help. She subtly shows me there's a lot not to mourn as my offsprings' childhoods rush by as she launches yet another of her dirty protests in the potty-training battle. So maybe a new carpet is the answer to my woes. What with the combined forces of four children over the years, the one outside the loo isn't up to any more near misses.

When Kelly and Thom announced their split, she vehemently denied it had anything to do with her spending time with her ex Danny. Reports at the time claimed Thom was unhappy that Kelly kept in contact with her ex throughout their relationship. 'Loverat': Danny was alleged to have 'sexted' other women while he was being nursed back to health by Kelly after being knocked down by a bus . Kelly and Danny share custody of their dog Rocky - which they got together during their original romance. Meanwhile, retired rugby player Thom has also moved on and is dating former 90210 actress Jessica Lowndes.

Despite a eight year age gap and a split three years ago, the couple were photographed spending time together earlier this year. When Kelly announced her split from Thom in February, she insisted 'Thom and I mutually agreed to go our separate ways some time ago. It had absolutely nothing to do with a third party.' Just weeks after Kelly and former rugby player Thom started dating, the model announced she was pregnant with his child. However, tragically she suffered a miscarriage in May 2011 when she was five months pregnant. Kelly fell for Titanic star Billy on set of Three (aka Survival Island), which coincided with the end of her seven year relationship with Jason Statham. Despite their engagement, the pair briefly split in April 2008, but got back together, before finally calling things off in August that year. During their brief split, Kelly claimed she was 'too young at 28 to get married'. Kelly started dating action star Jason when she was just 18. During their seven year romance, Kelly lived with the actor in Los Angeles. She left him for Billy after falling in love, but insisted she was very honest with the English actor. She said in a 2004 interview: 'I respected him throughout the whole thing and I was totally honest with him. He doesn't hate me or think I humiliated him.

You wouldn't expect to see your meal to come to you in a bowl like this - not until after you'd eaten it, that is. But this is exactly the kind of experience that awaits diners at one of the many toilet-themed restaurants that are springing up across China in a craze for food that - hopefully- doesn't taste as it looks. The latest loo eatery, which opened in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, at the end of August, serves up lavatorial delights such as brown, curly wisps of soft serve ice cream - as well as more standard noodle, meat and vegetable dishes. Bog roll: Diners can choose from a menu of lavatory-themed dishes . All of them come in individual, toilet-like vessels, from bidets to potties to - in the case of the ice cream - little cups, where the plumbing at the back forms a dainty handle for diners to hold their end-of-meal digestif. The restuarant itself is equipped to resemble a bathroom, with showers attached to the walls and seats that look like toilet bowls topped with cushions in the shape of large piles of poo. Toilet restaurants have become popular across China, with cities including Chonqing, Shanghai, Kunming and Hangzhou boasting their own loo chains, and others in Korea and Japan. Beijing's version - Pian pian man wu, which translates as 'House full of poo' - has an extensive menu covering dishes that also includes the apparently signature 'super constipation black dry s***' ice cream, in this case topped with red beans and sprinkles in a mini squat toilet and coming at a price of 26RMB (around £2.60). Visitors may be surprised to find so may toilets in a restaurant, where many other eateries in China do not actually have their own toilet, and patrons are required to relieve themselves in public lavatories in the street outside. WC decor: The walls are decorated to look like the inside of a bathroom . Groom of the stool: Waiters serve patients at seats that are adorned with poo-shaped cushions . Toilet bowl: Diners share food from dishes shaped like sinks, bidets and WCs . Seated toilets like the ones that feature in the dinnerwear at these establishments are also less common in China, as hygiene tends to dictate a preference for squatters. In Beijing, a municipal law literally states that 'Only two flies' are allowed in a public toilet at any one time. Yet China is no stranger to quirky themed restaurants - including those of a less lavatorial nature. Beijing boasts a string of weird dining experiences that include a Kung-fu themed restaurant, where waiters perform karate chops as they deliver dishes, a Hello Kitty restaurant, and an Eighties schoolroom restaurant where entry is only on production of ID that shows you would have been at school in the decade. Outside of Asia, themed restaurants can be just as bizarre. The Hospitalis restaurant recently opened in Riga, Latvia, giving the chance to eat cakes that look like human organs and bandages on a dentist's chair and be served by waiters in doctor and nurse uniforms - or opt to be tied in a straitjacket and have their meal spoonfed to them.

Romance: Newcastle-born Donna Air has been dating James Middleton since February . For Daybreak viewers, it was hard to tell what came as more of a surprise. The sight of former lads’ mag favourite Donna Air presenting from such an upmarket yachting event – or the curious absence of her once famous Geordie accent. But given that she is now dating the brother of the future Queen of England, perhaps it is only natural that the model appears so desperate to leave behind her working class roots. The 34-year-old stunned viewers who tuned in to the ITV breakfast show yesterday after she began presenting a live report from the Cowes Week regatta on the Isle of Wight. She was introduced by presenter Kate Garraway as a ‘keen yachtswoman’. However, audiences were then left in a further state of bemusement when Miss Air appeared to put on a peculiar posh accent, slipping in and out of a plummy British drawl with faint traces of an Australian twang. Her attempts to wrestle with her natural accent came as an opportunistic Miss Garraway hijacked the interview after just two questions about Cowes, instead trying to engage Miss Air in conversation about her romance with James Middleton. Less than 60 seconds in to Miss Air’s report from Cowes harbour, Miss Garraway abruptly steered the conversation away from sailing, to ask: ‘Talking about going overboard, tell us about the blossoming romance with James Middleton. Have you gone overboard on him? How did you both meet?’ Miss Air giggled, before attempting to brush off the question by saying: ‘I’m here just to talk about Cowes week today.’ Despite Miss Garraway’s repeated pleas, Miss Air refused to elaborate before the interview was ended, with fellow Daybreak host John Stapleton left to tell viewers: ‘I don’t think we’re going to go very far with that one, are we?’ Viewers immediately took to Twitter to berate the star for dropping the thick North-East dialect she was once known for during her days as a child star on programmes including Byker Grove, and as a presenter for MTV. Scroll down for video . New voice: The former lads' mag favourite surprised viewers with her posh accent as she spoke at Cowes yacht regatta in the Isle of Wight . She was accused of trying to sound posh after it was revealed that she is now dating the Duchess of Cambridge’s brother. Natalie McCormack wrote: ‘Donna Air! What’s happened to your accent? I know you’re dating a Middleton, but you’re from Newcastle not Windsor!’ Joanne Salmon wrote: ‘I’m sure Donna Air was a Geordie? From watching her on Daybreak she appears to be some sort of fake toff.’ Katie D’Arcy said: ‘We know where you come from pet and they don’t sound like that there!’ Catherine Finkle added: ‘Donna Air seems to have forgotten her time at Byker Grove and the fact she’s from Newcastle with that hilarious accent.’ A further comment from James Matthews read: ‘Last time I heard Donna Air speak she was a broad Geordie. All of a sudden she’s talking with a Queen’s English twang?’ Newcastle-born Miss Air began a discreet relationship with 26-year-old James Middleton in February, after they met at 5 Hertford Street, a private members’ club in Mayfair. Blossoming: Miss Air has reportedly been given the approval by James' sister Pippa who he shares a flat with in Chelsea . They were initially reluctant to be seen together, but were soon spotted holding hands on dog-walking dates in Hyde Park, and out for drinks with Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie. Despite the age gap and their . different backgrounds, the relationship reportedly has the approval of . Mr Middleton’s sister Pippa, with whom he shares a flat in Chelsea. Mr . Middleton works for his parents’ party products website in Berkshire . and runs his own Cake Kit Company, which produces cake-making kits and . novelty cakes. By contrast, . Miss Air, the daughter of a builder who began her showbusiness career as . a child star in TV show Byker Grove, before working as a presenter for .

Since the split she has dated several . rich, older men, including John Dorrance IV, the London-based American . heir to the Campbell’s soup fortune, and Sam Goldstone, a Cheshire-born . millionaire. Miss Air . recently blamed the softening of her broad Newcastle dialect on the fact . she has lived in London for almost 20 years, despite the fact her . fellow Byker Grove co-stars Ant and Dec have retained theirs. She said: ‘Obviously I have lost my accent slightly, which I appreciate. But it’s because I’ve probably lived in London longer than I lived in Newcastle. ‘When I go home it comes back and when I get cross apparently, or slightly tipsy.’","Former lads' mag favourite gave report from yacht regatta on Isle of Wight .

The National Park Service says a pair of hikers made it down one of Colorado's highest peaks on their own after being stranded by an ice storm for two days. The news came just as the Park Service was organizing its latest effort to rescue the women from 14,200-foot Longs Peak in Rocky Mountain National Park. 'They are fine, they were not injured,' said Patrick O'Driscoll, a spokesman for the Intermountain Region office of the National Park Service. Conditions created by the ice storm were so bad that 32-year-old Connie Yang and 33-year-old Suzanne Turell had sent text messages urging rescuers to come quickly. Out of danger: Connie Yang (left) and her girlfriend Suzanne Turell were . caught out by an ice storm and had to spend two days trapped on one of . Colorado's highest mountains . Challenging: Longs Peak is one of Colorado's highest summits standing at over 14,000 feet . SOS by SMS: The mountain is around 70 miles northwest of Denver but weather conditions can change rapidly and trap even the most experienced climbers . The climbers provided their precise latitude and longitude and said they were not hurt, but raging floods at the bottom of the peak have left roads impassable and made it impossible for rescue crews to reach them. A text sent on Thursday morning read: ‘We need help. At top of longs peak. 13400 feet. Whiteout snowstorm.’ A follow up text sent shortly afterwards conveyed the hopeless nature of the situation. ‘Can’t move because of ice Storm, don’t know how long it will last. Been here for 1 day trying to wait it out.’ Desperate: Texts were sent from climbers Suzanne Turell and Connie Yang to Connie's sister who created a Tumblr page . No help needed... in the end: Two experienced climbers trapped for two days by an ice storm near the peak of a 14,000-foot mountain in Colorado managed to get down on their own . The texts were sent to Ms. Yang’s sister who set up a Tumblr page to keep friends and family up to date on the rescue. The women were hunkered down inside a tent in whiteout conditions. The couple, who live in York, Maine, are experienced when it comes to mountaineering and have spent several weeks on and off the Pacific Coast Trail last year and work for New Hampshire-based outdoor gear manufacturer NEMO Equipment Inc.

Simon Brittle, 45, has been jailed for eight years after biting off his girlfriend's nose at a motorcycle rally . A biker who bit his girlfriend’s nose off leaving a 'gaping bloody hole' in what a judge described as a 'bestial' attack has been jailed for eight years. Simon Brittle, from Rotherham, bent down as if to kiss his girlfriend Heidi Smith’s nose but instead took a large bite, leaving her face pouring with blood. Hull Crown Court heard that Ms Smith, 44, from Nottingham, had a hole looking like 'half a ping-pong ball' where her nose used to be after the attack at a three-day motorcycle rally at South Dalton, near Beverley in East Yorkshire. She was rushed to hospital where plastic surgeons grafted skin from her hip on to her nose, but the court was told Miss Smith, a civil servant, was left with a 'pointy witch' appearance after reconstructive surgery. The attack happened at Motorcycle Action Group's Into the Valley Rally in May, and was witnessed by Sally Pearson, who told the court she could hear Miss Smith's screams above the loud music as she was pinned to the floor. She said she brushed Miss Smith’s hair away from her face and 'realised at once her nose was gone.' Ms Pearson added: 'Her nose was missing. There was a gaping bloody hole where her nose should have been.' The witness said she stayed with the distraught woman as she made a tearful call to her mother in Derbyshire to tell her a man had just bitten her nose off and she should come and pick up her motorcycle as she was on her way to hospital. The court heard that Brittle had been in a relationship with his victim for four months, and that it was a turbulent relationship that Miss Smith was too frightened to finish. Two days before the motorcycle event in the grounds of the Dalton estate, Brittle sent her a message on Facebook saying: 'I’m really looking forward to f****** you up over the weekend - take plenty of bodyguards. 'Here’s to a happy rally season. You don’t know what I am capable of.' Philip Evans, prosecuting, said that on the day of the attack Brittle became loud, drunk and aggressive, threatening to stab one man and accusing another of sleeping with Ms Smith. Heidi Smith, 44, says she has had to move from her home of 10 years because of the terrifying attack on her . He  then began punching and slapping her before twisting her arm, forcing her to the ground and straddling her. Mr Evans said: 'He pushed his thumb in her eye socket. 'That was painful, she screamed out for help, but other people thought it was a couple in an amorous embrace. 'But Sally Pearson heard a chilling scream. Others described it as blood-curdling. 'Sally Pearson took hold of Mr Brittle’s shoulder and shouted at him. The defendant was calm and Ms Pearson said he had a blank expression. 'She was told to get off. He lowered his head, as if they were going to kiss. Heidi Smith then let out an intense scream.' Ms Smith fell back on the floor holding her hands to her face in a pool of blood. Defence barrister John Thackray said: 'There is absolutely no excuse for this behaviour. He is disgusted with himself. He was drunk. 'There is absolutely no excuse for this behaviour.  He is disgusted with himself.  He was drunk.' - Defence barrister John Thackray . 'He has gone from being a loyal partner, a good father and working man. 'There was a breakdown in the relationship. He lost his work, became a carer for his father and suffered from depression.' Sentencing Brittle, who admitted wounding with intent, Judge Mark Bury told him: 'The use of your teeth was plainly the use of a weapon. This was not just in public. This was in full view of Heidi Smith’s friends.' He jailed Brittle for eight years and imposed an indefinite restraining order on him contacting Miss Smith. Miss Smith has now had to move from the home she lived in for a decade as Brittle knew where where she lived. In a victim impact statement she said: 'I think it will be a long time before I can trust a man or be alone with them. 'I don't feel like me any more; I am embarrassed by this... I feel like people judge me' - Victim Heidi Smith, 44 . 'I don’t feel like me anymore; I am embarrassed by this. I have had to relive the incident over and over again as work colleagues asked me what happened. 'I have tried to ignore it, but it being my nose, I can’t hide it or cover it up.  I feel like people judge me and I think I have done something to deserve it. 'My family have been affected by this. My mother had to deal with me screaming down the telephone. I cannot imagine having a boyfriend again.' Four months after the May 4 attack , Miss Smith said she still had problems with her arm movement where Brittle had twisted it. She is also unable to pursue her hobbies of motorcycling and skiing because her nose is painful when she is cold. She added: 'I have to move from the home I have been in for 10 years. This incident has changed my life forever.'","Simon Brittle, 45, sent Heidi Smith a Facebook message saying 'Take bodyguards' two days before attack .

Property tycoon Donald Trump could be setting his sights on acquiring the FBI's colossal headquarters in Washington adding an enormous concrete block to his growing empire. Trump, who already owns several million square feet of prime Manhattan real estate, as well as buildings across the US, has hinted that he's interested in the vast building on Pennsylvania Avenue. The billionnaire has just completed drawing up a long-term lease for the city's Old Post Office Pavilion, a block west of the FBI HQ, to transform it into a $200 million luxury hotel. FBI interest: Donald Trump has said he is closely watching what is happening regarding the FBI HQ moving buildings, and may, or may not, consider getting involved . Donald Trump and Ivanka Trump, pictured last year, could use their $200million Post Office Pavilion hotel project in Washington, to boost their profile for future big developments in the city . And not long after the ink has dried, and Trump has turned his attention to his next major project. The J Edgar Hoover Building, considered by some a blot on the otherwise grand boulevard landscape it sits on, was built in the mid-1970s - a Brutalist architectural epoch that often instills strong reactions from people today. The General Services Administration (GSA), which manages real estate for the federal government, wants to cut a deal with a developer for the building, says the Washington Post. It is looking for a developer to swap a new building with its iconic 1970s block so the FBI can move into larger, more contemporary premises, the news service said. The iconic 1970s block is considered an eyesore by some, but Trump and his daughter Ivanka may take on the building as a project . The building has an open mezzanine and courtyard, but access to the courtyard is limited, and most of the first floor is closed for security reasons . Undeterred by the building's monstrous size and design, Trump seems keen, telling the Washington Post: 'We’ll be watching the FBI as to what’s going to happen.... Whether or not we will bid on it, we may, we may not. 'Now if we do as good a job as we will do with [the Old Post Office], people may ask us about it.' The timing, at least, could fit nicely with Trump's schedule, the Washingoton Post notes, with his developers finishing the Old Post Office in 2015 and wondering over the street to the FBI rubix cube to start the next job. The Trump empire has even crossed the Atlantic to Scotland where work began last year to construct a new golf club on the Menie estate in Aberdeen . An artist's impression of the clubhouse at the new golf course being built by Donald Trump, at the Scottish golf club . His pregnant daughter Ivanka Trump is managing the Post Office, and the pair hope the grand $200 million hotel project will boost their profile for future bids, according to the news service. It would add to a growing empire of buildings for th real estate family, that includes the Trump Nationla Dolf Club, in Loudoun, purchased  2009, the Kluge Winery and estate in Charlottesville, The Trump Tower, in Tampa, The Trump International Hotel and Tower, in Toronto, and many more.

A 42-year-old man twice convicted of sexually . assaulting children has been accused of repeatedly raping a six-year-old girl with her mother's consent. Seattle's Jeffrey Johannes Evenson, a Level III sex offender, was arrested yesterday after the girl, now aged nine, told a family friend she was sexually abused for at least two years. Police allege the unidentified girl's now-dead mother allowed Evenson, who she lived with from 2008 to 2010, to fondle her young daughter. Evenson was released from prison on child rape charges just two years before he and the girl's mother moved in together. He was under Community Supervision until January 2008. Kiro 7 reported the girl's father recently notified police about his daughter's claims. Investigators claim the girl's mother forced her to watch pornographic movies and be in bed with . her and Evenson when they had sex. The police report also said she allowed her child rapist partner to molest her child. The woman is now dead. Evenson was booked into the King County Jail with bail set at $500,000. Kiro 7 reported Evenson could have a life sentence because of the U.S. state of Washington's 'two strikes you're out' law for sex convictions. Evenson was convicted in 1990 of child rape and was in prison until 1994. Just four years later, he was convicted of child molestation, and was behind bars until March 2006. Evil: Evenson was booked into the King County Jail with bail set at $500,000. He could face life behind bars . Evenson was also convicted twice for failing to register as a sex offender. Prosecutors today noted in court that Evenson was previously investigated – but not charged – in two other sexual assaults. Seattle Pi reported Evenson was a homeless sex offender known to frequent Virginia Avenue in downtown Seattle prior to his arrest. Washington State Department of Corrections spokeswoman Norah West said Evenson was not predatory enough to be sent to the Civil Commitment Center for Sexually Violent Predators on McNeil Island. 'In 2005, Evenson was deemed ineligible for civil commitment because his forensic psychological exam results indicated he did not meet the criteria of a sexually violent predator,' she said.","Jeffery Johannes Evenson arrested for allegedly repeatedly raping a girl, 6 .

Today show star Savannah Guthrie has admitted she and her fiancé Michael Feldman are now finally planning their wedding - after months of 'procrastinating'. The slender TV host, 41, got engaged to her boyfriend of four years, political consultant and former Democratic adviser Mike Feldman, in May during a trip to the Turcs and Caicos Islands . And when asked about their wedding plans, Savannah told MailOnline today: 'It took us four years to get married - we're huge procrastinators! 'When we started to talk about the kind of wedding we wanted, we didn't know how many people to invite, where to have it, small or large...and then we'd give up and go and watch reality TV. 'But now we're going to start organising, we will get married soon! Mike's a great guy, he's very smart and sweet.' Wedding planner: Savannah Guthrie and Michael Feldman are finally organising their wedding, the Today show co-host says . Announcement: Today co-host Al Roker shared this picture of Savannah showing off her ring after she got engaged to boyfriend of four years Mike Feldman . Mr Feldman, 44, was a former aide to Al Gore and heads up a successful communications advisory firm based in Washington, D.C. and New York. And Savannah recently admitted to Elle magazine: 'I would love to have kids. I hope so, if we're lucky and blessed, but who knows what life holds, you know? I'm 41 years old.' While she works in a newsroom, Savannah admitted no-one noticed her large diamond engagement ring after she returned to work following Mike's proposal. Laughing, she recalled: 'I came in to work, I thought people would notice, but when they didn't, I lifted my hand up, and it wasn't until I was on set that a producer came over to me before we went on air and said 'what is that on your finger?!' They'd all been zooming in on the ring in the control room.' Her co-star Matt Lauer, she said, insisted that he HAD noticed the ring - but said he had not wanted to be the first to ask if she was engaged. However, he was the first to tweet a picture of the amazing sparkler. After a troubled year, where the NBC breakfast show lost its top slot title to ABC's Good Morning America and was embroiled in a row over former host Anne Curry's firing, Savannah said: 'I feel like it's just clicking now.' Although Matt's NBC contract expires . at the end of 2014, he insisted he had no . plans to leave Today, adding: 'The new direction of the show has me more . invigorated than I've been in a long time.'

Cohorts: Savannah Guthrie and Matt Lauer on set in July . On Monday, Matt and Savannah will launch the newly revamped Studio 1A at Rockefeller Plaza, featuring a mostly orange high-tech set and updated sunrise logo, as part of a huge bid to revamp the actual show. New NBC News president Deborah Turness, a Brit who has been in the job for five weeks after running ITV News in London, insisted: . 'We are a news show. The No. 1 reason (viewers) tune in to our show is . to find out what's going on in the world. It's about setting the agenda . and getting the exclusives. We can do this better than anyone else.' She referred to a string of recent exclusives including Matt's interview with shamed TV chef Paula Deen, Savannah's chat with disgraced New York Mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner and an interview with Bradley Manning's lawyer David Coombs who revealed his client now wanted to be known as Chelsea - and was transitioning to a woman. The set is not yet finished yet- and the actual desk which will now be placed on a revolving floor has yet to be moved in, and Savannah said: 'I think we'll be here all weekend, we'll need to have some rehearsal, we need to work out what looks good, and the crew need to work things out.

The endangered cat was being mauled by five ferocious females when one of them accidentally brushed against a high-voltage wire and reared back in shock.

The white cat had been cornered by the five lionesses following a territorial battle between her pride and theirs. The two groups, referred to as the Ross and Giraffe prides, had been involved in a vicious fight, which saw the beasts hitting, mauling and biting each other. The lioness, who is part of the Giraffe pride, was left behind when the rest of her group retreated without her. The ferocious battle, which unfolded at Kruger National Park in South Africa, was caught on camera by game ranger and photographer Ken Whyte. Cornered: The rare white lion squares up to her attackers at the safari park . Vicious: She bares her teeth in a bid to keep the Ross pride members away . 'This was an incredible one-of-a-kind experience as the white lion is a rare and treasured animal - with sightings becoming few and far between,' said the 22-year-old. 'To see this rare animal being cornered, . submitting and then being attacked was a sight that would bring goosebumps to . the most seasoned guides. 'Although it was a fast-paced and . vicious battle, the fact she managed to escape with minor wounds made it . all the more amazing.'

A 93-year-old woman who was allegedly raped by a 17-year-old neighbor who broke into her house in the middle of the night has detailed the terrifying ordeal she wishes she could forget. 'I want to forget about it,' Amelia Rudolf, from Anderson, Indiana, said as she held her daughter's hand tightly. 'I'll never forget it.' The great-great-grandmother, who suffered the brutal attack on July 16, said she wanted to come forward with her story in the hope that it will inspire other rape victims to contact authorities. Speaking with the Indianapolis Star, she detailed her horror at getting up in the night to use the bathroom and finding a teenager, whom authorities named as Iquise Taylor, inside her bedroom. Heartbroken: Amelia Rudolf, 91, has recounted how she wanted to die when she was sexually assaulted by a teenager who broke into her home in July. She said she will never be able to forget the attack . 'When he grabbed me I . just had a feeling, like, ""Oh, my gosh, is this true?""' she said. 'I thought, ""Am I . dreaming this or what?"" 'When I kind of come to, I went in the kitchen, . and I saw that door, the way it was broken into. I thought, ""Oh my God, . I'm not dreaming, that it's true"".' She added: 'I felt like I wish I could die. I wish it wasn't true.' Mrs Rudolf immediately called family members who contacted authorities. Mrs Rudolf has not been able to return to the house built by her late husband, Charles, a mailman, where they raised their four children. Instead, she has been staying with relatives. Support: Mrs Rudolf is pictured meeting Indianapolis Colts Andrew Luck at Colts training camp in Anderson in August after her daughters, pictured, contacted them to say she was a fan . Fighter: Mrs Rudolf sits with one of her daughters, Carol Fite, in their home in Anderson, Indiana . 'It took me away from home,' she said. 'I feel like I can't go back to my home.' Her family has supported her through the police interviews and press conferences, and even contacted the Indianapolis Colts - Mrs Rudolf's favorite football team - to explain what had happened. Mrs Rudolf, who has eight grandchildren and seven great-great grandchildren, was stunned when she was invited to visit their training camp. They also invited her to a season home opener, where she went on the field before the game and met the players and Coach Chuck Pagano. Her daughter, Tresa Hale, said her mother drew strength from Pagano, who has fought cancer. 'I felt like he gave her strength just by being there and letting us know how he fought his battle with the support and love of his family, his faith and positivity,' she told The Star. Sickening assault: Iquise Taylor, who lived a block from his alleged victim, allegedly broke into her home, went to her bedroom and attacked her when she got up to use the bathroom.

Now her family is looking to the future - although she is dreading seeing Taylor during his trial. 'I'd hate to look at him,' she said. 'I don’t think I'd even . want to see his face. I hope he gets what he deserves.' Police said the youth lived within in a . block of the woman's house. Investigators say he broke into her home by . kicking in the back door and then sexually assaulted her. He was caught by a footprint left at the scene where he had been wearing socks but no shoes. A witness that night said they had seen the teenager, who lived just a block away, without shoes on, according to police.

Cameron Bay, the adult film actress who recently contracted HIV, is calling for more porn producers to encourage the use of safe sex on set. The 29-year-old actress says she was naive to trust industry STD tests and said other performers told her not to ask for condoms. 'I learned that there's always someone . younger and sexier, willing to do something you're not,' Bay told the Huffington Post. 'I think we need more choices because of that. Condoms . should be a choice.' Test results: Adult film actress Cameron Bay has contracted HIV . Bay performed in her first porn scene a few months ago but, after just nine more scenes, she tested positive for HIV. The actress does not know when or from whom she contacted the disease, but admitted that none of the male performers she worked with used condoms. Bay said another actress told her: 'Don't even bring it up because they have somebody waiting to replace you.' In November, a Los Angeles district passed a measure on condom use in the billion-dollar industry, despite a campaign against it by porn executives. 'People don’t want to see adult films where people are wearing condoms,' Hustler publisher Larry Flynt had argued, according to Bloomberg Businessweek. Bay, who also had to be treated in hospital after contracting a kidney infection after one film, said all but one of her scenes were filmed in Los Angeles, and one was filmed in San Francisco. The San Francisco one, which involved bondage and anal sex, was the only set to have offered her the option of a condom, but Bay said she didn't feel she needed one because her male co-star had a negative STD test. 'I was new to the industry. When I was . told that I was safe to shoot, I was like, ""OK, cool"",' she said. 'I had . no idea. I really didn't understand.' Diagnosis: Cameron Bay has tested positive for HIV just months after filming her first porn scene . Naive: 29-year-old Bay says she didn't ask for condoms because all porn actors have regular STD tests . Affected: Rod Daily, Bay's partner, has also tested positive for HIV . Film company Kink, which was behind the San Francisco production, confirmed that Bay had been offered a condom but had declined to use it. Since contracting HIV Bay has discovered that her health insurance will not cover her treatment. While injuries, such as the damage caused to one of Bay's breasts during a shoot, are covered by workers' compensation, because it is impossible to know which set she contracted HIV on, she has to cover her medical bills alone. 'I spent more in one day on medical . stuff than I did on rent for two months,' she told the Huffington Post. 'I had a safety net . of three months of not working and that cut into it a lot.' Currently it is costing Bay $2,000 a month for pills to curb the disease. The actress has set up a Give Forward fund to help her meet her medical bills and plans to do online solo performances. After her HIV diagnosis, a six-day moratorium was put in place to prevent further cases being spread. However, a week after the moratorium was lifted, two more porn actors, including Bay's boyfriend Rod Daily, tested positive for HIV. Funds: Bay has set up a web page to help raise money to pay for her treatment . Spirited response: Cameron Bay has vowed to fight against the disease . Bay believes the moratorium should have been in place for longer, and has been trying to raise awareness of the importance of safe sex on set. On her Twitter account she has vowed to fight the disease, saying: 'If I could beat my own deamons as a teen I can definitely beat this disease'. She added that had she been properly informed she would have demanded a condom each time she worked, adding: 'At the end of the day, it's about your safety. And a piece of paper . that says you're clear to shoot doesn't mean anything.'","Cameron Bay says she wishes she had pushed for condoms .

It was supposed to be a look that was so last season, darling. But judging by this picture of a painfully thin model at New York Fashion Week, it’s clear size zero is back. Dutch model Bette Franke, 23, took to the catwalk for designer Michael Kors – but all eyes were probably on her gaunt face and matchstick legs rather than the clothes she was showing off. The return of stick-thin models to the catwalks comes in spite of efforts by the New York fashion scene to change its image, welcoming its first ever plus-sized designer Eden Miller, who used voluptuous models to show off her Cabiria designs as part of this year’s events. For years the fashion industry has  tried to shake off accusations that it is encouraging eating disorders among generations of girls by using only the thinnest models. Victoria Beckham banned size zero models from her New York show in 2010, while the Italian fashion houses Armani, Prada and Versace all say they have done the same. And last year Vogue editors from across the globe, led by Anna Wintour, editor of the magazine’s US edition, pledged to ban the use of models under 16 in photo shoots and promised not to use models they know to be suffering from eating disorders. However, this pledge was branded  ‘disingenuous nonsense’ by former Australian Vogue editor Kirstie Clements, who said it was impossible to police models’ diets. In a book published this year, she described a world in which models resorted to eating tissues to fill their empty stomachs, and who accepted fainting regularly from under-nourishment as part of the job. Models respond to the industry’s insistence on tiny frames by ‘dangerous patterns of behaviour that the industry – shockingly – begins to accept’, she said. GRAPHIC SIZE ZERO.jpg . London Fashion Week, which starts today, will be under no less scrutiny than its New York equivalent. Last week Alexandra Shulman, editor of British Vogue, announced a video revealing the secrets of making models look perfect on photo shoots would be sent to 1,000 schools in a bid dispel myths about body image among young girls.","Dutch model Bette Franke, 23, took to the catwalk for designer Michael Kors .

The body of Emylee Lonczak was found in shrubbery between two homes on Madrillon Estates Drive in Vienna on Friday morning . A 16-year-old Virginia girl who was discovered dead last month had used illegal drugs with a group of people and had experienced a medical emergency before her death, it was revealed today. Emylee Lonczak was reported missing August 21 from her home in an affluent area of McLean, Virginia. Two days later, her body turned up in the bushes between a pair of million-dollar homes in the well-heeled suburb of Vienna. According to a search warrant obtained by The Washington Post, the McLean High School student left home August 21 with two men and then drove out of state to buy drugs from another man. On the morning of August 22, Lonczak's companions realized that the teen was in medical distress, but did not seek help, the document stated. The search warrant was filed in Fairfax Circuit Court to access the Facebook accounts of the deceased girl and the men she was with on the night of her death. Police investigating Lonczak's death had previously interviewed one of the teen's companions, identified by NBC Washington as 19-year-old Kyle Alifom, and searched his parents' Vienna home. Alifom, who attends Marshall High School, reportedly told officials that hours before the girl died, he and Emylee attended a party together where they drank beer and smoked marijuana. Left to die: Search warrants state that Emylee Lonczak used drugs in the company of three adult men, who failed to seek help when she needed medical attention . Probe: Police determined that one of the men Emylee (left) was with before her death was Kyle Alifom (right), 19, who told officers that he and the 16-year-old drank beer and smoked marijuana that night . Alifom later got a ride with the girl to his home in Vienna, where Lonczak remained for several hours before taking her leave on foot. On August 23, police bloodhounds picked up Emylee's scent in the Tysons Corner area of Vienna, and quickly tracked down her body left in the shrubbery between two homes. So far, no arrests have been made, but police are considering charging the men involved in the incident with contributing to the delinquency of a minor. According to online records, Alifom has had at least two run-ins with the law. Most recently, he was arrested in March on a public drunkenness charge. A year before, Alifom was collared on a count of alcohol possession. The state medical examiner's officer has yet to determine Lonczak's cause or manner of death. Grieving family: Emylee, pictured as a young girl with her father Don, is survived by her parents and six brothers and sisters . Emylee Lonczak is survived by her parents and six siblings, including her twin brother.

A 19-year-old man has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for his role in the beating to death of a disabled Chicago man. The brutal crime was captured on video and then posted on Facebook. Earlier this year, Anthony Malcolm was found guilty of first-degree murder and robbery for his part in the sickening attack that killed 62-year-old Delfino Mora. Speaking in court yesterday, he told the victim's family: 'I'm sorry, I can feel your pain.' Scroll down for video . Going to jail: Anthony Malcolm, 19, has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for his role in the beating to death of 62-year-old Delfino Mora . According to prosecutors, Malcolm was with two other teenagers last July when they decided to play a game called 'Pick 'em out, knock 'em out'. The three targeted Mr Mora, a father of 12 and grandfather of 23, in an alley in the West Rogers Park neighbourhood and ordered him to empty his pockets. Malcolm's friend Malik Jones allegedly then punched him in the jaw, causing him to fall to the ground and hit his head on the concrete. The group then proceeded to rifle through the victim's wallet as he lay dying in the alley. Mr Mora was found by a passer-by with . blood on his face and vomit next to his head about three hours later . and was taken to hospital. However, he died the next day as a result of blunt head trauma. Victim: Mr Mora, who was disabled, was found unconscious in an alley in Chicago last July. He died in hospital the next day as a result of blunt head trauma . Crime scene: The teenagers targeted Mr Mora in an alley in the West Rogers Park neighbourhood in Chicago, where he had been collecting soda cans . Murdered: Mr Mora was found by a passer-by with blood on his face and vomit next to his head . Malcolm used a mobile phone to record the fatal assault on Mr Mora, who didn't have full use of his right arm after a workplace accident 15 years ago. He then posted the sickening footage on to Facebook, according to NBC Chicago. 'He left him in the alley like a piece of garbage,' said prosecutor James Murphy at an earlier hearing. 'To them it was funny, they laughed.' Malcolm's lawyers had initially claimed that all he did was hold a cellphone camera as the deadly attack unfolded. However, Judge Joseph Claps ruled in July that the teen was 'not only present, but also accountable' for the death of Mr Mora. 'It’s a sad travesty that Mr. Delfino . Mora died because of the actions of people who apparently think that . what they were doing was a game,' he said. 'Well, it wasn’t a . game for Mr. Mora and his family.' The one-minute recording of the attack, which was posted on to Facebook, was the most damning piece of evidence presented during the case. Laughter from the three teens charged in the brutal death could be heard on the tape. Mr Mora, who had been collecting soda . cans when he was approached by the youths, had emigrated to Chicago in . the 1980s from Michoacán, Mexico. He . supplemented his disability payments by collecting the waste cans early . in the morning and was attacked just blocks from his home. He was a father to six girls and six boys, who range in age from 17 to 40, and was also a grandfather. Loving family: Mora was a father of 12 and a grandfather of 23. He supported his family partly by collecting aluminum cans . Chilling: Malcolm recorded the brutal attack on a cellphone, before posting it on Facebook. His friends are still awaiting trial . Speaking in July after Malcolm's guilty verdict, Mr Mora's son Emanuel said: 'We . feel a little bit of peace in our hearts. The judge made the right decision. But on the other . side, we still feel a little bit down because with this decision, it’s . not going to bring our father back.' Sentencing Malcolm yesterday, Judge Claps said he was an accessory not only for videotaping the death, but also for not reporting the attack to the authorities. 'There must be a deterrent for people who choose violence for some past-time,' he said. Malcolm was sentenced to 22 years for murder and eight years for robbery. His family have spoken out against the sentence, claiming Malcolm should not be sent to prison for holding a cellphone. 'He was a studious child. Respectful,' his aunt and retired Chicago Public Schools teacher Rosemary Rodriguez told NBC Chicago. 'I never saw anything else but that.' The remaining two defendants are awaiting trial.

Your next mobile phone or computer could be powered by a glass of wine, chipmaker Intel has revealed. At the firm’s annual developers conference in San Francisco, it showed a low-powered computer able to draw enough power from a glass of red wine to power itself up. The project was demonstrated by Dr Genevieve Bell, who said: ‘Some people turn water into wine, here at Intel we're turning wine into electricity.’ Intel pran a computer by drawing enough power from a glass of red wine (picture from Intel conference in San Francisco) The firm hopes the experiment, designed to show off how little power computers and sensors could run on, could lead new a new breed of computers and wearable sensors that constantly monitor our health, for instance, and are powered by the heat from our skin. ‘It's possible to start to imagine a world of incredibly low power but also with high performance, which will help unburden us, help us do things that are remarkable and gives the ability to power things like constant sensing, communication, and computing - all of which are necessary for our mobile future,’ she said. An Intel researcher carried out the groundbreaking demo. ‘Today, we're not here to talk about watts. We're not even here to talk about milliwatts. We're here to talk about microwatts,’ he said. ‘We're talking computing solutions so low that, in the future, we should be able to power them with the heat of our skin or the ambulant light in the room or, like I show you today, maybe something just a little bit more entertaining.’ The project was demonstrated by Dr Genevieve Bell (pictured far left) at the annual Intel developers conference in San Fran . The demonstration saw a researcher take a bottle of red wine and pour it into a glass containing two electrodes. As the current flowed between them, sensors came to life and showed live data feeds on a giant screen. ‘You might remember in grade school, you did a little experiment where you took some lemons and you put a copper penny and a nail in there, and you lit up an LED,’ the researchers said. ‘Well, we're in California, so we're going to do the same thing, only wine is cheaper than lemons here. So we're going to do it today with wine. ‘So I'm going to take my bottle of wine here, and I've got a glass, I've got some copper, and I've got some zinc in there, so I'm going to do really that same experiment we did in high school or in grade school.’ Dr Genevieve Bell (pictured) said: 'Some people turn water into wine, here at Intel we're turning wine into electricity' Intel says the technology could see computers in new and inaccessible places. ‘Low power is essential for the future of wearable devices and sensors in smart spaces, where frequent charging or power cables would be burdensome or even impossible,’ said Intel’s Mike Bell. ‘Only then can technology be truly personal and embedded into the places and spaces we inhabit and move through.’ Earlier this week Intel introduced a line of extremely low-power processors called Quark for wearable and embedded devices Another demonstration focused on cyclists, with a smart fabric jacket that lit up when it sensed a cyclist was braking or going quickly to alert drivers nearby.

A 14-ton molasses spill has killed thousands of fish and other marine life in Honolulu Harbor, the biggest environmental disaster Hawaii has ever faced. Hundreds of suffocated sea creatures have already been collected since Monday when a pipeline running from storage tanks to Matson Navigation Co ships spilled 233,000 gallons of molasses – enough to fill one-third of an Olympic-size pool - into the water. Health officials expect thousands more fish to die because the high concentration of the sugary, brown goo is sinking to the bottom of the ocean 'like a rock', making breathing difficult. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Environmental disaster: Thousands of fish are expected to die in Honolulu waters after a leaky pipe caused 1,400 tons of molasses to ooze into the harbor and kill marine life .

Widespread: Fisherman Placido Shim shows two fish he gaffed that were floating past his boat after a leaky pipe caused more than 230,000 gallons of molasses to ooze into the harbor and kill marine life . 'This . is the worst environmental damage to sea life that I have come across, . and it’s fair to say this is a biggie, if not the biggest that we've had . to confront in the state of Hawaii,' Gary Gill, deputy director for the . Environmental Health Division of the Health Department, told Hawaii News Now. The department . has warned people to stay out of the area because the dead fish could . attract sharks and other predators like barracuda. Diver Roger White made a seven-minute video showing the dead sea life - crabs, fish, eels and more - blanketing the bottom of the harbor. The water has turned a murky yellow-brown colour. 'There’s nothing alive there at all,' he said. 'Everything is dead. They’re all dead and they’re all just lying across the bottom - hundreds and hundreds, thousands.'

Laborious: A Pacific Environmental Corporation worker pulls debris and dead fish from the water near the Matson shipyard in the Kapalama Basin in Honolulu, Hawaii, after the molasses spill . Widespread: Dead marine creatures were located at La Mariana, nearly three miles away from Pier 52 (pictured) where the faulty pipe dumped the molasses into the water during loading onto a Matson ship on Monday . Ripple effect: The molasses has spread into a number of Hawaiian marinas and harbors up to three miles away from the site of the original spill . Matson spokesman Jeff Hull said the company repaired the hole and the pipe stopped . leaking on Tuesday morning. However Hawaii News Now reported the state could fine Matson up to $25,000 a day for violations of the Clean Water . Act. However the Health Department has reportedly not decided whether to take action against Matson, which makes weekly runs of molasses from Hawaii’s last sugar plantation to the mainland. The molasses is made at Hawaii's last sugar plantation, run by Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Co. on Maui. Meanwhile, the company said in a statement it was taking to steps to guard against future spills. 'Matson regrets that the incident impacted many harbor users, as well as wildlife,' it said. 'We take our role as an environmental steward very seriously and have a strong record of leadership in the maritime industry on a number of fronts.' Marine biologists said the effects in the harbor area will be long-lasting. 'This is in a bay so there's not a lot of circulation, so you're not going to have flushing of this water out,' Dr. David Field, a visiting assistant professor of marine sciences at Hawaii Pacific University, said. 'So in this area where the spill occurred we're probably going to see the effects for a long time. 'As water does leave this bay area and goes out into the neighboring ocean, we can expect the effects in the long term, in days, weeks, months and probably years, to spread out over some of the South Shore reefs.'The Department of Health has added crews to collect the dead fish and monitor water quality.","Thousands of fish dead after Monday's molasses spill in Honolulu Harbor .

The National Security Agency has been sharing information likely to contain details of phone calls and emails of U.S citizens with Israel, according to secret documents. A memorandum of understanding provided to the Guardian newspaper by whistleblower Edward Snowden reportedly shows that the NSA has been handing intercepted communications over to its Israeli counterpart without screening out information about its own citizens first. Although the memorandum stresses that the Israelis should not deliberately target Americans, there is no legal obligation to comply by U.S. demands. Secret documents: The memorandum of understanding between Israel and the U.S was shown to the Guardian by whistleblower Edward Snowden . Despite previous assurances from Barack Obama that a so-called 'minimisation' process safeguards the privacy of U.S. citizens, the five page memorandum reportedly makes it clear that information is shared in its raw, pre-'minimisation' state. It discloses that Israel is entitled to 'raw signant' or signal intelligence adding: 'Raw signant includes, but is not limited to, unevaluated and unminimised transcripts, gists, facsimiles, telex, voice and Digital Network Intelligence metadata and content.' According to the Guardian, while the NSA said that any information supplied to Israel is given via procedures designed to protect privacy rights, it did not deny that unvetted communications were being shared. It also refused to comment when questioned whether permission to hand over such information had been sought from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (Fisa) court. Legally compliant: The NSA, based in Maryland, insists that any information handed over complies with rules to protect U.S privacy . Under the agreement between the two countries, which is said to have been reached in 2009, Israel is allowed to retain information identifying U.S. citizens for up to a year. Israeli's have to inform an NSA liason adviser when such files are found and any files containing government communications must be destroyed, according to the memo. Although the NSA should have a warrant to target citizens of its own country, it is allowed to collect details of communications with a foreign target without a warrant. Israeli intelligence can disseminate the information given to it by the U.S. as long as it doesn't identify the American in question. Israel can however release U.S. identities to 'outside parties' with written U.S. permission, according to the Guardian.

For anyone who can claim to have scaled America's tallest mountain this news may come as a bit of a disappointment. According to a new map published by the US Geological Survey (USGS) Mount McKinley is not as tall as previously thought. New technology used by USGS has revealed the Alaskan mountain, also known as Denali, tops out at 20,237 feet, 83 feet short of the 20,320 feet usually given. Mount McKinley is still the highest peak in Northern America despite a survey revealing it is 83 feet lower than previously thought . The new data comes from a 2012 survey done using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar, a technology designed to track very small geographic changes. The last published measurement was taken in 1952. In a statement on its website, USGS said that the change could be down to more precise technology, different methods of compilation, or climate. Climbers need not worry about their . bragging rights, however, as the peak is still far taller than Mount . Saint Elias, America's second tallest, which tops out at 18,009 feet. Mount McKinley, whose Alaskan name is Denali, was named as a patriotic gesture for the then Presidential candidate William McKinley . The first men to successfully climb Mount McKinley were four amateurs in 1910 lead by Peter Anderson and Billy Taylor who made it to the lower North summit using homemade equipment and carrying donuts and hot chocolate. The so-called Sourdough Expedition completed the climb as a bet rumored to have been made with a local bar owner who said it would never be climbed. After three months on the mountain the team planted a 14 foot spruce pole topped with an American flag to mark their success in the hope it could be seen with a telescope, but their story was widely doubted. The first man to set foot on the summit was Walter Harper in 1913, an Alaskan native, who reached it along with Robert Tantum in a team lead by Harry Karstens and Hudson Stuck. Along the way they spotted the spruce pole, verifying the earlier attempt. The mountain was named McKinley after the then Presidential candidate William McKinley who became the 25th US President, though it is also referred to as Denali which is its traditional Alaskan name.","New technology used in 2012 survey registers the summit at 20,237 feet .

Tragic: Ryan Acaster, 17, was killed after he was catapulted from his trail bike by a wire a nursery firm gamekeeper had tied to two trees as a makeshift fence in Merseyside . A nursery firm has been ordered to pay out £50,000 over the death of a teenager who was thrown off his motorbike when he rode it into a makeshift wire fence. Ryan Acaster, 17, suffered severe head injuries when he was catapulted off his 110cc off-road bike after hitting a line tied between two trees on land close to Crossens, Lancashire in 2008. He was found unconscious by his father Dean lying near his bike and airlifted to Royal Preston Hospital, but later died from his injuries. Bosses at Nursery firm JA Jones & Sons have now pleaded guilty to causing his death at Liverpool Crown Court. The court heard that the company's gamekeeper Adrian Johnson erected the wire along with a sign in a bid to deter trespassers from entering private land. The sign, however, was taken down by an unknown person, and replaced with a 'grubby white T-shirt'. As Ryan rode along the track he failed to spot the marker and hit the wire, which had been tied at around chest height. Prosecuting, Nigel Lawrence said: 'The cable should have been removed while there was no sign present and Adrian Johnson should have done more to alert people to the potential danger. 'Such failures by the company gave rise to the potential of danger, a danger that ultimately claimed the life of Ryan Acaster. 'The cable and shirt combination presented a foreseeable risk of serious injury and should have been dealt with accordingly.' Judge Thomas Teague added: 'Unfortunately, the metal sign was at some point removed by some unknown and unauthorised person. 'When the loss was discovered by Mr . Johnson’s stepbrother, he replaced it by the crude expedient of . attaching what has been accurately described as a “grubby white T-shirt” to the middle of the cable. 'The cable in its altered state was inconspicuous, particularly as it was shaded by trees on either side of the track. 'Despite the fact that Ryan Acaster was probably driving at less than 20 mph, he would have had little time to react to its presence by the time he saw it. 'To those who loved Ryan, no sentence will seem remotely adequate, and they are right to think so. His life was priceless and could never be measured in monetary terms.' Speaking after the verdict, Ryan's devastated father Dean slammed the 'hollow apology' his family had received from the company during the judgment. Guilty: JA Jones & Sons pleaded guilty in Liverpool Crown Court and were ordered to pay a £50,000 fine over the death of teenager Ryan Acaster . He said: 'It’s nice to get some sort of justice. Today was the only time we have received an apology in five years - it was a bit of a hollow apology.

An athletic director at a private school in Prattville, Alabama was forced to resign for not wanting to be a member of the school's church. Scott Phillips said we he was offered the position of AD at East Memorial Christian Academy in June 2012, and told that he must start attending the school's baptist church. The administrator, assistant administrator, athletic director and daycare director are all supposed to be members of it's church, according to an undocumented school policy. Out of the game: Coach Phillips on the East Memorial court before he was forced to resign because of his wavering church loyalties . Christian values: Phillips and his wife Teri Grisham Phillips. For a year Phillips would take his family to church service at both East Memorial and the Church of the Highlands . Phillips had previously taught Bible and science, and was the boys basketball coach as well as an assistant football coach. For the first year Phillips tried to make it work, taking his family to the 9am service at East Memorial Baptist before ferrying them to the 11am service at Church of the Highlands in Montgomery. But at the end of the year he was tired of his double-church life. He went to school administrators asking for permission to go back to his old congregation. 'In a nutshell, I told them I miss my old church,' Phillips told the Montgomery Advertiser. 'I went in to share my heart to a pastor. Knowing what might happen, but kind of saying, ""Maybe we can work something out?’"" Strict school: Phillips tried to reason with school administrators to let him be demoted so he could continue coaching, but they refused . Faithful: Phillips just wanted to go to his own church, Church of the Highlands in Montgomery, Alabama . Phillips said his confession was not well received. Phillips didn't hear back from school administrators until the end of June, when they met twice. At the second meeting Phillips was forced to resign. And though he was never a member of the school's church before he became AD, the school refused to compromise on keeping him employed. Phillips asked to be demoted so could he continue to teach and coach basketball but they said no. What makes Phillips most upset is the fact that the church membership was not discussed more or spelled out in his contract. Taken out: Phillips also served as an assistant coach of the football team . 'If it had have been in my contract, I possibly would have not taken the job,' Phillips said. 'I was totally committed to East Memorial (the school). I thought I did enough to prove I didn’t have to be a member to do my job effectively.' In response to Phillips resignation, the school issued a statement to the Advertiser saying: 'For several months, we discussed with coach Phillips the requirements of his position at EMCA and after months of discussion and prayer, coach Phillips resigned his duties here. 'It was made very clear when we hired Phillips that the AD position is required to be a faithful member of our sponsoring church East Memorial Baptist Church.' But Phillips still doesn't understand how he lost his job because of his faith. 'I was an advocate of East Memorial as the athletic director. That’s what I thought my role was,' he said.","Scott Phillips took the position of athletic director at East Memorial Christian Academy last year .

A rare glimpse into the family album of pop superstar Cher has revealed where the singer gets her youthful appearance from - her 86-year-old mother. Georgia Holt, who once harboured her own ambitions of being an actress and a singer, talks candidly about the difficulties she faced as a young mother in new documentary 'Dear Mom, Love Cher'. She told how, while pregnant with Cher, she almost had an abortion because of pressure from her own mother. Emotional: Cher with her mother Georgia Holt, 86, who she says taught her to sing . Tough times: Cher's mother Georgia admitted she almost had an abortion during her pregnancy . Pressure: Georgia Holt was just 19 years old when she gave birth to Cher in 1946 . Georgia said when she fell pregnant with Cher she had just left her first husband. She said her mother, who had given birth to Georgia when she was only 13, said she either have an abortion or return to her husband. She could not bring the child up as a single mother. Georgia also admitted she had to temporarily put Cher into an orphanage because she couldn't afford to look after her, a decision she has always regretted. Talking of the day she gave birth to Cher. Georgia said: 'I can remember the chairs were chrome [in the clinic], and I was sweating. The sweat was just coming off of me on this chrome and when the door opened and it was my turn, I said, 'Mother, I can't do it.' So, that's how she's here.' Cher, now 66, told the USA Today newspaper: 'I heard the abortion story when I was a teenager. The orphanage story has been a touchy one for my mom her whole life, and she didn't want to talk about it. I said, 'Mom, why didn't you just march in and take me?' 'She said, 'I didn't have the power. I didn't have any money or a job, and the church was so strong. I'd go see you every day and you'd be crying. You don't know what it was like.' It was harder for women then. 'I thought, this could be tricky, But what's anyone going to do to me now? So I come from a poor white trash background. It doesn't make any difference.'

Ultimatum: Cher's mother said she had considered having an abortion having recently left her first husband . Glamorous: The pop diva said her mother gave her the determination to be a success . Cher, Georgia and Georganne recently appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres show to promote the 86-year-old's first album, Honky Tonk Woman. The mother-daughter duo started off the show with a performance of a track called I'm Just Your Yesterday, which was originally recorded in the 1980s, but was recently rediscovered by the 66-year-old as she helped her mother with some spring cleaning. The slow-tempo was well received but had a shaky start - but if anyone can deal with a professional mishap with an abundance of Love and Understanding, it's Cher. Ellen filled the audience in, explaining: 'This album was done 31 years ago, and lost in the garage. 'You pulled it together and I think you are going to sing a little  bit of a song from it now.' The story behind Honky Tonk Woman is an interesting one. More than 30 years ago, Georgia recorded a country-influenced album with the members of Elvis Presley's band. The tapes from these recording sessions were forgotten in her garage until Cher stumbled across them a few years ago. She helped her to preserve them, but soon the mother daughter duo decided it might be good fun to record them performing a couple of the tracks, just for themselves. These performances formed the basis of the documentary 'Dear Mom, Love Cher' which will look at Georgia's extraordinary life. The documentary took a detailed look at Georgia's colourful life for the first time. As well as jamming with Elvis' band, Georgia has been married six times - twice to Cher's father John Sarkisian. Born in Arkansas, she enjoyed stints modelling and acting, and is a skilled musician. She has Native American ancestry, which inspired Cher's hit record, Half Breed.

A married couple have invented a simple way to stop pirates hijacking ships this is set to earn them £1million and the gratitude of sailors the world over. Teresa Stevens dreamed up a plastic barrier to fit over ships’ rails and make it impossible for anyone to board from another vessel. Together with her husband David she runs a company specialising in maritime security and the pair are celebrating after the crime-busting design put them on course to turn over £1million in their first year. Scroll down for video . Teresa and David Stevens have invented a simple but effective way to stop pirates hijacking ships but stopping them getting aboard in the first place . The design is a large plastic P shape which is fitted over the railings of ships and hangs over them. It . works by making it impossible for pirates to board boats by throwing . ladders and grappling hooks because they can't over the ledge it forms. After . an arduous development process the Stevens called in their local unit if marines Royal Marines to try and board a ship protected with Guardian Anti-Piracy barriers - after 2 hours they gave up and the design was declared a success. It is has now been fitted on more than 100 ships and in May this year saved it's first would-be victims when pirates attempted to storm a container ship of the coast of Nigeria. Mrs . Stevens said: 'The pirates came up to the ship and were harassing it . for close to an hour I think, trying to board it but they couldn't. 'In . the end they got so frustrated that they shot the lifeboat to pieces . but they couldn't get any further than that, we learned later that they . took another ship in the same location just two hours later - obviously . that one didn't have any protection. 'The . chief security officer contacted us to say they were very happy because . it saved the ship and that meant the crew members were safe. Startlingly simple: Pirates are unable to board ships protected with the Guardian barrier because their grappling hooks and ladders are unable to get grip . 'That . is absolutely why we do it, it was great to get that validation because . it makes you think all that effort developing and designing, those . years of hard work and living on the poverty line was worth it.' The units appear to made from plastic . but are in fact a compound UV package which makes it denser and . stronger than any plastic used in any marine environment to date. Crucially . it does not fall apart under fire and is fixed to the rails so it also . screens the crew from incoming pirates  enabling them to stay out of . sight and get to safety. They can also be removed in sections making them easy to move in and out when they ships enter ports and need to allow people off but still keep stoaways and thieves out. They retail for £110 and most ships require between 65 and 100 units to cover all their exposed areas meaning that relative to the value of the ships they protect the barriers are hugely cost effective. Mrs Stevens, a former chef, works . alongside her husband David at their firm Marine and Auto Security . Solutions in Lee-on-Solent, Hampshire. She . said that they realised after focusing their efforts on trying to remove pirates from . ships that the real key was to make it impossible for them . to get on board in the first place. The Guardian Anti-Piracy Barrier prevents pirates from boarding ships by making it impossible for them to sling grappling hooks over the railings . Success: The barriers have already been installed on 100 ships and the company is set to make £1million turnover in it's first year of trading . She added: 'We were working on anti-piracy and my husband came up with a way of remotely controlling a ship. 'But our customers wanted something to stop pirates getting on board in the first place, so we thought of things like ways to blast the pirates with chilli oil and other things. 'It suddenly occurred to me to put a huge plastic P over the rail to prevent the ladders and grappling hooks gripping.' The most common way pirates take control of ships is to sling ropes and roof ladders around the outdoor railings and then, often at night, climbing up. But the Stevens' device has a wide plastic top which means its hooks cannot grab on. The success they have had so far means that they save the shipping industry millions and thwart an increasingly common problem that endangers the lives of seamen all over the world. Mrs Stevens added: “We tested it with Royal Marines at a local maritime school and they couldn’t get on. 'We even tied a rope on but because of the shape of the barrier, the marines could not get past the overhang. 'They tried for two hours and had to give up and it was really put through its paces in the Gulf. 'Now we have put it on probably 100 ships and are in talks with an oil rig company to supply them, as they’re based off the coast of Africa an the rig and their ships get attacked by pirates regularly.' Not ones to rest on their laurels, the Stevens are now working on developing a range of different sizes and shapes to protect other marine installations at threat from piracy.","The barrier prevents pirates from boarding ships using grappling hooks and ladders because they can't get a grip .

The Bank of England today looks set to announce that interest rates could stay at record lows until after the General Election. Mark Carney, who succeeded Lord King as Governor last month having been hand-picked for the job by George Osborne, is expected to reassure the public that rates will not rise anytime soon. The Canadian hopes the use of so-called ‘forward guidance’ will boost confidence among households and businesses and help drive the economic recovery. The Chancellor will also hope that rock bottom borrowing costs between now and polling day in 2015 will bolster Tory chances as house prices rise and optimism returns. Tough balancing act: Mark Carney with his wife Diana . But the prospect of at least two more years of low interest rates will delight borrowers but inflict further misery on savers who have lost out since rates hit 0.5 per cent in March 2009. It will mark a dramatic change of tack at the Bank which has until now resisted tying its hands by committing to a future path of interest rates. Experts warned that if the economy picks up sharply in the coming months the Bank could be forced to renege on its promise and raise interest rates sooner than expected - particularly if inflation roars back. It means Mr Carney, the highest paid central banker in the world on £874,000 a year, faces a difficult balancing act when he outlines his plans today at the Bank’s inflation report. It is thought that he could peg low interest rates to economic thresholds - such as saying they will not rise until unemployment falls below a certain level as has been done in the United States by the Federal Reserve. The prospect of at least two more years of low interest rates will inflict further misery on savers who have lost out since rates hit 0.5 per cent in March 2009 . But Brenda Kelly, senior market strategist at City trading firm IG, said the ‘better economic data has complicated the plans of Mr Carney’. The Bank looks set to raise its growth forecasts for this year and next following a flurry of better economic news in recent months. But output is still around three per cent below the pre-recession peak reached in early 2008 - meaning this is the longest downturn for a century. Mr Carney is also likely to be concerned that Britain has been the worst performing economy in the G7 since the start of the financial crisis bar Italy. It could be enough to persuade him to press ahead with forward guidance today when he responds to Mr Osborne’s request to consider ‘unconventional’ tools to boost the economy. Mr Carney, former governor of the Canadian central bank, gave a clear taste of forward guidance last month when he signalled that interest rates will not rise for some time. The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said expectations of an imminent rate rise were ‘not warranted’ - sending stock markets soaring. Business leaders welcomed the prospect of full-blown forward guidance last night. Neil Bentley, deputy director-general of the CBI, said: ‘Forward guidance could provide a welcome injection of certainty around interest rates for businesses and consumers.’ David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ‘Businesses need a stable environment with reassurance that interest rates will remain at very low levels for the foreseeable future.’ David Owen, managing director at investment bank Jefferies International, said: ‘We still expect Mark Carney to introduce forward guidance, probably along with a target for the unemployment rate, reinforcing the view of a Bank Rate likely stuck at 0.5 per cent until just after the General Election.’ James Knightley, an economist at banking group ING, said forward guidance would be a useful tool to prevent expectations of higher interest rates ‘choking off the recovery story’. But a critic said it could pave the way for problems in the future if the Bank is forced to change its mind and raise rates due to economic developments. Former MPC member Andrew Sentance said: ‘This is a very difficult environment for central banks wishing to design forward guidance and we should not build up our hopes about its accuracy or effectiveness.’ Allan Monks, economist at JP Morgan Chase Bank, said: ‘It doesn’t take long to see how messy things could get. The decision would only add to the confusion over when rates are likely to rise.’","Interest rates could stay low until after election .

Wet hair, tracksuit bottoms and chipped manicures become de rigueur as they rush to drag the children out of . bed, make their packed lunches and cajole them into the car. But for a certain breed of mothers, the school run is a whole different ball game. Writing an anonymous piece in Times2 today, one mother has lifted the lid on what life is really like at the celebrity school gate. Scroll down for video . Queens of the school gates: An anonymous mother has lifted the lid on what exactly life is like at the school gates of London's most exclusive schools, where Victoria Beckham and Elle Macpherson turn the school run into a catwalk . Known as 'The Strip', the haunt in West London is home to two of the capital's most exclusive and expensive private schools and the likes of the Beckhams, Elle Macpherson, Claudia Schiffer and Trinny Woodall have frequented the school gate. 'Welcome to the high-octane, caffeine-fuelled, fashion savvy domain. Here, morning drop-off is no ordinary jam-smeared, bleary-eyed routine. 'In fact, celeb-spotting aficionados would be far better placed to set up camp here than at the Beverley Hills Hotel during award season,' writes the mother, whose children share lessons with the celeb offspring. The writer describes her first day at the celebrity school gate, which she describes as a 'parallel universe', where appearances count for everything. 'With their glossy manes, expensive highlights and Pilates-honed thighs, this was a new breed of woman - an uberbeing, perpetually ready for her close-up,' she said. She explains how each 'tribe' of stylish mothers define themselves by their choice of handbag. Picture perfect: 'With their glossy manes, expensive highlights and Pilates-honed thighs, this was a new breed of woman- an uberbeing', says the writer of the mothers at Trinny Woodall and Claudia Schiffer's children's schools . Hermes Birkins are the choice of arm candy by the 'cougar' mothers, who desperately try to emulate Elle Macpherson, whilst the 'fashion mums' rock none other than a Victoria Beckham tote and Claudia Schiffer's minions, known as the 'boho mums', love their Jerome Dreyfuss bags. No handbag, however, is the biggest statement of power and wealth a mother can make. These mothers are the ones who are chauffeured to school in a black-out Mercedes, meaning their driver is on hand to guard their Chanel tote whilst they accompany their children to the school gate, the anonymous mother writes. Fitness fanatics: Gym gear is obligatory at the school gate, as mothers dash off to their Ten Pilates class or Barrecore Ballet . Whilst leather leggings a la Elle Macpherson were once the school gate outfit of choice, this has recently been replaced by super stylish gym gear. The current trend, she explains, is to match their trainers to the neon stripe in their gym leggings before dashing off to their Ten Pilates or Barrecore Ballet class. Then there are the super skinny mothers who don't need to exercise at all because they don't bother eating. 'They decamp to a cafe near the school for a daily debrief. Whilst sipping their double-shot soya lattes and inhaling Malboro Lights, they will dispense their verdicts - picture Joan Rivers on steroids,' she writes. Judging by the latest research, looking good on the school run isn't just a preoccupation of the the rich and famous. A study by Google found that 'what mums should wear back to school' searches have increased by 40 per cent this year. Another survey found that mothers spend an average of £87 to look good on the school run with the average mother spending up to 25 minutes perfecting her . hair and make-up and deciding what to wear in preparation for the . big day. Amazingly, that's around seven minutes longer than it will take them to get the children ready.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:13 EST, 12 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:14 EST, 12 September 2013 . Americans trying to beat the bulge have started walking and cycling their way through the workday at treadmill desks, standup desks or other moving workstations. Others are forgoing chairs in favor of giant exercise balls to stay fit while working in their corporate office environment. Walking on a treadmill while making phone calls and sorting through emails means 'being productive on two fronts,' said Andrew Lockerbie, senior vice president of benefits at Brown & Brown, a global insurance consulting firm. Josh Baldonado, an administrative assistant at Brown & Brown Insurance, works at a treadmill desk in the firms offices in Carmel, Indiana . Lockerbie can burn 350 calories a day walking three to four miles on one of two treadmill desks that his company's Indianapolis office purchased earlier this year. 'I'm in meetings and at my desk and on the phone all day,' he said. 'It's great to be able to have an option at my work to get some physical activity while I'm actually doing office stuff. You feel better, you get your blood moving, you think clearly.' Treadmill desks designed for the workplace are normally set to move at one to two mph, enough to get the heart rate up but not too fast to distract from reading or talking on the phone comfortably. It's been a decade since scientific studies began to show that too much sitting can lead to obesity and increase the risk of developing diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease. Even going to the gym three times a week doesn't offset the harm of being sedentary for hours at a time, said Dr. James Levine, an endocrinologist at the Mayo Clinic. Being glued to your desk is no longer an excuse for not having time to exercise as a growing number of Americans are standing, walking and even cycling their way through the work day . 'There's a glob of information that sitting is killing us,' Levine said. 'You're basically sitting yourself into a coffin.' More companies are intrigued by the idea of helping employees stay healthy, lose weight and reduce stress — especially if it means lower insurance costs and higher productivity, said Levine, an enthusiastic supporter of the moving workstations. 'Even walking at one mile an hour has very substantial benefits,' Levine said, such as doubling metabolic rate and improving blood sugar levels. 'Although you don't sweat, your body moving is sort of purring along.' Sales at Indianapolis-based TreadDesk are expected to increase 25 per cent this year as large corporations, including Microsoft, Coca Cola, United Healthcare and Procter & Gamble have started buying the workstations in bulk, said Jerry Carr, the company's president. At LifeSpan Fitness, based in Salt Lake City, sales of treadmill desks more than tripled over 2012, said Peter Schenk, company president. 'We don't see the growth slowing down for several years as right now we are just moving from early adopters, which are educated and highly health conscious, to more mainstream users,' Schenk said. Workers at Brown & Brown in Carmel, Indiana, signed up for 30 slots on the treadmills and have their phone and computer transferred to the workstations . With bicycle desks or desk cycles, workers can pedal their way through the day on a small stationary bike mounted under their desk. Treadmill desks can range from about $800 to $5,000 or more, depending on the manufacturer and model. Desks cycles start as low as $149 for models that can fit under an existing desk but can run $1,400 or more for those with a desk built in. Standup desks can run as low as $250 for platforms that can rest on an existing desk. Some workers have opted for lower-profile — and lower-cost — ways to stay fit at work, such as sitting on giant exercise balls instead of chairs. Using the inflatable balls can help improve posture and strengthen abs, legs and back muscles. Less time at the gym: Now you can workout at work instead (library image) 'I've got nurses in my operating room who will use one of those balls instead of a chair,' said Michael Maloney, a professor of orthopedics and sports medicine specialist at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Maloney said anyone trying an exercise ball, treadmill desk or moving workstation should approach it with common sense. Those who have not been exercising regularly should start using the equipment in small time increments to avoid injury, he said. 'They . have to just do it with some common sense and not overdo it,' Maloney . said. 'Just pay attention to how their body is responding to the new . activities.' Georges . Harik, founder of the Web-based instant messaging service imo.im in . Palo Alto, Calif., bought two treadmill desks for his 20-person office . to share three years ago. Employees tend to sort through email or do other work while using the treadmills. 'I . do it when I can,' he said. 'Sometimes it's not possible if you're . really thinking hard or programming a lot. But this sort of low-grade . activity that keeps people from being sedentary probably helps extend . their lives by a few years, and we're big fans of that.' The . office has also purchased standing desks for most of its employees. The . desks can be raised up or down with the touch of a button, and Harik . says at least three or four workers can be seen standing at desks to . stretch their legs at any one time. But not everyone wants one, Harik said. Some workers find it too distracting to incorporate standing or walking into their work, and some feel they are just not coordinated enough to multitask as they exercise. Levine said he was at first skeptical that a standup desk would offer improvements in health comparable to treadmill desks or other moving workstations. 'It appears I was completely wrong,' he said. 'Once you're off your bottom, it's inevitable that you start meandering around. 'Within two minutes of standing, one activates a series of metabolic processes that are beneficial. Once you sit, all of those things get switched off.' Denise Bober, director of human resources at The Breakers, the resort hotel in Palm Beach, Fla., said having a treadmill desk in her office has made a big difference in how she feels after work. 'The more movement and interaction I have, the more energy I have at the end of the day,' she said. Bober spends one to three hours walking when she's in the office, usually at two mph. 'If I go faster, then I make too many typing errors, but if I'm just reading a report I can go faster,' she said.","Workers can burn 350 calories a day walking three to four miles on treadmill desks .

With their distinctive saffron-colored robes, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness - or Hare Krishnas as they are commonly known - have seen a rapid growth in the movement since it started in the mid-Sixties in New York City. The belief system is based on Indian scripture and aims to spread the practice of bhakti yoga as devotees dedicate themselves to pleasing the Supreme Lord Krishna. The community has 400 centers worldwide, 50 schools and 90 restaurants. The popular nickname comes from the mantra they often chant in groups, which repeats:      'Hare Krishna Hare Krishna' over and over. The four central principles of the movement are no eating of meat, no illicit sex, no gambling and no intoxication of alcohol, caffeine, tobacco or other recreational drugs. Nikko is optimistic his parents will be cool with the usual setup. ‘My mom and dad like Jaycee,’ he said. ‘They don’t think he is a demon.' Nikko described his relationship with Jaycee as 'close' but not 'sexual in the full sense.' He said he remains 'undecided' about this sexual orientation.

Sophomore student Nikko reportedly met Mr Akinsanya, who is a freshman at the same university, last year. After Wheel Of Fortune star Vanna and her ex-husband and Nikko's father George Santo Pietro, refused to give the money, the Enquirer claims that the monk has been trying to cut his teenage housemate off from his family, advising that Nikko 'follow his own path'.

He added: 'The money I asked for was for my living expenses - food, gas and for living my spiritual life with Jaycee.' Nikko's Facebook page is filled with pictures of the pair visiting a Hare Krishna temple and taking a road trip to Canada.

"By . Rebecca Camber and Rebecca Evans . CREATED: . 06:31 EST, 19 December 2011 . Isaac William appeared to be the perfect charitable preacher at St Nicholas Church in Tooting, but he was actually behind a £2.6m tax fraud . To his congregation, he was an inspirational Christian pastor who had dedicated his life to raising money for the poor, homeless and sick. Isaac William, 61, his wife Venus, 54, and their three daughters appeared to be the very model of Christian charity, funding housing, hospitals and education in Pakistan. But in reality, the preacher was swindling taxpayers out of £2.6million in a tax fraud to pay for a million-pound property empire in Britain and abroad. The 'crooked' businessman who ran a security guard company, made profits of over £6million exploiting illegal immigrants who were forced to work around the clock on a pittance and live in cramped caravans and huts sleeping on the floor. To avoid paying VAT, income tax and national insurance, William hid the profits into a number of bank accounts including his charity account named 'The Great Commission Evangelical Fellowship'. But the money was then withdrawn in cash and laundered by his wife and daughters, Sylvia, 34,  who worked for Lloyds Bank, Maria Gunasekara, 33, a business manager for Barclays and their younger sister Sophie, 26, a law graduate. The family used the cash to build an impressive property portfolio which included eight homes in London, Surrey, Hounslow and Walsall and two holiday homes in Pakistan. The father of six also splashed out on luxury sports cars and frequent trips to Dubai and Pakistan. But the authorities became suspicious when a van belonging to William was stopped by police who found a gang of illegal foreign workers. An investigation by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs revealed he had failed to declare £5million in profits and owed £1.1million in VAT, national insurance and tax between 1998 and 2008, which added up to £2.6million in lost interest to the taxpayer. His wife and daughters - two of whom . had been trained in money laundering as part of their work - laundered . £1.3million of the profits, wiring the cash to accounts in Dubai and . Pakistan. Venus William, Isaac's wife, (left) helped launder the cash to build a property portfolio including eight homes - two in Pakistan. Their youngest daughter, Sophie (right) was a law graduate . Maria Gunasekara (left) and Sylvia William (right) both worked for banks where they picked up the skills to launder money by wiring £1.3million to bank accounts in Dubai and Pakistan . Now William has been jailed for four years after admitting ten counts of cheating the public revenue at Kingston Crown Court. Judge Susan Tapping said the 'crooked' businessman ran a 'dishonest and exploitative business.' She told him: 'Your working practices were dubious and exploitative and you used people who had no right to be here.' She . added: 'The worst part was to use his wife and daughters to launder . money. They wouldn't be here if it wasn't for him. It helped his family . to begin to own their own homes. 'He may well have used this money for charity but most of this was sent abroad.' The . court heard that the pastor born in Karachi, Pakistan came to Britain . in 1989 on a six month visa to do a Christian studies course at . Spurgeon's College, London, but he overstayed his visa and was not given . leave to remain here until 2000. Paul . Brogan QC, defending, said William had set up a scout movement in . Karachi, but 'it was charitable work at the expense of the British . taxpayer.' He said: 'The business was ran with . virtually no records being kept and he ignored his responsibilities, not . only to keep records but to account for his profits and he accepts that . over the years he declared little and failed to pay the taxes on his . profits. When the William family was put on trial there were protests in Pakistan where people claimed he was an innocent pastor . 'He also accepts that his family enjoyed considerable financial benefit. 'Throughout this time he continued to support the scout movement and help people in the local community. He also set up medical centres in Karachi and a maternity hospital. 'It was charitable work at the expense of the British taxpayer.' But HMRC investigators were unable to find any evidence that the money in his charity account reached the Karachi Scout movement. A pastor of the Yahweh Christian Fellowship in Tooting and chaplain for the Metropolitan Police, told the court he had witnessed William's work in Pakistan. He said: 'I was taken to areas where he had helped in the building of homes and hospitals and schools. It seemed to be quite extensive. 'People would not stop talking about . him. He was held in high esteem. They spoke of how many lives had been . transformed by his giving.' In . October his wife and daughters were found guilty of money laundering . after a six week trial. Last Friday his wife, Venus was sentenced to 16 . months in jail. St Thomas Church in Tooting, South London, were Isaac William was a preacher and charity fundraiser . His daughter Maria, was given a 12 month suspended sentence. Sylvia, received a 10 month suspended sentence and Sophia got an eight month suspended term. They were also given 100 hours of unpaid work. Simon De Kayne, Assistant Director of Criminal Investigation for HMRC, said: 'Isaac William failed to declare his company's income or pay taxes of £1.1m from his business activities. 'The amount he owes now stands at £2.6m including interest. His wife and daughters then continued the web of deceit by laundering over £1.3m through their personal bank accounts. 'Their criminal activities ensured they were able to fund luxury lifestyles and further increase their wealth at the expense of the taxpayer.' Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, David Gauke added: 'This Government will not tolerate dishonest people stealing public money. This sentence shows that those who try to commit fraud need to think again – HMRC will find you and the courts will punish you.' Andrew Biker, Senior Prosecution Lawyer for the Crown Prosecution Service's Central Fraud Group, said: 'For over a decade, Isaac William defrauded the public purse with the knowledge and assistance of his wife and family. 'Not only did he exploit the public purse, he also exploited his employees, many of whom were illegal foreign nationals.'","Isaac William involved his wife and three children in the scam .

"By . David Martosko In Washington . PUBLISHED: . 02:33 EST, 12 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:50 EST, 12 September 2013 . Vital weapons shipments from the United States have begun to arrive in rebel fighting units that oppose the regime of dictator Bashar al-Assad in Syria, according to sources on both ends of the transactions. The light arms, ammunition and other small, trackable armaments – likely grenades, mortars and shells – are coming via clandestine CIA operations in a significant escalation of U.S. involvement in the 30-month-long civil war. The White House promised in June that it would arm anti-Assad forces who were not aligned with Islamist radical groups, authorizing the CIA to do the heavy lifting and manage the pipeline. But news of the weapons' long-awaited delivery comes at an awkward moment, a day after President Obama pledged to pursue diplomacy instead of military action. Reinforcements: Rebel fighting units like this one in the Syrian city of Aleppo are starting to receive weapons from the United States in a significant escalation of U.S. involvement in the civil war . Assad in the sights: Light arms, ammunition and other small, trackable armaments - likely grenades, mortars and shells - are coming via clandestine CIA operations, according to sources on both ends of the transactions . The Washington Post reported late Wednesday night that the CIA has expanded its clandestine network of bases in bordering Turkey and Jordan over the past year, initially to help allies like Saudi Arabia and Qatar to send weapons across the Syrian border. Now those installations are the conduit for American military hardware destined for moderate rebel factions organized under the banner of the Supreme Military Council. That fighting force, outnumbered and outgunned, is led by Gen. Salim Idris, a former Syrian Army commander who defected in 2012. Opposition fighters have sustained heavy losses while they waited for the U.S. to send the cavalry, in often gruesome battles that have killed more than 100,000 and turned 2 million civilians into refugees. Last week a career U.S. intelligence official told MailOnline that the delay was in part due to a turf battle between the intelligence and diplomatic communities in Washington. Bad timing: News of the long-awaited weapons delivery comes at an awkward moment, a day after President Obama pledged to pursue diplomacy instead of military action . Backing a tyrant: A Syrian woman holds a portrait of President Bashar al-Assad as pro-regime supporters parade their cars in Damascus to celebrate the leader's 48th birthday on September 11 . Speaking on condition of anonymity, the source said that while higher-ups in the State Department understood that CIA officials would be in charge of shipping arms to border stations and transporting them into Syria, they wanted a say in the delivery timetable. 'It was disheartening,' the source said, 'to see the anti-Assad guys gasping for breath while the brains at Foggy Bottom [where the State Dept. is headquartered] talked about choosing the right moment to turn the tide.' The State Department replied that it 'cannot detail every single type of support that we are providing to the opposition or discuss timelines for delivery.' '[B]ut it’s important to note that both the political and the military opposition are and will be receiving this assistance.' News that U.S. weapons are making it to rebel fighting groups will provide the latest in a whiplash-inducing series of developments in Washington since a chemical weapons attack killed more than 1,400 Syrians on August 21. Less than two weeks ago, Obama asked a vacationing Congress to approve a resolution authorizing him to launch military strikes in retaliation. After a week's reflection, the Republican-controlled House watched warily as the Democratic-controlled Senate rushed through committee hearings and was poised for a floor vote. Not in favour of military action: Nearly half of those polled said the U.S. does not have an obligation to punish regimes like Syria that use chemical weapons to kill civilians . Then in what a White House official later conceded was a 'major goof,' Secretary of State John Kerry answered a reporter's question during a press conference Monday in London by quipping that if Assad wanted to avoid a U.S. attack, he could 'turn over every single bit . of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week.' 'He isn't about to do it,' Kerry quickly added, 'and it can't be done, obviously.' But Russia, a key Assad ally with a strategically irreplaceable naval base on Syria's Mediterranean coast and a continuing series of its own arms deals in play, leaped into the diplomatic opening. In the space of hours, the Russian and Syrian foreign . ministers said publicly that Kerry's 'proposal' was to their liking. The result was an historic backpedal by the White House on the day the president was expected to argue in favor of military force in a series of six television network interviews, and a day before a scheduled prime-time public address. Now Russian President Vladimir Putin has emerged with a diplomatic coup, promising to help Assad surrender his suddenly declared chemical weapons stockpiles on what the White House conceded Wednesday is an unspecified timetable. Obama was left Tuesday night to tell the American people that he had asked Congress to put his war-powers resolution on the back burner while international negotiations play out. What Obama surely knew when he first asked Congress to approve military intervention – although the public wasn't informed – was that U.S. military hardware was already crossing the Syrian border. It's unclear whether, at the time, the White House told key members of Congress what the CIA was doing. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, crafted the war powers resolution with his Democratic counterpart, New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, the committee's chairman. Yet three weeks ago Corker was embarrassed when Syrians on the Turkish border begged him for the speedy dispatch of American weapons. 'It was humiliating,' he told the Post. 'The president had announced that we would be providing lethal aid, and not a drop of it had begun. They were very short on ammunition, and the weapons had not begun to flow.' 'There's been a major disconnect,' Corker said on Sept. 2, between what the administration has said it's doing relative to the rebels and what is actually happening. The pipeline has been incredibly slow. It's really hurt morale among the Syrian rebels.' On Wednesday morning at a Wall Street Journal breakfast in Washington, Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain hinted after Obama's prime-time address that he believed the moderate Syrian opposition was still playing a waiting game with the U.S. 'I guarantee I'm going to hear from Gen. Idris today,' McCain said, 'and he's going to say, ""Have you abandoned us? Have you abandoned us? Aren't you going to help us?""' 'And my answer is going to have to be, ""General, I will do everything I can to try and get support for you.""' Word of warning: Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, says a U.S. strike will bring more violence . Other nations have been supplying and resupplying the anti-Assad rebels while the U.S. dithered, most significantly the Saudi and Qatari shipments that the CIA was facilitating through its stations in Turkey and Jordan. But the Obama administration will continue to face tough questions about why its June 2013 promises took three months to fulfill. A month after that pledge, Kerry met at the United Nations headquarters with Ahmad Al-Jarba, a former Syrian political prisoner who now leads the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, the largest Western-backed opposition group. Jarba said in a statement on July 26 that his people's situation was 'desperate' without sufficient weapons to hold its positions in Damascus suburbs, and in the more distant provinces of Homs, Aleppo and Deir al-Zor. Opposition forces, he said then, needed swift U.S. action 'to push the international community to demand a political transition.' In the late spring, the Obama administration's daily drumbeat on Syria included assertions that U.S. involvement was aimed at forcing Assad from power. 'We have been making clear as a matter of United States policy that we believe that Assad must not continue to rule Syria,' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said during a briefing on May 29. 'We are unapologetic,' he added, 'about a policy position that calls for a future in Syria that does not include a tyrant who has demonstrated his willingness to murder his own people.' But in the week following the Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack, Carney began to provide fuel to skeptics who feared American promises of concrete help for rebel groups would go unfulfilled. 'I want to make clear,' he told reporters on Aug. 28, 'that the options that we are considering are not about regime change.  They are about responding to a clear violation of an international standard that prohibits the use of chemical weapons.'","Guns, mortars and ammunition smuggled in as U.S. steps up role in civil war .

But a six-year dispute over a 10ft strip of land between two millionaires reached a new low when one of the men dropped his trousers to ‘moon’ at his neighbours. The astonishing rearguard action was the latest incident in an increasingly frenzied turf war between the men which has already led to a greenhouse being burnt down, a string of trees felled and accusations of people hiding in bushes taking secret photos. Dispute: Company director Neville Williams (left) was captured on camera 'mooning' at his neighbour as his gardener looks on . The graphic shows the piece of land between Mr Mead and Mr Williams that they have been arguing over . Argument: Gerald Mead (pictured) and Mr Williams have been locked in a bitter dispute about the strip of land for six years . Land: Mr Mead had planted trees on the narrow strip of land between their two houses as he believed he owned it . Property developer Gerald Mead, 71, insists the three-yard gap between their properties in Kingswood, Surrey, belongs to him. Mr Mead and his wife, Heather, planted trees on the land during their 19 years in the property. But . neighbour Neville Williams, 53, the director of a company that services . Rolls-Royces and Bentleys, is equally adamant that the strip belongs to . him. He claims a . document from the Land Registry proves he is within his rights to remove . Mr Mead’s trees and put up a ‘conifer screen’ instead. Caught on camera: Mr Williams admitted he did pull his trousers down but only 'after 18 months of Mrs Mead hiding in the bushes taking photos of me' Row: Police have said they cannot resolve the dispute and have advised the two neighbours go to mediation . Proof: Mr Williams (pictured) says a document from the Land Registry proves he owns the land . After a series of increasingly bitter rows, Mr Williams took things into his own hands this summer. While his neighbours were on  holiday, he chopped down some of the trees planted by the Meads. He then set fire to the trunks – but the blaze spread out of control and destroyed Mr Mead’s greenhouse. Then last month, he pulled down his trousers to flash his bottom at Mr Mead’s garden – a moment that was captured on camera. Destroyed: Mr Williams has apologised for inadvertently destroying Mr Mead's greenhouse when he set fire to the trunks of the trees he had chopped down . Accident: An attempt to burn severed trunks got out of hand, spread to more of the trees and destroyed Mr Mead's greenhouse . Mrs Mead, 69, said: ‘The grandkids were playing in the garden and I was just enjoying watching them. ‘Then he (Mr Williams) came out and there were a few words between him and the gardener. ‘Then Freddy, who is seven, shouted, “He’s showing his bum”.’ Exclusive: Kingswood, in Surrey, is one of Britain's wealthiest suburbs. Mr Mead's house is pictured on the left, while Mr Williams' house is on the right . Trees: Mr Williams described the trees as 'horrible', 'manky' and 'old' and said they needed 'taking down' Mr . Williams admitted: ‘Yes, I did remove my trousers, but only after 18 . months of Mrs Mead hiding in the bushes taking photos of me.’ He added: ‘Common sense must prevail. It’s completely got out of proportion.’ He has now apologised for destroying his neighbours’ greenhouse and has offered to pay for it. Mr .

Hit four times: Catherine Bury, 56, had locked herself in the bathroom but her attacker burst through and shot her . Three generations of a British  family were shot by their gardener after a pool party at their Turkish holiday home. Anne Bury, who was celebrating her 56th birthday, was killed. Her son Alex, 23, and mother Cecilia, 87, were taken to hospital with serious injuries. Their attacker had been arrested less than 48 hours before for apparently making death threats against the family. But he was released, and shortly afterwards arrived at the luxury villa in the picturesque coastal resort of Dalyan armed with a pump-action shotgun. The shootings happened in the early hours of Monday, after a party to mark Miss Bury’s birthday. The 46-year-old gunman, named by locals as Turkish gardener and handyman Velli Acar, appears to have targeted the family in some kind of revenge attack. He blasted Mrs Bury in the back and shot her grandson in the leg. Miss Bury fled in  terror up three flights of stairs and bolted herself in her bathroom. But Acar blasted the lock and reportedly shot her four times at point-blank range as she cowered on the tiled floor. She died at the scene. Her son and widowed mother were taken by ambulance to separate hospitals. Mrs Bury was later discharged and Alex was said to be in a ‘stable’ condition after undergoing successful surgery to repair a damaged artery in his leg. Locals in Dalyan claimed that Miss Bury may have been in a relationship with Acar and the killing was probably a crime of passion. The suspect, named locally as Velli Acar, is taken into custody by the security forces today . The luxury villa where three members of a British family were shot . Neighbour Ozman Tugcu said: ‘I’d seen . them out together occasionally and thought they were a couple. But they . were both quiet and kept themselves to themselves.’ But . another neighbour said the row was over money, and Acar had been . accused of pocketing cash intended for other tradesmen for work at the . villa. Police have refused to comment on the motive for the shooting. Alex Bury, 24, is rushed to hospital after he was shot in the leg. Alex is being treated in Mugla University Hospital . The gardener, known as VA, 46, is lead away by Turkish jandarma . Mr . Tugcu described the British family as ‘quiet and respectable people’. He said he was alerted to the shooting by the arrival of police. Alex Bury planned to become a doctor, according the family's neighbours in north Allerton . ‘I . was horrified to see the elderly lady brought out of the house,’ he . said. ‘She was covered in blood. I was sure she was dead and am . astonished she survived. It’s a really dreadful thing to happen.’ The gunman later gave himself up to police and was remanded in  custody yesterday ahead of a formal court appearance. Miss Bury and her family had been going to stay in their villa in the tiny fishing village for six years. Acar, . described as a heavy drinker, had been reported to police over alleged . death threats and was arrested on Saturday. He was held overnight for . questioning and released the following day. Locals said the suspect also owned a boat and ran trips for tourists in the resort. One . resident said he would regularly drink a bottle of a strong local wine. ‘Velli was a quiet man but we think he had an alcohol problem,’ he . said. The Bury family had  decorated their villa with bunting and . balloons for the birthday party by the pool on Sunday. Yesterday blood smears could be seen on the marble floors beneath the decorations.

David Axelrod has said goodbye to his mustache - his faithful companion for the last 40 years. The idea to part with the facial hair first came during the 2012 presidential race when Axelrod, President Obama's senior campaign adviser, announced he was so confident that the Democratic incumbent would win the key battleground states of Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania that Axelrod would shave his mustache if Obama failed to claim victory. When Obama was declared the winner, Axelrod's stache was safe...but he turned the idea into gold for a good cause. After raising $1 million for epilepsy research, Axelrod appeared on MSNBC's Morning Joe in New York on Friday and freed his upper lip of the hair that had nested there for 40 years. Scroll down for video. This is a mustache: In October, David Axelrod told the Morning Joe hosts he would shave his mustache if Obama lost the key battleground states of Minnesota, Michigan or Pennsylvania in the election . Now you see it, now you don't: Axelrod held on to the facial hair since Obama was successful in the election but he ultimately ditched the stache for charity . When Axelrod put his mustache on the line in an October interview on Morning Joe, in the lead up to November 6, the race to the White House really began to heat up - with many in the media joking the New York native might have to part with his long term accessory. Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough in turn had said he would grow a mustache if Romney lost Florida or North Carolina. After Obama's re-election, and his victory in Florida, Axelrod didn't need to pay up but Scarborough, apparently uncertain of how the new look would suit him, decided to use the publicity to help a good cause. Axelrod has a daughter, 31-year-old Lauren, who suffers from epilepsy and he decided to launch a fundraising effort in early November to benefit CURE (Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy), a non-profit that Axelrod's wife, Susan, started in 1998. In return, Scarborough kicked off the effort with a $10,000 donation as part of the  'Slash the Stache' campaign. The moment of truth: Axelrod was surrounded by his wife Susan (left), MSNBC host Joe Scarborough (second from left), Steve from eShave and host Mika Brzezinski (right) for the momentous shave . Faithful friend: Axelrod, 57, has had the stache for 40 years and said he was up all night preparing to say goodbye to the facial hair . Over the years: Axelrod's wife Susan, left, said the mustache was lighter in shade when they were married in 1979 . Axelrod said if he could raise $1 million in one month, he would come on Morning Joe and shave the mustache. In the course of the month, over 2,608 donors pledged $1,051,679. High profile donors included real estate tycoon Donald Trump, who donated $100,000, and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, who gave $200,000. Other donors included President Obama, George Clooney and Tom Hanks. 'It took David's mustache to bring Donald Trump and President Obama together,' the hosts joked on Friday about the bi-partisan participation. With the fundraising mark met - Axelrod said he would make good on his promise. 'I will keep my part of the bargain and surrender the stache at 7:15 on @ Morning_Joe!' he tweeted late Thursday in anticipation of his transformation on Friday. Do not try this at home: Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski stepped in with an electric razor but Axelrod didn't look too sure about her participation . Saying goodbye: The professionals stepped in, with Steve from eShave leading the effort . Cleaning up: The barber also used a straight razor to shave away the hair that has rested on Axelrod's upper lip for 40 years . Axelrod was joined by his wife Susan and Morning Joe hosts Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski for the day of reckoning. In the lead up to the shave, Axelrod admitted, 'I'm very attached to it.' 'Does your mustache have any last requests?' Scarborough joked. 'I was up all night, to be . honest with you. It’s a little unsettling. I was up last night talking to it...it keeps saying 'Why, why, why, do we have to do this?' he added, though he conceded that the end did justify the means. Gone but not forgotten: Axelrod prepares to see himself without a mustache for the first time in 40 years . Did I really just do that? At first, Axelrod seemed uncertain about his choice . Satisfied customer: After a few moments getting used to the idea, and with a little encouragement from his wife, Axelrod couldn't help but smile . Axelrod's wife was on hand for the ordeal. The couple married in 1979, when he was already sporting a mustache, and she has never known him without the facial hair. 'It was very dark then,' she said about the state of the stache in his youth, 'It has lightened,' she added euphemistically about it aging gracefully. Throughout the chit-chat, Axelrod closed his eyes and braced himself for the inevitable moment, saying he bet his friends at the White House were watching...'and laughing.' A new man: David Axelrod shaved his mustache on Friday as part of his campaign to raise $1 million for epilepsy research . Scarborough offered to help out but Axelrod said he 'was not going to let Joe Scarborough near my neck with a straight razor.' A professorial from eShave, Steve, was on set to do the actual deed. The 57-year-old looked pain as the razor came down and the hair began to fall. After the shave, his wife complimented him on his new look and even Donald Trump called the show to congratulate Axelrod for his commitment to charity and willingness to go under the razor for a good cause. But the suspense continued even after the mustache was gone. 'Slashthestachers, stay tuned. At 4:30 p.m. on CNN, one of DC's remaining mustachioed personalities is going 2 put his whiskers on the line,' Axelrod tweeted after this appearance on Morning Joe about his next media spot.

Friends of a Taiwanese woman pleaded with her not to kill herself as she chatted to them live on Facebook, giving them a running commentary of her own suicide. But not one of them alerted the authorities as Claire Lin, 31, told them she was inhaling poisonous fumes. Police in Taipei said her final Facebook entries show her chatting with nine friends, describing her gradual asphyxiation. Chilling: Claire Lin, 31, used Facebook to chat to nine friends as she inhaled poisonous fumes . One picture posted from her mobile phone shows a charcoal barbecue burning next to two stuffed animals. Another shows the room filled with fumes. Police officer Hsieh Ku-ming said today that Miss Lin took her own life on her birthday, March 18. Family members reported the suicide soon after her death but were unaware of the online conversations that accompanied it. One friend, identified as Chung Hsin, told Miss Lin: 'Be calm, open the window, put out the charcoal fire, please, I beg you.' She replied: 'The fumes are suffocating. They fill my eyes with tears. Don't write me anymore.' Her last words, written in Chinese, were: 'Too late. My room is filled with fumes. I just posted another picture. Even while I'm dying, I still want FB [Facebook]. Must be FB poison. Haha.' Miss Lin's chilling messages indicated she was unhappy because her boyfriend was ignoring her, and had failed to return home to be with her on her birthday. He found her body the following morning and alerted her family. Mr Hsieh said he regretted that none of Miss Lin's friends called the police for help during the 67-minute episode. But he added: 'It could be true that it would be hard to track down a Facebook friend without her address or phone contact.' Chai Ben-rei, a sociologist at Taiwan's Feng Chia University, said the incident reflected social isolation in the internet age. 'People may have doubts about what they see on the internet because of its virtual nature, and fail to take action on it,' he said.","Claire Lin, 31, gave a running commentary to nine friends - but not one of them alerted the emergency services .

A multi-billion dollar U.S. company has been found guilty of hiring Mexican workers on well below the minimum wage and paying them in pesos, it was revealed today. Silicon Valley firm Bloom Energy Corporation paid 14 employees the equivalent of just $2.66 per hour, around a third of the federal minimum hourly rate of $7.25, a U.S. Labor department investigation found. The clean energy manufacturer, which provides power systems for firms such as Google, Walmart and Coca-Cola, also violated overtime and record-keeping provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, a U.S. District judge ruled. 'Appalling': Bloom Energy, which makes clean energy generators like these ones outside eBay's headquarters, has been found guilty of paying 14 Mexican workers well below the federal minimum wage . Ruben Ronsalez, a Labor department administrator, said: 'It is appalling that this was happening right in the heart of Silicon Valley, one of the wealthiest per capita areas in the U.S. 'The department remains vigilant in protecting the rights of vulnerable workers and to ensuring they are paid the wages they have rightfully earned.' The company, which receives tax breaks as a 'clean energy' provider and is worth an estimated $2.7billion, must now pay the Mexican nationals $31,922 in lost wages as well as $6,160 in civil penalties, according to Fox News. The employees, who were in the U.S. on visitor visas, worked alongside American employees welding and refurbishing generators.

Their wages were deposited into a Mexican account in pesos, according to the Labour department, which launched a two-year investigation in November 2010, but did not reveal why. As well as the financial penalties, Bloom Energy has been banned from shipping the goods made by the Mexican workers and must publish quarterly reports over the next two years to show they are adhering to legal pay practices.

An Arkansas man who raised an abandoned bear cub for six months until wildlife officials confiscated the animal says he wants his ‘little girl’ back. Robert Baysinger chokes up with tears when he describes finding the cub he named Savannah and gets even more emotional when he recalls the day he came home to find her gone. The Marshall man insists he has what it takes to properly raise the animal, but Arkansas Game and Fish maintains that wild animals must be cared for by professionals and confiscated Savannah on Monday. Scroll down for video . Heartbroken: Robert Baysinger of Marshall, Arkansas raised a bear named Savannah for six months and now he weeps thinking about how she's been taken away by wildlife officials . 'They came in there with total strangers': Baysinger arrived home Monday to find that Savannah had been seized by wildlife officials . ‘She's part of my family. It's no different from raising a little kid. She depends on you,’ Baysinger told KARK. Baysinger was doing a prescribed burn on his land in March when he discovered the bear crying and along with singed fur. ‘I picked it up. It couldn't walk,’ he said. He kept watch over the little cub for a couple of days, but when its mother never returned, Baysinger decided to take her in. 'Like a little Yorkie': Savannah became a part of Baysinger's family and lived in his home for six months . 'It's no different from raising a little kid': Baysinger said Savannah was quickly learning to pick blackberries and to climb . Attached: Savannah was burned during a prescribed burn near Baysinger's home in March. Baysinger tried returning her to the wild but her mother never returned and she seemed to want to stay with Baysinger . For six months, Baysinger watched the bear grow and became attached to Savannah like a human child. ‘I got an old '86 Toyota pickup, she gets in there like a dog and she hangs her head out the window like a little Yorkie and goes wherever I go when I'm not doing nothing,’ Baysinger said as he fought back tears. Early this week, Baysinger left home and when he returned Savannah was gone. All that was left was a ticket taped to his door from Arkansas Game and Fish. Baysinger is devasted. Naysayer: Game and Fish spokesman Steve ""Wildman"" Wilson says Baysinger is endangering himself and the bear . Write caption here . 'I've been in the woods all my life': Baysinger dismissed claims that he is unprepared to raise a wild animal . ‘She's crying,’ he said. ‘They came in there with total strangers. And took her by force and put her in a strange place that she's not used to. She's crying.‘ . Officials fear that Baysinger is putting himself and the animal in danger. ‘This is not only about his safety but the bear's safety as well,’ said Game and Fish spokesman Steve ‘Wildman’ Wilson. ‘We all love bears. We all love wildlife. They're cute and they're cuddly but it's called wildlife for a reason.’ Needless to say, Baysinger disagrees and says the classroom of life has taught him all he needs to know. ‘I've been in the woods all my life,’ he said. ‘68 years. Even though I don't have a certificate hanging on my wall I know more about it than the people who has her right now.’ Baysinger is now begging to have Savannah returned. ‘I'm asking game and fish to please let me have my little girl back.’ To see the full interview with Robert click here .","Robert Baysinger cried as he described the day Savannah was taken from this Arkansas home .

Linda Leann Wallace, 53, has been sentenced to 16 years in a Texas prison for the relationship with her student . A 53-year-old teacher and mother who had a sexual relationship with a female student lasting four years has been jailed for 16 years. Linda Leann Wallace, of Texas, was given the lengthy sentence despite her daughter telling the court:'My mom is not a predator.' Wallace, 53, began the inappropriate relationship when the student was 13 years old. The 16 year sentence is one of the harshest ever handed down by a court for a teacher involved in an inappropriate relationship. A court in Beaumont, Texas, was told the affair continued for four years and the pair would meet at her home, on campus and during school trips. The affair ended when he teen graduated from the Legacy Christian Academy where Wallace worked as a music teacher. Wallace had pleaded guilty to engaging with an underage student in July. She was arrested in 2012 after police were tipped off about the affair. Her daughter had spoken on her mom’s behalf telling the court her mom was not a sexual predator. Wallace also spoke in her own defense saying she was sorry for her actions. 'I've had remorse for many years.  I'm terribly sorry.  I cry myself to sleep at night for her innocence,' said Wallace. 'We knew it was wrong. The only reason it evolved to that point was because she was struggling with her family. 'I wanted so hard to be there for the student and encourage her. I should have stood my ground.  I'm sincerely sorry.' Wallace was a teacher at Legacy Christian Academy in Beaumont, Texas (pictured) In a victim impact statement the female student, who has not been named, said she forgave Wallace - but told here 'there must be consequences.' The victim said: 'I don't wish anything bad on you. I just wanted to do the right thing. I am deeply saddened by what took place. 'I was seeking a motherly figure. I trusted you so much. I was robbed spiritually, emotionally, physically, and mentally. 'I was afraid of that happening to someone else. The enemy had silenced me for a good portion of my life. 'But, today I shed light. I'm not going to be silent anymore. I'm not angry with you. This is not the end for you. I completely forgive you. But, there must be consequences.' Prosecutors said Wallace faced between two to 20 years in jail. Prosecutors said the student's family is 'severely traumatized' by the relationship because Wallace was also a family friend. Wallace's attorney, Paul Fukuda,said:  'It's a tragedy for both families. Ms. Wallace is taking full responsibility.'","The sentence is one of the harshest ever handed down by a court for teacher relationship .

Nash Papyrus: The fragile fragment and some of the other most significant religious manuscripts in the world are being put online by Cambridge University . A digital version of a fragile 2,000 year old copy of the Ten Commandments will be put online. The Nash Papyrus - one of the most significant religious documents in the world  - will be placed on the internet by Cambridge University. It is among 25,000 new images made available by the university library. Other manuscripts include one of the most remarkable ancient copies of the New Testament, The Codex Bezae, thought to date from the fourth century. Another important historic text that has been released is the tenth-century Book of Deer, which is widely believed to be the oldest surviving Scottish manuscript and contains the earliest known examples of written Gaelic. A thirteenth-century Life of Edward the Confessor provides an account of the early English saint and king and boasts masterpieces of English illumination, including a very graphic portrayal of the Battle of Hastings. The extensive Cairo Genizah collections, which are being gradually released through the digital library, provide fascinating glimpses into the everyday life of a Jewish community in Egypt over a period of a thousand years. Based at the crossroads of trade and intellectual exchange, the archive of this community represents one of the most important sources for understanding the wider medieval world. Cambridge is also beginning to release digital versions of its library's Islamic and Sanskrit collections, which include both secular and religious texts. The Islamic manuscripts collection includes some of the earliest surviving Qur'ans, while the Library's Sanskrit manuscripts cover all the major religious traditions of South Asia and include some of the oldest known manuscripts of key religious texts. The Polonsky Foundation charity has helped to fund the digitisation of much of the new content on the website. It aims to make the world's intellectual treasures freely available to a global audience. Anne Jarvis, university librarian, said: 'Cambridge University Library preserves works of great importance to faith traditions and communities around the world. 'Because of their age and delicacy these manuscripts are seldom able to be viewed - and when they are displayed, we can only show one or two pages. 'Now, through the generosity of the Polonsky Foundation, anyone with a connection to the Internet can select a work of interest, turn to any page of the manuscript, and explore it in extraordinary detail.' The Cambridge University online library was launched last year and has already attracted tens of millions of hits on its website.

Named after the Egyptologist who purchased it at the beginning of the twentieth century, the Nash papyrus is a very fragile second-century BCE manuscript. Before the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, it was by far the oldest manuscript containing text from the Hebrew Bible, and even now it remains among the most ancient. The Codex Bezae is one of the most important New Testament manuscripts. Containing the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles in Greek and Latin, it is thought to date from the late fourth or early fifth century. It is striking in containing many unique forms of the text, including, a saying attributed to Jesus found in no other sources, a longer ending that was added to Mark's Gospel and a strikingly different version of Acts. The Book of Deer is a tiny pocket gospel book, about 16cm tall and 11cm wide. Historic: A fragment of an Abbasid Qur'an, showing geometric ornamentation, which was probably written in the 9th Century . Book of Deer: The tiny pocket gospel book dates back to the 10th Century, and contains early 12th Century additions in Latin, Old Irish and Scottish Gaelic . This illustrated Buddhist text on palm leaf will also go up online thanks to the project . Usually dated to the first half of the tenth century, the manuscript is of particular importance to Scotland. It is widely regarded as the earliest surviving manuscript produced in Scotland and also contains the earliest examples of written Scots Gaelic, added to the manuscript in the twelfth century at the monastery of Deer in Aberdeenshire. The Life of St Edward the Confessor by Matthew Paris celebrates the life of this important English saint and king.

Sian Lloyd was said to be devastated last night after being ‘uninvited’ from the wedding of her stepdaughter Suzanne Ashman to Euan Blair, son of the former prime minister. TV weathergirl Miss Lloyd married Suzanne’s father, 64-year-old motor racing entrepreneur Jonathan Ashman, after a whirlwind romance six years ago and had been preparing to attend tomorrow’s ceremony for weeks. But just days ago she was told that she would not be welcome at the Blair family mansion in Wotton Underwood, Buckinghamshire, where the wedding party is due to take place. ‘She was basically and unceremoniously uninvited,’ explained a close friend last night. ‘Sian is devastated and at one stage Jonathan was talking about not going if Sian was not allowed to attend. 'But Sian has insisted he attend as he is giving his only child away and simply must be there. ‘The mystery remains for Sian as to why she has been excluded. She has been met with a wall of silence from both Suzanne and the Blair side so she just has to accept what she has been told.’ It is not known if Miss Ashman herself decided that Miss Lloyd, 55, should not attend the wedding – or if she has been excluded for anything she might have said publicly or privately about the Blair family in the past. ‘All she knows,’ added a friend, ‘is that she has got an embossed wedding invitation with her name on it and now she will not be going –  and she is none the wiser why.’ Mr Ashman’s 25-year-old daughter Suzanne is from his marriage to first wife Sedef, which ended more than 13 years ago. She is the daughter of a former Turkish government minister and one-time mayor of Ankara. Euan Blair, 29, who has been dating Suzanne for eight years, is due to marry her at South Pavilion, the Buckinghamshire mansion that his parents bought for £4million in 2008. The young couple were introduced by former defence secretary Geoff Hoon. In recent weeks it has been suggested the Blairs – who are estimated to be worth more than £60 million – are planning a stunning wedding and reception for the couple who became engaged last Christmas and have bought a house together in Islington, North London. Miss Ashman read Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Trinity College, Oxford, after leaving the private St Paul’s Girls’ School in south-west London. Last minute preparations: Euan Blair and Suzanne Ashman on a night out in London 2009 are now looking forward to their big day . Wedding: Tony and Cherie Blair's son Euan is marrying Suzanne Ashman and the party afterwards is taking place at the family mansion in Wotton Underwood, Buckinghamshire . She carried out work experience with Mr Hoon during which she met Euan Blair. She later worked at Tony Blair’s Faith Foundation. Last year, after working for American merchant bank Morgan Stanley, Euan became a business development manager at the Coventry-based Sarina Russo Job Access – part of the Government’s Work Programme – in a move said by some to be a stepping stone towards following his father into politics. Euan is the eldest of the Blairs’ four children and he is the first to marry, though it is unclear whether it will be a Roman Catholic service. He was brought up a Catholic and attended the popular Catholic Oratory school in West London before going to Bristol University where he obtained a 2:1 in History. The Blair mansion: South Pavilion, in Wotton Underwood, where the wedding party will take place . Cherie Blair is a Catholic and her husband joined the Catholic Church in 2007. Guests who are expected at the wedding include Cherie Blair’s Muslim convert sister Lauren but her father, actor Tony Booth, may not be well enough to attend. Miss Lloyd met Jonathan Ashman at a St David’s Day party at Westminster Palace hosted by then Secretary of State for Wales Peter Hain in 2007. Mr Ashman proposed to her in December that year at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania while they were on holiday and the pair married just weeks later at the Portmeirion Hotel in Gwynedd, Wales. Last night Miss Lloyd was unavailable for comment. A spokesman for Tony Blair did not wish to comment.","Suzanne Ashman and Euan Blair are set to marry tomorrow .

If you’ve already invested in a brand new autumn wardrobe and can’t wait to wear it all, you’re in luck this weekend. Everyone else? Well, you’d better go find your old cagoule fairly sharpish. Storms are set to batter huge swathes of the country tomorrow, with forecasters issuing severe weather warnings for many areas. Autumn storms: Last week waves pounded the wall surrounding Seaham lighthouse in County Durham . Vile conditions: Driving rain and strong winds ghave replaced the sunny summer weather of late . Winds of up to 70mph are expected in . parts of Scotland, North-West England, North Wales and Northern Ireland . tomorrow, with blustery conditions in the South. The wind will be accompanied by up to two and a half inches of rain. Last week, Britain left summer behind in typical fashion with wind, rain and plummeting temperatures. And just as the dire autumn conditions begin, forecasters have warned the weather will get dramatically worse over the weekend. Forecasters also predict that up to two-and-a-half inches of rain could fall over the weekend. The South will avoid the high-speed winds, but will not escape low temperatures, showers and the first signs of a cold autumn. Temperatures will be in the mid-teens in some parts, but will drop to as low as 10C during the day in the north of Scotland. It comes a week after hailstorms and torrential rain hit parts of North Yorkshire and the North East, leading to dozens of people being evacuated from their homes. Lindsay Mears, a spokesman for the Met Office said it was going to uncharacteristically cold for this time of year and admitted the weather would not be pleasant for the next few days. She said: 'We are going to get some rather wild weather coming in. 'Tomorrow will not be too bad with a few scattered showers, reasonably normal temperature for this time of year. 'But we are looking at a yellow warning being in place on Sunday and Monday in Scotland and the North East of England. 'We are expecting gales of between 45 to 60mph with cold temperatures. It is possible it could go up to 70 on coastal areas. It will be really unpleasant. Change: Last week, 11 miles down the coast from Seaham, the sun beamed down on South Marsden beach in South Shields . This time last year parts of the country saw similar Autumn gales, with the seafront at Swansea Marina (pictured) feeling the impact . 'The south will escape the wild weather with pleasant conditions but colder temperatures than is typical for this time of year. 'This yellow warning means drivers need to be aware of things that may have blown onto the road when they are out and about. 'There are no warnings for Tuesday, but it will feel quite cold compared with the last few weeks. 'From then, it is going to feel a lot colder than it has done.' Last week saw extraordinary extremes as the country was hit by a mixture of blizzards and hailstorms, but it seems the cold weather and the decline into winter will begin on Tuesday. The Met Office said it is likely that 2013 will be one of the ten warmest summers . since records began in 1910. Heat maps revealed the mercury has been 2C higher than average this summer. August 1, has so far been the hottest day of the year with temperatures reaching 33.7C at Heathrow Airport in West London, surpassing the previous seven-year high of 33.5C on July 22. Estimates also suggest that just 7.45in of rain fell between June and . August, about 78 per cent of the UK average. This made it the driest summer since 2006 and has led to an early Autumn with trees expected to shed their leaves in the next couple of weeks. Last week dozens of people had to be evacuated from their homes after almost a month and a half's worth of rain fall in just 24 hours. In some areas of North Yorkshire as much as 75mm of rain fall over a 24 hour period, almost one and a half times the average September monthly rainfall. Durham was Britain's wettest city with over 58mm of rain. In Redcar, Cleveland, up to 60 people had to be evacuated while in nearby Saltburn part of a bridge was washed away with some areas seeing up to three inches of rain fall. And on the other side of the country a freak hail storm covered parts of Devon and Cornwall in a blanket of white creating a winter wonderland, at the beginning of September. Just a few days before, forecasters were predicting an Indian Summer with the mercury reaching 28C on September 1st. But the hopes were washed away a week later with a flurry of showers and plummeting temperatures.","Met Office say 'wild' conditions are expected on Sunday and Monday .

Cowboy: Builder Martin Bennison, 53, smiles as he leaves Teesside Crown Court after being sentenced to 300 hours unpaid work . A cowboy builder charged a doctor £37,318  for worthless work so he could prop up his failing business. Martin Bennison, 53, took the money from Dr Jitendra during a refurbishment planned especially for his daughter's Indian wedding. But the builder flooded the doctor’s Wolviston home, botching a bathroom plumbing job while guests were staying in neighbouring rooms . A judge at Teeside Crown Court ordered ex-bankrupt Bennison to carry out 300 hours’ unpaid work after admitting eight unfair trading offences. Dr Patel, 67, said outside court: 'He got away lightly.' Bennison, 53, was a friend trusted by Dr Patel after building his home and doing work at his Seaton Carew surgery to his satisfaction. He was asked to build an extension, refurbish a bathroom and other works by mid-April last year, in time for Dr Patel’s daughter’s wedding. He charged tens of thousands of pounds, plus VAT, for the home improvements. He took a 50 per cent deposit of £23,570 for materials, assuring the family his high quotes were for a 'high specification job'. After starting work a week late, he little improvement was made and the increasingly desperate Patels struggled to contact him. When they found him, he promised: 'Without doubt, Doctor, I will complete the job by April 15, 2012.' He took another £13,748, which he claimed was needed to get the job moving again. But two days earlier, unknown to the Patels, his company had been dissolved. Dr Patel had to pay £1,600 to repair damage caused by Bennison, including the major water leak. He had to use industrial dehumidifiers in the home for three months. His son also had to pay more than £5,000 to a builders’ merchant for materials which Bennison didn’t deliver. When challenged, Bennison couldn’t explain where the family’s money had gone. He downed tools in June last year, leaving barely any work done and having failed to pay a electrician, tiler, painter and decorator. Prosecutor Richard Bennett said: 'The work undertaken was really worthless. 'In short, the family had paid £37,318 for labour and materials for little if any value at all.' Shoddy: Work done by Bennison around pipework in the Patel's home . Unfinished: Bennison did not complete the work in one of the Patel's showers . Sloppy: Bennison took £37,318 from Dr Jitendra Patel for the work, which included this effort on the flooring . A surveyor said the work, if done properly, was worth just £8,000, but the family would have to spend that sum just to put right what had gone wrong. Ian Mullarkey, defending, said the married dad had a good work record for more than 30 years, but was in a desperate situation at the time through 'the most dire' financial and personal circumstances. He said Bennison showed fremorse and deep regret, now lived with his daughter but was still in the same line of work and would like to repay the money. The judge, Recorder Tim Gittins, told .

He didn’t give me any choice because of his arrogance. It’s been very, very stressful.' His son, 32-year-old accountant Yaomi Patel, said: 'He gets that sentence, it’s not right.

The family of a five-year-old girl who was given the all-clear following treatment for a brain tumour have now been told she has just weeks to live. Despite raising almost £300,000 to fly their daughter twice to the U.S. for specialist radiation therapy, the devastated family have been told her cancer has returned. Ruby Owen was given the all-clear in 2010 following the treatment in the U.S. which is not available on the NHS. Heartbroken: Ruby Owen, who has just weeks to live, pictured with her mother Rachel and her father Martin . Doctors had discovered more tumours despite the youngster, pictured, having just returned from therapy . But her heartbroken father Martin, 42, revealed today that doctors had discovered more tumours despite the youngster having just returned from 10 weeks of radiation therapy. Martin posted a message on a Facebook group that had previously been used to raise money for his daughter’s treatment revealing there was nothing more doctors could do for Ruby. In the heart-wrenching post, Martin spoke of the ‘unbearable pain’ experienced by himself and wife Rachel, 40, after learning the devastating news. He wrote: 'Ruby’s scan was not the best result they think it has come back again its so hard for me to tell you all this as the pain is unbearable. 'Our little girl has never done anything to anybody and does not deserve this.' Martin went on to thank the group’s 14,000 members for their support since Ruby was diagnosed with cancer. He wrote: 'Your support over the last 3 1/2 years has been nothing short of phenomenal. It pains me to tell you that ruby’s (C word) has come back and there is nothing they can do for her this time. 'They have said it will only be weeks not months. our hearts have been torn in two yet again we are doing our best to stay strong. Ruby's family raised almost £300,000 to fund specialist radiation treatment for their daughter in the USA not available on the NHS . Still smiling: A Facebook group of 14,000 members have showed their support for Ruby since she was diagnosed with cancer . 'We would just like to say thank you to each and every one of you for all that you have given, time and money, to help keep our baby girl as well as she has been.' Ruby was last night being cared for in a hospice near the family’s home in Kidsgrove, Stoke-on-Trent. She was first diagnosed with the rare and aggressive form of cancer in 2009. A year later the girl was flown to the U.S. to undergo a course of proton treatment after her family and friends raised £170,000. Ruby was given the all-clear and returned to the UK with her parents. Tragically, in February this year medics discovered a second tumour and Ruby’s family raised a further £120,000 to send her back to America for the treatment.","Ruby Owen was flown to the US twice for therapy not available on the NHS .

Grilled by MPs: Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said was open to moves to cool Britain's housing market if it began to over-heat . House prices should not be allowed to rise by more than 5 per cent a year – and the Bank of England should stop them if they do, a report will say today. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) will today call for radical new rules, such as banning banks from lending more than 80 per cent of a property’s value and shrinking the maximum life of a mortgage. In an explosive move, it says urgent action is needed by the Bank due to ‘a growing risk of another house price boom’. Yesterday, Bank of England governor Mark Carney also signalled to MPs that he was open to moves to cool Britain’s housing market if it began to over-heat. The institution warned that if action was not taken to control house prices, ‘another housing bubble, reckless bank lending and a dangerous build-up in household debt’ could cripple Britain again. But the move will draw protests from the generation of young people already frozen off the property ladder by house price rises. With an average home now costing £170,000, nearly seven times the average full-time salary, the introduction of a compulsory deposit amount – such as 20 per cent – could make it even harder for young people to get on the property ladder. Critics warn the housing market is already over-heating, with price rises in each of the past seven months, largely fuelled by the Government’s interventions. Under two controversial schemes, both called Help to Buy, people are being encouraged to buy a home with a deposit of just 5 per cent. The second scheme launches in January. In Canada – where Mr Carney ran the Bank of Canada before coming to the UK in July – 100 per cent mortgages are banned and a minimum deposit of 20 per cent is needed if you are refinancing a loan, and 5 per cent on a new mortgage. Grilled by Labour MP Pat McFadden about what he would do about ‘an unhealthy acceleration in house prices’, Mr Carney told the Treasury Select Committee that a ‘more intensive supervision of lending’ was possible. One option is ‘some guidance provided in terms of loan-to-value ratios’, he said. The loan-to-value ratio is the figure representing the size of deposit in relation to the property’s value. For example, a £10,000 deposit on a £100,000 home gives an ratio of 90 per cent. But he added: ‘We do not have powers of direction in that regard, but certainly have an ability to observe and recommend if necessary.’ Still a dream: With an average home now costing £170,000, nearly seven times the average salary, the introduction of a compulsory deposit amount could make it even harder for youngster to get on the property ladder . Joshua Miller, senior economist at RICS and author of the report, said capping house price inflation at 5 per cent per year ‘would discourage households from taking on excessive debt out of fear of missing out on a price boom’. At present, house prices are rising by 6.2 per cent a year, but rose  by up to 30 per cent a year at the height of the boom a decade ago. RICS said the policy could be introduced on a regional basis, if some areas of the UK are hit by rampant house price inflation but homeowners in other regions experience the opposite. But in a recent report, the Council of Mortgage Lenders said: ‘Intervention to dampen buoyancy in some locations would almost certainly bear down on other local markets where activity is more subdued, unless carefully targeted.’ The number of first-time buyers getting a mortgage has hit the highest level since the credit crunch began in 2007 as banks are offering far more loans which need only a 5 per cent deposit. Before the credit crunch, there were 1,000 different types of 95 per cent loans. During the recession, it dropped to just three, but has rallied to 46. █ Mr Carney admitted to MPs that savers had been hammered by record low interest rates designed to encourage people to spend. He said thrifty savers and pensioners who have seen their nest eggs eroded by years of dismal returns and high inflation deserve ‘tremendous sympathy’. But he said holding the Bank rate at rock bottom ‘encourages spending rather than saving’ and that the rates – which have been held at 0.5 per cent since March 2009 – must not rise any time soon for fear of snuffing out the recovery. Simon Rose, from campaign group Save Our Savers, said Mr Carney’s comments amounted to: ‘Spend as much as you can, even if it means borrowing to do it and maybe it will ginger up the economy.’","Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors calls for ban on low-equity loans .

A four-year-old boy who is dying from a rare disease has written a heartbreaking letter describing his illness as his mother hit out at scientists for their lack of research into a cure for the condition. Marshall Starhahn is just one of 24 children in the UK to suffer from Late Infantile Batten Disease, a disorder of the nervous system which normally proves fatal by the age of 12. His mother Lisa, 23, has published a letter written by her son with the help of her and his grandmother in the hope that it may persuade pharmaceutical companies to invest in finding a cure for the illness. Heartbreaking: Marshall Starhahn, pictured with his mother Lara, suffers from a rare and fatal genetic disorder . Upset: Ms Starhahn spoke out about her son's condition in the hope that pharmaceutical companies might try and find a cure for the disease . Tragic: Four-year-old Marshall's condition means that he is unlikely to live beyond the age of 12. He is pictured with one of his school teachers . She said: 'There is no cure, not even a treatment. 'It's basically too rare and not profitable enough for the people who research medications to look into it because there are not enough children like Marshall in the world to make it worthwhile for them financially. 'Marshall will eventually go blind. He will lose the ability to walk completely soon. He's not able to feed himself any more. He can't eat lumps so he will have to be tube fed eventually. 'Children with Batten Disease become bed ridden and then die without being able to see or communicate. Deterioration: Marshall, pictured with his father Michael, was a normal little boy before his diagnosis back in April . Fundraisers: Marshall with his mother Lara and grandmother Elsie Clark holding up signs saying thank you to some of those who helped pay for a recent trip to Disneyland with his family . 'I have to live every day knowing that my child is going to die and all I can do is watch, there is nothing I can physically do. She added: 'As a parent you want nothing more than to protect your children from everything you can and that chance has completely been taken away from me. 'There are no realistic clinical trials that I can put him on, no doctors that can put him on medication that he hasn't already tried.' Marshall was diagnosed with the disorder in April following several months of seizures, thought to be epilepsy, which got progressively worse. Thank you: Marshall, pictured, wrote a letter of thank you to those who raised funds for him to go to Disneyland, describing his terrible condition . He now also suffers from night terrors, jerks which make him constantly fall over, tremors which mean he can't feed himself or play with his toys, and absences where his eyes roll back in his head and he becomes vacant. The youngster wanted to write the thank you note after friends and colleagues of Marshall's grandmother Elsie Clark, a staff nurse at St Luke's Hospice, in Plymouth, and grandfather Nobbie Clark, a black-cab driver, collected over £1,000 upon hearing of his diagnosis. The money went towards sending Marshall to Disneyland, Paris, with his family. A local newsagents also raised money while the Army Benevolent Charity and Royal Artillery Charitable Fund donated money towards the cost of the trip as Marshall's dad Michael is serving with the Army. Rare: The youngster is one of just 24 in the UK diagnosed with the condition . Lara said of her decision to publish the thank you note: 'I want people to know that there is a childhood disease that hasn't got a cure and that every childhood disease should have a cure. 'It shouldn't matter how many children suffer from it, there should at least be some sort of treatment for those children to give them a chance. 'It makes me angry that companies that make billions of pounds through other diseases can't even find it in their hearts to at least try to invest into Batten disease. 'These children deserve to have a happy childhood. Even if I can't save my own child I will do all I can to raise enough awareness to save someone else's child, to save someone else's family going through what my family is going through. 'Having to think about your child's funeral before they are five years old is horrible, but it's the reality - there is nothing in the world that can save him. Marshall Starhahn's letter . 'My name is Marshall and I am four-and-a-half years old. Until 12 months I ago I was a normal little boy. 'I loved playing football and going down the slide in the park and paddling in the sea. I was always laughing and loving. Well, I still am very loving! 'Then I started having fits, lots of different types. And I began to have trouble talking and things I could do before I couldn't do anymore. 'The doctor did lots of tests and told my mummy and nana in April that that I have Late Infantile NCL, a form of Batten disease. 'It makes me very special because there are only about 20 to 30 children like me in Britain. Lots of horrible things are happening to me very quickly now. 'My hands shake so much I can't play with my toys very well and I have to be fed. And I lose my balance all the time so I can only walk a little bit and need to be steadied when I do. 'I fall over all the time and I get covered in bruises but I rarely cry. 'And there are lots of things I can't eat any more because I choke and I can hardly talk anymore.

Taxpayers are footing a £3million annual bill to pay for taxis to transport prisoners - even though a security firm already has a £420million contract to do the job. The bill pays for prisoners to be ferried between prisons and courts, to visit sick relatives in hospital, or to go to funerals. The cost was uncovered by Labour justice spokesman Sadiq Khan who called on the Government to 'get a grip'. Costly: £3million is reportedly being spent a year ferrying prisoners to and from jail in taxis (file picture) He told The Sun: 'Taxpayers will be outraged that they are stumping up millions to cart prisoners round in luxury taxis. 'The Government is already paying companies to move prisoners, and then taxis to do the same job. Why are we paying twice?' Conservative MP Priti Patel called the cost a 'scandal'. The £3million sum is the equivalent cost of buying 100 black cabs according to The Sun or a £37.27 fare for every inmate in UK jails. The Prison Service claims that transport hire costs had been cut by almost ten per cent since 2010 and that efforts were being made to continue to reduce the cost. Disgusted: The cost was highlighted by Labour spokesman for justice Sadiq Khan . The service was criticised last year after it emerged that millions of pounds was being spent on taxis, hairdressers and even actors. According to reports, one cab firm was paid £920,000 for its work. The Prison Service also spent £720,000 on professional actors for role playing that is aimed at helping inmates get into employment.

Nigel Evans today delivered an extraordinary Commons speech protesting his innocence after being charged with a series of sex offences against seven men. Quitting as Deputy Speaker, he addressed hundreds of MPs including the Prime Minister about his desire to ‘robustly defend my innocence and seek acquittal’. Quoting Churchill, he referred to the death of his mother and the spiritual support of Parliament’s chaplain before thanking fellow MPs for their ‘hugs, prayers and good wishes’. Scroll down for video . Speech: Nigel Evans addressed MPs in a personal statement after Prime Minister's Questions . Last night Evans was charged with the rape of a man between March 29 and April 1, 2013, five sexual assaults dating back to 2009 and two indecent assaults dating back to 2002. The Conservative says he will continue to represent his Ribble Valley constituency in Lancashire but as an independent MP. The decision to charge the openly-gay politician – a popular figure in Westminster – came after he was arrested for a third time yesterday morning. Speaking immediately after Prime Minster’s Questions, he told a packed Commons chamber: ‘I hope you will bear with me while I make this statement, it’s been a few years since I made a speech in this chamber and I’m sad to say this is the speech. ‘As many of you will know following recent allegations, I was charged with alleged offences yesterday. I now have the opportunity to robustly defend my innocence and seek acquittal. ‘I have therefore decided the best course of action is for me to return to the backbenches and this is a decision I have made myself after careful consideration.’ When he left Preston police station last night, he gave  a short statement before saying he ‘will not be making any further comment until after the case concludes’. But in the Commons he spoke at length about the impact of the case on his. Thanks: Evans listed the many people he says have shown him 'compassionate consideration' Evans said: ‘It was one of the happiest days of my life when I was elected deputy speaker in 2010, it was an endorsement of my abilities to do the job by my colleagues and for that I am grateful. ‘Since these allegations, I have not been able to fully fulfil my duties in the chair, which left me in a land of limbo. ‘None of us were elected to the fine office of Member of Parliament to be put in that invidious position, unable to fully fulfil the reason why we were sent here.’ He said he was ‘grateful’ for the ‘unstinting support’ he has revceived from Mr Bercow and the other two deputy speakers, Lindsay Hoyle and Dawn Primarolo. Evans went on: ‘When I told Ms Primarolo on Saturday my decision, I even got a hug from her - thank you Dawn. ‘I have had so many hugs, prayers and good wishes since May 4 and I would like to thank everyone who has shown me such compassionate consideration, my family particularly, my association, who have been marvellous, and even seasoned, crusty journalists have displayed a heart I have never before witnessed. ‘I was told I would soon see who my real friends are and that has been true. But the truth is there have been so many of them - so thank you to my dearest loyal friends, including loyal members of my staff at Westminster and the Ribble Valley. Grateful: Speaker John Bercow paid tribute to Mr Evans twice in the Commons . ‘And to you, my colleagues, on all sides of the House who have spoken with me, looked after me and just shown loving attention. Party divisions disappear in times like this and they have, thank you. ‘Rose Hudson-Wilkin, the Speaker’s chaplain, and Andrew Tremlett, the canon of Westminster Abbey, have given me superb spiritual guidance which has given me the one thing everyone in this world needs, alongside air, water and food: that is hope. ‘Hope is that essential key to giving us a fulfilled life and they have ensured I have retained that hope.’ Evans said: ‘This is clearly the most painful thing I have endured in my life alongside the loss of my mother in 2009 and the loss of my brother earlier this year. ‘Winston Churchill said when you are going through hell, keep going. Sage advice. And so I will see this through to the end with the support of the people that mean so much to me.’ The Ribble Valley MP added: ‘Returning to the backbenches gives me the opportunity to speak out on issues such as the over-building of new homes in the Ribble Valley, threats to the Slaidburn doctors’ surgery and cuts to rural bus services. ‘It’s the bread and butter of politics, giving support to the people who put me in the mother of parliaments, my home for the past 21 years and a place that has meant so much to me. ‘I am proud to serve the people of the Ribble Valley and the best tribute I can give them now is to get on with the job that they sent me here to do.’ Tory MP Nadine Dorries placed a hand on Evans’s shoulder as he sat down after his statement. Earlier, at the start of Commons session, Mr Bercow said: ‘I have received his resignation with sadness. I wish to thank Nigel for his three years of service to the House as deputy speaker, in which he has proved to be highly competent, fair and good-humoured. ‘He has been a loyal and valued member of the team of deputy speakers who assist me in chairing our proceedings. I am warmly grateful to him.’ Evans will appear before magistrates in Preston on September 18. The indecent assaults are alleged to have been committed between January 1, 2002 and January 1, 2004; the sexual assaults between January 1, 2009 and April 1 this year; and the rape between March 29 and April 1 this year. Evans's initial arrest in early May related to offences alleged to have been committed in Pendleton, Lancashire . Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer said: ‘Following an investigation by Lancashire police, the Crown Prosecution Service has received a file of evidence in the case of Mr Nigel Evans MP which concerns allegations of a sexual nature. ‘After careful consideration, we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and that it is in the public interest to prosecute Evans. ‘Lancashire Constabulary has therefore been authorised to charge two counts of indecent assault, five counts of sexual assault and one count of rape relating to a total of seven alleged victims. ‘The decision in this case was taken by Joanne Cunliffe, an experienced specialist rape prosecutor, in consultation with John Dilworth, head of the CPS North West Complex Casework Unit and in consultation with an external and highly experienced criminal QC. ‘I have also been consulted on this case. The decision has been taken in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors and the CPS legal guidance on rape and sexual offences.’ Evans, from Pendleton, Lancashire, stepped aside from his deputy speaker duties after his arrest but had continued to work as an MP. He was one of three deputy speakers elected in a secret ballot of MPs in 2010. Later that year he came out as gay, saying he was ‘’tired of living a lie’’. He was a vice chairman of the Conservative Party from 1999 to 2001. When Iain Duncan Smith became party leader in 2001, he was promoted to the shadow cabinet as shadow Welsh secretary - a post he held for two years.

Support: Archbishop Dr Barry Gordon said it made 'no theological sense' to oppose women bishops . Women will be allowed to become bishops in Wales’ Anglican churches following a landmark vote that will surely put pressure on the Church of England to follow suit. Members . of the Church in Wales’ 144-strong governing body voted through the . proposals at a meeting in Lampeter, near Cerdigan in west Wales, earlier today. Supporters and women’s rights groups called the decision long overdue, arguing the exclusion of women from the top roles made the church less relevant in modern society. Wales has now joined Scotland and Northern Ireland in opening their doors to the ordination of women bishops, leaving just the Church of England opposed to the idea. The issue was hotly debated at the Church of Wales’ governing body meeting in the University of St David. The vote needed a two thirds majority from three of the Church in Wales’ 'houses' - Laity, Clergy and Bishops. Laity voted 57 for and 14 against, with Clergy backing the move 37 to 10. Bishops’ vote was unanimously in favour of the plan. Archbishop of Wales, Dr Barry Morgan, said it made 'no theological sense' to continue opposing the ordination of women as bishops when the church already ordained them as deacons and priests. It is the second time in five years it had faced the issue. A previous proposal was defeated in 2008 by just three votes. The Bill was proposed by the six diocesan bishops of the Church in Wales. Canon Patrick Thomas of Christ Church, Carmarthen, said: 'I’m happy with Bishop Wyn but would be just as happy with Bishop Wynona.' Nigel King, stewardship officer for the Diocese of Swansea and Brecon, added: 'Do we really care whether the bishop has external or internal plumbing?' Canon Jenny Wigley, from Radyr, Cardiff, said the Bible itself says there should be no differences between people. 'It’s Christ-like people that the church chooses as bishops and I hope and pray that the Church in Wales gives an unqualified and unreserved yes to the Christ-like qualities of our women priests alongside our men,' she added. However, Father Ben Andrews, from Barry, said it could be difficult for some people to stay in the church if women bishops were allowed. He said: 'The bishop’s role is to hold the diocese together, and for those of us who in good conscience cannot accept the sacramental ministry of a woman bishop means we cannot be in communion with that bishop. 'We are told we have an honoured place within the church but that place is going to be difficult if not impossible for us to stay and remain. Christ-like: Cannon Jenny Wigley argued there were no differences between people in the Bible . 'There may come a time when it is impossible for me to function as a priest in the Church in Wales.' Dr Elliott King, Swansea and Brecon, said the church should not feel it has to do what secular society says. However, unlike democratic political elections, the Church in Wales takes all views into account in making its decisions. And one contentious microcosm of debate was what level of protection should be afforded to those who fiercely objected to the plans. Calls had been made for changes to the Church in Wales’ constitution for priests who did not want to be led by a woman, which would have prompted a second vote at a later date. Some argued that allowing greater room for objectors by going to a second vote later in the year could avert a division opening up in the church. However, those in favour of going to a straight yes/no vote - where any decision would come into effect within one year - said the matter needed to be resolved now. Passionate: Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby is in favour of women bishops . The decision to allow women to be ordained as bishops in the Church of England was narrowly defeated last year. The matter went before the Church of England's General Synod's governing body in November. Despite it being approved by the House of Bishops and House of Clergy, the proposition was rejected by the General Synod's House of Laity. As with the Church in Wales, each house needed a two thirds majority in favour for the vote to be approved. In the House of Laity, 74 voted against with 132 in for. Had another six members voted in favour, the motion would have been passed. Archbishop of Canterbury the Rt Reverand Justin Welby is firmly in favour of the ordination of women bishops and had been looking at dissolving the General Synod and holding fresh elections. But In July the General Synod voted in favour of looking at the matter again by 319 votes to 84. The General Synod is unlikely to vote on the matter again until 2015 at the earliest.","The Church in Wales' three houses were overwhelmingly in support .

William Goad, pictured, died last year in prison, but may not have been the only one involved in abusing thousands of young boys . Police have launched a new investigation into Britain’s worst ever paedophile after an internal report revealed that officers failed to hunt down his sick accomplices. Millionaire William Goad was caged for life in 2004 for preying on boys as young as eight over the course of 35 years. He was said to have as many as 3,500 victims. Goad died last year in prison aged 68, but some of his victims have long suspected there were others involved in his child abuse ring who escaped the net. Their claims have now been backed by a police probe which said detectives focused so narrowly on Goad that they sidelined claims he had help. The report by Devon and Cornwall Police’s Professional Standards Department (PSD) said hundreds of possible new victims have come forward after his conviction but none had even been interviewed properly. The force has responded by promising a full-scale re-investigation that sources say could be bigger than Operation Yewtree - the Jimmy Savile sex abuse investigation. Goad, who ran a chain of indoor markets and discount stores in Plymouth, Devon, used his wealth and influence to lure generations of boys into his clutches. He once boasted of abusing 142 children in a single year - and often ten boys at a time stayed in his home. He gave them cash and gifts, employed them at his shops, bought homes overlooking school playgrounds and threatened to hurt their mothers if they talked. Victims have always claimed he had links with other paedophiles and sometimes abused boys with them. A police document from 1996 warned that Goad’s abuse ring contained 'prominent members of society' - but none were ever identified. Devon and Cornwall Police launched their internal probe after a complaint was lodged last November by Paul Wyatt, who was abused by Goad in his teens and has campaigned for years to see the case reopened. The PSD referred the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission but insisted the force had correctly followed its policy at the time and did not recommend specific disciplinary action. William Goad abused thousands of boys, and now Devon and Cornwall Police will try to track down his accomplices (picture posed by model) However, investigators agreed there was a possibility other victims 'might have also been abused by other offenders and thus the lack of any police action has potentially meant these offenders have retained their liberty and continued their offending behaviour'. Mr Wyatt, who said victims who came forward were simply given a crime number and referred to support services, welcomed the new inquiry. He said: 'Of the 17 witnesses who originally were part of the trial which led to Goad’s eventual conviction, some had named other paedophiles connected to Goad who had also abused them. This information eventually led to the convictions of other paedophiles in the last few years. 'What if these other hundreds of victims, that came forward but were never allowed to make statements, were abused by others as well? 'They were just given crime reference numbers and a telephone helpline to ring. It means their offenders have been active in Plymouth for all this time without ever being brought to book.' Mr Wyatt was backed by former detective constable Shirley Thompson, who helped secure Goad’s life sentence in 2004. She said: 'The interviews and statements showed there were more victims and more offenders out there. A senior officer said to my boss ""put a lid on it and concentrate on Goad"".' Devon and Cornwall Police said it had assembled a team of specially-trained officers for a 'complex and sensitive investigation'. Detective Sergeant Mark Metherell said: 'The issues raised by Mr Wyatt were investigated by the Professional Standards Department. Their investigation concluded that police had acted lawfully and proportionately and that no misconduct issues had been identified. 'A voluntary referral, however, was made to the Independent Police Complaints Commission in respect to some of the key policy decisions that had been made during the police investigations into the criminal activities of Mr Goad. 'Following consultation with the IPCC Commissioner, Rachel Cerfontyne, Deputy Chief Constable David Zinzan has asked for the Devon and Cornwall Criminal Case Review Team to draw up a terms of reference for a new police investigation which will seek to address the conclusions highlighted within the Professional Standards Department investigation.'","William Goad was jailed for life after four decades of abusing boys .

A British bomb-maker who was on the run with the world's most wanted woman - dubbed the 'White Widow' - has been executed in a gun battle in Somalia alongside an American fellow terrorist. Habib Ghani had been in hiding with the widow of a London 7/7 bomber, Samantha Lewthwaite, 29, in a remote part of the war-torn country when his killers struck, according to reports. The 28-year-old and Omar Hammami, 29, from Alabama - known for jihadi rap videos he posted to YouTube - are thought to have fallen out with commanders from militant group al-Shabab, provoking a bloody revenge. Killed: Hammami, right, joined al-Shabab in 2006. He is pictured with deputy leader of al-Shabab. Sheik Mukhtar Abu Mansur Robow, left, in 2011 but he went on the run after falling out with the group . Killed: Habib Ghani (left) is believed to have been shot dead in Somalia. He has been on the run with Samantha Lewthwaite (right) since 2011 . Ghani, from Hounslow, west London, and . Hammami, also called al-Amriki (The American), are thought to have been together when their former comrades from al-Shabab cornered them. The gunmen overpowered their bodyguards in a . village where they had been in hiding since fleeing the terror group in . June. Ghani, who also called himself Osama . al-Britani, was a key ally of Muslim convert Lewthwaite, who was married . to King’s Cross bomber Jermaine Lindsay. The so-called ‘White Widow’, who is the world’s most wanted woman, has been on the run in East Africa after police foiled a Christmas bomb plot against Western tourists in the coastal resort of Mombasa in 2011. Police believe the soldier’s daughter from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, had been working with Ghani for several years, although she was not thought to have been present when gunmen struck early yesterday.

In April, he tweeted . this pictured, right, following what he called an assassination attempt . as he was in a tea shop . Popular: Hammami was voted president of his Sophomore class and dated one of the most popular girls in school . Residents in al-Baate village in southern Somalia said their bodies were dragged away by rebels. ‘This morning al-Amriki and his comrades were attacked by well-armed fighters,’ said Hussein Nur. Convert: Soldier's daughter Samantha Lewthwaite pictured at school . ‘After a brief fight, al-Amriki and his two colleagues were killed. Several of their guards escaped.’ The al-Shabab gunmen struck at 5.30am, just after morning prayers, capturing the jihadists unawares. Sources said the gunmen had lain in wait for several days, posing as camel herders. Ghani and Hammami were allies of Somali Islamist Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys, who split from al-Shabab in June, causing a rift in the group’s ranks. Since the split, al-Shabab has been hunting down and killing allies of Aweys. Al-Amriki - the son of a Christian mother and a Syrian-born Muslim father - was on the FBI’s Most . Wanted terror list and a $5million (£3.1million) bounty was offered for . information leading to his capture. He had been active on Twitter but his last post was on September 5 in which he said: 'I'm still a terrorist.' A . more prophetic Tweet came in April in which he said: 'May not find . another chance to tweet but just remember what we said and what we stood . for. God kept me alive to deliver the mssg 2 the umah'. Reports of Hammami's death crop up every few months in Somalia, only for him to resurface alive and well a short while later. But . a U.S. terrorism expert who closely follows the inner workings of . Somalia's al-Qaida-linked terror group says he thinks that the current . reports of the death are accurate. 'I think it's very likely true based on the sources I am seeing,' said J.M. Berger, who runs the website Intelwire.com. Ghani . was born in the UK to a Pakistani father and a Kenyan mother. According . to police sources, he left his home in Hounslow several years ago and . gained bomb-making experience in Pakistan. Last night details emerged about Ghani’s secret life in Somalia where he was also known locally as Sheikh Towfiq. Target: One of Americas most wanted terrorists, Omar Hammami (left), was killed alongside Ghani.

This FBI listing shows their description of Hammami . The bearded Briton was living with his Somalian wife Habibo and two children, a boy aged three and a baby girl just a few months old, in the remote town of Hawalbarbar which has no electricity. He owned a small kiosk, where he charged phone batteries with his solar-powered adapter for a fee. Ghani and Lewthwaite were said to have fled Kenya in December 2011 as police swooped on a third and unconnected British extremist, Jermaine Grant, who was living on the other side of Mombasa. Police feared she and Ghani were planning to unleash a terror attack as the tourist season got under way but she managed to slip the net. Lewthwaite is believed to be a vital conduit between Al Qaeda groups in Pakistan and East Africa.

She was seven months pregnant when Lindsay, a Jamaican convert from Huddersfield, killed 26 people when he blew himself up on a Piccadilly Line train in July 2005. Since her disappearance, Lewthwaite has been linked to a spate of grenade attacks in Mombasa, including one which killed three people. Ghani’s family, who live in a modest £270,000 terraced house in a quiet suburban street, refused to speak to reporters last night. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We are aware of reports of the death of a British national in Somalia and are looking into this.’ Samantha Lewthwaite, 29, from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, has been on the run for nearly two years.

Sainsbury's supermarket has recalled all of its own-brand watercress after it was linked to an E.coli outbreak that has made 15 people ill. The Food Standards Agency issued an alert last night after six people affected by the outbreak were hospitalised. It is thought their illness is linked to watercress products bought in Sainsbury’s over the past six weeks. Danger: Sainsbury's baby leaf watercress, spinach & rocket salad is one of the products recalled by the retailer after its watercress products were linked to an E.coli outbreak that has left 15 people ill, with six in hospital . The supermarket has recalled six different products containing the watercress as a ‘precautionary measure’ following the possible link to the outbreak of E.coli O157. A Sainsbury’s spokesman said their tests had not found any traces of E.coli in any products, and that no other Sainsbury’s supermarket products are known to be affected. The FSA says on its website: ‘[Sainsbury’s] is advising people not to consume any of these products and to return them to the store they were purchased from for a full refund. ‘Investigations by the Food Standards Agency, Public Health England and local authorities are continuing and further information will be provided once it becomes available. ‘Sainsbury’s has informed the FSA that it is carrying out testing on all of its affected lines, but that no trace of E.coli O157 has been detected to date.’ Escherichia coli (E coli) is a bacteria which causes food poisoning, including symptoms such as diarrhoea and stomach cramps. It is usually contracted by eating contaminated food but can also be passed from person to person by poor hand washing. The FSA, Public Health England and . local authorities are investigating the matter and the FSA confirmed no . other supermarkets had recalled products. Escherichia coli: The bug, which can lead to . symptoms such as diarrhoea and stomach cramps, is usually contracted . by eating contaminated food but can also be passed from person to person . by poor hand hygiene . A . spokesman for Sainsbury’s said: ‘The Food Standards Agency has made us . aware that a small number of people have fallen ill with a bacterial . infection, and that one of their lines of investigation is watercress . bought at Sainsbury’s since August 1. ‘Customer safety and the quality of our food are our overriding concern, and so although no traces of contamination has been found in our products we have as a precautionary measure withdrawn six lines of pre-packed salad containing watercress from the supplier concerned. ‘We are urgently testing all similar products and have to date found no indication of contamination. We will of course keep customers fully updated. ‘Customers who have bought any of these products from Sainsbury’s since August 1 should not consume them. They can be returned to store for a full refund. We apologise for the inconvenience this may cause.’ Last year seven people were infected with E.Coli after visiting Sutton Park in Sutton Coldfield, in the West Midlands. And in 2011 a deadly mutant strain of the bacteria was identified, which was capable of spreading from person to person and had been found in 12 countries. Hundreds were left seriously ill by the outbreak and at least 18 died.","Six people hospitalised by illness thought to be linked to retailer's salads .

UN weapons inspectors will put Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in the frame for the gas attack that killed 1,400 civilians, but will only be able to provide circumstantial evidence, insiders have said. A senior Western official said the team had collected a 'wealth' of evidence that nerve agents had been used last month's atrocity in Damascus. A highly anticipated report on the findings, expected to be presented to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon on Monday, will not directly accuse Assad, according to three U.N.-based diplomats familiar with the investigation. But it will present a strong circumstantial case that the regime was responsible based on analysis of rocket shells, ammunition and tests on soil, blood and urine from the al Ghouta suburb of the capital. Pointing blame at Assad: U.N. chemical weapons inspectors collect samples in Damascus which insiders say will provide strong circumstantial evidence the regime was to blame for the attack that killed 1,400 last month . Preparing a case: A senior Western official said the team had collected a 'wealth' of evidence that nerve agents had been used last month's atrocity in Damascus . The Western official, who has knowledge of the investigation, told Foreign Policy Magazine: 'I know they have gotten very rich samples - biomedical and environmental - and they have interviewed victims, doctors and nurses. 'It seems they are very happy with the wealth of evidence they got. You can conclude from the type of evidence the [identity of the] author.' The official, who declined to be named, did not reveal the specific agents found by the team. Both Syria and their Russian allies have previously claimed that the rebels were responsible for the attacks and that they have evidence to prove it. It is believed the report could easily become a bargaining chip in talks between Moscow and Western powers on conditions for Syria to give up its chemical weapons and the terms of a United Nations Security Council resolution on the matter. Atrocity: A Syrian man mourns over a dead body after an alleged poisonous gas attack fired by regime forces that killed 1,400 in Damascus last month . Allies: President Assad and Russian president Vladimir Putin have previously claimed the rebels carried out the gas attack and say they have evidence to prove it . Two Western diplomats said they strongly expected chief U.N. investigator Ake Sellstrom's report would confirm the U.S. view that sarin gas was used in the attack on suburbs of Damascus that killed hundreds. 'We expect it (the report) will have a narrative of evidence,' said one U.N. official. Russian President Vladimir Putin, in an opinion piece in the New York Times, confirmed Moscow's view that there was 'every reason to believe' the poison gas was used by rebels. The United Nations has repeatedly declined to comment on the expected contents of the report. Syria's U.N. Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari did not respond immediately to a request for comment. The news comes as it emerged that vital weapons shipments from the United States have begun to arrive in rebel fighting units that oppose President Assad, according to sources on both ends of the transactions. The light arms, ammunition and other small, trackable armaments – likely grenades, mortars and shells – are coming via clandestine CIA operations in a significant escalation of U.S. involvement in the 30-month-long civil war. The White House promised in June that it would arm anti-Assad forces who were not aligned with Islamist radical groups, authorizing the CIA to do the heavy lifting and manage the pipeline. But the long-awaited weapons delivery comes at an awkward moment, a day after President Obama pledged to pursue diplomacy instead of military action.","Inspectors have collected 'wealth' of evidence that nerve agents were used .

Stores such as Currys, PC World and Tesco are misleading customers into spending hundreds of millions of pounds a year on unnecessary warranties for household goods, it is claimed. Official figures suggest consumers are paying £300million a year too much for warranties, which can cost as much as £160 for three years of cover on a £350 washing machine. Now research by consumer champion Which? has found staff are basing sales of extended warranties on misleading claims about what is covered and are using hard-sell tactics to seal the deals. It has been claimed that stores including Currys and PC World are spending hundreds of millions of pounds a year on unnecessary warranties for household goods . And Which? questioned whether shoppers need the warranties at all, given that there is already alternative protection which is cheaper or free. For example, many manufacturers offer one to two years’ cover as part of the purchase price. Which? carried out a mystery shopping exercise at leading electrical stores Currys/PC World, Tesco, John Lewis, Richer Sounds and Euronics. Researchers made 12 visits to each retailer and asked about buying a TV or washing machine. Staff were then rated pass, unhelpful or fail based on whether they provided useful and accurate information about the warranties. Currys and PC World, which are part of Dixons, were rated worst. Eleven shops offered warranties, but six were rated as a fail and four as unhelpful. Which? said: ‘A third of our mystery shoppers felt that they were being pushed to take a ‘Whatever Happens’ care plan. Staff made exaggerated claims aimed at getting a sale. Staff at four out of 12 Tesco shops offered a warranty. The information given was unhelpful in two cases with one involving hard-sell tactics . ‘We were told that Whatever Happens “covers everything”, but it doesn’t cover weather and water damage, and problems due to “neglect and misuse”.’ Which? said: ‘On another visit, an employee claimed the Sale of Goods Act doesn’t apply to retailers, which of course it does. ‘We were also told, twice, that repairs under the manufacturer’s guarantee often take up to six weeks, a claim contradicted by the manufacturers we spoke to.’ Staff at Richer Sounds offered a warranty on eight out of 12 visits. One of these was scored a fail and four were unhelpful. Staff at four out of 12 Tesco shops offered a warranty. The information given was unhelpful in two cases with one involving hard-sell tactics. John Lewis scored best. Eight staff offered warranties with only one fail and one considered unhelpful . Only one Euronics store out of 12 pushed a warranty, however the shop worker erroneously insisted that it could not be cancelled. John Lewis scored best. Eight staff offered warranties with only one fail and one considered unhelpful. Staff wrongly claimed the policy was a binding contract and could not be cancelled. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘Some high street retailers are making inaccurate and exaggerated claims about extended warranties to get people to purchase cover they may not need. ‘Retailers should make sure their staff provide accurate information so consumers can decide whether to buy an extended warranty.’ Which? wants the sale of the warranties to be regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, which would have the power to fine companies for mis-selling. A spokesman for Dixons said: ‘Our store training is refreshed regularly and includes compulsory training on the legal obligations associated with support agreements. ‘We also conduct independent mystery shops to consistently check legal compliance in terms of selling support agreements and displaying relevant literature in store.’ Richer Sounds said: ‘We certainly accept that a percentage of our sales staff did not communicate as clearly as they might have done.’ Tesco promised to improve its staff training.","Which? carried out a mystery shopping exercise at leading electrical stores .

The forensic remains found in Mark Bridger's fireplace will be returned to heartbroken Paul and Coral Jones almost a year after they were found by detectives. They will place the remains in a pink coffin and take them through the town of Machynleth, Powys, on a horse drawn carriage. Mrs Jones told The Sun: 'They are all we have. We can now finally lay April to rest. Our hell this past year has been made worse because we did not have April's body.' Mourners will be asked to wear pink which was April's favourite colour and became the symbol of the massive seven-month long search for her. The funeral has been arranged to give Mr and Mrs Jones, both 41, some closure after the devastating murder of their five-year-old daughter. It will be held later this month almost exactly a year after April was snatched off the street by abattoir worker Bridger, 47, on October 1 last year. A family friend said: 'It will be a very sad day for Coral and Paul but it is something they want to do, .

Grief: Coral and Paul Jones will finally be able to hold a funeral for their daughter . The funeral service is expected to be held at St Peters Church in Machynlleth and hundreds of people are expected to turn up to say their farewells to a little girl they never even knew.

At the weekend Miss Creasy was sent a horrifying image of a masked man wielding a knife on Twitter by an internet troll, who warned her: 'I'm gonna be the first thing you see when you wake up'. The Twitter user who sent the image, under the handle @Murkztah, was suspended from the site and reported to police. Ms Criado-Perez received rape threats over Twitter after she campaigned for a woman to be featured on British bank notes. Miss Creasy was targeted by abusers who . threatened to attack her and called her a 'dumb blonde bitch' after she . came out in support of the journalist. A number of female journalists later came forward to report a series of rape and bomb threats. They were allegedly sent to Guardian columnist Hadley Freeman, Independent writer Grace Dent and Europe editor of Time magazine Catherine Mayer. Similar messages were also sent to Sara Lang, a social media manager at U.S. campaign group AARP.

Days gone by: Stanley Fox, circled, says he and his fellow soldiers were once proud to be soldiers but the country today is no longer 'what we fought for' He has sent his collection of 23 medals to a children’s hospice along with medals earned by his brother and his father, who fought in Boer Wars and the First World War. He said: 'No one seems to care these days, older people are just treated like a bit of rubbish. 'The country is not as we all hoped. It is not what we fought for. We were proud to fight for the country and I was proud to wear the medals. 'Now I just hope they can go to help the children and the future and make it better.' Stanley, from Bideford, Devon, joined up at 14 and remained fiercely loyal to his country despite enduring two years in a PoW camp in Africa. Mr Fox's collection of honours spans more than 100 years and includes the the Military Cross, the General Service Medal, the Long Service Good Conduct medal and the British War medal .

Shaftesbury Town Council has been told it faces criminal prosecution after it put up the 6ft monument to commemorate those who have died fighting for their country since 1945 without planning permission from English Heritage. The memorial to the soldiers of the Dorset and Devon regiments is in the shadow of Shaftesbury Abbey. The war memorial, pictured, was built without permission 15ft away from the wall of Shaftesbury Abbey (right) But although the council owns the land surrounding it, the ruin itself is recognised by law as a ‘scheduled’ – or listed – monument. The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 rules it is a criminal offence to carry out works to listed monuments – such as erecting the memorial – without consent from the Secretary of State. The council defended the move, claiming it did not realise the Abbey had specially protected status. English Heritage has now demanded the memorial be moved – and it refused to rule out prosecution should a solution not be found. The quango said it was a ‘criminal offence’ to build the monument so close to the historic 9th-century abbey. The council may have to move the war memorial after English heritage pointed out their mistake . The council could be fined up to £5,000. The 1979 Act does not allow for retrospective planning consent to be given. The memorial was built of expensive white Portland stone, and £20,000 of its cost was covered by public donations. The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 makes it a crime to carry out works to listed monuments without consent from the Secretary of State. Anyone convicted under the act can face fines of up to £5,000. English Heritage has demanded the 8ft monument be moved to a different location, and has refused to rule out prosecution. The £30,000 monument was erected 15ft away from historic Shaftesbury Abbey . An English Heritage spokesman said: ‘Under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979, it is a criminal offence to carry out works to a Scheduled Monument without Scheduled Monument Consent from the Secretary of State. 'English Heritage is taking this matter seriously but our focus is on achieving a negotiated solution. 'There is no facility under the 1979 Act for the Secretary of State to issue retrospective Scheduled Monument Consent and so the matter of unauthorised works and criminal offence stands until the situation is satisfactorily resolved. 'Wherever possible, a negotiated solution is preferable and this is what we are currently pursuing with the Town Council. Although Shaftesbury Town Council owns the land the memorial was built on, its proximity to a protected building means it needed special permission . ‘I am sure this was put up with the best of intentions, and we have had constructive discussions with Shaftesbury Town Council about resolving the issue of unauthorised works involving the erection of a stone memorial at a Scheduled Monument known as Shaftesbury Abbey. ‘The Town Council is looking at options for moving the memorial in consultation with interested parties.’ Simon Pritchard, the Mayor of Shaftesbury, said: ‘The Town Council is currently in constructive discussions with English Heritage to resolve the issue of the new memorial recently erected on Park Walk within the Scheduled Monument of Shaftesbury Abbey. ‘Due to an oversight this was carried out without having obtained Scheduled Monument Consent. The memorial is just 4ft away from a wall surrounding Shaftesbury Abbey, which is now mostly a ruin. A statue of King Alfred has been erected there, and the tower of another church can be seen in the background . 'We are confident that a negotiated solution can be reached with English Heritage and the Town Council is looking at options, working together with English Heritage, the Royal British Legion, North Dorset District Council and the Civic Society to find the right location for the memorial.’ Shaftesbury Abbey was founded by Alfred the Great in 888 AD and his daughter Aethelgiva was the first abbess there. The only part of the abbey that remains today is the excavated ruins of the abbey church within a walled garden, home to the Shaftesbury Abbey Museum. Under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979, carrying out works on protected buildings is a crime if permission is not sought. The legislation is designed to protect sites deemed to be of 'national importance' from unnecessary development. There are no fixed rules stating what distance away from a protected building works can be freely carried out, but in this case the small distance between the memorial and the wall of the abbey would appear to mean the land was covered by the act. More than 20,000 buildings are on the ‘schedule’ in England alone including Ironbridge in Shropshire, the missile shelter at RAF Greenham Common and Cadbury Castle in Somerset. In order to carry out works on any scheduled monument, permission must be granted by a Secretary of State, and people who break the rules face fines of up to £5,000. In 2006 a man was fined £1,230 for dumping waste on a protected hill fort in Tunley, Somerset, which was also a breach of the Environmental Protection Act.","Shaftesbury Town Council has built the war memorial just 15ft from the historic Shaftesbury Abbey .

An act of selfless bravery: Danny Lewin was the first person to be killed on 9/11 after trying to stop terrorists from hijacking the plane he was on . The remarkable story of the first victim of the 9/11 attacks and his doomed attempt to stop Al Qaeda terrorists who had hijacked a plane destined for the Twin Towers has been told for the first time. Internet entrepreneur Danny Lewin, 31, was travelling on American Airlines Flight 11 when it was hijacked just 16 minutes into a journey from Boston to Los Angeles as it passed over Worcester, Massachusetts. The hijackers then turned the plane north instead of south - heading towards New York airspace. A veteran of an elite unit in the Israeli Defence Force who understood Arabic, Lewin appears to have immediately understood what was happening and challenged the terrorists, who were armed with box-cutters and knives. It was an act of extraordinary . courage which was to cost him his life. As the former commando fought . with Satam al-Suqami, one of the five who had taken the plane, he was . fatally stabbed. Half an hour later, at 8.46am, the Boeing 767 became the first plane to crash into the Twin Towers. All 81 passengers, nine crew members and the two pilots died. The story of Lewin's unimaginable bravery has only just been made public in a new biography No Better Time: The Brief, Remarkable Life of Danny . Lewin, the Genius Who Transformed the Interne. Author Molly Knight said she wanted to write about Lewin's life because she felt it deserved to be celebrated. She told CNN: 'It was about the way he lived. I felt like if he was motivating me as much, I felt like I could do the same for readers.' The . writer was able to piece together his last moments from the desperate . accounts of two flight attendants who had been in contact with the . ground as the tragedy unfolded.

They . told authorities that a passenger seated in 9B - now believed to be . Lewin - had been killed as he tackled one of the terrorists. Early reports by . the 9/11 Commission claimed that Lewin had been shot but after . extensive interviews with officials on the ground who had spoken to the . attendants, it was concluded that al-Suqami had slit his victim's . throat. Lewin's best friend Marco Greenberg told Slate: 'He was the first victim of the first war of the 21st century.' There were to be many more. Seventeen minutes after Flight 11 crashed, United Airlines Flight . 175 hit the South Tower of the World Trade Centre at 9.03am.

As . news of terrorist attacks spread around the world, it was Lewin's own technology which allowed the internet to keep up with . the increased amount of traffic. The Israeli-American . co-founded Akamai Technologies which is responsible for more than . 30 per cent of the world’s internet traffic. His . company's October 1999 share market float made Lewin an overnight . billionaire and he became one of the world's richest high-tech . entrepreneurs before he was even 30-years-old. The multibillion dollar company's clients today still include Sony, Apple and News Corp. But before . his business success, Lewin, who was brought up in Denver, Colorado, before . moving to Israel with his family when he was 14, served with one of the . country’s most elite counter-terrorism unit, Sayeret Mat’kal.

The fourth plane crashed in Pennsylvania . After reaching the rank of captain, he decided to return to graduate school to study maths and computer science. He studied at the Israeli Institute . of Technology before going on to Massachusetts Institute of Technology . (MIT) on a full scholarship where he came up with a ground-breaking idea to allow the internet to work more efficiently and at faster speeds. The . set of algorithms he created and called 'consistent hashing' formed the . basis of his company Akamai which he set up with MIT professor Tom . Leighton in 1998. Describing Lewin, Leighton told CNN: . 'He was really exceptionally smart. MIT has a lot of really smart . people, and Danny stood out even among that rarified environment. In memory: A plaque for Danny Lewin on the fence of a park named in his memory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he studied at MIT . Gone but not forgotten: After Lewin's death, the intersection of Main and Vassar Streets in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was renamed Danny Lewin Square in his honor . Success story: Danny Lewin created a set of ground-breaking algorithms which make the internet work more efficiently and formed the basis of his company Akamai which he co-founded with MIT professor Tom Leighton in 1998 . 'He liked working on the hardest problems, as opposed to the easier ones, because they would make more of a difference.' He added he was intrigued by Lewin's idea because it would make a real beneficial impact on the world. He said: 'In the area where we worked, in algorithms and the theoretical side of . computer science, often that work is good, deep work, but it doesn't . change the world. It doesn't impact people directly. 'With this work, we thought it would have relevance . in the real world, and make the Internet be faster, more reliable, more . secure. It was a chance that was pretty rare for us.'
