"A multi-coloured footbridge has been built over a canal bed - and it's made out of giant-sized pieces of Meccano. The six-ton steel bridge in the Little Lever area of Bolton cost £90,000 to construct, using 400 pieces of oversized Meccano and 700 nuts and bolts. It is hoped that the project will kickstart a regeneration of the historic stretch of the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal at Nob End. Scroll down for video . Old-fashioned fun: The completed bridge now stands 1.3 metres high and spans 6.4m across the canal in Little Lever to Moses Gate Country Park . Colourful story: Artist Liam Curtin said he wanted to reflect Bolton's engineering heritage . Splash of colour: The bridge is 1.3 metres high and 6.4m across. The council praised its distinctiveness . Toy town: Designer Liam Curtin with one of the 400 pieces of giant Meccano used to build the bridge over the disused canal . The bridge built at the spot in 1796 was a wooden construction used by horses, but it collapsed around 50 years ago. Earlier this year, a developer gave Bolton Council money for the building project, an agreement that was part of . its planning application to build houses in Little Lever. The council commissioned public artist Liam Curtin, from Fallowfield, to work on a public installation. 'We tried out a few smaller projects in the area, such as floating structures like a boat made of CDs, created by local people,' he told MailOnline. 'We then turned towards canal and had a different site, but the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal Society talked me into looking at the site where the bridge now is. Nuts and bolts: The fact that the pieces could be assembled on site meant lots of people could be involved . 'Distinctive': The nuts, bolts and component parts were made in two Bolton factories . Play time! A local steel fabricator made the beams, nuts and bolts in the same style as a toy set - but 10 times thicker and 1,000 times heavier . 'They thought having it there would allow them to develop the rest of the canal, and have a footpath going into Moses Gate Country Park. 'Paul Hindle, leader of the society, took me on a tour of a vandalised bridge and a new, very robust but slightly ugly bridge nearby. It made me want to make the design stronger, and yet reflect Bolton's heritage as town of engineering . Meccano is a model construction system comprising re-usable metal strips, plates, angle girders, wheels, axles and gears, with nuts and bolts to connect the pieces. It was invented in 1901 in Liverpool by Frank Hornby and manufactured by the British company, Meccano Ltd, between 1908 and 1980. It was an educational toy for children, teaching basic mechanical principles like levers and gearing. It is now manufactured in France and China. 'Meccano is, in a sense, scaled down engineering and all we were doing was scaling it up. 'It's intriguing because of the Meccano element, and it was funny going back to it - we even modelled it with Meccano. 'We also had something we could assemble on site, meaning lots of people could be involved. 'A Meccano society came to visit it and they were impressed with its authenticity.' The completed bridge now stands 1.3 metres high and spans 6.4m across the canal in Little Lever to Moses Gate Country Park. Here, the canal branches into three, at a famous site important to the history of canal building, dating back to the 1790s. Local steel fabricators made the beams, nuts and bolts in the same style as a toy set — but ten times thicker and 1,000 times heavier. Each piece cost around £55 to produce and each bolt around £18. The bridge uses traditional 1950s Meccano colours, and local people volunteered to help with the building. Mr Curtin added: 'Building a bridge from giant Meccano is the fulfilment of a childhood dream. I spent my entire childhood building mechanical devices from Meccano. 'It wasn’t until I actually saw the finished pieces arriving from the factory that I realised we had created something quite wonderful. 'As members of the canal society unpacked the lorry, they appeared like Lilliputian figures in a magical toy world. 'I am so grateful to everyone involved. The engineers at Bolton Council have been creative and inventive and given us something which is structurally sound without compromising the artwork. The local residents and canal society members have been working tirelessly.' Public land: The project is being funded through an agreement with a developer as part of a planning application . Bright idea: The scaled-up building pieces make people 'look like Lilliputian figures in a magical toy world', according to the artist . The council’s cabinet member for environment, Councillor Nick Peel, hailed it as a ‘distinctive landmark’. He said: 'Being from the local area myself I know that the bridge will really benefit local people and I hope they make good use of it.' It was originally described as having an 'exaggerated toy-like detail'. Marie McNulty, Bolton at Home’s east neighbourhood manager, said: 'Local residents have been overwhelmingly supportive of this idea, which we believe would make a positive difference to the area as both a functional and decorative feature.' The canal society is also carrying out . improvements around the Nob End section of the canal and is planning to . create a picnic area. Society members hope it will form part of their long-term aspirations to create a visitor centre and re-open the waterway. They plan to remove the in-fill at the nearest road bridge and put in a dam so that water can flow down the stretch of canal again and under the Meccano bridge.

"You're sat on your lunch break scrolling through your latest dating app  when who should pop up but your boss. Awkward? It's a situation of nightmares. But never fear. New dating app The League, which is currently going through a soft launch, could put an end to potential inter-office dating dramas. The new app which has been started by former Google employee Amanda Bradford allows you to enter your LinkedIn information, blocking out those who you work with. Meaning you never have to fear that you'll stumble across your colleagues again. Scroll down for video . The League is a new type of dating app which allows users to filter out the people they work with to avoid office embarrassment . Dating apps like Singled Out are downloaded to your smart phone (posed by a model) Amanda decided to start the app after becoming single last year. After trying out Tinder she realised that she didn't want everyone to be able to see that she was online dating. 'I found myself single and I figured it must be this really cool thing if everyone was using it. [But] I got a little bit uncomfortable that everybody and their mother could see you on the app,' she said. Amanda also felt that Tinder - where users can swipe left for people they don't fancy and right for those they do, based on a series of pictures - was a little shallow. '[With Tinder] you’re swiping based on whether you think someone is good looking or not. In my relationships, I’m attracted to things like ambition, and what people do in their free time. Whereas Tinder is basically a glorified hot-or-not.' The League - which has initially launched in San Francisco - promise to allow you to, 'Keep It Classy.' They say, 'We hide your profile from friends, business contacts & coworkers – the whole office doesn't have to know you're on the prowl.' Currently if you want to join the app then you need to be referred by a friend. You will then be vetted on the basis of your education and your career before you are allowed to start using The League. And Amanda is hoping that after the soft launch the App will be rolled out to many more cities. Amanda said, 'We don’t want to be Ivy League and we don’t want to be just CEOs. But, I guess if you have to choose between superficial and elitist, I choose elitist. 'Any app that shows what people are and how they spend most of their day is less superficial than a game of hot or not.' Can new dating app Singled Out help you weed out the type of men who send unsolicited sexual photographs? Sick of facing a barrage of requests for sexually explicit pictures from dating app users? Tired of being sent their photographs without even having asked? Then Singled Out App might be for you. The new app, which is being sold as 'The first female friendly dating experience,' aims to weed out all those unsolicited messages putting the full control in the hands of it's female users. Scroll down for video . An example of how Singled Out works. A woman posts a picture of herself and asks a question, men are then invited to answer her . Singled Out, which was started in the US, works by allowing women to pose one of 200 questions to men on the app.They can then choose which people they want to interact with based on their answers. The questions can be anything from, 'Do you sing in the shower?' to, 'Would you date outside your race?' and 'Is Cory/Topanga a better couple than Ross/Rachel?' Singled Out's marketing guru Jocelyn Harwood explains, 'Some of the questions seem random but what is really happening is the male user taking the time and effort to figure out the female.' When the men have answered the question users are shown a list of those who agree with them so they can carry on a conversation if they wish . And unlike other apps there is literally no option for men to speak to women until they have answered the proposed question. The singled out team created the app after consulting 300 female students, most of whom suggested that their hesitation to use dating apps came from the fact that they were worried about receiving unsolicited sexual pictures and messages. The app aims to allow users to get to know each other a little bit better - through the questions - before they embark on a more serious conversation. The hope also that if men are encouraged to engage with the woman before the actual conversation starts they are more likely to have an interest in her and therefore are more likely to meet up and be interested in a proper relationship. This is in stark contrast to popular apps like Tinder or Happn where often the only thing the user has to go on is a picture. Singled Out is the third female friendly dating app to have been released in recent months. There are also Mesh, which filters messages by picking up on those that use swear or crude, sexual words. And Siren, which keeps your picture private until you feel comfortable to release it to your match.","The League is currently going through a soft launch .

"A three-year-old girl who went missing while out playing in Russia has been rescued by a curious Game of Thrones fan. The TV series makes uses crows and ravens as a signal that an important event is about to take place. So when fan Cairo Nurmagambetov saw birds circling over a field in the southern city of Omsk, he knew he had to investigate. Scroll down for video . Safe: Alexandra Spirinka had been missing for two days when Game of Thrones fan Cairo Nurmagambetov, 47, found her. She vanished while playing outside her home in the Russian city of Omsk . The flock of birds led him to Alexandra Spirkina, who went missing two days earlier. Despite the fact that 400 police officers, including 15 dog handlers, and 200 volunteers participated in the hunt none of them got close to finding her. A police officer said: 'We had state of the art thermal imaging equipment but it was the crows that won the day. 'The person that found her said that . in the show Game Of Thrones there was always something significant . happening when the crows gathered. Thank goodness he decided to check it . out.' The girl had vanished . on May Day after playing outside her home in the early evening. Her . father, Emelyan, 35, was outside tinkering with his car and called the . police when he could not see her. Cairo . Nurmagambetov, 47, said: 'I knew that the crows meant there was . something happening. I drove towards them and when I got there I saw the . girl who was walking across the field. 'She was crying and calling for . her dad. Curiosity: The fan of the show went to investigate after seeing a group of crows circling above a field . Care: After she was safely located, the toddler was bundled into a car and taken for treatment . Investigation: The youngster, who is out of sight being cradled by her mother, is said to be in a stable condition and has not yet been interviewed about her disappearance . 'I gave her some crisps and a drink, and put my jacket round her to warm her up before taking her back to the other rescuers.' She is in a stable condition but has not yet been interviewed about her disappearance. During the show, crows and ravens appear when something signifcant is about to happen. A three-eyed bird also appears in Bran Stark's dream. Hero: Cairo Nurmagambetov said he felt he had to investigate in the knowledge that crows and ravens in Game of Thrones mean something important is about to take place . Curiosity: Police thanked the 47-year-old (pictured in the car) for investigating the circling birds, as a huge search party struggled to find the missing girl . In the first series, it presents itself as Bran is about to fire an arrow and causes him to stop. The raven then lands on the head of a direwolf statue and cries once, before flying towards the Stark family crypt.

"When Frank Swain began losing his hearing at 20, he decided he would use his new reliance on technology to hear something others couldn't: the sound of Wi-Fi. The London-based writer teamed up with sound designer Daniel Jones to build a tool that translates Wi-Fi networks into sounds that could be picked up through his hearing aids. Now, Mr Swain has created a map and audio file that reveal what the internet sounds like, during his walk around BBC Broadcasting House in central London. Scroll down for audio . The sound of each network is heard originating from the router's geographical location, producing clicks whose frequency rises with the signal strength — akin to a layered series of Geiger counters. Pictured is how the internet sounds at the BBC in London, close to Oxford Circus . In a feature for the New Scientist, Mr Swain describes the sounds he hears from public internet data using his new hacked hearing aid. 'As I approach Turnpike Lane tube station and descend to the underground platform, I catch the now familiar gurgle of the public Wi-Fi hub, as well as the staff network beside it,' he writes. 'On board the train, these sounds fade into silence as we burrow into the tunnels leading to central London.' 'You expect it to be really strange, but it very quickly becomes ordinary,' Frank Swain (pictured) said . The project, dubbed Phantom Terrains, works by translating the language of a wireless network into sounds. Each Wi-Fi element – such as router names, data rates and encryption modes - are assigned their own tones, which are sent to a phone and picked up using his hearing aids. The foreground and background layer of sound are built up through the strength of the signal, direction, name and security level on these networks. For instance, distant signals sound like click and pops, while stronger networks play a looped song. 'You expect it to be really strange, but it very quickly becomes ordinary,' Mr Swain told MailOnline. 'It was a big blow to find I was losing my hearing, so it was nice to have my expectations turned around, to think instead of it being a disability it could be an enhancement.' An American artist has created stunning colourful representations showing what Wi-Fi waves, peaks and pulses would look like if we could see them. Nickolay Lamm worked with former Nasa astrobiologist M. Browning Vogel to learn how the networks move and based the designs on coverage data taken from around the U.S Congress and The National Mall in Washington. The images show the shape of the Wi-Fi signal's and different colours were used to distinguish the different sub channels. As well as looking great, the illustrations were also designed to teach people about how Wi-Fi signals work. Mr Lamm, from website MyDeals.com, said: 'Although we use it often, we rarely think about how it works. 'A lot of us take technology for granted and use it without appreciating the science that makes it work.' The project was a follow-up to Lamm's Wi-fi visualisations released last year which depicted the shape of the Wi-Fi signals. The Wi-Fi pulses are shown here as spheres. Lamm used red, orange, yellow and other colours to represent these invisible channels that make up the overall Wi-Fi signal . Mr Swain said that despite wireless communication becoming a ubiquitous presence in modern life, the underlying infrastructure has remained largely invisible. 'If you have ever wandered in circles to find a signal for your cell phone, you will know what I mean,' he said. Phantom Terrains, he said, opens the door to this world to a small degree by tuning into these fields. 'If I have to spend my life listening to an interpretative version of the world, what elements could I add?,' Mr Swain asked. 'The data that surrounds me seems a good place to start.' Wi-Fi routers on buildings and lamp posts create a circular omnidirectional data fields around them, pictured. Wi-Fi broadcasts at a frequency between radio and microwaves, meaning that the waves or pulses are about six inches apart, as shown by these coloured bands in front of Congress .","Frank Swain, a journalist in London, began losing his hearing at 20 .

"Rant: Morrissey wrote on a fan site that he was 'unable' to watch the London Olympics . Former frontman of The Smiths Morrissey has slammed Great Britain fans for their support of the country's athletes in the London Olympics, asking: 'Has England ever been so foul with patriotism?' The rock star, who has come out with controversial remarks in the past, has said that he can not even bring himself to watch the Olympics, slating the presence of the Royal Family and David and Victoria Beckham in the process. He even likened fans of the country's growing support of their athletes to a mindset held by the populace Nazi Germany in the late 1930s, and told Brits to 'WAKE UP'. The 53-year-old singer will not have been celebrating, or even watching, on Saturday when Team GB brought home a remarkable eight gold medals - their best haul in a day since the 1908 London Games. Morrissey, who fronted one of Britain's most influential bands, published a statement on the True to You fan site: 'I am unable to watch the Olympics due to the blustering jingoism that drenches the event. Has England ever been quite so foul with patriotism? 'The ""dazzling royals"" have, quite naturally, hi-jacked the Olympics for their own empirical needs, and no oppositional voice is allowed in the free press. 'It is lethal to witness. As London is suddenly promoted as a super-wealth brand, the England outside London shivers beneath cutbacks, tight circumstances and economic disasters. Not celebrating? Ennis won gold on a remarkable Saturday for the British, when they won three gold medals in athletics . Home support: Morrissey has condemned the 'blustering jingoism' he believes the Games has roused in the British public . 'Meanwhile the British media present . 24-hour coverage of the ""dazzling royals"", laughing as they lavishly . spend, as if such coverage is certain to make British society feel fully . whole. In 2012, the British public is evidently assumed to be . undersized pigmies, scarcely able to formulate thought. 'As . I recently drove through Greece I noticed repeated graffiti seemingly . everywhere on every available wall. In large blue letters it said WAKE . UP WAKE UP. 'It could . almost have been written with the British public in mind, because . although the spirit of 1939 Germany now pervades throughout media-brand . Britain, the 2013 grotesque inevitability of Lord and Lady Beckham (with . Sir Jamie Horrible close at heel) is, believe me, a fate worse than . life. WAKE UP WAKE UP.' The singer's latest rant has not gone down at all well on Twitter, where many users have taken to the site to hit back at Morrissey. What a haul: Mo Farah (centre) and Great Britain are on course to beat their previous record of 19 gold medals in the London Games . Disapproval: Morrissey ranted that the 'Dazzling Royals' had dominated the Olympics . Comparison: SS troops march past Adolf Hitler in a German street in May 1939. Morrissey has likened the support for British athletes at the London Olympics to the mindset of the German people during the late 1930s . @PunkHammer said on his profile: 'He . is as dogmatic as those he opposes. Unable to see anything but his own . ideas as correct. #morrissey ' @PHarrisonYP quipped: 'He'll not be at the closing ceremony then.' @gwarizm . tweeted their views on the rocker's rant against the Games: 'Morrissey . complaining about nationalism? A case of the pot calling the kettle . ""devious, truculent and unreliable.' And @ameliadodge simply said: 'i feel like Morrissey lost his touch after he left The Smiths #opinion #haterswillhate' Champion: The black athlete Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin and embarrassed Hitler, who had intended to use the Games to promote his Aryan ideals . This is not the first time Morrissey has made remarks that have caused a stir. The singer, whose former band once released an album called Meat Is Murder, criticised the Chinese for their treatment of animals. Morrissey is a well-established vegetarian and animal rights campaigner. Speaking to the Guardian Weekend magazine about China's treatment of circus animals, he said: 'Did you see the thing on the news about their treatment of animals and animal welfare? 'Absolutely horrific. You can't help but feel that the Chinese are a subspecies'. He has also made anti-Royal comments in the past. Last year, when the Queen visited Ireland on a state visit, he even likened Her Royal Highness Elizabeth II to the former Libyan tyrant Muammar Gaddafi. He wrote in Irish magazine Hot Press last year: 'The very existence of the Queen and her now enormous family ... is . entirely against any notion of democracy, and is against freedom of . speech. For a broad historical view of what the Queen is and how she . 'rules', examine Gaddafi or Mubarak, and see if you can spot any . difference.' The Smiths wrote their 1986 album The Queen is Dead, and sang the lyrics: 'Her very Lowness with a head in a sling/ I'm truly sorry – but it sounds like a wonderful thing.'

"A British nuclear submarine has reportedly been spotted off the Gibraltar coast. Witnesses said they saw the vessel surface on Saturday as tensions between Spain and Britain continue to rise over fishing rights around the Mediterranean enclave. The sighting comes days after Royal Navy warship HMS Westminster arrived in Gibraltar. Witnesses say a British nuclear submarine, believed to be HMS Tireless (pictured), surfaced off Gibraltar . The Ministry of Defence refused to confirm or deny today if a nuclear submarine is currently stationed at the enclave. A spokeswoman said if it was in Gibraltar then it was for 'routine business'. The Sun quoted an 'insider' as saying: 'There is only one reason a submarine breaks the surface - and that is to be spotted. Last time the Trafalgar-class sub docked by the Rock it provoked anger and protests from activists (pictured) 'These things do not show themselves unless they want to be seen.' The website shipspotting.com reported that HMS Tireless - a Trafalgar-class nuclear submarine - was seen in Gibraltar in Z Berth last month. Local news in Gibraltar reported that HMS Tireless sailed into the area last month for a 'short stay as part of (the submarine's scheduled operational tasking'. If confirmed, it will be the first time the nuclear submarine has docked in the contested region since 2004. The docking of HMS Tireless, which is due to be decommissioned this year, sparked protests from Spanish activist nine years ago - the same year as the 300th anniversary of the capture of Gibraltar from Spain. The submarine caused diplomatic tensions between Britain and Spain once again in 2000 when it docked in Gibraltar for a year after the submarine developed a serious leak in the nuclear reactor primary cooling circuit. Another Trafalgar-class submarine, HMS Talent, stopped in Gibraltar this year and the enclave's first minister Fabian Picardo and his deputy Dr Joseph Garcia were given a tour. Tensions between the two countries have ramped up this year over fishing rights. Gibraltar's creation of an artificial reef with concrete blocks has provoked fury from Spanish fisherman, which they say blocks their access to certain waters. Spanish police were criticised last week when they unfurled a Spanish flag during an inspection of the reef. Spanish police were criticised recently after they held up a Spanish flag during an inspection of an artificial reef that has caused anger among fishermen . Gibraltar accused the police of violating 'British sovereignty' by attempting to exercise jurisdiction in its territory. Last week, a fleet of almost 40 boats sailed into British waters to demand the reef be removed. Spain has also increases border checks, leading to long queues for workers and tourists entering Gibraltar. The Gibraltar government has tried in recent days to defuse tensions by proposing a change in local law to let the Spanish resume fishing in parts of the sea near the Rock.","Witnesses said they saw the submarine surface on Saturday .

She lifts: Jenna Thompso survived a horror birth after losing three pints of blood during childbirth has defied doctors by making a miraculous return to bodybuilding . But the defiant mother-of-one had trained throughout her pregnancy to maintain her muscles and refused to give up on her dream. Speaking about her ordeal, Jenna said: 'I was terrified when doctors rushed into my delivery room, I feared something was wrong with Emilia. 'Once I’d got over the trauma, I was determined to get back to bodybuilding. 'I had spent my entire pregnancy lifting weights so I was devastated when doctors told me my dreams of becoming a bodybuilder weren’t possible. 'I couldn’t pick Amelia up for three months and I had six months of physiotherapy to improve the muscles that had torn, thankfully my supportive family and partner, Daniel Wylie, helped me through.' New mother: Jenna had trained throughout her pregnancy to maintain her muscles and refused to give up on her dream after welcoming little Emilia, now fourteen months . Working out: Pregnancy didn't stop Jenna from hitting the gym nor did doctors warning her about weight training after birth - she refused to give up . Before baby: Jenna decided to start bodybuilding seriously in 2012, when she met her personal trainer on Twitter, and went on to compete in competitions . 'After eight months of not lifting heavy weights, I was finally able to do so once again. 'I returned to the gym just four months after giving birth but I took things slow as I needed to slowly build up my muscle strength. 'I had found myself a great personal trainer before Emilia was born and even managed to compete in a bodybuilding event last month.' Jenna balances being a new mother and lifting weights by using the gym she set up at home. She said: 'I time my weight sessions with Emilia’s naps and feeding times. 'A week before my competition I was working out six times a week, I ate six meals a day, which consisted of white fish and green vegetables but I still managed to put Emilia first.

'Anita was a successful bodybuilding trainer and I loved how lean and curvy she looked rather than overly muscly. 'I was training daily for a competition called Miami Pro but I had to pull out when I fell pregnant.' But pregnancy didn’t stop Jenna from hitting the gym nor did doctors warning her about weight training after birth - she refused to give up. Each to their own: Jenna has been overwhelmed with the kind messages, compliments and questions seeking advice but also realises every woman is an individual and is sensitive about giving the right advice given she is not a qualified trainer . Jenna said: 'I suffered two prolapses after lifting Emilia and heavy shopping bags too soon. 'Luckily they were corrected through physiotherapy but the whole experience was terrifying.

'On a weekly and sometimes daily basis she is getting emails, messages and questions asking for advice and insight as to how she did it. 'Other mothers Jenna knows or has met can hardly believe her transformation and are especially inspired by the way she has bounced back and escaped near death after the birth of Emilia. 'Jenna has been overwhelmed with the kind messages, compliments and questions seeking advice but also realises every woman is an individual and is sensitive about giving the right advice given she is not a qualified trainer. 'Her advice to them was hire a great coach, follow their advice, eat clean, train hard and never give up. 'It is safe to say that Jenna is one to never give up and visualisation is a tool Jenna used to bounce back from the traumatic birth of Emilia. 'It just goes to show if Jenna can do it and overcome a traumatic birth and defy doctors by being able to weight train again, with determination and self-belief, any woman can do it.'

"Unanswered questions:  Kent Chief Constable Alan Pughsley, whose force hacked Mail on Sunday phone records . Despite the outcry over The Mail on Sunday’s revelations that police were hacking its journalists’ phones, police are still refusing to reveal the scale of the snooping. At least four forces across Britain – as well as the taxman – have been exposed for using controversial anti-terror powers to expose sources and trace leaks. But they are still blocking requests from journalists to reveal the full details of their surveillance conducted under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA). Kent Police obtained records of this newspaper’s phone calls in order to trace the confidential source of our stories about shamed Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne, who had falsely accused journalists of conspiring to bring him down over his illegal penalty points swap with his wife. Last night the force – while claiming it ‘welcomed a wider debate’ about RIPA – declined to answer key questions about the controversial investigation. It would not say how many phone numbers were trawled through as part of the probe – codenamed Operation Solar – into Huhne’s bogus claim that he was the victim of a conspiracy. Nor would Kent say how many individuals were identified after their private numbers were revealed through the RIPA application to telecoms companies. And the force would not say what had happened to the data since the probe in 2012 – raising the prospect it is still lying in police files. The force would also not identify the senior officers who had approved the RIPA application, only saying it was a superintendent and an inspector. Assistant Chief Constable Matthew Horne said in a statement: ‘We welcome a wider debate on whether this specific investigatory power – when used in lawful pursuit of serious wrongdoing – should be the subject of judicial authority or oversight from an appropriate regulatory body when matters of journalistic privilege are apparent. As part of this debate consideration has to be given to how material held by the media that might be relevant to a criminal investigation is shared with the police and the courts.’ Police forces across the country failed to reveal how many times reporters have been monitored using RIPA. Of the 37 forces who rejected Freedom of Information requests by industry journal Press Gazette, 24 said it would cost too much to trawl through their records, while 13 cited security reasons. However, every chief constable has now been ordered to provide the information both by a watchdog and MPs. The Interception of Communications Commissioner, Sir Paul Kennedy, has told all chief constables to hand over ‘full details of all investigations that have used Part I Chapter 2 RIPA powers to acquire communications data to identify journalistic sources’. And the chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, Keith Vaz, said: ‘I will be writing to them, each of the police forces, to ask how many times they’ve used RIPA powers and where. I’d like it broken down by profession.’ Sources said it will be a huge undertaking for police as, until now, they have not been required to collate figures on how many times they have accessed journalists’ data since the law came into force in 2000. The records cannot be searched in a single database, so police staff will have to painstakingly reopen every single RIPA application made over the past 14 years to see if it makes reference to journalistic sources. Figures obtained by pressure group Big Brother Watch show police made more than 120,000 RIPA requests for communications data in a single year – 2011-12 – so the total number of files to be searched will top one million. As well as Kent, it is known that three other forces, as well as HMRC tax officers, have used RIPA in leak investigations. Ian Hislop called the police's actions 'dangerous' and said 'if they can do it to journalists they can do it to all of you' Scotland Yard trawled through phone data for The Sun’s political editor Tom Newton Dunn so detectives could track down the source of the ‘Plebgate’ story that led to Tory Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell resigning. The Met refused to say how many times it had used RIPA in leak inquiries. Thames Valley Police bugged the car of local newspaper reporter Sally Murrer in a 19-month leak inquiry that ended with the case against her collapsing. The force declined to comment on her case but said: ‘RIPA is designed to ensure the powers are used lawfully and in a way that is compatible with human rights. It also requires those authorising the use of covert techniques to give proper consideration to whether their use is necessary and proportionate.’ Suffolk Police obtained phone records of a reporter on the Ipswich Star, Mark Bulstrode, to find out how he had got a story about a rape investigation – even though his paper did not run the controversial piece. HMRC also used the law to get hold of phone records for one of its own solicitors, Osita Mba, after it wrongly thought he had told a newspaper about a secret deal with millionaire bankers. The taxman declined to say how many times it had used RIPA on its own employees. Last night, police chiefs insisted they took great care when using RIPA, and promised to co-operate with the watchdog’s inquiry.","Police used anti-terror laws to hack Mail on Sunday reporter's phone .

"This is the shocking tweet from Justin Ross Harris to a friend on September 11 of last year that suggests his baby Cooper, then 13-month-old, was not sleeping to his satisfaction. Of course, many parents of young babies have shared similar frustrations about wishing their babies would sleep through the night. But the shocking tweet from @rossharris: ‘NEW INVENTION: Snooze buttons on babies’ is shocking in light of the charges against Harris, who has been charged with leaving his son to die in a scorching hot SUV on June 18, is alarming. Harris, who describes himself as a 'web developer, musician and lead guitar @ Stonebridge Church' on his Twitter account, which he joined in July 2008, has a total of 22 tweets on his Twitter page, most talking about entering contests and his new coffee machine. On his Twitter page Harris describes himself as a 'web developer, musician and lead guitar @ Stonebridge Church' He joined in July 2008 and has a total of 22 tweets on his Twitter page. This is the shocking tweet from Justin Ross Harris to a friend on September 11 of last year that suggests his baby Cooper, then 13-month-old, was not sleeping to his satisfaction . Turned away: Leanna Harris walks out of the Cobb County detention facility after being turned away from seeing her husband and accused killer of her son on Tuesday morning . Harris' wife Leanna was barred from visiting her husband on Tuesday when she attempted to see him in jail for the first time since shocking details of the alleged crime were revealed in court. Harris refused to answer reporters' questions as she left the Cobb County detention facility in Marietta on Tuesday morning, where she'd spent 36 minutes according to WXIA, except to shake her head 'no' when asked if she'd seen her son's accused killer. She appeared at least passably distraught as she got in the back seat of an unidentified woman's car, though questions have already begun to arise about her role in 22-month-old Cooper's June 18 death precisely because of her behavior. Also on Tuesday, investigators took Justin Ross Harris' SUV back to the Home Depot parking lot to recreate details similar to the day when the child died. Investigators took Justin Ross Harris' SUV back to the Home Depot parking lot on Tuesday to recreate details similar to the day when the child died . Police revealed this week that . Cooper had been switched out of his forward-facing new car seat weeks . before his death - even though he was too big for his old one. Harris . was found dead in his rear-facing car seat in a parking lot in Cobb . County, Georgia on June 18 - after sweltering inside for more than seven . hours. According to Cobb County, Georgia police detective Phil Stoddard, Harris told his wife, 'I dreaded how he would look,' when he 'discovered' his son's dead body. Harris faces a . murder charge but insists he mistakenly left his 22-month-old son inside . the car before heading to work at Home Depot. With the boy in the rear-facing seat, Harris would not have seen his child if he looked over towards it. During . a probable cause hearing on Thursday, Cobb County Police Detective Phil . Stoddard testified that the boy was 'several inches' too big for the . child seat, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Loss: Cooper Harris, pictured with his parents Justin Ross and Leanna, had been switched out of a seat that might have been easier for his father to see him in the back of the sweltering car . He added that the parents had bought a new, forward-facing child seat just six weeks ago but they switched back to his old seat for reasons that are not yet clear. 'Harris knew the specific make and model of the seat and what the weight limit was for the child to be seated in it,' the warrants state. 'When the seat was inspected the straps for the seat were set on the lowest level for a small child.' Harris told detectives his son was 'developing fine'. Suspicions are also growing about what role Harris' wife may have played in the death. Accused: Justin Ross Harris, pictured at his bond hearing in Mariette, Georgia on Thursday, is accused of leaving his 22-month-old son Cooper to die in a hot SUV on June 18 . Emotional: Harris is facing additional charges of sexual exploitation of a minor as well as murder . Leanna Harris has not yet been charged with any crime but she expressed little emotion throughout last weeks hearing, despite a number of shocking allegations including that her husband had been sexting with six different women, some teenagers, on the day their young son had passed away. Investigators also described her own behavior on the day her son died as odd, if not suspicious. When . workers at her son's day care said that Cooper had never been dropped . off, she calmly responded: ‘Ross must have left him in the car. There's . no other explanation,’ Stoddard said. When . reunited with her husband at police headquarters after he had been . charged with murder, Leanna Harris asked him: 'Did you say too much?' according to Stoddard. When she called home June 18 with the . grim news of Cooper’s death, her mother could be overheard on the phone . saying: ‘Why aren’t you crying? Why aren’t you reacting?’ Her response, according to Stoddard: ‘I must be in shock.’ Familiar face: Leanna Harris, right, wife of . Justin Ross Harris, arrives for her husband's bond hearing in Cobb . County Magistrate Court Thursday. There are also questions surrounding her reactions to her son's death . Aftermath: Guests leave the funeral for Cooper Harris after hearing an emotional call from father Ross from prison as he said goodbye last month . Police . had previously disclosed that, like her husband, she had researched . children dying in hot vehicles prior to her son Cooper’s death, telling . officers it was her ‘worst fear.’ At Cooper’s funeral - and with her husband listening from jail on speaker phone - she said she held no anger toward him. ‘Ross . is and was a wonderful father,’ she told mourners, before telling her . husband of seven years: ‘I love you and I’m doing this for you.’ Some of Leanna Harris’ comments during her eulogy at Cooper’s funeral have also raised suspicions. 'Some . of you might wonder how I’m standing here today and I ask myself the . same question,' the deeply religious mother said. Heartbreaking details: Detective Stoddard testified that there was scratch marks on Cooper Harris' face and abrasions on the back of the toddler's head . 'I should be crumpled . into a pile of tears and snot on the ground. (The Lord) is standing . behind me, holding me up.' The . 250 or so mourners who gathered at University Church of Christ gave her . two rounds of applause as she said she wouldn’t bring her son back, . even if she could. 'He’s in the most peaceful, wonderful place there is,' she said. Detective Stoddard also told the court . that several injuries were found on the boy's body, including . visible marks on his face, revealing that he had struggled to escape as temperatures soared. Justin Ross Harris remains in jail on murder and child cruelty charges. He has been denied bond.","Justin Ross Harris is accused of leaving his 22-month-old son Cooper to die in a scorching hot SUV on June 18 .

"Humans have used pigeons to carry messages to desired locations for centuries, but how the birds find their way home has remained a mystery. Now experts believe they navigate using a gyroscope-like area in their brain. They say that the birds use their memory of the gravity field at their home to guide them home. Scientists believe that homing pigeons navigate using a type of gyroscope in their brain and use their memory of the gravity field at their home location to guide them back . Dr Hans-Peter Lipp of the University of Zurich in Switzerland and Kwazulu-Natal University in South Africa, said: ‘There is widespread agreement that pigeons are able to determine and maintain flight - compass - directions based on solar and magnetic cues.’ But no-one had previously explained how the birds determine their position. Previous studies have suggested that pigeons  navigate using smells or magnetic fields. After decades of working with pigeons in the Swiss Army, Dr Lipp teamed up with Valeryi Kanevskyi, of the High-Technologies Institute in Ukraine. He said: ‘Valeryi had formulated a simplistic yet astonishing theory.’ The Ukrainian suggested that the birds use their memory of the gravity field at their home loft for guidance. Dr Lipp said: ‘I realised that he had solved the map problem by one simple assumption: birds must have a gyroscope in their brain.’ No-one had previously explained how the birds (stock image) determine their position. Previous studies have suggested that pigeons develop ‘map sense’ and navigate using smells, or a geomagnetic map . Scinetists believe that huge flocks of birds decide when to change direction in mid flight by using a kind of 'democratic hierarchy'. In 2010, a team from Britain and Hungary strapped tiny global position systems (GPS) to pigeons to work out how they operated as a well-ordered group rather than chaotic individuals. They recorded the flight paths of individual birds and then analysed interactions between them. Scinetists found that pigeon flocks use a flexible system of leadership where almost every member plays a part, but high-ranking birds have more power. To conduct their study, the researchers fitted miniature GPS loggers weighing less than one ounce into custom-made backpacks carried by flocks of up to 10 homing pigeons. The devices allowed scientists to analyse spatial and temporal relationships between birds and the movement decisions they made at the scale of a fraction of a second. 'These hierarchies are flexible in the sense that the leading role of any given bird can vary over time,' said Professor Dora Biro of the zoology department at Britain's Oxford University . 'This dynamic, flexible segregation of individuals into leaders and followers - where even the lower-ranking members' opinions can make a contribution - may represent a particularly efficient form of decision-making.' The scientists said more studies could help explain how such a sophisticated leadership system is able to give evolutionary advantage to individuals, compared with strategy based on a single leader or one where all members play an equal part. Their team published the discovery that homing pigeons are affected by disturbances in the gravity field, in the Journal of Experimental Biology. At the beginning of the experiment, the team set out to show that gravity anomalies - without geomagnetic contamination - would mislead pigeons. To do this, the scientists used a location in the Ukraine - a huge meteorite crater filled with sediment where gravity was weaker than usual. The researchers wondered whether crossing the edge of the crater could disrupt a pigeon’s gyroscope navigation system and send the birds off in the wrong direction. Pigeon fanciers in the nearby town of Novoukrainka trained birds and over a series of days, 26 birds fitted with lightweight GPS trackers, were released from the middle of the crater. Of the 18 birds that made it home safely, seven  headed in the correct direction and managed to cross the edge of the crater without deviating much from the most direct route home. However, other birds that set off in random directions seemed to become disorientated at the edge of the crater and when they crossed a second gravity disturbance, lost their bearings again. The researchers compared the flight paths of the birds that encountered the gravity distortions with birds that had an unhindered return home. They found that the disturbed birds’ routes were much more widely dispersed than the unhindered groups and showed that the birds veered off most severely when they crossed the edge of the meteorite impact. The scientists believe that the birds initially set a bearing home by comparing their ‘home gyroscope setting’ with their ‘local gyroscope reading’. But some birds initially set the wrong bearing - taking several days to correct the error and return home – suggesting that they rarely use the alternative navigation strategy of regularly checking the difference between their actual and anticipated return routes. Dr Lipp hopes to learn more about the cellular mechanisms that allow the birds to detect the weak gravitational forces that keep them on the straight and narrow.

"We’ve survived the Mayan apocalypse and Y2K, but be afraid – the end of the world is coming…again. This time it’s the Viking apocalypse that is allegedly set to destroy Earth, with Norse mythology claiming the planet will split open and unleash the inhabitants of Hel on February 22. According to the Vikings, Ragnarok is a series of events including the final predicted battle that results in the death of a number of major gods, the occurrence of various natural disasters and the subsequent submersion of the world in water. Apocalypse now: People in York dress as Vikings as part of the Jorvik Viking Festival. It comes as the Viking community prepare for the Norse apocalypse called Ragnarok this Saturday, in which the Earth is predicted to split open and gods will battle for supremacy. Doom: The final battle of the gods, otherwise known as Ragnarok, signals the end of the world. Vikings believe the apocalypse will begin on Saturday. THE MAYAN APOCALYPSE . The world was set to be destroyed by an asteroid, or some other interplanetary object such as an alien invasion on December 21, 2012. Scientists said this wasn't possible... and were proved right. THE RAPTURE . When his four original predicted dates failed to come to fruition, Christian radio broadcaster Harold Camping revised his prediction and said that a 'Spiritual Judgment' took place in May 2011, and that the end of the world would occur on October 21. THE COMET . There were grave fears Comet Elenin would cause disturbances to the Earth's crust, causing massive earthquakes and tidal waves in August 2011. Others predicted that Elenin would collide with Earth on October 16. THE BLACK HOLES . A number of groups claimed that activation of the Large Hadron Collider experiment would bring about the end of the world through the production of planet-eating micro black holes on September 10, 2008. Similar claims were made two years later. THE NUCLEAR WAR . In 2003, Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo predicted the world would be destroyed by a nuclear war sometime between October 30 and November 29. THE NATURAL DISASTERS . Yoruba priests in Nigeria predicted dramatic tragedy and crisis in 2002, including coups, war, disease, and flooding. THE MILLENIUM BUG . Predictions a Y2K computer bug would crash computers and cause major catastrophes worldwide when the clock ticked over to midnight on January 1, 2000. Planes were tipped to fall out of the sky and electronic gadgets were predicted to malfunction, ultimately resulting in society ceasing to exist. The wolf Fenrir is also predicted to break out of his prison, the snake Jormungand will rise out of the sea and the dragon of the underworld will resurface on Earth to face the dead heroes of Valhalla – who, of course, have descended from heaven to fight them. Legend has it the sound of the horn will call the sons of the god Odin and the heroes to the battlefield, before Odin and other ‘creator gods’ will be killed by Fenrir. The Vikings believe the Ragnarok is preceded by the ‘winter of winters’, where three freezing winters would follow each other with no summers in between. All morality would disappear and fights would break out all over the world, signalling the beginning of the end. The wolf Skoll would then devour the sun, and his brother Hati would eat the moon, causing stars to fall out of the sky and the Earth subjected to tremendous earthquakes. Should Saturday be the day, the world will then be restored and will be inhabited by the surviving gods and just two human survivors - with the Earth sinking into the sea and paving the way for a new utopian land with endless supplies. Another part of the legend claims that the Midgard Serpent, named Jormungand, shall free itself from its tail and rise up from the ocean, with believers claiming this had already occurred when two giant fish washed up on the coast of California last year. Ragnarok, which is literally translated to mean ‘Fate or Twilight of the Gods’ or ‘Final Destiny of the Gods’ is based on a 13th century poem written by Snorri Sturluson. Modern day Vikings warriors have already begun preparing for the apocalypse by converging on the UK town of York to celebrate the Jorvik festival – an excuse for grown men to dress up and swing replica swords at each other. The festival’s finale on Saturday will see about 300 warriors march through the city, before rival tribes participate in an ‘ultimate battle’. The Jorvik Viking Centre predicted that Ragnarok would occur on 22 February because this is the end of the feast of Jolablot. Traditionally, the Viking festival of Jolablot marked the end of the winter.While not a scientific conclusion, they claim that Vikings loved to feast and wouldn't want to miss this event. And if nothing happens on Saturday, Ragnarok will join a list of hundreds of other failed predictions for the end of the world, including the Mayan apocalypse on December 21, 2012 – which convinced many the Earth would be destroyed by an asteroid – and Y2K on January 1, 2000. Apocalypse: Vikings believe Norse mythology claiming the end of the world will strike this Saturday.","Norse mythology states the world will end this Saturday, February 22 .

"A champion wakeboarder has spoken for the first time since an horrific training accident left him quadriplegic. Talking through a speaking valve from his Florida hospital bed, Brad Smeele, 27, thanked his supporters for their donations and good wishes and celebrated being able to talk for the first time in a month. The New Zealander shattered his C4 vertebrae in July while attempting a double backflip during training at the world's largest wake park Lake Ronix in Orlando, Florida. Scroll down for video . Brad Smeele, 27, from New Zealand was left a quadriplegic after a wakeboarding accident in Florida . 'I just wanted to send a message out and say thank you so much for all the support and all the kind messages you guys have been sending through,' Mr Smeele said in a video posted to YouTube. 'All the donation and gifts and everything has been really amazing and it's truly blown me away how much support I've got from all around the world so just wanted to say a huge thank you to everyone. 'I'm really stoked to let you guys know that tomorrow morning I'm actually off to Atlanta to go to the Shepherd Rehab Centre so onto stage two of this battle so I'll keep you guys updated.' Mr Smeele will spend roughly six weeks at the Atlanta rehabilitation facility to help adjust to life as a quadriplegic, his sister Monique Smeele said. Mr Smeele was working at the Florida wake park as a manager when the tragic accident occurred . Before his accident he was ranked 20th in the US Pro Wakeboard Tour - the largest professional wakeboarding circuit in the world . 'Apparently they work them pretty hard, which Brad is pretty keen on,' Ms Smeele told Daily Mail Australia. 'He's been in the ICU for a month so he wants to get out, that's the type of person he is.' Following the accident and the injury to his spinal cord, Mr Smeele was told there was only a one to two percent chance he would regain motor skills to the top half of his body - a fact he is taking day by day. 'He's been incredible throughout this. He has dealt with it much better than I thought he would,' Ms Smeele said. 'It's a situation you don't wish upon anyone, but Brad has been really strong and positive. He's going to do whatever he has to in order to have the best life possible going forward.' Mr Smeele, from New Zealand, shattered his C4 vertebrae in July while attempting a double backflip during training at the world's largest wake park Lake Ronix in Orlando, Florida . Since the operation he has regained sensation from his nipple-line up, and has been able to move his shoulders slightly. Mr Smeele has spent the past five weeks recovering in Orlando Regional Medical Center. He has been building up the ability to breathe without the aid of a ventilator while also battling an ongoing pneumonia infection. The keen wake boarder has split his time between New Zealand and the US for the past 10 years to follow the pro season. Mr Smeele was working at the Florida wake park as a manager when the tragic accident occurred. On Saturday a fundraising event held in his hometown of Auckland raised almost $NZ30,000 ($A27,381) – but this is only a small part of what is needed. Just six months of rehabilitation is estimated to cost US$500,000. His family created a website to document his recovery and to help raise money for his care. 'We're focusing on raising enough money for his rehabilitation... that's where he's going to have the best chance possible moving forward,' Ms Smeele said. 'We'll try to pay for medical bills through other avenues.' Talking through a speaking valve, 27-year-old Brad Smeele thanked his supporters for their donations and good wishes in a video posted on YouTube . Following the accident and the injury to his spinal cord Mr Smeele was told there was only a 1-2 percent chance he would regain motor skills to the top half of his body . Brad's mother Linda Smeele thanked all her son's supporters in a Facebook post last month but described his recovery as an 'agonisingly slow process'. 'I feel like I am in 'groundhog day', treading the same path to be by my son's bedside every day, with what seems like little or no change,' she said. Mr Smeele's girlfriend Talor Reazin . 'We keep reminding ourselves this is a marathon, not a sprint, and your combined love and support will help him for the remainder to his marathon. 'I am grieving for the loss of the active life Brad had, and challenged by the unknown of what lies ahead. 'But we know he is strong and determined and he will be an inspiration!' Following the accident his girlfriend Talor Reazin posted a picture of him to Instagram along with a message of support. 'I love this boy with all my (heart). He was badly injured doing the one thing he loves most - wakeboarding,' Ms Reazin wrote. 'He is one of the most kind-hearted, hard working, gentle souls I know and is always positive with a bright happy smile on his face.' Mr Smeele has been wakeboarding since he was 12 and has won titles at wakeboard championships around the world. Before his accident he was ranked 20th in the US Pro Wakeboard Tour - the largest professional wakeboarding circuit in the world. For updates, visit www.bradsmeelefoundation.com.

"Threats: PR man James Saville claimed to be working with Theresa May’s department . A Mail on Sunday journalist trying to uncover the truth about Fiona Woolf’s appointment to the child abuse inquiry received unwarranted threats from a PR man claiming to be working with the Home Office. This newspaper was warned it would be reported to the new press complaints watchdog for simply arranging an interview with another panel member who could shed light on the controversy. The threat was made by James Saville, a spokesman for Sharon Evans, a third person on the abuse inquiry. She runs a charity which includes Strictly Come Dancing star Kristina Rihanoff and Tony Blair’s daughter Kathryn among its trustees. Last night, an MP said it sounded like another attempt at a cover-up. Labour’s Simon Danczuk said: ‘I find it bizarre. The last thing we want is for the Home Office, its representatives or PR people trying to silence journalists or to cover up the relationships that may have gone on.’ After a reporter had agreed last week to meet abuse survivor Graham Wilmer, who is on the inquiry panel, Mr Saville rang the journalist five minutes before the agreed interview time to say it had been called off. He then suggested the reporter had behaved improperly – a claim the journalist vehemently denies. In a reference to the new Independent Press Standards Organisation, Mr Saville said: ‘I don’t want to have to start getting Ipso involved.’ Mr Saville claimed to be working with Theresa May’s department, and suggested the reporter phone her head of press, Andy Tighe, if he did not believe him. But Mr Saville represents abuse victim Mrs Evans, who defended Mrs Woolf’s appointment in a BBC radio interview last week. Trustees: Kathryn Blair and Kristina Rihanoff at the Dot Com Children's Foundation Strictly-inspired event at the Home Office. The charity is run by abuse victim Sharon Evans - who defended Mrs Woolf this week . Mrs Evans runs a charity called the Dot Com Children’s Foundation, which has had significant support from the Home Office, including hosting a campaign launch where Strictly dancers showed off their moves to a room of civil servants. Criticism: Mrs Evans defended the appointment of Fiona Woolf, pictured, to the child abuse inquiry . As public criticism of Mrs Woolf intensified over her links to former Home Secretary Lord Brittan, Mrs Evans told Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday: ‘I am very confident this inquiry can do its job. We are satisfied that Fiona Woolf has the skills of a solicitor… We need balance and we need those skills.’ Yet her charity, whose trustees include Ms Blair and Ms Rihanoff, is helped by many of the organisations that will come under scrutiny in the inquiry, including the Home Office, which has admitted losing dozens of files on child abuse in the 1980s. Mrs Evans admitted in her letter of possible conflicts of interest: ‘The Dot Com Children’s Foundation has received funding and support from a number of public sources including the Mayor of London’s office, the Fire Service through the Chief Officers’ Association, the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Home Office, Foreign Office and Department for Education.’ The Home Office said it had not provided any funding to the Dot Com Children’s Foundation. Last night Mr Tighe denied Mr Saville was working with the Home Office. But asked whether he had been speaking to Mr Saville, he refused to comment. ‘I understand he works for Sharon Evans – he’s nothing to do with the Home Office,’ Mr Tighe added.","PR man claiming to be working with the Home Office threatened journalist .

Once she had been diagnosed with the . blood cancer, shortly after her 13th birthday, Alice from Ulverston, . Cumbria was determined not to to waste a moment of the time she had . left and created a 'bucket list' that quickly became an internet sensation. The schoolgirl swam with sharks, went to her . school leavers’ prom, set up her own charity, and met the band Take . That. Top of the bucket list was 'to get everyone eligible to join a bone marrow register' and following her appearance on the stage at the Pride of Britain awards in October the Anthony Nolan trust received 26 times more applications from potential donors. Speaking on today's show mother Mrs Pyne said: 'Alice was always a very positive, bubbly person. 'Even when she was diagnosed there was never a doubt that she wouldn't beat it ... there was never an option for her to lose this battle . 'She just carried on doing everything, being ill was just an inconvenience. 'It was impossible not to be positive around her.' It was Mrs Pyne's idea for Alice to start the blog as a way of keeping her closest friend's up to date with her progress without having to talk about the details time and again. The family - including Alice - were amazed when the blog went viral. Mr Pyne said: 'Alice was the most surprised. It quickly became surreal. 'She didn't like the limelight and shied away from publicity but got a lot of pleasure from reading the responses. There are a lot of incredible people out there.' Inspiration: Alice Pyne (centre, checkered shirt) with her sister Milly and parents Vicky and Simon. The family announced her death on Twitter . Following Alice’s death earlier in January, . Mrs Pyne said: ‘I will spend my life doing the things Alice wanted me to . do - the charity, Anthony Nolan (Bone Marrow Trust) and an odd mountain . or two.’ In an entry for a competition at . Knowsley Safari Park in Prescot, Merseyside, Alice wrote of her sister: . ‘It makes me happy to know, that when I'm gone, she'll carry on . spreading her magic. I love you Milly.' Alice, who died with her family at her bedside, . inspired millions with her ‘bucket list’ of things she wanted . to achieve before she died. The list went viral online and, as it . caught media attention, she attracted support around the world to make . her dreams come true.

Tributes poured in for the plucky . teenager yesterday after her parents, Simon and Vicky Pyne, announced . her death at the weekend. The last wish on Alice's list was to go whale watching (left). Her plight attracted the attention of a host of celbrities, including Sir Paul McCartney (right), pictured with Alice and her sister Milly in 2007 . Alice Pyne with her friends and relatives at the official launch of Alice's Escapes at Booths store, Ulverston . Brave: Alice Pyne lost her battle with Hodgkin's Lymphoma but inspired millions . Last wish:  Alice with sister Milly and mother Vicky whale watching in Canada. It was the last thing she achieved on her bucket list . Canadian actress Nicole McKay joined Alice on her whale watching trip . Despite her bucket list of wishes, Alice was determined to help others and raised more than £100,000 for charity . Her mother wrote on Facebook: ‘Our darling girl, Alice, gained her angel wings today. ‘She passed away peacefully with . Simon, Milly and myself by her side. We are devastated and know that our . lives will never again be the same. Night Night Alice.’ And now the teenager has lost her cancer battle the family vow that the work that she started will go on. 14-year-old Milly is climbing Mount . Kilimanjaro, where she will scatter some of Alice's ashes, because 'I . know she wanted to do it and wasn't able to so I am doing it for her.' Mrs Pyne will focus on raising awareness of Hodgkins lymphoma and getting more bone marrow donors. She said today: 'I'm going to be doing some training and than going in to schools and colleges and clinics in the area.' And the family are in the progress of . building Alice's charity caravan which will offer holidays to other . families in similar situations. Hodgkin’s lymphoma sufferers  receive . bone marrow transplants and blood stem cells to replace what is killed . off during chemotherapy and radiation. Alice’s . hope that everyone in the UK would sign up as a bone marrow donor was praised by Prime Minister David Cameron in the House of . Commons. Following campaigns by Alice, the Anthony Nolan blood cancer . charity saw more than 40,000 sign up to its donor register. She also set up the charity Alice’s Escapes, which helps parents with a seriously ill child go on holiday. Last year Alice and her sister, Milly, . 14, were awarded a British Empire Medal for services to charity in the . Queen’s Birthday Honours List. She also won the Pride of Britain . Teenager of Courage award. Among those paying tribute following her death . was comedian David Walliams, who posed as a penguin keeper to surprise . Alice on a visit to London Zoo. He tweeted: ‘I am so sad about the . passing of Alice Pyne. What a beautiful and courageous girl.’ Alice . completed her ‘bucket list’ last August placing a final ‘DONE’ next to . whale watching. She said: ‘I never expected it [the . bucket list] to be published to the whole world. I didn’t even expect to . get the majority of my wishes fulfilled. Words can’t really explain it . but I’m so happy it is done.’ Poignantly, her final post on her . blog, on New Year’s Day, read: ‘Can’t believe I’m really saying ‘Happy . New Year’ to you all. I don’t think there is a single doctor that would . have expected me to be here when they sent me home over two years ago.’ It adds: ‘My New Year mission is to get a bit fatter which will hopefully give me more energy.’ Find out more about bone marrow donation at the Anthony Nolan Trust site .","Alice Pyne, 17, lost four-year fight with Hodgkin's lymphoma on Saturday 12th January .

"The run-up to the Super Bowl on Sunday has been marred by deflate-gate - and it's  hurting Tom Brady's feelings. The New England Patriots quarterback says he took football tampering allegations personally after  11 of the 12 footballs tested by the NFL were found to be two PSI less than league minimums. Brady once again denied having anything to do with the fact that they were improperly inflated in an interview with WEEI sports radio in Boston on Monday. Scroll down for audio . New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady says reports he was involved in deflate-gate 'hurt his feelings' Brady appeared on Monday alongside owner Bob Kraft (second right) and head coach Bill Belichick (right) 'I’ve tried to wrap my head around it, too. I’ve done that and I’m trying to move past that, because I continue to try to rehash things,' he said. 'I personalized a lot of things and thought this was all about me, and my feelings got hurt. 'Then I moved past it, because it’s not serving me.' The Patriots are still fending off cheating allegations less than a week before the Super Bowl, where they will face the Seattle Seahawks this coming Sunday. Adoring fans braved the cold - and threat of blizzard - to send their team off to Phoenix on Monday . Critics have suggested that billionaire team owner Kraft (left) could get the team out of trouble . Already, some Seahawks are speaking out about the NFL's investigation of 'deflate-gate.' Richard Sherman, the Seattle cornerback, says he doesn't believe the Patriots will be punished for breaking the rules because Patriots owner Robert Kraft is so close to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. 'Will they be punished? Probably not. Not as long Robert Kraft and Roger Goodell are still taking pictures at their respective homes. He was just at Kraft's house last week before the AFC Championship. Talk about conflict of interest. As long as that happens, it won't affect them at all,' Sherman fumed. Brady told WEEI that he has now blocked out the deflate-gate speculation and is working to focus 100 percent on the upcoming Super Bowl - his sixth appearance with the Patriots. On Sunday, he told ESPN that he hadn't been contacted by NFL investigators - and didn't expect to hear from them until after the big game. Investigators found that 11 out of the 12 footballs used by the Patriots offense during the AFC Championship game were under-inflated, which makes them easier to throw, catch and carry . The Indianapolis Colts complained that the Patriots' footballs were under-inflated during their 45-7 drubbing in the AFC Championship game on January 18. Under-inflated balls are easier to catch and throw in bad weather and they are also easier to carry and harder to fumble. Sports statistician Warren Sharp wrote last week that the Patriots' historically low fumble rate - once every 187 plays - is almost statistically impossible, and dramatically better than even the runner-up team. This Patriots team was able to achieve the record while running more than 200 more running plays than the team with then next-lowest fumble rate - the 2006-2010 Indianapolis Colts.","Brady says he 'took it personally' that he was accused of cheating .

"Druids, vegans and green activists . should be given special treatment at work, according to ‘lunatic’ advice . from the equalities watchdog. The . Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) warns employers that they . risk ‘potentially costly legal action’ unless they allow staff to follow . their ‘religion or belief rights’ in the workplace. This . could include giving believers time off to go on pilgrimages, such as . druids and pagans going to Stonehenge, while environmentalists should be . free to lecture other staff about their car use. Rights: The Equality and Human Rights Commission has warned employers that they should allow staff to follow their 'religion or belief rights' in the workplace, which could include giving pagans time off work to visit Stonehenge in Wiltshire . Druids should have the same rights at work as mainstream religious staff, according to the new guidelines . Vegetarian kitchen workers could . refuse to do tasks that offend their beliefs, such handling meat. Critics say that by the same logic vegans could refuse to work in an . office furnished with leather chairs. Even atheists should have their beliefs respected, according to the new guidance. It has been issued in the wake of the landmark European Court of Human Rights ruling that Christians may wear a cross at work. Vegetarians could also refuse to clean out fridges if they contain meat under the guidance . But . rather than focusing on Christian rights in the workplace – which it . insists are still strictly limited – the controversial quango suggests . employers should give equal respect to fringe and non-religious groups. The . guidance is likely to be seen as an insult by some Christians and other . religious observers as it appears to put lifestyle choices like . vegetarianism on a par with their deeply-held spiritual beliefs. Officials insisted they were trying to be helpful by alerting businesses . topotential legal pitfalls. But Tory MPs said the watchdog had gone . ‘many steps too far’ and warned that the guidance would have a damaging . effect on employers, particularly small businesses. Brian . Binley, a member of the Commons business, innovation and skills . committee, said the economy could not afford such ‘frivolous nonsense’. He . added: ‘We need to recognise the importance of people being able to . earn a living. We need small businesses to be able to thrive, not to be . weighed down with this sort of nonsense.’ Fellow . Tory Philip Davies called for the quango to be scrapped. He said: ‘If . anyone ever doubted that the EHRC is packed full of idiots who have no . idea about the real world or running a business then this is all the . evidence they need.’ Dominic . Raab warned that the guidance could lead to a flood of vexatious legal . claims. Mr Raab, a Tory MP and former international lawyer, said: ‘This . is a recipe for every crank and crazy to take their boss for a ride. The . EHRC has become an expensive taxpayer-funded laughing stock.’ The . guidance follows the successful bid by Christian British Airways worker . Nadia Eweida to overturn a ban on wearing a small crucifix at work. But the 12-page EHRC document makes it clear that the rights of Christians in the workplace are strictly limited. It . gives the example of a religious magistrate asking to be excused from . dealing with cases involving the upbringing of children by gay couples. The new advice comes after British Airways employee Nadia Eweida won her case at the European Court of Human Rights in January when it ruled that she had suffered discrimination at work because of her faith . The guidance suggests it would be reasonable to refuse the request because the rights of gay couples are more important. But . in other areas it suggests the Strasbourg court ruling could have a . wide-ranging impact on the right of employees to express their religion . and beliefs at work. It says . employers can refuse to consider a request if they suspect a belief is . not sincerely held, but warns: ‘An employer should only question a . belief in the most exceptional cases’. Last . night an EHRC spokesman said: ‘The Commission does not make the law on . what is or isn’t a legitimate religion or belief. This is set by . Parliament. It is important to remember that employers are not required . to accept these types of request. ‘The . Commission’s role is to provide free, expert advice to employers . helping them understand and deal with what can be complex issues, and . helping them avoid potentially costly legal action.’ The . advice was welcomed by the Vegetarian Society, which said it gave . official recognition that ‘vegetarianism can be, and indeed often is, a . deeply held belief’. The EHRC said although the recent cases at the European Court of Human Rights, pictured, were about Christians they had further 'implications' for employers .","The Equality and Human Rights Commission has released new advice .

"A New York-based student who earned widespread criticism and notoriety earlier this year when she wrote an essay demanding that poor people should stop making her feel bad because she's rich has posted a follow-up article in which she complains that the media coverage of her outburst failed to make an issue of her sexuality. Rachel Sacks, who is enrolled in a $40,000-a-year writing program at a New York liberal arts school, posted her latest musings – entitled They Could Find My House But They Couldn't Find Out I Was Gay - on Thought Catalog on Monday. Sacks writes that she is upset with the media for not making an issue our of her sexuality, even though she admits it wasn't actually relevant to her previous essay about how a cashier at a grocery store close to her affluent West Village apartment was unfriendly and frowned at her because she had a designer bag. Scroll down for video . Rachael Sacks, who gained notoriety over an essay about poor people hating her because she's rich, has now complained that the media didn't include the fact that she is gay even though she admits it wasn't relevant . ‘I have Pride Flags hanging in the windows of my apartment,’ protests Sacks. ‘My Facebook account also says ''interested in women''. Reporters were able to find my home on Google Earth yet they were unable to see my sexuality blatantly listed for the public to see? It doesn’t add up.’ It was October when Sacks first gained notoriety after she posted her controversial essay on the Though Catalog site entitled I’m Not Going To Pretend That I’m Poor To Be Accepted By You. In that article Sacks blogged: 'I am sorry that I was born into great financial circumstances and my father likes to provide for me. I am sorry I don’t have to go to a state school to save my parents money. What do you want from me?' Scorned: Rachael Sacks, 20, has received endless online vitriol over her essay about her privileged background . In the media firestorm that followed Sacks, 20, was unrepentant over her rantings and told the Mail Online that she was undeserving of the media attention it generated because she was a 'spoiled brat who masturbates too much'. In her latest essay, Sacks freely admits that her sexuality has nothing to do with previous essay which gained her notoriety in the first place. ‘While my sexuality is irrelevant to the topic of my article, it still is part of who I am and should not be ignored,’ she admitted. According to Sacks, she believes her sexuality was ignored because ‘it would look tacky to vilify me in the press in regards to my sexuality.’ ‘Non normative sexuality has to be avoided completely as a topic of discussion because of all of the tragedies that have resulted from kids being bullied for being gay.’ Sacks is seen here with her father, Dr Preston Sacks, a prominent fertility doctor in Bethesda, Maryland . On her blog, her ambition is stated as: 'Working on my goal of being a rich eccentric old person by writing a lot of things.' The student has penned other articles . entitled '13 Things That Should Exist For New York Women In Their 20s' and 'Confession: I'm a chronic female masturbator'. In her essay about the hardships she faced as a rich person she wrote: 'People shouldn’t make others feel bad about their own personal finances. How people spend their money is their own choice.' She continued: 'It just seems really petty and makes you look bitter and unhappy with your own life if you are casting nasty glares at college girls in Gristedes because you’re a cashier.' The 20-year-old then argued: 'I’m not one of those people who try to be poor to relate to people. 'I think that’s honestly really disgusting behavior, it’s as if you’re saying that you have to make yourself into something you think is beneath you to get others to like you.' Classy lady: The 20-year-old New York college student said in her previous article that it is petty to be bitter about college girls if you're a cashier at a grocery store . She later claimed that she had no idea . that she was rich while growing up because her family went to McDonalds . and she wore clothes from Old Navy. She added: 'I went to private school when I was younger and there would always be someone so much richer than me. 'There . were kids who owned their own horses and whose parents were . billionaires, so I had no idea that I had any money until I was about 14 . and people called me ''Rachael Sacks of Cash''. Within hours of Sacks' previous article, she was flooded with deriding, mocking comments from people who didn't appreciate her perspective on wealth. 'Yes, let's all pity and feel bad for poor, judged, not smiled at,' one twitter user commented sarcastically. A commenter on her story wrote: 'What a spoiled brat. Your parents did a horrible job of raising you. The level of entitlement in this article is mind blowing. No one is born spoiled, entitled and snobby.' Sacks attends the New School's Eugene Lang Liberal Arts College - one of the most expensive universities in the country . 'That is a learned behavior. And it's . repugnant. I hope that you can modify your behavior before you pass your . horrible and selfish attitude down to your children,' another commenter . added. Sacks responded in fury at the negative responses her personal essay had drawn. She posted on Twitter: 'I've been dealing with b****** since the third grade I've always been ready for haterz.' She added: 'I'm just an obnoxiously loud voice of idiocy amongst billions.' Gossip site Gawker piled on with a post headlined Rich Girl Not Going to Pretend She's Not Rich Just to Make Poors Happy. Sacks attends the private Eugene Lang Liberal Arts College at the New School in Manhattan. Sacks was unrepentant in the face of criticism, telling her 'haters' to 'suck it' With tuition and fees totaling nearly . $40,000 a year and annual cost of attendance estimated at more than . $61,000, it has been ranked as one of the most expensive college in the . country. Her father is Dr Preston Sacks, a prominent fertility doctor in Bethesda, Maryland. The family lives in a $700,000 home in Bethesda, Maryland. Despite the massive influx of online criticism, Sacks doesn't appear to have changed her mind. She tweeted: 'I'm rolling my eyes because I definitely don't deserve this much attention.'

Sally, 40, who is single and lives in Crediton, Devon, with her son Luke, eight, said: 'The thought of baring my body in a photoshoot was enough to keep me losing the pounds towards the end of my weight loss. 'A friend had encouraged me to have the photoshoot done. I would never have dreamed of doing anything like that before. 'But losing the weight really boosted my confidence and it definitely helped me carrying on losing the pounds.' Sally started piling on the weight when she was in her 30's, and she'd struggled with her weight on and off during her teenage years. 'When I was very little, I was a podgy child,' she said. 'Then I slimmed down a bit, but put weight back on in my early teens. By my late teens I'd slimmed down to a size 12, and when I was 25 I was actually a size 10. But then I put on some weight in my 30's. The mother-of-one, who was a size 22 at her largest, was shocked into changing her lifestyle after suffering  a suspected stroke . 'By the time I married my husband in 2005 I was a size 16, and then a year later, when I gave birth to our son Luke in 2006 my weight had crept up to about 17 stone. 'In the following few years I wasn't happy with my size, but I would comfort eat, and the weight piled on even more.' Sally wouldn't eat any breakfast, then she would tuck into pasties for a mid morning snack. She would have sandwiches and crisps for lunch, and then often she would have a takeaway for dinner. 'I work as a carpenter making children's play equipment, and my colleague would nip out mid morning and get pasties for us to snack on, and that was before I would eat any lunch. 'I would snack on chocolate during the day, especially my favourite Yorkie bars. When I ate chocolate bars at night, I couldn't eat just a few pieces, I would wolf down the whole bar. And I would have takeaways several times during the week and at weekends too. I especially loved Chinese and kebabs too.' Carpenter Sally started losing weight when she swapped takeaways for salads and homemade dinners, but it was booking the sexy shoot that gave her the final motivation she needed to slim down . But Sally's weight proved to be a problem when she was working on a child's play cottage in a garden near Devon. She said: 'I was working with my colleague Alex in the garden. I was inside the children's play cottage hammering in some nails, and he was outside. Suddenly I had tunnel vision and everything went dark. I had a splitting pain in the the side of my face above my eye and I felt really sick. 'It was terrifying, I had no idea what was happening to me and I couldn't get my words out properly either. I wanted to shout out to Alex to come and help me, but I couldn't even remember his name. Luckily he heard me banging about in the cottage and came to see what was wrong. 'He helped me outside and got me to sit down, but I still felt really unwell.' When Sally started to feel better, she went down to the hospital where she was tested in the stroke unit as doctors thought she may have suffered a minor stroke. Today, weighing 10 st 10 lb, Sally says doing the shoot was the best thing to happen to her . She said: 'I was eventually given the all clear and I hadn't actually had a stroke. But it gave me such a fright. The doctors told me that my weight had probably caused it, so it was really worrying. It had been such a terrifying experience that I knew that I had to something about it. 'I felt that it was my fault, that I'd felt so unwell and it was only me who could do something about it.' So in January 2013, Sally, who is now single, joined her local Slimming World class. She swapped takeaways and chocolate bars for healthy breakfasts, salad lunches and homemade spaghetti bolognaise or cottage pie for dinner. 'It was a great diet as I could eat as much as I liked, but it was healthy food and not all the sugar and salt in takeaways.' The weight started to fall off Sally, and when she had lost several stone, she was chatting with a friend, who made a suggestion. 'My friend's daughter had just done a modelling photoshoot,' she said. 'And my friend said I should do one too, to celebrate having lost all the weight. She encourage me to do a shoot in my lingerie to really boost my confidence. 'I'd never even imagined doing such a photoshoot before, and it was something that was completely out of my comfort zone. But I gave it some thought and decided that it would give me something to work towards. 'So I booked the shoot, and carried on losing the weight and managed to hit my target weight of ten stone ten in March. The photoshoot was booked for June. 'I was nervous when I arrived at the Kensa Boudoir Photography studio but the photographer really put me at ease, and so did the make-up artist. 'When I was overweight I didn't even like dressing up to go out, so the thought of stripping down to my underwear and being photographed was something I would have never thought I would ever contemplate. 'But there I was stretched out in all my lingerie, and as the shoot went on, I felt more relaxed and less nervous. I was proud of my body after losing all the weight, but I still had loose skin and stretch marks too. But I was thrilled with the photos afterwards. I just looked at them and didn't even believe it was me at first! I never imagined I could ever look like that. 'When I showed the photos to family and friends they were amazed too. I've lost a total of 7 stone 9, going from 18 stone 7 to 10 stone 10. And I've dropped from a size 22 to a 10/12. I still can't believe it when I catch sight of my reflection in shop windows as I walk past - I have to do a double take as I don't realise its me. 'I feel much healthier too, and I haven't had another funny turn like I had that time in the garden. I've got much more energy for my job and playing with Luke too. If anyone had told me I would lose nearly eight stone and pose for a sexy photoshoot I wouldn't have believed them. But it's been the best thing to have happened to me.'","Size 22 Sally Stone suffered a suspected stroke because of her weight .

"An animal-loving grandmother died from a rare infection after she was licked on the hand by her pet dog. Sheena Kavanagh, 53, went into septic shock when her dog's saliva entered her bloodstream through a small cut and was rushed to Stafford Hospital. It is believed an affectionate lick from either of her Yorkshire Terriers or her Jack Russell proved fatal because her spleen – the organ which prevents bacterial infection – was removed in 1988, an inquest heard. Sheena Kavanagh, 53, pictured with one of her horses, went into septic shock after being licked by her dog . She became ill in April after finishing work at a care home where she was a chef. The mother-of-two was rushed to hospital where medics suspected she had bacterial meningitis but the results were not clear. She was prescribed antibiotics but her condition deteriorated and she died at about 9.30pm the following night after her organs shut down. The inquest at Cannock Coroner’s Court heard that death was so unexpected doctors were unable to pinpoint what had caused it at first. Due to its rarity, clinicians are now considering publishing a report on the case. Ms Kavanagh from Hilderstone, . Staffordshire, was unaware she was at risk from capnocytophaga . canimorsus – an organism present in dog saliva - after her spleen was . removed. The organism Capnocytophaga Canimorsus is typically found in the saliva of cats and dogs. It has the low ability to cause disease in healthy individuals but has been known to cause severe illness in people with pre-existing conditions. Its transmission can occur through bites, licks or even close proximity to animals. Symptoms usually appear within one to eight days of exposure, but mostly on the second day, and can range from flu-like symptoms to fulminent septicemia. Infection can usually be treated effectively with antibiotics and is recommended for a minimum of three weeks. The faster the infection is diagnosed the better the chance of survival, but death is rare. The operation was carried out she was assaulted by her then partner in 1988, although at the time she told doctors she had sustained the injuries in a car crash. She escaped the relationship three years later, and her former partner died in 2001. Her daughter Melissa Bromfield, 27, told the hearing her mother had been prescribed penicillin as is standard practice after a splenectomy until five years ago to reduce the risk of contracting the illness. She added that her mother, who also has a son, James, 23, had been taking the antibiotic twice a day right up until her death. Pathologist Dr Hiam Ali told the inquest, held yesterday, that the bacteria which proved fatal was discovered in a blood sample taken shortly after Ms Kavanagh arrival at hospital. Dr Ali said: ‘She had antibiotics [in hospital] which worked on the bacteria but unfortunately the damage was already done. ‘Her blood was full of bacteria and organisms. ‘Capnocytophaga canimorsus, an organism present in dog saliva, normally doesn't cause damage. ‘But in people without a spleen it can cause death due to septic shock. But it is extremely rare.’ Dr Ali added that a 'very small' cut had been found on her hand. She was rushed to Stafford Hospital but died the next night after her organs began shutting down . He added that he would have expected that the penicillin she regularly took would have protected her from the bacteria entering her bloodstream and was unsure why it had not. South Staffordshire Coroner Andrew Haigh recorded a narrative verdict that Ms Kavanagh died from 'splenectomy and dog saliva in bloodstream'. Speaking after the hearing, her daughter said: ‘It was a shock as she had been around dogs all her life. ‘She had two Yorkshire terriers, a long haired Jack Russell and six horses, she loved all animals. ‘She was brilliant, a devoted nan and my best friend rather than my mum. I saw her almost every day. ‘She loved her job and everyone misses her dearly. ‘There is a massive part of our family missing.’","Sheena Kavanagh, 53, went into septic shock after saliva got in bloodstream .

"A wrong turning gave a bus full of western journalists a glimpse of a different side to North Korea today. Most foreign visitors to Pyongyang on the Communist heartland never witness a pothole, a traffic jam or a piece of litter bigger than a cigarette butt. Those with physical disabilities are hidden from view as is graffiti. Buses catering for people outside of North Korea only ever take roads which are well-maintained and spotlessly clean which is why photographers couldn’t wait to start snapping away when a Government-run tour inadvertently veered from the official path. Towering: A large modern apartment block in Pyongyang, North Korea, which the regime is happy for foreigners to see . Hidden from view: Grim crumbling buildings inhabited by North Korean residents in the capital city mingle on the side of the street in Pyongyang . Instead of gleaming buildings such as the computer labs at Kim Il Sung University, filled with people whom the authorities insist are representative of the population, reporters saw crumbling apartment blocks and two men in wheelchairs waiting at a bus stop. Old people trudged along the sidewalk, some with handmade backpacks crafted from canvas bags. In place of the well-lit high-rise homes, there were shops shrouded in darkness and pavements lined in dirt rather than smooth tarmac. There were stores with no lights, and side roads so battered they were more dirt than pavement.'Perhaps this is an incorrect road?' mumbled one of the North Korean minders, well-dressed government officials who restrict reporters to meticulously staged presentations that inevitably center on praise for the three generations of Kim family who have ruled this country since 1948. Grim: A North Korean man pushes a wheelbarrow past a pile of coal in Pyongyang . Manual labour: North Korean men at work close to the water on an industrial site. The images depict a world that North Korean officials try and hide . The three buses quickly reversed away from the less wealthy area of the city and headed back towards the original intended target, a plush, marbled building called the Hana Music Information Centre where recently deceased leader Kim Jong II made one of his final public appearances before his death in December last year. CBS news reported that Ri Jinju, who was leading the tour, said: ‘I hope that the journalists present here report only the absolute truth. How life REALLY is: Poor North Koreans living in a run-down concrete residential compound in Pyongyang, North Korea . The North Korea they want you to see: University students swim inside a modern gleaming swimming pool complex at Kim Il-Sung University . Plush: North Koreans relax in a smart new jacuzzi at Kim Il-sung University - but the reality is very different to the life of most people . Modern: University students stand on a platform at the swimming pool before going down a slide . 'The truth about how much our people miss our comrade Kim Jong Il, and how strong the unity is between the people and leadership, who are vigorously carrying out the leaders' instructions to build a great, prosperous and powerful nation.’ So controlling is the regime that police will detain and potentially expel any foreigner who tries to explore further afield than the few hotels that they are permitted to stay in. According to Anthony Brunello, a professor at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, Florida, those in charge will go to huge lengths to create a system that will keep the Kim family in power. ""They've managed to create a process of control that works,"" he said. Gloom: A woman carries a baby on her back as she walks through an area of the North Korean city which resembles Soviet Russia . Real life for North Koreans: Two men stood by a concrete wall look up at a plane flying overhead yesterday. To many North Koreans these pictures likely depict a very middle class life as conditions in the countryside are far grimmer . Rundown highrise: A residential tower block seen in Pyongyang yesterday as a bus full of journalists took a wrong turn into an area that is normally hidden from them . What they want you to see: THousands of people gather for the unveiling of statues of the North Korean leaders, Kim Il Sung, and his son Kim Jong Il, during an unveiling ceremony in Pyongyang . Bizarre: Cartoon characters decorate the outside of the Dudan duck factory which employs 1,000 workers and produces 7,000 tons of duck products a year in Pyongyang . At Kim Il Sung University students young people in the swimming pool were seen enjoying the luxurious, well-finished surroundings that feature plastic slides and a jacuzzi. Journalists  normally see only the clean streets outside their bus windows, and the showcase buildings - the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum, the palace commemorating the Kims' 'juche' philosophy of self-reliance, the computer labs at Kim Il Sung University - filled with people that the minders insist are everyday North Koreans. The students in the classrooms don't glance up as dozens of reporters rumble in, and the professor's lecture continues without pause. The young people in the university pool careen down the plastic slide, in front of TV cameras, as if they are completely alone. Ri heaps high praise on her former leader. She says: ‘The more time passes by the more we miss our Dear Leader Kim Jong II. ‘I don't think we can ever find any person so great.’ Dilapidated old travel car: North Korean commuters pass by in a trolley car in Pyongyang - in a far cry from the modern image of the country the regime want to present . Salughterhouse: A North Korean woman cleans ducks on a processing line at the Dudan duck factory . It's not clear why the regime hides places like the dusty, potholed neighborhood, which is just a mile or so from the centre of town, across the trolley tracks and just off Tongil Street. It doesn't look like a war zone, or even like a particularly rough New York City neighborhood. Many streets in New Delhi, the capital of one of the world's fastest-growing economies, look far more battered and far poorer. To most North Koreans, one-quarter of whom depend on international food aid, living in homes without electricity or running water, the neighborhood would look upper-middle-class. Special permits are required to live in the capital city, and life here is vastly better than it is for most people in the countryside. There are predictable government jobs here, electricity at least a few hours a day, better-stocked stores, schools that have indoor bathrooms. But the officials still hide the run-down neighborhoods. There's a certain view of North Korea they want visitors to have. Urban living: A schoolgirl walks under a bridge in front of residential tower blocks. Although the accommodation wouldn't look out of place in a Western city like New York, the regime are not keen to show it off . Modern... or technology out of the 1970s? South Korea show off their scientific prowess ahead of their satellite launch - which flopped within seconds . According to defectors North Koreans have similar stresses to those living in capitalist societies. They get frustrated by politics in . their jobs, they aspire to buy their own cars and look forward to a . holiday at the beach. In times of difficulty such as the famine in the . 1990s, they dream of having enough food to prevent their children from . starving to death. Yet . the more rundown area the journalists were accidentally driven into . today would appear plush to many North Koreans who depend on . international food aid and live in homes without electricity or running . water. Special permits . are required to live in the capital city, and life there is considerably . easier than it is for the majority of people living in the countryside. There . are predictable government jobs in Pyongyang, electricity for at least a . few hours a day, better-stocked stores and schools that have indoor . bathrooms.

"Winston McKenzie said letting same sex couples to adopt was a 'violation' of children's human rights . A leading member of the UK Independence Party has likened allowing gay people to adopt to ‘child abuse’. Winston McKenzie, the party’s culture spokesman, said same sex couples should be banned from the adoption process, because it breached the human rights of children. It comes as UKIP defends itself in the row with Rotherham council, which removed three foster children from a couple because they were party members. Today it emerged the siblings have been separated from one another. The boy has been sent to live with one family, while his two sisters – a baby and an older girl – have gone to another home. The couple - who have already bought Christmas presents for the children - has now called on the leaders of Rotherham council to quit after they failed to apologise for what has happened. Mr McKenzie is the UKIP candidate in this week’s by-election in Croydon North. His remarks were condemned by campaigners and the party moved to distance itself from his comments. Mr McKenzie, a former boxer, said: ‘To say to a child, “I am having you adopted by two men who kiss regularly but don’t worry about it” – that is abuse. ‘It is a violation of a child’s human rights because that child has no opportunity to grow up under normal circumstances’ he told Metro. Mr McKenzie is a Christian and said gay adoption was against his religious beliefs. He added: ‘There are people out there who bring up their kids encouraging them to believe they are gay themselves.’ He also used the interview to attack celebrities who come out as gay ‘as a fashion’. David Coburn, UKIP’s London chairman who is gay, insisted Mr McKenzie’s views were not party policy. ‘We entirely, wholeheartedly support equal rights for couples regardless of their sexuality,’ he said. Ben Summerskill, of gay rights charity Stonewall, said: ‘These 19th-century views are not acceptable in the 21st century.' UKIP leader Nigel Farage has ruled out doing a deal with the Tories while David Cameron is still leader . The comments will be especially . embarrassing for UKIP as leader Nigel Farage seeks to prove it is a . mainstream party able to compete with the Tories. He . has this week attacked David Cameron over his 2006 claim that UKIP was . made up of  'fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists, mostly'. The two parties have come to blows repeatedly, after Tory vice chairman Micahel Frabricant suggested an electoral pact with UKIP, to stop the anti-EU party snatching votes from the Conservatives which could deprive Mr Cameron of a majority at the next election. Mr Farage rejected the idea, insisting 'it's war' with the Tories, but he left open the possibility that he could do a deal with a different Conservative leader. 'If Cameron went and somebody pragmatic, grown up and sensible like Michael Gove was leader, you might think then we could sit around the table and have a proper discussion... open-minded, doesn't throw abuse around and thinks issues through - he would be the right kind of person,' he said. Today UKIP treasurer Stuart Wheeler, a former Tory donor, claimed to have held secret lunches with eight Tory MPs about defecting. ‘I . have had lunch, secretly if you like, in a completely confidential way . with eight different Tory MPs,' he told the Daily Telegraph.

"Deceit: Rosie Dodd was jailed for two years for crying rape because she regretted having sex with three men at a drunken orgy . A woman who cried rape because she regretted having sex with three men at a drunken orgy has been jailed for two years for her ‘wicked’ lies. Rosie Dodd, 20, had been out drinking when she met the men, aged 25, 23, and 21, and started groping one of them on a bus on the way home. She had sex with them one after the other, but after telling a friend she felt ‘dirty’ she lied to police that she had been raped. The men, two of them students, then suffered a ‘nightmare’ involving intimate examinations and being locked up in cells. But after police became  concerned about inconsistencies in Dodd’s account, she admitted the encounters had been consensual. Last night she was put behind bars. On a social networking website, she has left displayed numerous photographs of herself with a string of men, apparently taken as trophies of her conquests. Jailing Dodd at Nottingham crown court, Judge John Milmo told her: ‘None of these three lads had seen the inside of a police station before. ‘They may well have been wrongly convicted if these charges had gone to trial. It was ten days before police managed to talk to you – and you admitted your allegations had been completely untrue. I am told, from your perspective, it was easier to tell lies rather than tell the truth. ‘I have no idea why you decided to make these wicked allegations.’ Dodd went out drinking in Nottingham city centre in June, downing eight vodkas and ending up in a casino. There she met one of her numerous ex-boyfriends and through him met the trio. She and the three men took a bus to a house in the Clifton area of the city, and  during the journey she began groping one of them. In the house she willingly had sex with all three. But afterwards she texted a friend saying that she felt ‘dirty’. With that in mind she claimed to police that all three of her partners had raped her. Deceit: Dodd met the three men on a night out in Nottingham but regretted bedding them all . Angry: Police have warned anybody who lies in the same way Dodd did will be found out . The men, who have not been named, were . arrested on suspicion of rape and spent a total of 50 hours in custody . before being released on bail. After further enquiries police grew . suspicious and, when challenged, Dodd admitted she had consensual sex . with the men and made up the claims because she felt regret at sleeping . with them. But police said Dodd, of Nottingham, who is listed as in a relationship on a social media site, showed no remorse. She was charged with perverting the course of justice and pleaded guilty at a previous hearing. The court heard that one of her . victims had recently graduated from university – but what should have . been a time for celebration became a ‘nightmare’. Another victim, who was  also a . student, said a medical investigation he was forced to go through was . ‘awful’, and told of his embarrassment at having to detail the . consensual sex he had had. One of the men said he feared his . plans to work with children in America would be wrecked by the episode, . although police claimed any trace of the investigation would be wiped . from their files. None of the men had any criminal record. Hearing: Rosie Dodd admitted she had made up the rape claims because she regretted having consensual sex with the trio, Nottingham Crown Court was told today . Detective Constable Gina Farrell, who . led the investigation, said: ‘We take every report of rape and sexual . assault extremely seriously. ‘But it soon became apparent that there were inconsistencies with Dodd’s account. ‘The three men accused of rape were . quite badly affected by the damaging accusations and Dodd has never . shown an ounce of remorse for what she put them through. ‘The time our specially-trained officers spent with her could have been spent with someone who really needed our help.’ Detective Inspector Stephen Waldram, . head of the city Rape Investigation Team, said: ‘I would remind anyone . considering making a false report to think again. ‘We carry out extremely thorough and in-depth investigations and their lies will be exposed.’","Rosie Dodd, 20, claimed men - aged 21, 23 and 25 - assaulted her at a home .

"North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un has today set foot on the slopes of the country's first ski resort... but he appears to have forgotten his skis. Kim took a test ride on one of the new lifts at Masik Pass Ski Resort but as he sat surveying the resort his legs dangled free. The leader was said to note 'with great satisfaction' that everything was 'impeccable' and gave instructions to serve people well to ensure visitors may 'keenly feel the loving care of the party', local media reported. Scroll down for video . A ski-less Kim Jong-Un surveys the snowy surroundings during his visit at the end of last year . Kim, who was educated in Switzerland, told officials to hold the opening ceremony at the resort at the earliest opportunity, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.

Kim was accompanied by top military leaders and, Pak Myong-Choi, a top sports official known to be associated with Kim's uncle who was executed this month. Jang Song-Thaek, Kim's powerful political mentor, was put to death in a shock purge on charges including corruption and plotting to overthrow the state. The purge was the biggest political upheaval since Kim, aged around 30, took power after the death of his father and longtime ruler, Kim Jong-Il, in December 2011.

He has called for the resort, which features 70 miles of runs, a hotel and helipad should be opened as soon as possible . The Masik Pass Ski Resort made headlines in August when Switzerland blocked a $7.6 million sale of ski lifts to Pyongyang, calling it a 'propaganda project' for the impoverished Stalinist regime. Featuring 110 kilometres (70 miles) of multi-level ski runs, a hotel, heliport and cable cars, the resort has been heavily promoted since Kim visited it in June and called for construction to be completed by the end of the year. The young leader has shown a fondness for expensive, high-profile leisure projects in and around the showpiece capital Pyongyang including a massive new water park, an amusement park and a luxury horseback riding club. The Munsu Water Park in Pyongyang opened in October to much fanfare, with the 109,000-square metre venue sporting dozens of indoor and outdoor pools, water slides and saunas. Kim in September also watched films at a new '4D' movie theatre built in the newly-renovated Rungna People's amusement park, state media reported earlier. He was photographed riding a roller coaster in the Rungna amusement park in Pyongyang when it reopened in July 2012 after renovations ordered by Kim.","Kim Jong-Un orders the nation's first resort be opened as soon as possible .

"There are lots of theories on how to beat jetlag, but a new app claims it can work out how travellers can adjust to new time zones faster. Researchers behind Entrain - in a study partly funded by the Air Force - say they have developed mathematical formulas that calculate light exposure. If it works, it means holidaymakers travelling long-haul will be able to use the free app to work out how much daylight they need and when to change their body clocks quicker. Scroll down for video... Beating jet lag: A new app helps passengers adjust to time zones faster . Humans have an . internal mechanism - the circadian rhythm or body clock - which . synchronises bodily functions to the 24-hour pattern of the Earth’s . rotation. The clock is regulated by the bodily senses - most . importantly the way the eye perceives light and dark. When . we work late, or travel to different time zones, the light our body . expects to see - based on how long we've been awake - for example, is . different, and this causes our body clock to fall out of sync. This causes the feeling of jet lag. Daniel Forger, University of Michigan math professor who led the research, said: 'If you get light in the wrong time or wrong way, it'll send you the wrong direction.' A master biological clock, called a circadian rhythm, regulates when we become sleepy and when we're more alert. When people travel across time zones, the body clock has to reset itself - with light exposure being its strongest regulator. The Michigan team used two equations proven to predict someone's circadian rhythm, and with computer modelling calculated different schedules of light exposure for more than 1,000 possible trips. It's possible to customise a block of . time each day when you should be in light, the brighter the better, and . another when you should avoid it, Forger's team reported in the journal . PLoS Computational Biology. For . example, flying from Detroit to London, which is five hours ahead, . arriving at 11am London time, it's generally thought that it would take a . day per time zone to fully adjust. Formula: . But the study suggests a three-day adjustment schedule. On the day after arrival, holidaymakers should make sure they get light exposure from 7.40am to 9pm; on day two from 6.20am to 7.40pm; and from 5am until 7.20pm on Day 3. Entrain, an iPhone app, does the calculations. And if travellers don't go outside or stay up later, it adjusts the advice. And holidaymakers can help with the research by submitting their data to a University of Michigan study. 'I think it makes sense,' said Dr Charles Bae of the Cleveland Clinic's sleep disorder centre. 'Anything you could do to optimise your adjustment is welcome, without medications.'","Researchers have calculated how light exposure affects body clocks .

"Psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos has written a guide book for young women on surviving their 20s . Being a twentysomething in today's high-pressure world isn't easy. Life in this decade is flooded with expectations about what woman should weigh, say, eat, earn... In her new book psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos, who is famous for her frank and practical advice, offers strategies that she says will empower young women to lead the life that they want while being happier and more confident. Here Dr Linda, 43, shares her top ten tips for surviving your twenties exclusively with FEMAIL. 1. TREAT SOCIAL NETWORKING POSTS LIKE A SCENE FROM  A REALITY SHOW . They are edited version of peoples’ lives and the editors are all trying to figure out what their audience wants and give it to them. We tend to go online to compare and what we are often comparing to is an exaggerated version of reality, so don't feel deflated when someone else’s life seems more exciting than yours. Remember, no one ever posts updates on the nights where they are sitting at home eating last night's leftovers. It's all about impressing each other and you can choose to opt out of that and realise that how we engage online can impact who we think we need to be offline as well. 2. STOP WITH THE FOMO* (*Fear Of Missing Out) The simple fact is that the more choice you have, the harder it is to choose. Ultimately, the only way around this is to make your choice and then actually engage with that choice rather than half-heartedly experiencing it and instead worrying about what else you could have been doing. Whatever the experience, it’s best if you are actually present when it’s happening. Sitting there worrying about what you’re missing out on means you’re actually missing out on everything. 3. REALISE YOU ARE MORE THAN YOUR PROFILE PICTURE . The idea that women are valued for their looks is nothing new, but the sheer number and ubiquity of glamourised perfected images we see around us makes it feel like it’s expected that a woman should be as close to physically perfect as possible. By all means enjoy your looks; experimenting with the way you look is a normal and important part of establishing your identity. But don't become defined by them and certainly don't buy into the notion that any of us can reach the levels of physical perfection that we are made to believe we need to aspire to today. 4. BE ADAPTABLE . It’s really important to be able to react to what is actually happening in your life rather than trying to force fit life into some pre-determined way of what it ought to look like. The truth is that sometimes things will happen that you don't expect, and no matter how organised you are or how much planning you have put into things you will be blind-sided by stuff that life throws at you. Because of this, adaptability, more than anything, is the trait that will get you not only through your 20s but through life. Scroll down for video . Understanding that social networking posts are often exaggerated is key to staying positive, says Dr Linda . 5. SPEND TIME WITH PEOPLE WHO AREN'T LIKE YOU . We live in a world where age stratification is increasingly common and means that we mostly spend time with people in the same age bracket as ourselves. And while it may feel that it’s only people your age that will really understand you, believe me the insights that you will get from hanging out with people that are older than you and that see things from a different perspective is such an important part of not only making sense of your past but also your future. People who have been here longer will challenge you to see things from a different angle so make time for your favourite aunt or grandma as she may have a perspective on things that might surprise you. 6. UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE PERFECT TO BE HAPPY . Like unicorns and effective cellulite creams, perfection is a mythical concept, it does not exist. You will make mistakes and you will feel like dropping out of things that you aren’t that good at, but the thing is, you can’t drop out of life so making peace with the idea that you can actually enjoy and learn from something, without having to be the best at it, is important. 7. TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF . Burn out is not a badge of honour. So while engaging in competitive sleep deprivation with your colleagues to prove that you can work harder than anyone else might be appealing, it will, eventually, catch up with you, and your health is something you should never take for granted at any age. Remember the basics: eat well, ditch the processed stuff and fad diets; sleep well (research shows that most of us really do need 7-8 hours to function optimally so make time for sleep); and get fit, exercise is a great stress buster as well as being good for your physical health so make it part of your self-care routine. 8. REMEMBER THAT BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP IS NOT THE BE ALL AND END ALL . Dr Linda's latest book is published on October 2 . Feeling like there is something wrong with you until you’re in one is frankly illogical. It is not a testament to your value as a human being! It might be that you are simply single at this stage of your life, so enjoy it, fill it up with experiences and learning and discovery and connections and ultimately you will meet someone that you like because of who they are not because you’re looking for a relationship. 9. SEEK OUT AMAZING ROLE MODELS . There are some amazing women out there doing amazing things, but you need to look for them. Women are often celebrated for their physical desirability rather than their accomplishments so we don't really hear about the business women, the scientists, the political activists changing the world. Be active in seeking out what inspires you, it will make a huge difference in how you see yourself and the world around you. 10. WRITE YOUR OWN SCRIPT . Adulthood means finding your identity, writing your script. As kids and teens, even in college, knowing who you are seems pretty straightforward. In your 20s things aren’t so simple. Don't be afraid of that; in fact, enjoy the freedom to write your script rather than having it thrust upon you. It’s up to you what you buy into, and what you reject. And while you might have to re-write a few scenes or even re-think a few plot-lines it’s YOUR life so confront it, direct it and embrace it. Success doesn’t happen in a day, and the work and struggle you need to put in to get there are not obstacles just the natural process of getting to a place that is worth being in.","Psychologist Dr Linda has released a guide book for young women .

"Canadian minor league baseball draws some fans from far, far away, it seems. Spectators at the Nat Bailey Stadium in Vancouver, Canada, were stunned to spot what appeared to be a UFO in the sky above the first game of the best-of-three North Division final between the Vancouver Canadians and Everett AquaSox. Nor was there any doubt as to which team the intergalactic groupies were cheering for - the Canadians scored four runs at the time of the sighting, sparking whispers of 'cosmic intervention' and the Twitter hashtag #luckyUFO. Scroll down for video . Unidentified: Did the flashing lights in the sky above the Nat Bailey Stadium herald visitors from another galax . The blue object, adorned with the requisite flashing lights, appeared over the right field fence at the start of the sixth inning. Even players on the Vancouver Canadians team were tweeting pictures of the flying disc as it hovered above their Scotiabank Field home. One Twitter user said he saw the supposed flying saucer moving up and down in the sky over the crowd of 1,796 baseball fans. The luck of the little green men clearly held out, as the Vancouver Canadians went on to win the match with a 5-1 score, despite a slow start to their play. However, a YouTube video of the surreal sighting produced some less than enthusiastic responses from UFO raters. Is it a bird...? Fans of the Vancouver Canadians and Everett AquaSox pointed in amazement at the sky above the minor league game . Boldly go: The metallic disc peeps out from behind a tree outside the stadium walls . Sport star: Spectators said the alleged UFO hovered up and down as play continued . Some apparently took genuine offence at the astronomical claims, with one user, who called themselves 'Saddam Hussein', writing: 'You guys are so gullible. Those EXACT colors are used on the majority of the RC air crafts available in stores. Even planes, real planes use those colors on each side of the wing.' The message continued: 'Wake up... I believe in UFO's, I truly do. But I'm not a f****** stupid, gullible, moronic person like the rest of you believing in everything.' Others mentioned that the camera was pointed towards the southwest, in the direction of Vancouver International Airport, and suggested a large passenger jet or freight aircraft might be the more likely identity of the ship. Yet another YouTube user, 'thenewaeon', floated the idea of 'a weather balloon filled with swamp gas', while 'BC stargazer' wrote: 'I'm sure there's a photoshop class near Main & Hastings.' #luckyufo: Vancouver Canadians scored four runs and won the match 5-1, sparking claims of 'cosmic intervention' 'Cmsahe', however, pointed out that as the true identity of the ship was still unconfirmed, the moniker UFO - 'Unidentified Flying Object' - could still apply. This is by no means the only stellar sighting to take place in the country in recent months. One survey in May this year suggested record numbers of Canadian UFO reports in 2012 - a staggering 1,981. The figure was almost double 2008's previous annual record of 1,004 sightings. In November 2011, a UFO was reportedly seen over an NFL game in St Louis, U.S.","Unidentified flying object appears over Nat Bailey Stadium in Vancouver .

"By . Fiona Keating . Good news for people who think they are Facebook fanatics. Unless you’re checking the social media site at least 14 times a day, you’re actually BELOW the national average. The results from a survey may confirm suspicions about how much smartphones have become an integral part of our lives. It seems that 79 per cent of smartphone users check for their devices within 15 minutes of waking up. Latest model: The HTC One can take four digital photos per second . A majority - 62 per cent - don't even wait 15 minutes, and grab their phones immediately. (Among 18-24 year olds, the numbers rise to 89 per cent and 74 per cent.) The research by IDC was sponsored by Facebook, which is the third most popular app on smartphones, after email and the browser. Around 70 per cent of smartphone users are frequent Facebook visitors, with more than half of them checking it every day. Peak Facebook time is during the evening, just before bed. On average, we visit the Facebook app or the site 13.8 times during the day, for two minutes and 22 seconds each time. The total daily average mobile time on the site via our smartphones is half an hour. Socially moble: Facebook is the third most popular app on smartphones, after email and the browser . That's roughly a fifth of all the time we spend communicating; it's only slightly less time than we spend texting. On weekends, we check Facebook more than we text. Almost half of Facebook users check on updates while out and about. The gym is one of the most popular places, with 48 per cent accessing the site. Some 46 per cent of us check it when we're shopping or running errands. And a surprisingly high number of us checking while preparing a meal – nearly half of all respondents - at 47 per cent. Movie etiquette has certainly changed since the advent of smartphones as 50 per cent of users say they have checked Facebook while at the movies. It seems that many people are using the social media site for useful purposes – around half browse news feeds, while the rest of the time is divided fairly evenly between Facebook messaging and posting updates. Half of Facebook users play games via the service on their phone a few times a day. Pinterest has practically caught up with Twitter, according to Pew Research, with 15 per cent and 16 per cent of adult US Internet users on each network, respectively. Pinterest, which launched in 2009, has experienced explosive growth, especially with a white, female and affluent user base. Women are five times more likely to use Pinterest (5 per cent vs. 25 per cent) and almost twice as likely to be white and college-educated. It’s become a magnet for hip urbanites searching for the hottest wedding gowns and apartment decor. Twitter, however, gets a lot more attention, with Middle Eastern activists using it to publicise the latest political news, without state censorship. In the United States 67 pe rcent of online adults say they use Facebook, 15 per cent of online adults say they use Pinterest, 13 per cent of online adults say they use Instagram, 6 percent of online adults say they use Tumblr, and 16 percent of online adults say they use.","The total daily average mobile time on the site via our smartphones is half an hour.

"One of my former neighbours in my home town of Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, was a widow whose son was a sailor in the merchant navy. He did not like to tell his mother when he would be coming home on leave because he was afraid she would worry if he was delayed on the way. But his mother always knew anyway — thanks to the family cat. This pet was very attached to this young man and, an hour or two before he arrived, it sat on the front door mat and began miaowing loudly as if equipped with some sixth sense which told it that he was on the way. Mystic mutt: Some animals seem to sense when their owners have had accidents or have died in distant places . The cat was never wrong and this early-warning system gave our neighbour time to get her son’s room ready and prepare him a meal in the certainty that he would turn up soon afterwards. This is just one of many examples of animals displaying the apparently psychic tendencies more normally associated with some of their human counterparts. Many cats seem to know, for example, when they are going to  the vet’s —  hiding away in the hope that their owners might get bored  of looking for them and give up on the idea. More dramatically, some animals seem to sense when their owners have had accidents or have died in distant places — as documented on my database of more than 5,000 case histories involving psychic phenomena in animals. This includes 177 cases of dogs apparently responding to the death or suffering of their absent masters or mistresses, mostly by howling, whining or whimpering, and 62 accounts of cats showing similar signs of distress. Conversely, in 32 instances people knew when their pet had died or was in dire need, even when they were many miles away at the time. As we will see, these paranormal powers are of potentially huge value to human beings in the prediction of natural disasters, such as earthquakes and tsunamis. And yet, as someone who has spent his entire adult life working as a biologist, holding senior academic posts both here and in the U.S.,  I am constantly surprised and frustrated by the refusal of my colleagues in the scientific world to take them seriously. In 50 per cent of dog-owning households and 30 per cent of those with cats, the animals were said to anticipate the arrival of a family member . Without acknowledging such phenomena, it’s difficult to see how we can fully understand the behaviour of not just cats and dogs, but wild animals such as wolves. The latter were studied by naturalist William Long who, in 1919, wrote a book that described the behaviour of a pack he had followed in Canada. He found separated members of wolf packs remained in contact with each other and responded to each other’s activities while many miles apart. On one occasion, a limping female became separated from the pack Long was tracking and lay recovering in a den while the rest of the wolves moved on. Days passed, then suddenly the female reappeared among the pack. The wolves’ responsiveness appeared to involve far more than simply following habitual paths, tracking scent trails, or hearing howling or other sounds, and Long wondered whether the same abilities might be found in pets. He described some simple experiments with a friend’s dog which showed a knack for predicting its master’s return home. The dog would go to stand at the door soon after its owner had started his journey from work. No one followed Long’s lead in researching this because, among scientists, the subject of telepathy has always been taboo. But in the Nineties I began asking friends and neighbours if they had ever noticed that their animals could anticipate when someone was coming home. I soon received dozens of reports, and by 2011 my database included more than 1,000 accounts of dogs and more than 600 of cats behaving in this way. In telephone surveys in Britain and the U.S., I found that in about 50  per cent of dog-owning households and about 30  per cent of those with cats, the animals were said to anticipate the arrival of a member of the family. And it was not just dogs and cats that were involved. More than 20 other species showed similar behaviour, especially parrots and horses, but also a ferret, several bottle-fed lambs raised as pets, and pet geese. Many cats seem to know, for example, when they are going to  the vet's - hiding away in the hope that their owners might get bored of looking for them . Many of those I spoke to made it clear that the animals’ responses were not simply reactions to the sounds of familiar cars or footsteps in the street. They happened too long in advance of the person’s arrival, and often even when they came home by bus or train. It wasn’t just routine. Some people were plumbers, lawyers and taxi drivers who worked irregular hours, but still their pets were ready to welcome them when they got home. Intrigued by this, I carried out experiments. The most extensive were with a terrier called Jaytee, who lived near Manchester with his owner Pam Smart. Initial observations showed that he was at the window on 85  per cent of the occasions when Pam returned home. I wanted to be sure that this was not down to Jaytee learning Pam’s routine, or picking up on other clues, so in a series of more formal tests, we arranged for Pam to be at least five miles away from home during each test. I then set up a camera to film Jaytee’s behaviour and each day selected a random time for Pam to return home, asking her to travel by taxi so as to avoid any cues which might have come from the engine noise of a familiar car. She did not know in advance when she would go home, but was informed when to do so by a pager. On average, Jaytee was at the window only 4  per cent of the time during the main period of Pam’s absence, and 55  per cent of the time when she was on the way back. I did similar experiments with other dogs, including a Rhodesian Ridgeback from Manchester called Kane. He looked out of the window, with his paws on a front table, when his owner came home — but whereas Jaytee’s vigil began shortly before his owner set off, Kane took up his post only when his mistress was already homeward bound.  Both these and the many other cases I have investigated suggest that these animals have some kind of telepathic bond with their owners. Alongside telepathy, animals also seem to have a sense of impending doom. Since classical times, people have reported unusual animal behaviour before earthquakes, and I have collected much modern evidence. In all these cases there were descriptions of wild and domesticated animals acting in fearful, anxious or unusual ways. Some possible explanations are that they pick up vibrations in the earth’s surface, or detect subterranean gases. The ability of animals to anticipate disasters have been ignored by Western scientists... but things are very different elsewhere . Or perhaps, as I am suggesting, animals rely on something which defies current scientific understanding. In the case of the Asian tsunami on December 26, 2004, they appeared to be aware that something was happening half an hour beforehand. According to villagers in Bang Koey, Thailand, a herd of buffalo were grazing by the beach when they suddenly lifted their heads and looked out to sea, ears standing upright. They turned and stampeded up the hill, followed by bewildered villagers, whose lives were thereby saved. Some animals anticipate other kinds of natural disaster such as avalanches, and even man-made catastrophes. During World War II, many families relied on their pets’ behaviour to warn them of air raids before official warnings were given. The animal reactions occurred when enemy planes were still hundreds of miles away, long before the animals could have heard them coming, and some dogs in London anticipated the explosion of German V-2 rockets, even though these missiles were supersonic and could not have been heard in advance. With very few exceptions, the ability of animals to anticipate disasters has been ignored by Western scientists, but things are very different elsewhere. Since the Seventies, in earthquake-prone areas of China, the authorities have encouraged people to report unusual animal behaviour. In several cases they have issued warnings that enabled cities to be evacuated hours before earthquakes struck, saving tens of thousands of lives. By paying attention to unusual animal behaviour, earthquake and tsunami warning systems might be feasible in parts of the world that are at risk from these disasters. Millions of people could be asked to take part in this project. They could be told what kinds of behaviour animals might show if a disaster were imminent. If people noticed such behaviour, they would telephone a hotline. A computer system would analyse the places of origin of the messages. If there was an unusually large number, it would signal an alarm, and display on a map the places from which the calls were coming. Exploring the potential for animal-based warning systems would cost relatively little. If it turns out that they are indeed reacting to subtle, physical changes, then seismologists should be able to use instruments to detect these and to make better predictions themselves. If, on the other hand, it turns out that what we call ‘presentiment’ plays a part, we should embrace it, regardless of whether or not we understand it. Ignoring it, or trying to explain it away, will leave us less protected against the unexpected ravages of nature.

"A couple have claimed that their three daughters were indoctrinated into a religious cult by their school teachers leaving them with suicidal thoughts and alienated from their loving family, according to a new lawsuit. The couple, from Avon, Connecticut, filed the civil lawsuit in federal court on Monday against the Avon school district, three teachers and a guidance counselor at Avon High School and Wellesley College in Massachusetts. The parents alleged that their older daughters, now aged 22 and 19, became 'reclusive, secretive and distant' after they began taking Spanish classes at Avon High. The named defendants are Connecticut residents Tanya Mastoloni (also known as Tanya Romero), Rebecca Kessler; Laura Sullivan and California resident Christopher Esposito. The parents have filed a lawsuit against teachers and a guidance counselor at Avon High School in Connecticut claiming their teenage daughters were indoctrinated into a cult . The parents are known only in the lawsuit as Jane and John Doe. Their girls began having 'fantasies of suicidal ideation and martyrdom', according to the suit. They also began to speak in a strange language and gathered at Wellesley College in Massachusetts to perform religious 'whirling dervish' dances throughout the night. The couple claimed that the teachers and counselor indoctrinated their daughters into a cult that promotes martyrdom and celebrates death. The couple said their daughters became secretive, lost their good humor and empathy and began speaking a bizarre language. The girls are also unable to think critically or independently, the lawsuit claimed. The parents noticed that their second daughter began to change in the same way as her older sister when she took classes with the same Spanish teacher, Tanya Mastoloni. The teachers, along with a guidance counselor, encouraged the girl to join her older sister at Wellesley so they could all meet up there. The indoctrination by the teachers reportedly continued when two of the girls went to Wellesley College. According to the 64-page lawsuit, the youngest daughter was also targeted to be indoctrinated into the same belief system, but she broke free. She has jointly filed the lawsuit with her parents. The two elder sisters have had no contact with their family since last July along with their extended family and friends at the urging of the group of teachers, it is claimed. According to the suit, they reported their parents as abusive to be allowed to remain at Wellesley College over the summer vacation. The teachers, in particular Mastoloni, preyed on students who lacked social skills and were shy, the parents claimed. The Does' lawsuit said that the defendants pose a serious threat to the community and the public because of the influence they have over impressionable students. In the lawsuit, the parents claimed that their eldest daughter, identified only as E.D., is an extremely gifted young woman but socially awkward, preferring to spend time with adults than with people her own age. She was bullied in elementary and middle schools, which made starting high school a stressful experience for her. The parents noted that their daughter is fluent in Spanish, having studied it from fifth grade and having a flair for languages. This caught the eye of the group of teachers, who were known as the 'Tri-State' at Avon High - because one was from New York, the other from New Jersey and the third from Connecticut. The parents claimed that the three women, along with Esposito, acted like a clique, favoring certain students over others. The lawsuit claimed that they socialized with students and shared inappropriate stories about boyfriends. Mastoloni would also pry about students' personal lives and offer to interpret their dreams. Defendant Mastoloni veered from the Spanish curriculum and taught her students about spirituality, numerology, astrology, dreams and angels in her classes, the lawsuit claimed. She asked students to write essays about what they believed happened to them when they died - but because the writing was in Spanish, people outside the class were unaware of the inappropriate subject matter. According to the suit, Mastoloni told her class about her abusive upbringing, including stories of an alleged kidnapping and rape by her stepfather. The parents' lawsuit alleges that the girls were up all night performing 'whirling dervish' dances at Wellesley College, following their personality changes . The teacher also alienated the oldest . girl from the boyfriend she had in her sophomore year of high school, . the lawsuit said, claiming he was not a 'man'. The couple broke up after . a year. During her . final year when she had turned 18, the friendship became more intense, . it is alleged. Mastoloni asked a lot of questions about ED's family and . wanted to come round for dinner. Esposito, it is claimed, once asked ED . about the sexual orientation of her sisters. When ED went off to study at Wellesley, the teacher allegedly began visiting her former pupil. The parents' lawsuit claimed that their daughter developed an obsessive friendship towards her roommate, named as Naureen in documents, who eventually had to move out of their shared room and seek counseling. The lawsuit claimed that during her first year at university, ED and other girls would go to Alumni Hall on campus and would 'dance, sing and perform ''whirling dervishes'' - religious dances - until the wee hours of the morning'. The parents claim that their daughter's new personality was 'the direct result of the religious indoctrination she had been subjected to by Defendants Mastoloni, Kessler, Esposito, and Sullivan'. The couple alleged that their daughter switched her major due to Mastoloni's influence, moving from an interest in political science or international relations to philosophy. She also told her parents she wanted to do a masters in Divinity, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit stated: 'E.D. was constantly talking about ''seeking the truth'' and pursuing a ''greater purpose''.' During the Thanksgiving holiday of her sophomore year, the couple claimed that their daughter had clear signs of an altered personality - acting flat and humorless, giving people strange looks and keeping her distance from family members. When E.D.'s sister, who is identified as L.D. in the lawsuit, began taking Mastoloni's Spanish class in her senior year of high school, the parents claim that she underwent a personality change. The parents claim that the two sisters began to compete for the teacher's affections. The parents alleged that the teachers and guidance counselor persuaded L.D. to attend the same college as her sister despite the fact she was previously reluctant. The lawsuit claims: 'When E.D. and L.D. both came home for Christmas break in 2012, they were closer to each other than they had previously been, and they began isolating the rest of the family.' Over several months, this behavior intensified the lawsuit said. The sisters would engage in no conversation other than about their teacher, would spend hours on their laptops and would disappear for hours on 'walks'. When the siblings' youngest sister joined Mastoloni's Spanish class, she experienced the same discussions as her sisters about 'synchronicity', 'signs', the truth, angels and death, the lawsuit claimed. The parents claimed that Mastoloni took a special interest in their third daughter. The lawsuit stated: 'Defendant Mastoloni had already converted the two older Doe sisters, and now she was looking to add the third sister to her coven.' The couple claim that the teacher tried to break her daughter down psychologically, giving her into trouble over grades in front of classmates and leaving her in tears. The two elder sisters allegedly asked their sister to come to Wellesley during her spring vacation, at Mastoloni's insistence. After staying a week with their sisters, the parents said in the suit that their youngest daughter returned home 'cold, flat and serious'. She spent as little time with her parents as possible. Having experienced such drastic changes in their elder daughters' behavior, the mother said she was able to break through to her younger daughter with crying, pleading and talking. The lawsuit stated that the mother saw her daughter 'experience a sudden psychological release... she began crying uncontrollably'. It was then revealed that while at Wellesley, the youngest sister had been in the constant control of her eldest, who was acting at the behest of Mastoloni, the lawsuit claimed. E.D. told her youngest sister that her relationships with her mother was poisonous and that she did not need her parents. During this time, the youngest sister said E.D. spent long periods of time on the phone to Mastoloni. In the summer of 2013, the parents believe that the four defendants - Mastoloni, Kessler, Esposito and Sullivan - 'hatched a plan' to have the sisters move out of their family home for good. The four made up a story about the girls being abused by their parents in order to obtain housing for the girls at Wellesley, the lawsuit said. The parents also claimed in the lawsuit that the four defendants are providing their daughters with money. Avon . and Wellesley officials said that they're looking into the allegations. MailOnline was awaiting a response from the school superintendent on . Friday. He said in a previous statement: 'The district administration is in receipt of the complaint filed recently in federal court and is reviewing it at this time. No communications regarding that which is alleged in the complaint have been received in the past. 'We will continue to review the content of the complaint and have turned the matter over to our school district legal counsel.' It is unclear . today whether the defendants are still teaching at Avon High School but the . school's website lists the three female teachers in a current staff . directory. Christopher Esposito was a Spanish teacher at Avon High School until 2011. Attempts to reach the defendants were unsuccessful on Friday.","The parents, who are not identified, are suing three teachers and a guidance counselor along with Avon High School and Wellesley College as they claim their daughters were indoctrinated .

"The daughter of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has come under fire for an article in which she branded the poor city of Flint, Michigan 'apocalyptic' - and used a photo of Israel as proof. Laura Dimon, 26, from New York, penned the piece for PolicyMic and detailed the town's crime and unemployment stats, sweeping over the number of residents her father's bank foreclosed on. 'Flint now drowns in the hell that has become much of America's Rust Belt,' Dimon wrote of Flint, which was the birthplace of General Motors. But after the article - 'This is America's Most Apocalyptic, Violent City - And You've Probably Never Heard Of It' - was published, it emerged that some of the photos of Flint were actually of other places. Under fire: Laura Dimon, the daughter of beleaguered JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon, has written an article about Flint, Michigan that has sparked anger for its focus and inaccuracies . A Reddit thread hitting back at the article first pointed out that the pictures were not all accurate. 'I thought I was hallucinating at first, but this picture is not actually from Flint,' one user wrote, the Raw Story reported. 'I know this because I lived in the place pictured almost my entire life. 'It's a city in Israel called Ramla. I'm really confused as to why this picture is featured in the article and I'm a little creeped out.' A Google street map view shows that the photograph in the article matches the street in Ramla. Another photograph that actually pictured Detroit was also removed amid the backlash. As Dimon was criticized, she admitted that she has never been to Flint. Oops: The article initially featured an image of Ramle in central Israel but it has since been removed . Spotted: A Google map street view shows the same road in Ramle that featured in the article . After the photos were taken down, the website added an explanation that the article had also been re-headlined to: 'This is one of America's most violent cities - and it deserves more attention'. 'We believe the correction better befits the intent of our writer,' the editors wrote, 'and we continue to stand by the story.' Deadline Detroit noted that PolicyMic is similar to websites like Buzzfeed that use a 'a behavioral analyst' to generate viral headlines before assigning them to a writer to produce a matching story. 'That cart-before-horse reversal - ""do a clip job on Flint as America's most apocalyptic, violent city"" - is not how things typically work at new media or those with print roots,' writer Alan Stamm wrote. 'But while traditional editorial practices may point the way to an ethical high road, they're not necessarily the route to a high-traffic path in journalism's reshaped landscape.' Corrections: The editors also changed the name of the article - after realizing Flint was in fact a well known place . Redditors also attacked Dimon's assumption that Flint - the home of General Motors and a feature of documentaries by Michael Moore, who grew up there - was unknown. And after being slammed for her article, Dimon gave a surprising reaction on her Twitter account. 'Flint . Fights Back piece is in serious consideration,' she wrote. 'Wow, what a vocal and . proud city. Pride well-earned. Thanks to all for the responses.' It is not the first time Dimon, a Barnard and Columbia graduate, has come under fire this month - after she, her siblings and parents sent out a Christmas card featuring them hitting tennis balls around their luxurious home. Spin: After the backlash from readers online, Dimon said she was impressed with the 'vocal and proud city' Troubled: She is the daughter of Jamie Dimon, the millionaire chairman and CEO of JP Morgan Chase . Jamie Dimon, 57, was branded 'tone deaf' after sending the decadent card to employees at JPMorgan. Critics said that the card was tasteless in a time of economic hardship as Dimon earns $18.7m a year, making him one of the best compensated bosses in America. MSNBC host Chris Hayes said it was as if . the Dimon family were saying: ‘Hey, we’re so rich we can destroy our . own stuff’, whilst The Atlantic magazine said it was ‘braggy and . opulent’. In October JPMorgan agreed a $13billion deal with the US government to end investigations into its selling of mortgage investments in the 2008 financial crisis.","Laura Dimon, 26, has been criticized for article in which she calls Flint - the birthplace of General Motors - unknown .

"Education Secretary Michael Gove yesterday faced a growing backlash over plans to drop US literary classics from new English Literature GCSEs. To Kill A Mockingbird and Of Mice And Men are among the American novels being ditched by an exam board as well as Arthur Miller’s play, The Crucible, amid government reforms. The OCR exam board said the decision was due to Mr Gove’s desire for the exam to be ‘more focused on tradition’ as well as fewer opportunities to include such texts on the new British dominated syllabus. However, the decision has sparked a storm of protest, with complaints trending on Twitter and thousands of people signing online petitions to keep American classics on GCSE syllabuses. Anger: Education Secretary Michael Gove yesterday faced a growing backlash over plans to drop US literary classics, such as To Kill A Mocking Bird from new English Literature GCSEs . Authors, academics and booksellers have condemned the shake-up, with some describing it as ‘backward-looking’ and a traditionalist attempt to reinstate the idea of a ‘canon’ of English literature. The Department for Education has insisted that its document about content for the subject, published in December, ‘doesn’t ban any authors, books or genres’. The new GCSE course will include at least one play by Shakespeare, at least one nineteenth century novel, a selection of poetry since 1789 including representative Romantic poetry and ‘fiction or drama from the British Isles from 1914 onwards’. Exam boards can add extra books, but experts have pointed out that the rules leave very left little room for 20th century writing outside Britain. Of Mice And Men, the classic novel by John Steinbeck, has also been dropped . Referring to new specifications, Paul Dodd, OCR’s head of GCSE and A-level reform, said in an interview: ‘Of Mice and Men, which Michael Gove really dislikes, will not be included. ‘It was studied by 90 per cent of teenagers taking English literature GCSE in the past. Michael Gove said that was a really disappointing statistic.’ Speaking yesterday, Mr Dodd said the Department for Education ‘restrictions’ mean there is ‘no room for texts such as Of Mice and Men or To Kill a Mocking Bird’ any more. He added: ‘The essential thing is that in the new GCSE English Literature you cannot do fiction or drama from 1914 unless it is British.’ A series of online petitions have been launched in protest. One, signed by 2,567 people already, states that: ‘Modern texts from outside the UK are equally, if not more, important as British texts.’ Children’s Laureate, Malorie Blackman, retweeted a newspaper story on the controversy, saying: ‘Surely diversity in the curriculum is vital to encourage more extended reading and to expand our teens’ minds?’ She said her 18-year-old daughter had described To Kill A Mockingbird as a book that ‘kids should be reading’. In a blog, children’s author, Alan Gibbons, said that To Kill a Mockingbird’s themes of racism, prejudice and difference are ‘highly relevant’ to today’s children. He added: ‘There should be a balance of pre-20th century texts and more modern ones and this balance should reflect the breadth of writing in English, with US, Canadian, African, Indian and other writers present.’ Another author, Marcus Sedgwick, who has been nominated for the prestigious Carnegie Medal for children’s literature, also attacked the move. Referring to Mr Gove, he told teenagers on Twitter to ‘march up to your parents right now, show them this (story) and demand they vote this man out of office’. Meanwhile Waterstones in Braehead, Glasgow tweeted: ‘Don’t be alarmed if we put your copy of To Kill A Mockingbird in a brown bag today. We hear Michael Gove might be doing spot checks.’ It said that copies of The Crucible had been relocated to its ‘irony’ section. Bethan Marshall, a senior lecturer in English at King’s College, London, and chairwoman of the National Association for the Teaching of English, described the new syllabus as being ‘out of the 1940s’. She said: ‘Kids will be put off doing A-level literature by this.’ A DfE spokesman said: ‘In the past, English Literature GCSEs were not rigorous enough and their content was often far too narrow.’ A spokesman for Edexcel said it was still finalising its English Literature GCSE specification and would publish it later this week.","Furious backlash to plans to ditch American masterpieces from classrooms .

"A 20-year-old man was arrested Friday night in connection with the murder of a 99-year-old woman in upstate New York. Javon Tyrek Rogers was arrested by and charged in connection with the Wednesday death of Fannie Gumbinger in her Poughkeepsie, NY home. Rogers was charged with first-degree murder and first-degree burglary, according to a Poughkeepsie Police Department press release. Rogers is also considered a suspect in multiple burglaries nearby. Officials have not released details surrounding Gumbinger’s murder other than to say she died of multiple injuries. Almost a century old: Fannie Gumbinger, 99, was allegedly murdered by 20-year-old Javon Tyrek Rogers, according to police . ‘She was sharp as a tack,’ niece Jacqueline Solomon told WABC, adding that her aunt was ‘upbeat, opinionated and loved having lunch with her friends.’ Gumbinger was found dead Wednesday afternoon by her home health aide, according to the Daily Freeman. ‘I can’t imagine why people would have gone into that house, other than the fact that she was a defenseless old lady,’ Solomon told WABC, adding ‘she had a little jar on her table and in it she would have some 50 dollars, and some 20s, that’d be the most that she would have in the house.’ Investigators spent the past couple of days combing Gumbinger’s house for evidence and expected to be finished sometime Saturday, an official told the Poughkeepsie Journal. MailOnline was unable to reach a police spokesperson for further comment. Accused killer: Javon Tyrek Rogers was arraigned Saturday and charged with burglary and first-degree murder in the death of 99-year-old Fannie Gumbinger . Crime scene: Fannie Gumbinger's home has been roped off by police investigating her death . Authorities investigating a string of burglaries in the surrounding neighborhood also have reason to believe Rogers may be linked, according to the Journal. One of the burglaries even took place a few hours after Gumbinger's death only blocks from her home, according to YNN. ‘We can’t say that it is positively connected, but we cannot say that it isn’t,’ police spokesperson Edward Freer told WABC. Gumbinger‘s husband died in 2007, according to the Freeman. She had also outlived most of her siblings and friends, according to WABC. Her only health ailments were a bad leg and hip, the station added. It is not clear if Rogers has a prior criminal history, a search of court documents did not yield any results. The accused was arraigned and is currently being held without bail in Dutchess County Jail.","Javon Tyvek Rogers, 20, has been charged with first-degree murder and first-degree burglary .

"Question time: Fiona Woolf will be quizzed by members of the Home Affairs Select Committee . The controversial chairman of the Government’s historic child abuse inquiry will be finally forced to admit her links to a key figure in the alleged Establishment cover-up this week. For six weeks, Fiona Woolf has refused to reveal how well she knows Leon Brittan – accused of failing to act on a dossier about VIP paedophile rings – and whether or not she declared their friendship before she accepted her high-profile role. It is thought the Home Office was unaware that she has lived in the same street as the former Home Secretary for a decade, was on a City conference board with him, and was a magistrate at the same court as his wife Diana for three years – until it was revealed by The Mail on Sunday. Corporate lawyer Mrs Woolf has spent much of the past two months overseas in her role as Lord Mayor of London, missing the first meeting of the abuse inquiry panel and attracting criticism in Parliament. But she will finally have to answer the concerns about her potential conflicts of interest when she appears before a powerful group of MPs on Tuesday. Sources confirmed that the members of the Home Affairs Select Committee  will ask her about her links to the Brittans and if they were declared in advance of her appointment on September 5. She is also likely to be quizzed about the delay in starting work on the inquiry, caused by her heavy workload in the role as the ceremonial head of the City of London. The terms of reference – likely to include the possible involvement of former MPs in child abuse at institutions including care homes and schools – have not even been set but an interim report is due before the General Election in May. Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP who has helped expose high-profile child abusers including Cyril Smith, said last night: ‘I’m very pleased that she is coming before the Home Affairs Select Committee. But it’s unfortunate this information is having to be dragged out of her, rather than her giving a statement.’ How the Mail on Sunday broke story about Fiona Woolf's links to former Home Secretary Leon Brittan . He added: ‘I am disappointed the inquiry still hasn’t got under way properly. There is a historic dimension to this – every week counts.’ Meanwhile, two reviews into the Home Office’s handling of paedophilia in previous decades are being read by Theresa May. She commissioned NSPCC chief Peter Wanless and barrister Richard Whittam to look into allegations that the Home Office funded the notorious Paedophile Information Ex-change in the 1970s, and lost dozens of crucial files – including the ‘Dickens dossier’, said to name public figures involved in child sex, which was handed to Lord Brittan in 1983.","Committee of MPs will ask about her links to the former Home Secretary .

"A leading Conservative has warned that council taxpayers face rising costs from the influx of Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants set to start tomorrow - and claims that Roma are already causing trouble by begging aggressively and defecating in public. Philippa Roe, leader of Westminster City Council, said that local authorities had 'no idea' how many Eastern Europeans would come to Britain after immigration restrictions are lifted on January 1. And a police commissioner in the Midlands revealed that more crimes are committed by Romanians than by any other group of foreign nationals in his area even before the rules have changed. Many Tories and immigration campaigners have been warning for month that tens of thousands of Romanian and Bulgarian citizens are set to come to Britain when laws banning them from are repealed tomorrow. Trouble: Roma being moved on by police at Marble Arch ahead of restrictions being lifted on Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants . Ms Roe said today that some members of the Roma community have already been causing trouble in Central London with their aggressive and unhygienic behaviour. 'You've only got to wander around Marble Arch at 7.30 in the morning to see the camps,' she told The World at One on BBC Radio 4. 'We have people walking out of their front door to find people sleeping on their front doorsteps, people defecating on their front doorstep - it's extremely unpleasant and it goes with the very aggressive begging and pickpocketing and other sorts of crime in the area which affects both residents and tourists. 'It's this minority one is really concerned about, but it is this minority that has this really big impact.' She added: 'We have been trying hard to make sure we are prepared but one of the issues we face is we just have no idea how many people are going to come to London and draw on our resources.' Warning: A council leader has said that even before the expected immigration influx there have been problems with Roma sleeping rough and behaving in anti-social ways . The Romanian government has appointed a new consul to an eighth British city ahead of an expected influx of immigrants from the Eastern European country. Razvan Constantinescu became honorary consul officer to Bristol this month, shortly before the UK planned to open its borders to Romanians on January 1. The country already has representatives in Belfast, Cardiff, Inverness, Leeds, Liverpool, Morpeth and Southampton, as well as the ambassador based in London. Mr Contantinescu, who works at Bristol City Council fighting human trafficking, says he is keen to establish direct flights from Bristol to Romania as well as boosting business links. He insisted that fewer of his countrymen would migrate to the UK than is often predicted, pointing out that thousands are already here. 'Most of the Romanians who wanted to come over to Britain to set up in business, to explore working opportunities, have already done so,' Mr Contantinescu said. Shortly before Christmas, the Government rushed through new rules to ban immigrants from receiving unemployment benefits for their first three months in the country. However, Ms Roe called for this limit to be extended even further, saying: 'I would much rather it had been a year, if not two years.' Staffordshire's Police and Crime Commissioner said that Romanian criminals were more prolific than those from any other foreign country and expressed fears that the problem would only get worse. Matthew Ellis said that he was seeking talks with Home Secretary Theresa May in a bid to mitigate the impact of a large number of poor immigrants arriving at the same time. It is understood that 981 Romanians were arrested in Staffordshire between April 2010 and September 2013, followed by 967 Polish nationals and 636 Lithuanians. In total, 7.5 per cent of all arrests in the county involved foreign nationals. 'I am currently talking to the chief . constable about the new changes,' Mr Ellis said today. 'This is an area . where Stoke-on-Trent is seeing a significant rise in the number of . people who are not only being placed there by the state as asylum . seekers but also foreign nationals moving there. 'It's clear that their cultures are slightly different and their expectations are slightly different.' Concerns: Philippa Roe of Wesminster City Council says she does not know how many new immigrants to expect . MigrationWatch UK, which campaigns against unrestricted immigration, has claimed that Britain will be the most lucrative destination in the EU for new immigrants despite the new rules on benefits. 'Britain's generous benefits system acts as a pull factor for migrants from across Europe,' said chairman Sir Andrew Green. 'There must now be a renegotiation of the benefit system in the EU which was designed before 100million people in much poorer countries joined the EU. But business leaders have welcomed the impending arrival of Bulgarians and Romanians, saying it will help boost the workforce and strengthen the economy. The London Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that 55 per cent of its members believe immigration has had a positive impact on the capital. The UK imposed seven-year restrictions on Romania and Bulgaria after they joined the EU in 2007 - only allowing citizens a visa if they were self-employed, had a job offer, or were given a specialist role.","Philippa Roe of Westminster City Council says council taxpayers will face rising bills from Bulgarian and Romanian immigration .

"A father whose eye-popping act became a YouTube sensation failed to set a new world record - because his eyes came out too far. John Doyle, 30, became an instant online hit when he first started posting videos of his stunt two years ago. One, set to Daft Punk's Get Lucky, reached 500,000 views within days. He has since been flown everywhere from America to Japan to display his talent on TV. Scroll down for video . Denied: John Doyle from Rainhill, Liverpool, was refused the title after being measured last night . The optometrists visiting him at Vincent Hotel in Southport didn't bring long-enough equipment . When the moment came to officiate his talent last night, the two professional optometrists brought the longest equipment they could - but it was not enough. Only manned with a 12mm-long piece of apparatus, they were forced to deny him the title. It is believed Mr Doyle, from Rainhill in Liverpool, hit 14mm. Lamenting the blunder at the city's Vincent Hotel with his mum Jane, wife Becci, and two-year-old daughter Ruth, Mr Doyle - known as Mr Zoom - said he is determined to keep going: . 'I started doing it just for fun, but then people said I could get something out of this. 'I’m disappointed not to have taken the record tonight, but it’s encouraging that it was off the scale. I’ll try again.' It is the second blow for the newly-wed internet marketing worker, who believes he unofficially made history in Japan. The father-of-one is determined to keep trying. He has trained for two years and performed worldwide . He said: 'Guinness World Records have quite strict criteria so it is tough to meet their standards. 'While in Japan, I believe I beat the world record for how far eyes can come out but due to the language barrier it was hard to get it recorded accurately.' The father-of-one, who works in internet marketing, said the skill came to him about two years ago in the Coach and Horses pub near his home.

"A decomposing body believed to be that of the prime suspect in the murder of teenager Alice Gross was found yesterday less than two miles from where she was discovered – raising fresh questions about the police investigation into her disappearance. Officers discovered the corpse, thought to be that of Latvian builder Arnis Zalkalns, in a West London park they had searched a week ago while looking for the schoolgirl. Zalkalns disappeared a month ago. A source revealed last night that the body was in an advanced state of decomposition when it was found in dense woodland. It was also reported that the body had been found hanged. Scroll down for video . Police hunting Arnis Zalkalns (left), the prime suspect in the murder of schoolgirl Alice Gross (right), have found a body in Boston Manor Park in Brentford, west London - just miles from where Alice's body was discovered . The body was in an advanced state of decomposition when it was found in dense woodland in the London park . The discovery raises the prospect that the bodies of both the 41-year-old and his 14-year-old alleged victim had remained undiscovered for several weeks in the very area where the Metropolitan . Police had been carrying out its biggest search operation since the 7/7 terrorist attacks on London. A local resident confirmed last night that police had searched Boston Manor Park a week earlier. She suggested Zalkalns could have been living there with Eastern Europeans who use it as a makeshift campsite. The woman, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘When I spoke to one of the policemen, he said they were looking for evidence in connection with Alice. 'I asked him whether they had looked into the campsite which is in the dense wooded area because I’ve seen a lot of Eastern European people camping out there. ‘I think [Zalkalns] could have been living rough there. If the police had searched that area sooner they might have found him alive.’ Police deployed officers and a forensics team to Boston Manor Park following the discovery of a man's body . It can also be revealed that officers had not informed Zalkalns’s girlfriend by the time news of the body’s discovery was announced on Saturday afternoon. Told by The Mail on Sunday that the search team had found a man, Zalkalns’s partner Katerina Laiblova asked: ‘Has he been found in a good way or a bad way?’ On learning that the man found was dead, Czech-born Ms Laiblova said: ‘I hope he is innocent. I wish I could get drunk or be distressed but I can’t because I have Linda [their one-year-old daughter] to look after. He was a very good father.’ Although the body was discovered at 2pm yesterday, it will not be recovered until today because police need ‘specialist resources’. Alice vanished on August 28 after leaving her family home in Hanwell at lunchtime and telling her mother she would be back that evening. Scotland Yard confirmed the body of a man had been found in 'dense woodland' in the park this afternoon . Over the following days, her family made emotional appeals for her to return. A week after her disappearance the police investigation was taken over by a homicide team, and in the following days her rucksack was found, containing her shoes. Zalkalns, who lived with his girlfriend and their baby in Ealing, was reported missing on September 4. It was only on September 16, three weeks after the schoolgirl’s disappearance, that police announced they were searching for the labourer in relation to the case. Analysis of CCTV images showed Zalkalns cycling just 15 minutes behind Alice on the day that she went missing. Detectives also discovered that Zalkalns murdered his first wife Rudite in Latvia in 1997, for which he served seven years, and was arrested for indecently assaulting a teenage girl after arriving in Britain a decade later. Zalkalns, 41, has not been seen since September 3 - a week after 14-year-old Alice disappeared on August 28 . David Cameron has said he will examine 'all the circumstances of the case' surrounding Alice's murder . Last Tuesday officers discovered Alice’s body on a stretch of the River Brent that had previously been searched, and yards from where her belongings were discovered four weeks earlier. A post mortem has proved inconclusive, possibly because of the delay in finding the body, and further tests are being carried out to establish the cause of death. Yesterday Boston Manor Park was sealed off while teams in forensics suits looked for evidence. The developments came after David Cameron pledged to personally examine how Zalkalns managed to gain entry into Britain in 2007.","Arnis Zalkalns is the prime suspect in the murder of 14-year-old Alice Gross .

"It was multimillionaire Mitt Romney’s attempt to portray himself as an ordinary guy to Americans, with tales of living a slumdog’s life in France. But a different picture emerged today of the GOP presidential candidate’s life while serving as a Mormon missionary abroad in the 1960s. Mr Romney reportedly spent most of 1968 at a Parisian ‘palace for rich people’, which was staffed by a Spanish chef and a houseboy. Team: Mr Romney, left, stands with fellow Mormon missionaries in this photo in front of the police station in Limoges, central France, in 1968 . ‘It was a house built by and for rich people,’ Richard Anderson, 70, Kaysville, Utah, told the Daily Telegraph. ‘I would describe it as a palace.’ Mr Anderson is the son of the Mormon mission president when the former Massachusetts governor stayed during his missionary placement abroad. The revelations come after last week Mr Romney recalled spending two and half years knocking on doors and defecating into a bucket. Jean Caussé, 72, met Mr Romney in Bordeaux and told the Daily Telegraph he ‘never knew’ missionaries who ever did such a thing. Toilet experience: Mitt Romney had claimed he defecated into a bucket while serving as a Mormon missionary in France in the 1960s . ‘A number of the apartments I lived in when I was there didn’t have toilets,’ Mr Romney said in Hudson, New Hampshire, reported the New York Times. 'It was a house built by and for rich people. I would describe it as a palace' Richard Anderson . ‘We had instead the little pads on the ground. OK, you know how that works. There was a chain behind you. It was kind of a bucket affair.’ Mr Anderson claimed Mr Romney’s aides had told him not to speak out about their time together, reported the Daily Telegraph. The 19th century neoclassical building they stayed in featured chandeliers, stained glass windows and impressive art across the walls. Mormon faith: Mitt Romney, pictured on Monday at the Madison Lumber Mill in New Hampshire, spent two and half years in France as a missionary .

"An injured explorer is in hospital after nearly two weeks trapped a kilometre beneath the mountains of Bavaria. A multinational rescue operation pulled Johann Westhauser from the Riesending caves, which sink deep into the Alps near the Austrian border, just before noon. Mr Westhauser had been trapped after he suffered serious head injuries in a rock fall on June 8, leading to a rescue operation involving more than 200 cave rescue specialist. Scroll down for video . Rescue helpers carry injured cave explorer Johann Westhauser on a stretcher near the entrance to the Riesending cave at Untersberg mountain near Marktschellenberg, Germany, after his rescue today . The complicated rescue operation involved winching Mr Westhauser's stretcher up several vertical shafts . Mountain rescuers carry cave researcher Johann Westhauser to a helicopter waiting outside the cave . By early this afternoon, the 52-year-old had 'arrived safe and sound at a hospital,' Bavarian mountain rescue chief Norbert Heiland said. The final stage of the rescue, which involved hauling Mr Westhauser through a labyrinth of narrow passages and precipitous vertical shafts, began on Friday after several days of preparation. After a short pause overnight, rescuers resumed work early this morning morning and brought Westhauser the final 590 feet to the surface just before noon. A fit expert could scale the distance . from the site of the accident to the entrance in about 12 hours, but . rescuers had to haul Mr Westhauser on a stretcher through the . challenging terrain. The first words Mr Westhauser uttered . upon seeing Italian rescue workers approach him on Saturday morning . were: 'I am feeling OK.' Rescue workers put Mr Westhauser into a police helicopter perched on a tiny landing spot near the entrance to the Riesending cave after the final phase of the transport of the injured spelunker . The helicopter takes off to transport Mr Westhauser to hospital, 12 days after he injured himself in the cave . Cave rescue specialists stand next to the cave entrance after completing the evacuation of Mr Westhauser. Specialists from Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy and Croatia were drafted in as part of the rescue mission . After . two days treating him inside the caves, rescuers finally strapped Mr . Westhauser to a stretcher, to begin the process of carrying him out of the . network of tunnels. 'We are . very glad that the patient is able to tolerate the transport so well,' doctor Johannes Schiffer said as the rescue was underway. Mr Westhauser had a heating system and a neck . brace attached to him in a bid to avoid further brain swelling on his . journey back to the light. Some . German media reported that doctors considered boring into his skull . while underground to relieve pressure on his brain, but it is unclear . whether this procedure was actually carried out. Transport: Rescue workers finally started the process of winching injured cave explorer Johann Westhauser to safety yesterday after he spent a week trapped 3,200 feet below ground . Rescuers had strapped Mr Westhauser to a stretcher (pictured), as they transported him through the labyrinth . Despite having . suffered a serious brain injury, certain passages within the caves are . so narrow that the explorer was expected to get up and walk himself. Foam, of the type used . in building to insulate walls, had been sprayed on him to both cushion . and warm him on his journey. He was also medicated - tranquilised, in . effect - to keep him calm in the cold, pitch darkness where progress was expected to be agonisingly slow. There . were, for example, five shafts measuring 200 feet each, that he had to . be pulled up with only a few centimetres between him and the dripping . rock face. A graphic shows where the cave explorer was stuck - far from the entrance of the complex cave system . Mr Westhauser was seriously injured by a falling rock while he was wearing a helmet during the early hours of last Sunday morning. By the time a paramedic reached his side he was already showing the first signs of hypothermia, as the temperature in the spot where he is lying underground never reaches above 3C. It could only be reached by crawling through a labyrinth of tiny spaces, rappelling down sheer drops and making difficult climbs in the pitch dark. Cave rescue specialists from Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy and Croatia  were drafted in as part of the rescue mission. The giant Riesending complex is under the Untersberg mountain range. According to legend, the Holy Roman Emperor sleeps beneath the mountains and will one day emerge to lead Germany to glory. The entrance to the caves was only discovered in 1995. Mr Westhauser's expedition had set out to map uncharted areas of the cave and was scheduled to take a month.","Johann Westhauser, 52, is now being treated in hospital .

"These Syrian enemies are trading handshakes and laughter instead of bullets. Soldiers and rebels in the southern Damascus suburb of Babila have agreed a truce, raising hopes that the bloodshed can be resolved. Despite daily battles in the area for more than a year, the truce in Babila is the latest in a series of ceasefires in Damascus. As part of the compromise between the rebels and President Bashar al-Assad’s forces, a siege was lifted and food was allowed to enter rebel-held areas, with opposition fighters handing over heavy weapons and the regime raising its red, white, black and green flag there. Truce: A Syrian soldier and rebel shake hands following the ceasefire in Babila. The two sides have been fighting for nearly 12 months in the capital's southern suburb.

Every single building along Babila’s main street was either destroyed or damaged during the 12-month uprising, but the desolate scene was one of hope on Monday as dozens of people chanted: ‘One, one one! The Syrian people are one!’ In addition to the compromise in Babila, truces have been made for local ceasefires in Qudsaya, Moadamiyet al-Sham, Barzeh, Beit Sahem, Yalda and Yarmuk Palestinian refugee camp. A new agreement is also being harvested for Harasta, a rebel area north-east of Damascus. Truce talks over Daraya, in the captial’s south west are also reportedly taking place. Armed rebels were still present in the area, as the terms of the agreement also included an amnesty, a security source said.

"There's no escaping the Instagram selfie trend, so isn't it about time you perfected your photo face? Since model Tyra Banks first coined the term 'smizing' a bevvy of popular poses have been infiltrating our social networking sites, including 'pruning', 'teeging' and most recently the 'squinch' by photographer Peter Hurley. But how do you decide which one to choose? Fear not, one intrepid beauty writer is here to help. Angelica Hermon from style site neverunderdressed.com has road-tested the (supposedly) most flattering poses to see which ones really work.... What's involved? Lifting and tightening the lower eyelid and only allowing the top eyelid to come down slightly. Verdict? 'Perhaps I didn’t get it quite right because I think I look like . I’ve had seven and a half Aperol Spritzs too many. 'I . teamed it with a grin here, which probably doesn’t help the drunken . look, but without a smile it would no doubt look more serious and . therefore more cool. I need to practice.' Beauty journalist Angelica Hermon of NeverUnderdressed.com has tested out the most popular picture poses including squinching (l) and smizing (r) What's involved? Smiling with your eyes in the style of Tyra Banks on America's Next Top Model. Verdict? 'It’s actually pretty hard to smile with your eyes. Whilst also trying not to smile with your mouth. I felt like I was trying to freeze myself with a peculiar look on my face as if playing Grandmother’s Footsteps. I’ve realised that Tyra’s heavy layer of smoky eye make-up gets her half way to the smize.' What's involved? Copying the Olsen sisters to project a sultry almost serious look with your mouth. Verdict?: 'This felt like the . most posey of the lot and least like what I’d naturally do with my . expression if a camera was thrust in my face. To me, it looks like I’ve had a dodgy filler/collagen job done around my mouth. Or have really bad mouth ulcers. 'But . on those Olsen twins, it looks utterly fabulous. As poses go, it’s far . better than the 90s pout (see Posh Spice) and thoroughly easy to do on . demand.' Angelica attempts to give the Olsens a run for her money with her pruning pose (l) and teegs like Lily Allen (r) What's involved? Bear your front teeth and press your tongue closely behind them with it slightly on show (this is Lily Allen's favourite pose). Verdict? 'Though Lily nails this look every time, I don’t think my version looks anywhere near as good. It reminds me of my 3 year old niece who has a distinct lisp and whose tongue seems to permanently hang out of her mouth like a Labrador puppy. I think I’ll leave this one to Lily.' What's involved? Let loose, giggle, chuckle, ROFL and then freeze. Verdict: 'This felt natural and easy and although it was completely phoney, I think I fooled the camera well. It . felt the most normal of them all. I thought back to Saturday night when . my best friend slipped across the dance floor (ending up in a . near-splits stance), let out a loud belly laugh and hey presto, there it . is.' LOLing: This pose involves laughing out loud and freezing before the flash goes off . Portraitist Peter Hurley claims the squinch is . the act of squinting your eyes in such a way as to ooze confidence . and self-assuredness. He believes that this will make you look . far more attractive than staring wide-eyed into the camera, which . portrays fear and uncertainty. Firstly, Hurley emphasises that squinching isn’t the same as squinting and while the difference may be minor, it is vital. When you squint, your top and bottom eyelids close, which, Hurley believes makes you look far from confident. Does it really work? Portraitist Peter Hurley thinks that 'squinching' (R) makes you look more photogenic . When you ‘squinch,’ however, you’re . lifting and tightening the lower eyelid and only allowing the top eyelid . to come down slightly. He says: 'If you're a photographer out there, make your . people squinch. And if you're a human being who just wants to look hot, . this is going to do it for you. 'Want to know why? Because confidence comes from the eyes.' Read more of the latest beauty tips from the editors at fashion and beauty magazine Never Underdressed here .

"A police spy passed on confidential details about the breakdown of Neville and Doreen Lawrence’s marriage to Scotland Yard bosses. The undercover officer sent reports of how the couple ‘had, in reality, separated’ during the Macpherson inquiry into their son Stephen’s racist murder. In one, he made it clear that the collapse of the couple’s marriage ‘is not public knowledge’. Details of the astonishing intrusion of privacy are contained in the Ellison review into the Stephen Lawrence case. Scroll down for video . Intrusion: An undercover police officer passed on details about the breakdown of Doreen and Neville Lawrence's marriage to bosses at Scotland Yard, a review into the Stephen Lawrence murder case revealed . Last night Neville Lawrence said the revelations were disgusting: ‘It’s unbelievable. They have mocked everything we have done, telling us to our faces that they are listening and things will change, and all the time laughing behind our backs. ‘I think they are actually worse than criminals, because these officers get paid with taxpayers’ money for what they do.’ The extraordinary revelations of the invasion of the Lawrences’ privacy by an officer attached to Scotland Yard’s disgraced Special Demonstration Squad – an ultra-secret wing of Special Branch – came as: . The incredible scrutiny placed on the private life of the Lawrences is buried in the 100-page Ellison report into the Lawrence case. According to the Ellison review, undercover SDS officer N81 sent his police bosses a series of reports detailing private information back to his police bosses. Murdered: Stephen Lawrence. The revelations were made in the Ellison review into the case . It is not clear who read the spy’s reports but a number of very senior former Met officers are set to be quizzed over the privacy breach at the forthcoming public inquiry into undercover policing. In one report, in July 1998, N81 wrote ‘the main problem facing the [Lawrence] campaign was the refusal of both Neville and Doreen to have anything other to do with other groups ... that they had in reality separated and that they only continued together as a front for the campaign.’ In another, he said: ‘As for the Lawrence family, Doreen and Neville Lawrence split up during the first stage of the Inquiry (although this is not public knowledge). Neville remains the more politicised of the two although Doreen has recently been vocal in her calls for the Commissioner to resign.’ He also claims he was informed that ‘my reporting was going straight to [then Met commissioner] Sir Paul Condon’s desk each morning’. Last night a shocked Mr Lawrence said: ‘What in heaven’s name has the stage of my marriage got to do with Stephen’s murder? Did they think that Doreen and I had fallen out, and that one of us had decided to have our son murdered to spite the other? That’s the only reason I can think of for them taking the slightest interest in our relationship. This is disgusting. It makes me think that the police officers running the investigation must have taken leave of their senses. ‘From the day I first came to this country more than 50 years ago, I have never been in trouble with the law. Since Stephen’s murder I have gone out of my way to help the police. Now I don’t even want to talk to them again.’ Mr Lawrence said it was deeply ironic that the Met were interested in the breakdown of his marriage, because it might have survived but for the failed murder investigation. ‘There was really nothing wrong with our marriage,’ he said. ‘It was six years after the murder that the divorce took place. Our marriage broke down slowly, over a long drawn-out period directly due to problems with the case, fighting for justice, and our frustration and anger – and that was all down to the way it was handled by then police. Incredulous: Doreen and Neville Lawrence, pictured in 1998. Mr Lawrence said he 'sat down and cried' when he heard of the report's contents . ‘So you have a situation where this police spy in our camp was reporting back on a situation the police had created. The marriage probably wouldn’t have collapsed if it wasn’t for them.’ Mr Lawrence ‘sat down and cried’ yesterday, when he heard of the report’s contents at the London office of his solicitor. ‘It was the deceit that really got to me,’ he said. ‘And it just hit me that the police had destroyed my life, and the lives of my family.’ Police Minister Damian Green told BBC Breakfast he understood why the Lawrence family had lost faith in the police. ‘They went through a terrible, unimaginable ordeal 20 years ago and... they are still going through it because we’ve not got to the truth yet,’ he said. The heroic work of undercover officers who risk their lives on dangerous assignments should not be over-shadowed by the Stephen Lawrence ‘spying’ scandal, a former detective said yesterday. An undercover officer – codenamed N81 –spied on the Lawrence family while working for Scotland Yard’s Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) in the late 1990s. But just a few years later, an undercover officer working for a different Scotland Yard unit was bought a house as part of an extraordinary ‘sting’ operation to infiltrate the Lawrence murder gang. Using a false identity, the officer moved into a property close to one of the prime suspects and tried to befriend him. The long-term aim of the mission – carried out amid enormous secrecy – was to try to obtain a murder confession. The operation highlighted the risks taken by detectives in their bid to gain justice for Stephen. Up to 20 officers were on standby in case their undercover colleague’s cover was blown and his life put at risk. Ultimately, the operation failed to obtain new leads. But former Met Det Sgt Chris Hobbs, who once worked in Special Branch, told the Mail: ‘Critics of SDS undercover officers seem to be unaware that another undercover Met officer literally risked his life by attempting to befriend Stephen’s killers by virtue of living in a house close to one of the suspects. ‘Even before Stephen’s tragic death, racial tensions were high and Special Branch monitored neo-Nazi groups in the same way that they did those on the Left and their efforts unquestionably saved lives. Despite mistakes that were made, most SDS officers were brave, committed and dedicated. Now retired, those same officers are apprehensive at the current furore and concerned that being the subject of any inquiry may endanger both themselves and their families.’ Mr Hobbs, now a commentator on police issues, added: ‘The current furore will do little to lift the ever-growing black cloud that threatens a police service, which, for all its imperfections, is still the best and most restrained in the world.’","Undercover officer snooped on Neville and Doreen Lawrence's marriage .

"Two centuries might separate their great seafaring triumphs, and in terms of speed and agility, the vessels they commanded may well be beyond all compare. Yet given the way Sir Ben Ainslie almost single-handedly inspired his bedraggled and outclassed team to victory in the world’s oldest and most prestigious yacht race on Wednesday, experts were pondering a rather unlikely question: is he the greatest British sailor since Nelson? It might sound somewhat far-fetched, but for those who weren’t fortunate enough to witness on TV what is being hailed as the greatest sporting comeback of all time, the facts are these. Thrilled: Sir Ben Ainslie triumphantly holds up the America's Cup trophy after the Oracle Team USA won the sailing race in San Francisco on Thursday . Oracle Team USA: (from left to right) tactician Tom Slingsby, skipper Jimmy Spithill, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison and helmsman Sir Ben Ainslie stand with the America's Cup trophy . Having invested a cool £120 million of his fortune in attempting to retain the America’s Cup, billionaire computer tycoon Larry Ellison had watched forlornly as his turbo-charged super-boat, crewed by an elite team of 11 international yachtsmen hired on megabucks salaries, were blown out of the water by their New Zealand opponents. Ellison’s Oracle Team USA lost race after race in the series, and by mid-September their humiliation was almost complete. Having won eight of the nine completed races, their challengers, Emirates Team New Zealand (whose budget was less than half of Oracle’s), needed to clinch just one more victory to claim the coveted 162-year-old cup in front of more than a million spectators in San Francisco Bay. It seemed a mere formality. Speed machine: The Oracle catamaran, which boasts carbon-fibre sails designed by a Boeing engineer, has a hull length the same size as two London buses and the same width as a three-lane motorway . But then something quite extraordinary happened. Something which surpasses perhaps even Ian Botham’s legendary match-winning innings to snatch victory for England in the 1981 Ashes Test at Headingley. In desperation, Ellison sacked his tactician, an acclaimed yacht-racing genius named John Kostecki, who had made a series of errors, and replaced him with Ainslie, who had been included in Oracle’s team only to sail their trial boats, and — having won four Olympic gold medals in a very different form of sailing — was not considered experienced enough to play a major part in the America’s Cup. It must be said that mega-rich American Ellison also spent millions more on redesigning his yacht’s aerodynamics — reputedly seeking advice from top technicians at aircraft giant Boeing — yet it was undoubtedly the dramatic intervention of the bearded 36-year-old Falmouth mariner that turned the tide. Billionaire backing: The Oracle was bankrolled by software tycoon Larry Ellison, who ploughed a staggering £120million into his America's Cup campaign. The catamaran itself cost £7million . Drafted in with Oracle still five points down, he set about assessing every aspect of his boat’s performance, digesting data from a computer worn on his wrist. He also excelled in his key role of studying the opposition and drawing up an effective attack plan in a split-second; but such is his innate seafaring brilliance that the high-powered engineers also consulted Ainslie — who learned to sail at his father’s side in a dinghy bobbing about in the Channel when he was eight years old — about the key design modifications. The transformation was remarkable. Oracle won one race, then another . . . and another; and on Wednesday when they glided past the Golden Gate Bridge to thrash a desperate and disbelieving New Zealand crew by 44 seconds, Ainslie was given the honour of taking the wheel to steer the victorious yacht back to its moorings. All along the shoreline, the Stars and Stripes fluttered, for officially this was another great American victory. In truth, however, nobody among the joyous crowd was in any doubt that it was a triumph for Britain. ‘Ben didn’t do it all his own, it was a great team effort, but he really changed the course of the race series,’ said Bob Fisher, author of the definitive book on America’s Cup history, who watched the thrilling spectacle unfold. Comparison: Sir Ben has been hailed as Britain's greatest sailing hero since Napoleonic War captain Lord Horatio Nelson . ‘There is no doubt he is the best sailor we have ever had in Britain, and though one was a great battle commander and the other a great sportsman, I actually think it’s quite fair to compare him with Lord Nelson, because both were tactically brilliant and their skills transcend the centuries, even given the huge changes in technology. ‘Nelson used his skill and cunning to split the French fleet at Trafalgar by sailing at them at right-angles, rather than sailing alongside them (the conventional way of doing battle in those days). ‘Ben has been sailing since he was a kid and he’s absorbed so much knowledge. He has become a master at reading the wind and knowing the currents. They were skills he used to great effect in helping Oracle to pull off this amazing comeback, and Britain should be very proud of him.’ Indeed we should, but Ainslie himself says he won’t be satisfied until he brings the America’s Cup to Britain, which staged the inaugural race against the U.S. schooner America, after which the contest is named, off the Isle of Wight in 1851. Yet, despite many glorious — and highly expensive — tilts, we have never yet managed to win it. Despite all the millions it would take to mount a credible challenge, the remarkable events of this week have brought the dream closer. For the world’s top crewmen will surely now clamour to sail in a yacht guided by the great Briton — who recently acquired the requisitely wealthy sponsor, bankers JP Morgan. Given a following wind, therefore, we might soon see Sir Ben steering his victorious course along the Channel. Why, perhaps, in years to come, he’ll even be on a plinth in Trafalgar Square.","Sir Ben led the  Oracle Team USA to beat New Zealand at the America's Cup decider in San Francisco .

A report by Amnesty International is believed to have evidence of war crimes committed by both sides . Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko claims Russia has removed the bulk of its forces from the region, however there is a still a heavy military presence, with checkpoints in Slavyanoserbsk heavily guarded . According to Newsweek Europe, she said she had received her son’s head in the post and blamed nationalist volunteers for the death. The shocking report came as Amnesty International claimed they have documented evidence of war crimes by both sides in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The human rights group's secretary general, Salil Shetty, told a news conference in Moscow that some separatists, backed by Russian troops, and Ukraine's Aidar battalion had committed human rights abuses in the five-month-old conflict. Citing satellite imagery as well as witnesses' accounts, Shetty said Russia's involvement in the violence in eastern Ukraine made it a side in the conflict which could make it liable if war crimes are established. Tatyana Grigorivna (left), begs for help to locate her son, Nikolai, (right) who has disappeared from the town of Alovaisk which was damaged during heavy fighting . 'We have repeatedly raised the issue of war crimes and in our most recent reports we have documented evidence of war crimes from both sides,' said Shetty, repeating the allegations in the Russian capital, where authorities have denied their involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Shetty said the organisation had requested meetings with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov but neither had agreed to meet him or answered the allegations. Russia has denied it is a party to the conflict and has dismissed accusations that it has sent soldiers and weapons to support the separatists. Shetty said human rights abuses, including beatings and abductions, had been carried out by separatists 'who we now know have been backed by Russian forces' and by Ukraine's Aidar Battalion, a volunteer territorial defence group. He also called for an investigation into allegations from both sides of indiscriminate mortar fire which he said had led to more than 1,000 civilian deaths. Ukraine's President, Petro Portoshenko, today promised legislation  to offer greater autonomy to pro-Russian eastern regions, which have been the focus of fighting for five months. He said the regions would remain part of Ukraine and rejected the idea of federalisation, something both Russia and the Russian-backed separatists are still pushing for even after a cease-fire that began Friday. Mr Portoshenko added that the bulk of Russia's forces had been removed from the country, renewing hopes for a peace drive.

"Prince Harry came to the rescue of a lady who lost her hat after a gust of wind blew it off as he made a speech at RAF Honington in Suffolk this morning. Ever the gentleman, the Prince, 30, rushed to her aid and scooped up the wayward titfer before returning the garment to its delighted owner with a big smile. Harry's moment of gallantry came just after he had made a speech in which he praised the 'professionalism and determination' of the RAF's 26 Squadron. Scroll down for video . There you go: A gallant Prince Harry returns a missing hat to its owner after it was blown off by a gust of wind . Going, going, gone! A gust of wind sends the lady's hat flying as Prince Harry walks away to inspect the troops . Let me help: Harry spots the errant hat and scoops it off the parade ground tarmac, watched by troops and well-wishers . An officer AND a gentleman: A beaming Prince Harry returns the wayward hat to its delighted owner .

Salute: During the visit, he officiated during a ceremonial parade in front of airmen's friends and family . March: RAF Honington serves as the depot for the Royal Air Force's contingent of ground troops . The royal, who is fresh from a visit to Kandahar Airbase in Afghanistan, inspected ground troops before presenting No. 26 Squadron RAF Regiment with a new standard. The regiment is a specialist unit that focuses on thwarting chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear attacks - a role that has put it at the forefront of anti-terrorism efforts. In a speech in front of servicemen and women and their families, he said: 'This role is vital to UK defence and civil response capabilities; is is also highly valued by NATO. 'Alongside 27 Squadron, it is constantly committed at extremely high readiness to support the combined emergency service and military response to a CBRN [chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear] incident in the UK. ""Indeed, such is the vital nature of this role that responsibility has been handed over to the remainder of the wing to allow the squadron to be on the parade today.' He added: 'It is clear that every member of the squadron possesses the determination and professionalism to succeed, even in the most arduous of circumstances. Enjoying himself: Prince Harry appeared to enjoy his visit to RAF Honington in Suffolk . Inspection: Harry has held the role of Honorary Air Commandant at RAF Honington since 2008 .

Work: Harry remains a captain in the Blues and Royals but has taken a step back from combat operations . Dedicated: Instead, the Prince has been concentrating on helping injured servicemen and women . Smart: After the parade - and the hat rescue - Harry and the men of 26 Squadron RAF Regiment posed for a group photo . 'Traits which have ensured the squadron's success since its formation and that are embodied in this new standard and the proud history it represents.' A standard is presented to RAF Regiment squadrons every 25 years and represents hundreds of years of history of service to the monarch and to the country. Royal Air Force Honington is the RAF's centre of Force Protection and is the depot for the Royal Air Force Regiment - the ground-fighting force of the RAF. The regiment protects air bases from attack and is trained in a wide range of RAF protection roles, both at home and abroad. Harry, himself a trained Apache helicopter pilot - albeit in the Army rather than the Royal Air Force - became Honorary Air Commandant of the base at the request of the Queen in 2008. Joking: Prince Harry met Sgt Rick Clements during a visit to Bryan Adam's Wounded: The Legacy of War . Awareness: Mr Adams' photos are intended to capture 'the unique spirit and resolve' of British personnel . Forefront: Harry has spearheaded efforts to help servicemen via charity appearances and the Invictus Games . Nice to meet you: Harry shakes hands with one of the servicemen during the event on Tuesday night . Return to Afghanistan: Harry spent Remembrance Sunday with RAF personnel stationed at Kandahar Airfield . He remains a captain in the Blues and Royals but took a step back from frontline combat operations earlier this year in order to concentrate on the Invictus Games. The Games, which took place in September, saw more than 600 wounded servicemen from more than nine different countries go head-to-head in a range of sports, among them archery and wheelchair rugby. Harry remains a passionate supporter of charities working to rehabilitate injured troops and, on Tuesday night, joined Canadian rocker Bryan Adams at a photo exhibition dedicated to servicemen and women. In typical Harry style, the royal joked and laughed with the veterans, quipping to Sgt Rick Clement who lost his legs in an IED explosion in Afghanistan: 'At least your hair has grown back!' Speaking of Sunday's trip to Kandahar Airfield, he added: 'The visit [to Afghanistan] was great. Fourteen people collapsed, though, during the ceremony, and it was only 12 degrees heat. But they were from the RAF so that's acceptable.' All smiles: Harry looked delighted to be back in the Middle East and shared a joke with the airmen on duty . Clown prince: His trademark high jinks left the men stationed at Kandahar Airfield in fits of laughter . Good work: Harry met some of the pilots charged with flying bombing raids on ISIS jihadis . My turn: He also convinced some of the airmen to let him take a seat in the cockpit of one of the planes . Memories: During the Remembrance service on the base, Harry read a passage from the Bible .

"North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un spoke of the execution of his 67-year-old uncle during his New Year address telling the country 'our party took resolute action to remove...scum elements within the party last year.' The 30-year-old leader appeared on state television for the speech and analysts say the words reflect his feelings towards aides of his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, and other family members who are believed to have been sent to labour camps. 'Our party's timely, accurate decision to purge the anti-party, anti-revolutionary elements helped greatly cement solidarity within our party,' said Kim, adding that 'factionalist filth' had been 'eliminated.' Scroll down for video . 'Eliminated': North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said 'scum elements' including his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, had been removed from the party last year. The dictator gave the speech during his 2014 New Year address . His statement on state tv was the first time he had publicly criticised his uncle, who was executed on December 12 after he was accused of treason, corruption, following the ways of the hated West, and being a womaniser. Although Jang had played a major role in helping the inexperienced Kim after the younger man had taken power following the death of his father, Kim Jong-Il in December 2011, the new leader is believed to have felt threatened by Jang's power. Observers in neighbouring South Korea agree that Kim has been running a 'reign of terror' in carrying out a 'massive purge' to consolidate his grip. Kim also used his New Year message to warn that the Korean peninsula would be engulfed by a 'massive nuclear disaster' if war broke out there again - a reference to the Korean war of the early 1950s when South Korea, supported by the United Nations, fought with North Korea which was at one time supported by China and the Soviet Union. On holiday: Kim Jong-Un rides a ski lift while inspecting Masik Pass ski resort . 'If the war breaks out again in this land, it will bring about a massive nuclear diaster and the US will never be safe,' he warned. Before issuing his New Year message, Kim warmly wrapped in a thick coat and a bearskin hat, visited his pet project, the Masik Pass Ski Resort, lauded by state media as having been completed at 'lightning speed'. He took a test ride on a ski lift, rising up over the project that he said during an earlier visit was 'at the centre of the world's attention'. According to a report published by the official news agency, the resort was opened in a ceremony on Tuesday. Business as usual: Kim Jong-un (R) inspects Masik Pass, near Wonsan, North Korea . Switzerland, where Kim had studied during his youth, blocked a £6 million sale of ski lifts to the capital, Pyongyang, earlier in 2013, describing the resort as a 'propaganda project' for the impoverished Stalinist regime. Even so, Kim urged his workers to press on and today the resort is said to feature 70 miles of multi-level ski runs, a hotel, heliport and cable cars. The massive project is not the only entertainment centre to arise since Kim took power. Other projects he has ordered to be built include an amusement park, a water park and a luxury horseback riding club.","The dictator referred to those recently executed as 'scum elements' and 'factionalist filth'

"Charity aid convoys are at the centre of a counter terrorism investigation over fears they are supporting Al-Qaeda militants in Syria. Tens of thousands of pounds in cash has already been seized from relief vehicles travelling from Britain to the war-torn state. Security services fear the huge relief effort is being hijacked by radical Islamists determined to support networks of violent jihadists. British suicide bomber Abdul Waheed Majeed, 41, is among those who have travelled to Syria  under the banner of charitable work. He joined an aid convoy after his Crawley mosque raised more than £140,000 to help refugees . Majeed killed himself when he drove an armoured dumper lorry laden with explosives into the gates of Aleppo prison last week . Yesterday Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he remains deeply concerned at the threat posed by returning British jihadists. ‘We have not changed the policy,’ he said. ‘We are concerned about the number of British people going to Syria for humanitarian reasons or to get involved in the war that is happening. ‘There are a few hundred people going out there. They may be injured or killed, but our biggest worry is when they return they are radicalised, they may be militarised, they may have a network of people that train them to use weapons.’ British Home Counties suicide bomber Abdul Waheed Majeed, 41, was among those who travelled to Syria under the banner of charitable work. He joined an aid convoy after his Crawley mosque raised more than £140,000 to help refugees in just a few months. Volunteers travelled the 2,000 mile journey in a fleet of old ambulances loaded with supplies, including food, bedding and medical equipment. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he remains deeply concerned at the threat posed by returning British jihadists, radicalised while they are in the warzone . But Majeed left them to kill himself by driving an armoured dumper lorry laden with explosives into the gates of Aleppo prison last week. The vehicle was draped in the flags of Jabhat al-Nusra, an extremist faction aligned to al-Qaeda and banned in Britain. Further details of how the father-of-three was radicalised emerged yesterday as hate preacher Omar Bakri revealed he was a close aide. The cleric, barred from Britain almost nine years ago, said Majeed was a key member of his banned organisation Al-Muhajiroun. Bakri said he worked as his driver between his North London home and Crawley, where he nurtured a power base of militant supporters. Cleric Omar Bakri, barred from the UK nine years ago, revealed Majeed was a member of his banned organisation Al-Muhajiroun . Speaking from his home in Beirut, Bakri described Majeed as ‘a very dear brother’ and valued member of Al-Muhajiroun between 1996 and 2004. ‘He was a student of Sharia law,’ he said. ‘He wanted to study Islam and was very interested in how we could establish an Islamic state. ‘But I had not seen or heard of him for about a decade, until it was reported he had died. I am not surprised he became a jihadist, but I did not expect him to go as far afield as Syria. ‘He gave his life for the Muslim brotherhood and Muslims should be very proud of him. He was a good Muslim and he is now in paradise.’ Police also raided the home of the brother of one of Britain’s most notorious terrorists after it was revealed he travelled to Syria with Majeed. Forensic experts were combing the Crawley home of Raheed Mahmood, brother of Waheed Mahmood, jailed for life in 2007 over the fertiliser bomb plot. Neighbours said the two men ‘were like brothers’ and Mahmood falsely claimed to have travelled to Pakistan to arrange a marriage after his six month trip to Syria. Majeed is also believed to have also been close friends with convicted terrorists Jawad Akhbar and Omar Khyam, who led the fertiliser plot. Khyam was an associate of 7/7 ringleader Mohammad Sidique Khan, who travelled to Crawley several times in 2004. Police and officials at the charity watchdog are closely monitoring a handful of Islamic groups collecting money for the Syrian relief effort. One charity under the spotlight is Al-Fatitha Global, which was given £140,000 by Langley Green Mosque, in Crawley. It is being monitored by the Charity Commission over its activities in Syria, and a spokesman said its ‘governance and financial management’ remain under scrutiny. Officials are also concerned that some groups are handling hundreds of thousands of pounds in donations despite not being officially registered as charities. Suicide bomber: The video shows the truck driving at high speed towards the front of the jail in Aleppo . Explosion: The camera then shakes violently as the truck's explosives detonate, killing the driver . An investigation by Kent Police is still on-going after £36,000, $10,600 and 1,400 Euros were seized from one convoy at the port of Dover in December 2012. Members of a similar convoy were discovered to have named their vehicles after Aafia Siddiqui, a woman dubbed ‘Lady Al Qaeda’. The Pakistani neuroscientist is serving an 86 year prison sentence for attempting to murder U.S. officials after being caught with bomb making instructions in Afghanistan. Majeed left for Syria six months ago after mosques and churches in Crawley joined forces for a huge fundraising effort. He was a prominent member of Langley Green Mosque which he attended with his wife and three children, aged 18, 16 and 12. The Department for International Development confirmed that mosque leaders attended an event last week aimed at discouraging people from travelling to Syria. Senior members of mosques across Sussex were invited to a hotel for a presentation by the Government department, the Foreign Office and police on their work in the Middle East. Speaking last night, mosque chairman Arif Syed insisted Majeed’s family have not ‘given up hope’ as there has been no official confirmation of his death. He added: ‘We still haven’t heard anything and we’re fearing for the worst. The family are very tense and distressed.’ Last October, William Shawcross, Charity Commission chairman, said it is almost inevitable that some charity money will end up in the hands of terrorists.","Security services fear the relief effort is being hijacked by radical Islamists .

"Nelson Mandela will return home today to the mist-shrouded hills he roamed as a boy. Here in Transkei, the sun seldom pierces the leaden clouds, but by midday tomorrow when it reaches its zenith, he should have been buried. In keeping with the traditions of his Xhosa tribe, his funeral ought to be a great family gathering when the entire Mandela clan, numbering more than 70, come together. Scroll down for video . The giant marquee for the funeral and burial of . former South African President Nelson Mandela in Qunu. But many members . of the Mandela clan have not been invited to attend in favour of . international VIPs .

For . though the huge ‘marquee’ constructed in the grounds of Mandela’s . mansion will accommodate 4,500 VIP guests, among them Prince Charles, . there is apparently insufficient room for many relatives. His . great-nephew Mzwandile Mandela – grandson of the former president’s . brother Maurice, who died last year – lives just across the road from . the ‘big house’. Yet even this 13-year-old cannot get a pass. Guests: Prince Charles and Barack Obama are among the thousands of VIPs who will attend the funeral of Nelson Mandela at the expense of members of the former South African leader's clan . Instead, Mzwandile will have to watch the ceremony on a grainy TV. ‘I’m . sad because I would have liked so much to be there,’ he told me . forlornly. ‘But they say there are not enough passes for young ones in . the family.’ Also excluded are Mandela’s niece, Gloria Mkwedini, 38, the daughter of his last-surviving sister and her family of 16. They live a few miles from the mansion, in one of the many round-shaped, mud-built hovels. As it has no electricity, they won’t even see the broadcast but will join the throngs jostling for some sort of view.

I think it’s because we are so poor and she . thinks we might embarrass the family.’ The guest-list has also upset the . broader community, incensed so few of them will be allowed in. ‘If .

"Sir Cliff Richard is to sell his £3million home raided by police over child abuse claims, telling friends he feels like he has been 'ransacked by burglars'. The distraught star has confided in those close to him that he feels 'violated' by the police search of his Berkshire penthouse and can't bear to return to his only British home. The 73-year-old is said to have been sickened when he learnt detectives were rifling through his belongings as live images of the raid were broadcast around the world by the BBC. Scroll down for video . Sir Cliff Richard said he plans to sell his luxury £3million penthouse in Sunningdale, Berkshire . 'Violated': Detectives were filmed from a helicopter walking into the singer's £3million Berkshire home . He was on holiday in Portugal when South Yorkshire Police swooped without warning on August 14. They had received a report of a sex attack on a teenage boy at a Christian rally in Sheffield almost three decades ago. Now the pop star, who has denied the allegations, is determined to sell his Sunningdale apartment at the earliest opportunity. 'He is putting the place on the market because he feels it has been violated by the search,' said the friend. 'He says he feels it's akin to having your home ransacked by burglars. 'He is a totally innocent man, yet several officers went into his home without any warning, in view of the news cameras, and rifled through his effects.' The decision to sell will not have been taken lightly, as Sir Cliff spent years searching for his ideal property in the Home Counties – eventually buying the £3.1million penthouse in 2008. The Art Deco building has Portland stone columns and bronze-framed windows, and is conveniently near the Surrey office of the Cliff Richard Organisation, which handles his affairs. He was on holiday in Portugal when South Yorkshire Police swooped without warning on August 14 . It is not yet on the market because of the police inquiry, but Sir Cliff is said to be anxious to move it on as soon as possible. The sale is likely to be overseen by John McElynn, 60, the former Roman Catholic priest who has been Sir Cliff's closest companion for the past 15 years and manages all his homes, including a Manhattan apartment and his villa in Barbados. The singer has chosen to remain at his holiday home in the Algarve after being voluntarily questioned by South Yorkshire Police last month. A close friend said the star, who has angrily dismissed the allegations dating back to 1985 as 'completely false', now feels 'trapped' as he waits to hear the outcome of the inquiry. Police had received a report of a sex attack on a teenage boy at a Christian rally in Sheffield three decades ago . The distraught star has confided in those close to him that he feels 'violated' by the police search . Although he has not been arrested and faces no restrictions on his travel, Sir Cliff has preferred to cancel public engagements since the news broke. His friend said: 'It's purely a personal thing. Cliff is one of those people who always stops and chats to everyone when they come up to him, and he just doesn't feel he would be able to do that as things stand.' Police and the BBC have been heavily criticised over the way the raid unfolded.

"Craig Burley was forced to get a tattoo of Fernando Torres after insisting the Atletico Madrid striker had no chance of finding the net against rivals Real in the Copa del Rey last week. Following Torres' nightmare spell at Chelsea, former Blues midfielder Burley was so confident the Spaniard's barren run would continue with his new club that he promised to get the striker inked on his arm should he hit the target.

"It appears British holidaymakers like to cram in as many sights as they can when they head abroad. New research reveals that the typical city break lasts three nights with travellers taking in five attractions – more than they would over the course of a year in their hometown. But trying to pack it all into just a few nights doesn’t cut it as Brits admit they often need more time away to tick everything off their itinerary. One in three (31 per cent) have extended their break as a result. The city that never sleeps: New York ranks as the number one dream destination for British holidaymakers . The bright lights and endless activities of New York are always a popular draw for British tourists so it’s no surprise that the Big Apple ranks as the number one dream destination. Of those polled in the lastminute.com survey, 27 per cent of respondents put New York at the top of their list. Barcelona (23 per cent) came in second place on the list of the top cities that Brits want to visit, followed by Amsterdam (20 per cent), Rom (19 per cent) and Venice (18 per cent). But whether these dream trips become reality is another thing. Top cities: La Sagrada Familia, an iconic Roman Catholic church, is a popular draw for tourists in Barcelona . Venice of the North: Tourists ride a boat on a canal in Amsterdam . In terms of the top ten city breaks that British holidaymakers have taken before, Paris was the most common destination with visits from 33 per cent of the poll’s respondents. The second most visited city was Amsterdam (32 per cent). It was followed by Barcelona (26 per cent), Dublin (20 per cent) and Berlin (13 per cent). New York – 27 per cent . Barcelona – 23 per cent . Amsterdam – 20 per cent . Rome – 19 per cent . Venice – 18 per cent . Athens – 16 per cent . Berlin – 16 per cent . Florence – 15 per cent . Las Vegas – 15 per cent . Vienna – 15 per cent .

Bruges – 11 per cent . Brussels – 11 per cent . Travellers have their reasons for heading abroad for a few days, but it appears a long weekend in an international city is often the refuge of the heartbroken. Eight per cent of those polled admitted they will go on a city break to help them to get over an ex, while seven per cent said they have booked a trip in a desperate bid to save a rocky relationship.

"Hollywood actress Drew Barrymore has reached out to her extended family following the death of her half-sister in a suspected suicide saying she was 'incredibly sorry' for their loss. Jessica Barrymore, 47, was 'found dead' on the eve of her birthday in her car in National City, just north of San Diego, on Tuesday about 6am. She had apparently visited her mother earlier in the day. Drew, 39, released a statement today saying: 'Although I only met her briefly, I wish her and her loved ones as much peace as possible and I’m so incredibly sorry for their loss.' Scroll down for video . Extended family: Jessica Barrymore, her famous sister Drew and their brother John in a picture which was taken in 2004 . Tragedy: The San Diego Coroner's Office has ruled that Jessica died of an accidental overdose of booze and drugs, including methamphetamine, methadone, tramadol and nordiazepam . Ms Barrymore, seen in here in pictures from her Facebook page, was discovered in her car about 6am but neighbours said her car had been parked there for about six hours prior . Witnesses: Martha Lopez and son Oscar Sandoval standing in front of their driveway in National City, California, where they found Barrymore dead in a parked car . It has been reported that numerous white pills were scattered on the passenger seat of her car. Marta Lopez made the discovery when she tried to leave for work but was blocked in her driveway by Ms Barrymore's car, 10News reported. She unsuccessfully tried to wake Ms Barrymore, who was to turn 48 tomorrow, and asked if she needed help, before noticing the pill bottles and calling the police. Those living near where her body was discovered said her car had been parked there since about midnight. Ms Barrymore's cause of death is yet to be determined, but an autopsy is scheduled. Ms Barrymore is the daughter of actor . John Drew Barrymore – who is also the father of the Charlie's Angels . actress – and his third wife Nina Wayne. Although Jessica's immediate family are yet to comment on the death, condolences have been offered to the family via her brother John Barrymore's Facebook page. Arlene August wrote that Jessica had visited her mother on Monday, the day before she died. 'Sad day for my dear friend Nina Wayne. Her daughter Jessica Barrymore is no longer with us. Nina was visited by Jessica yesterday. 'Today I learned of her passing, and relayed the news to John Barrymore via the phone. Prayers for peace and clean grieving go out to family and friends from myself, my church members of Congressional UCC Klamath Falls, Oregon, as well as Debra Lee Harpham.' Hugh Tiny Hogg wrote: 'My condolences on your loss John, a tragedy.' Another wrote: 'So sad to lose family, RIP, Jessica.' According to Ms Barrymore's Facebook page she attended the San Diego School of Creative Arts and lives in San Marcos. Ms Barrymore pictured with her cat in a picture taken from her Facebook page . A woman who found Ms Barrymore at first asked if she needed help, but after noticing pills scattered across her car she called the police . Family ties: Jessica was the half-sister of Drew, seen here with husband Will Kopelman at the recent Blended premiere . Ms Barrymore's final post on her Facebook page was a quote she shared from Mystera Magazine . Freckles: A photograph of Jessica as a child, which she posted on her Facebook page . In a cryptic last message on her profile page on July 28, Ms Barrymore shared a post from Mystera Magazine that said: 'Life doesn't always introduce you to the people you want to meet. 'Sometimes,life puts you in touch with the people you need to meet to Help You, to Hurt You, to Guide You, to Leave You, to Love You, and to gradually Strengthen You into the Person You Were Meant to Become.' Jessica’s posts on Facebook also give an insight into her life as a spiritual person. Five days ago she posted a prayer from a book with the title: ‘I forgive and I am forgiven.’. It read: 'The moment I forgive I am receptive to divine forgiveness. This is the promise of the wisest sages and a spiritual truth I live every day'. There are quotes from Nelson Mandela, Mother Theresa and Aristotle which show she took a philosophical approach to life. One of Hollywood's most famous child stars, Drew Barrymore had a well-documented battle with drugs and alcohol in her teenage years and has often spoken about her strained family life. In her autobiography Little Girl Lost, published when she was 14, Drew wrote, ‘I had my first drink at age nine, began smoking marijuana at ten and at 12 took up cocaine.’ By 13 she was in rehab and following a suicide attempt and a further stint in rehab, at 15 she successfully petitioned for emancipation from her parents. Her father John was an alcoholic and abandoned Drew and her mother when she was a baby and was in and out of jail on drugs charges before he died of cancer. And her mother Jaid, who struggled as an actress, took her to nightclubs when she was just eight, and to auditions before she was a year old. Drew has described the relationship as 'my greatest battle'. And the Barrymore's relationship with substance abuse doesn't end there. Drew's grandfather, the legendary actor John Barrymore, died from alcohol-related cirrhosis of the liver aged 60.

"A Russian convoy of trucks carrying tanks towards the Ukraine border has been seen returning without its cargo... fuelling fears that Vladimir Putin is already gathering his army in the country. The convoy of 13 military transporters had been carrying fearsome T-90 tanks and infantry vehicles through Russia's Rostov region towards the border. The following day, the same trucks were seen returning empty. The images are certain to alarm the West, which fears Putin's forces are placing fighters and heavy weaponry across the border into rebel-held regions of Ukraine. Scroll down for video . The military transport convoy, totalling 13 vehicles, was seen a few miles from the border . A T-90 tank being carried towards the Ukrainian border in a military transporter convoy . Many of the same transport vehicles were photographed driving away from the border the following day . The images are certain to alarm the West, which has accused Putin of supplying weaponry to rebels in Ukraine . The empty transporters photographed leaving the area days after they arrived with military equipment . The number plates of the trucks matched those of trucks spotted carrying equipment towards the border . The vehicles carrying tanks were seen heading in the direction of where Putin's 'humanitarian convoy' is located . All the vehicles' plates have the number 21 on them, indicating they are from the former North Caucasus Military District, now part of Russia's Southern Military District . Today the eastern city of Donetsk - once a staunch separatist stronghold - turned into a war zone as clashes between opposing forces intensified. Rebels were seen firing as they made their way through a car park, while in an area near the rebel headquarters building, residents fled when shelling began nearby. Shops closed early, and cars with gunmen inside sped through the streets, ignoring red traffic signals. A few hours earlier, fighting broke out in Makiyivka, a neighbourhood on the eastern edge of Donetsk that until Tuesday had not seen any combat. A resident of Makiyivka who gave his name as Svyatoslav said he had seen separatist fighters turning back an ambulance from the scene of the fighting, telling the crew there was no one left alive for them to treat. 'They're having to retreat, they're not able to stand their ground the way they want to,' he said of the rebels. The conflict has been plagued by accusations Russia is supplying troops and military equipment to the separatists across the border. Number plates on seven of the trucks seen today matched those seen carrying the tanks towards the border yesterday. All the plates also carry the number 21 on the right hand side, indicating they are from the former North Caucasus Military District, including strife-torn Chechnya and Dagestan, which is headquartered in Rostov-on-Don. It is now part of Russia's Southern Military District. The tanks and infantry fighting vehicles were seen 21 miles from the border and heading towards it. This is close to the frontier post where Russia's stalled 'humanitarian aid' convoy is holed up. A man repairs a broken window in his home in Khartsyzk, located about 24km from Donetsk . Residents wait inside a makeshift bomb shelter in Makiyivka as fighting breaks out across the town . Ukrainian forces today pressed on with their offensive in the east despite claims fleeing civilians have been killed . Kiev has refused so far to permit almost 300 trucks to enter its territory amid suspicions the vehicles - army lorries painted white - have a military purpose. Russia strongly denies this, arguing it is vital that the 2,000 tons of aid - including grain, sugar and baby food - is urgently needed in war-ravaged areas. The fighting in eastern Ukraine has taken a heavy human toll and has climbed today after a refugee convoy was hit by a rocket attack last night. Fifteen bodies have so far been removed from the scene - it is understood the convoy of buses and cars was packed with civilians fleeing heavy fighting between Ukrainian government forces and separatist rebels near Luhansk. Ukrainian government forces blame the attack on pro-Russian separatists they are battling in the area around the rebel-held city, while the rebels have denied responsibility. The United Nations says an estimated 2,086 people, including civilians and combatants, have been killed in the four-month conflict. That figure has nearly doubled since the end of July, when Ukrainian forces stepped up their offensive and fighting started in urban areas. Luhansk has been largely cut off for weeks and is now in its 17th day without water and regular supplies of electricity which have hit mobile and landline phone connections. A statement issued by the press service of the Luhansk municipality painted a picture of misery and fear for its inhabitants. 'Overnight there was fresh shelling. The centre of the town has seriously suffered particularly near the central market ... As a result of the armed clashes civilians have been wounded and killed. There is further destruction (of buildings),' it said. 'Bread is being sold from vehicles, with big queues forming ... Interrupted supplies of food, medicines and fuel to Luhansk is a particularly acute problem.' Meanwhile, president Vladmir Putin is due to meet Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko next week for the first talks between the two in months. Government forces have pushed on with a punishing offensive designed to win back the east . A diplomatic solution would have to resolve a contradiction: with his troops advancing and victory possibly within reach, Poroshenko has little incentive to offer the kind of compromises that would allow Putin to achieve a face-saving deal. The offices of the Ukrainian and Russian presidents said both men would attend a meeting in the Belarus capital, Minsk, on Aug. 26, which is also to be attended by EU officials, and the leaders of Belarus and Kazakhstan. Officially, the meeting concerns relations between the EU and a customs union involving Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, but Ukraine will top the agenda. The meeting will be the first between Putin and Poroshenko since a fleeting encounter in Normandy, France, in June at commemorations of the World War Two D-day landings. European officials say privately that they will keep up pressure on Putin to not support the rebels, but at the same time Ukraine has to be persuaded not to ruthlessly press home its advantage on the battlefield. That could humiliate the Kremlin and force it into an unpredictable reaction, officials say. The conflict, which began when street protests put a Western-leading leadership in power in Kiev against Moscow's wishes, has dragged relations between Russia and the West to their worst level since the end of the Cold War. It has also triggered a round of trade sanctions and retaliatory measures which are hurting fragile economies both in Russia and in European Union states. Russia annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea earlier this year. Since then, Kiev and its Western backers say Russia has been arming the anti-Kiev rebellion in Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine, an allegation that Moscow has denied.

"A British man accused of murdering his girlfriend on the holiday island of Crete was a loving and caring person who never appeared violent, a witness has told a court. Luke Walker, 25, is accused of killing his girlfriend Chelsea Hyndman, 20, on the idyllic holiday island of Crete where the pair were working three years ago. Greek prosecutors claim Ms Hyndman, who died after suffering severe injuries to her abdomen, was . beaten by Walker, from Brierley Hill, West Midlands, in May 2010. But Walker, who is charged with causing her death by actual bodily harm, has always maintained his innocence and claims she . fell during a girls' night out in Malia and actually died 10 days later from . septicaemia. Scroll down for video . Court case: Luke Walker, pictured left at his home in Brierley Hill, West Midlands, goes on trial today accused of causing the death of his girlfriend Chelsea Hyndman, pictured right, through actual bodily harm . Carefree: Ms Hyndman and Walker were both living on the Greek island and working in bars before she died . Louise Purdy, 27, told the court she regularly socialised with Walker, along with a group of others, and he did not appear to be a violent type of man. 'In our time I never saw a violent or aggressive person,' she said. 'Alcohol obviously does change you but I think with him, and the same with Chelsea, they became even more happy and life and soul of the party. 'They were very, very similar to each other and they did love to have fun and enjoy themselves.' Miss Purdy met Miss Hyndman and Walker in 2009 when they were all working in the resort town of Malia, the couple were living and working as bar staff. As she was getting to know Walker, an electrician, he was a 'very fun person, very loving, quite caring'. Miss Purdy told the court she had been celebrating her birthday with Miss Hyndman and a group of friends on a girls’ night out on May 6, 2010. Luke Walker can be seen kissing his girlfriend Chelsea Hyndman who he accused of killing in May 2010 . Chelsea Hyndman, pictured left on the Greek holiday island Crete, died after suffering severe injuries to her abdomen. Luke Walker, pictured right, is accused of causing her death by actual bodily ham . They had been drinking in bars, had . eaten a little bit during the night, and were all involved in playing a . game where one of the group would shout a word and they all had to drop . to the floor. It was during this game that Miss Hyndman had an accident, she said. 'We left one particular bar and as we were walking up the road one of the girls shouted out the word,' Miss Purdy said. 'We all had to fall to the floor and the last person had to have a forfeit. 'As I got up Chelsea was running diagonally in front of me. 'All I remember is watching her . feet... she had very high heels on and the floor was very cobble-y and . as she was going across me her feet were very unsteady as if she was . about to fall. Family support: Luke Walker pictured with his parents Lindy and Patrick . 'The last thing I know Chelsea had hit the floor, she had gone down.' The group helped Miss Hyndman to her . feet and she told them she was okay, so they continued with their night . and went to another bar. Miss Purdy continued: 'As we got . there I asked her ‘are you okay?’ and she said that she had hurt herself . slightly on the stomach.' After repeated delays, the trial was . finally due to start today and lawyer Georgios Pyromallis said Walker . was 'upbeat' and confident of clearing his name. He . said: 'I don't know how it will go, but I'm quite confident. We have a . good case, and we have quite a strong defence argument. 'We . will try to prove to the court that Luke never really touched Chelsea . so it wasn't him who caused this injury to the pancreas. 'Luke is looking forward to it, believing that his name will be cleared, and he's really waiting for that. 'I can ascertain that he's feeling much better now because he was able to return to his country, to his family. 'Nevertheless . he's fully aware of the importance of the trial, of the possible . consequences of that verdict. If Luke is convicted he may face life . imprisonment. 'But he's confident that he will have a good result, because he knows that he didn't do anything wrong.' In the days following her accident 20-year-old Miss Hyndman seemed to become ill, Miss Purdy said. They had a meal together with some other friends the next night and Miss Hyndman was unable to eat a great deal. A few days after that Miss Purdy said she saw Miss Hyndman in a bar and her eyes looked 'discoloured', and the whites 'yellowy'. Miss Purdy told the court she put her illness down to being the effects of drinking and not eating a lot, as was usual for their lifestyle at the time, or possibly sunstroke. Miss Hyndman became even more unwell and around a week after their night out Miss Purdy went to visit her as she lay in bed. 'I gave her a cuddle and she said she was feeling a little better than she had done and I asked her what was wrong with this,' Miss Purdy said as she gestured with her hands towards her stomach area. 'She pulled her t-shirt up and her stomach was very taut, very bloated, she looked pregnant.' Miss Purdy said she thought Miss Hyndman's condition was serious and she wanted to take her to hospital, but Miss Hyndman assured her she had managed to eat and drink a little and just needed some rest. It was the last time Miss Purdy saw her alive, she told the court. Walker maintains his innocence - claiming Miss Hyndman sustained her injuries after falling over on a night out . Walker, who appeared in court in black trousers and a white shirt and accompanied by members of his family, had kept her updated on Miss Hyndman's condition, she said. If anything had been wrong between the couple she believed Miss Hyndman would have confided in her, she told the court. 'I don't think he would have ever done anything to hurt her.' Miss Purdy went on: 'In the time I got to know her I do believe that she would have said something and not only would she have said it but we would have seen something that would have made us question things.' Walker, . from Brierley Hill, West Midlands, was jailed for five months following . his arrest and then forced to remain in Greece on bail until October . last year, when his trial was adjourned until today. Ms Hyndman's family have travelled to the island to witness the trial. Her . mother Heather Hyndman, 47, of Castleford, West Yorks., said: 'I’m more . prepared and more ready than last time. I’ve been through it all . before, so I know what to expect. 'I just hope it will be over and done with before the courts close down over there for the summer.' Greek . courts close on July 1, and while the trial is due to last around four . days, it can be interrupted if the judge has to deal with other cases. Delayed: Walker's trial started Crete yesterday - three years after his girlfriend Chelsea Hyndman died . Party town: Walker lived in Crete for two-and-a-half years, working in a bar in Malia, pictured . Ms Hyndman said: 'Hopefully they will have a bit of compassion and appreciate how far we have all travelled, and hopefully I will get some answers.' She and her partner Neil Lorriman will be represented in court by a Greek solicitor, and they are arranging to have a translator to help them follow proceedings. The trial comes at the same time as the third anniversary of Chelsea’s death. Her mother said: 'We set off a lantern for her and spent time with family. It’s hard most days, but it’s even harder this day.' Mr Pyromallis claimed Chelsea's mother believes Walker killed Ms Hyndman and is pursuing the case. Mr . Pyromallis said: 'Chelsea's mother is chasing the case. She has . appointed a lawyer here and she's preparing to defend her case. 'According . to her position so far it was Luke who caused the injury to Chelsea and . it was Luke who actually killed her. 'She has been supporting the . argument that ""I have nothing else to do than believing what the Greek . doctors said"", but from the fact she has appointed a lawyer here in . Greece, who will represent her, I believe that she's willing to fight . for Luke's conviction. 'According . to the findings of the Greek authorities Luke was the one who punched . or kicked Chelsea in the belly area, and that this caused the pancreas . injury which in the end led to Chelsea's death. 'The . Greek coroner [Elpida Spanoudaki] said that this pancreatic injury was . caused by an external power, which is either a punch or a kick. 'The . medical findings could lead to the direction that Chelsea was injured . ten days before her death after a fall she had in a party she had with . her friends, or to an alleged kick or punch on her abdomen area. Court case: Prosecutors claim that Luke Walker punched or kicked Chelsea Hyndman in her stomach causing her fatal injuries . 'The most important thing will be what Chelsea's friends are about to testify. 'I . know from their statements which they gave in Greece and the UK that . all of them really can't believe that Luke ever really raised a hand . against Chelsea. 'They all testify that if something like that happened, for sure Chelsea would have told them about it.' Walker maintains he himself took Chelsea to get treatment several days after she said she was feeling unwell. On . his return to the UK, he said: 'I've never had closure from losing her. The last time I saw her was when she was taken to the operating room. She said she loved me and I said I loved her.'

"Sanctions have so far failed abysmally to halt the Russian president's determination - in Western eyes - to bully Ukraine into remaining in his orbit . Britain is to spearhead a new Nato rapid-reaction force amid warnings that Vladimir Putin is virtually ‘at war against Europe’ and planning ‘Tsarist expansionism’. EU leaders were scrambling last night to bolster sanctions which have so far failed abysmally to halt the Russian president’s determination – in Western eyes – to bully Ukraine into remaining in his orbit. Leaders of countries sharing borders with Russia led the way in demanding tougher action against what they see as blatant aggression on their doorstep. Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaite bluntly called  for the West to wake up, and appeared to urge Nato to give significant military aid to Kiev. ‘Russia is at war against Ukraine and that is a country which wants to be part of Europe. Russia is practically at war against Europe,’ she said. She lambasted previous sanctions as ‘a big mistake’ because they were ‘too general’. Lithuania is one of at least six states believed to have signed up to a new British-led Nato rapid-reaction force, the formation  of which is expected to be announced this week by David Cameron as Wales hosts the most important Alliance gathering since the end of the Cold War. Denmark, Latvia, Estonia, Norway and the Netherlands will also join the 10,000-troop bid to deter Putin from what  the West sees as an attempt to redraw the frontiers of Europe. A key concern is that he intends to use his military might to impose a new ‘statelet’ within Ukraine called Novorossiya –  or New Russia. What remains of Ukraine could be left with  no coastline if the plan goes through. A diplomat said: ‘Putin is obsessed with Novorossiya, territory won for the Romanovs by Catherine the Great. He wants it back. Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaite, pictured left with David Cameron and Denmark's Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, bluntly called  for the West to wake up, saying 'Russia was practically at war with Europe' Ukrainian President Porochenko, pictured today with President of European Council Herman Van Rompuy, warned: 'Today we are talking about the fate of Ukraine, tomorrow it could be for all Europe' 'But the so-called rebels in this region of eastern Ukraine, who he praised for keeping Kiev’s army at bay,  are his own soldiers, using his latest military equipment. Let’s not fool ourselves about the acute dangers.’ Putin’s use of the Tsarist name of Novorossiya is sending shudders through Europe. While it includes the Donetsk and Lugansk regions – at the epicentre of the current unrest – it also includes such major cities as Kharkiv, Kherson and Odessa. Ukrainian . president Petro Poroshenko – who will meet David Cameron today – told . EU leaders yesterday that his country ‘is now the subject of foreign . military aggression  and terror’. He warned: ‘Today we are talking about the fate of Ukraine, tomorrow it could be for all Europe.’ Tensions . were further fuelled yesterday by the EU leaders’ appointment of . Poland’s Donald Tusk – an outspoken hawk on the Ukrainian crisis – as . European Council president. Britain will lead a Nato force designed to deter Putin from what the West sees as a move to redraw Europe's borders.

"The infrasonic shockwave caused by the explosion of the meteor which slammed into central Russia nearly a fortnight ago was the loudest sound ever recorded by the global nuclear testing watchdog. Seventeen listening stations operated across the world by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBTO) detected the sound wave as it traversed the planet. The furthest station to record the sub-audible sound was more than 9,000 miles away in Antarctica. Loudest ever infrasonic shockwave: This imge from a Russian driver's dashboard camera shows the explosion caused as a meteorite burned up in the atmosphere over central Russia a fortnight ago . Almost 1,200 people were injured when the untracked lump of space rock exploded over the Urals at 03.22 GMT on February 15, with the debris narrowly missing a direct and devastating hit on the industrial city of Chelyabinsk . Estimated by Nasa to have been 55ft-wide and with a weight of some 10,000 tons, the meteor is thought to have exploded above the Ural mountains with a force equivalent to about 500kilotons. That makes its impact nearly 25 times more powerful than the atom bomb dropped on Nagasaki in 1945. The low frequency waves emitted by the gargantuan blast were not audible to the human ear, but were recorded by the CTBTO's network of sensors as they travelled across continents. Global tracking system: This Google Earth image has lines drawn to the 17 infrasound stations in the CTBTO's network that detected the infrasonic waves from the meteor as it broke up over Russia's Ural mountains . 'We saw straight away that the event . would be huge, in the same order as the Sulawesi event from 2009,' said . Pierrick Mialle, an acoustic scientist with the agency. 'The observations are some of the largest that CTBTO's infrasound stations have detected.' Until . last week, the meteor explosion above Sulawesi, Indonesia, in October . 2009 was the largest infrasound event registered by 15 stations in the . CTBTO's network. Infrasound has been used as part of the CTBTO's tools to detect atomic blasts since April 2001 when the first station came online in Germany. Data from the stations is sent in near real time to Vienna, Austria, for analysis at the CTBTO's headquarters. Both the raw and analysed data are provided to all Member States. 'We saw straight away that the event would be huge': A visual representation of the infrasonic shockwaves generated by the fireball, as recorded by the infrasound listening station in Kazakhstan . Questions are being asked as to why Russia's powerful missile defence radar systems did not detect the meteorite that exploded over the country this month. In the aftermath of the impact Russian politicians called on the world's powerful nations to urgently develop technology to spot asteroids and meteorites that threaten our planet. But with Russia having one of the most high tech early warning systems of any nation on Earth, many are wondering why the nuclear superpower was not able to detect the incoming object itself. Experts from the Russian Nuclear Forces Project have claimed that despite the size of the meteor, early warning radars 'never had a chance' - since they were never designed to detect rocks hurtling in from outer space. The group published an image, above, showing how far into space the country's radar systems can penetrate. A project researcher writes: 'As can be seen from the picture, the meteorite was out of the field of view of the Pechora radar and it was below the horizon as seen from Moscow, so the Don-2N radar could not see it either. 'The Dnepr radar in Mishelevka might have detected the meteorite if it looked up, but it didn't - as an early-warning radar its mission is to search the narrow strip of space just above the horizon, which a ballistic missile would cross if it ever comes. 'They don't (and shouldn't) much care about anything else.' 'We know it's not a fixed explosion . because we can see the change in direction as the meteorite moves . towards the earth,' said Mr Mialle. 'It's . not a single explosion, it's burning, travelling faster than the speed . of sound. That's how we distinguish it from mining blasts or volcanic . eruptions. 'Scientists all . around the world will be using the CTBTO's data in the next months and . year to come, to better understand this phenomena and to learn more . about the altitude, energy released and how the meteor broke up.' There are currently 45 infrasound stations in the CTBTO's network that measure micropressure changes in the atmosphere generated by infrasonic waves. Like meteor blasts, atomic explosions produce their own distinctive, low frequency sound waves that can travel across continents. Infrasound is one of four technologies (including seismic, hydroacoustic and radionuclide) the CTBTO uses to monitor the globe for violations of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty that bans all nuclear explosions. Seismic signals from the meteor were also detected at several Kazakh stations close to the explosion and impact area. Days before the meteor, on February 12, 2013, the CTBTO's seismic network detected an unusual seismic event in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), which measured 4.9 in magnitude. Later that morning, the DPRK announced that it had conducted a nuclear test. The event was registered by 94 seismic stations and two infrasound stations in the CTBTO's network. The data processing and analysis are designed to weed out natural events and focus on those events that might be explosions, including nuclear explosions.","Furthest listening post to detect blast was 9,000 miles away in Antarctica .

"A group of businessmen are to trawl a lake near Berlin in search of almost £1billion worth of Nazi gold allegedly dumped by Hermann Goering. The Luftwaffe chief is said to have disposed of the treasure in the spring of 1945 to stop the Soviet Red Army getting their hands on it as they closed in on the German capital. Up to 18 boxes of gold were apparently thrown in Stolpsee Lake, about an hour’s drive north of Berlin in the former Communist East Germany. Stolpsee Lake lies in north-west Germany, close to the former home of Hermann Goering and was trawled unsuccessfully by the East Germans in 1986 . Polish slave workers ordered to dump it were allegedly machine-gunned on the shore afterwards, their bodies following the gold into the depths.In 1986 Stasi chief Erich Mielke ordered a trawl of the water but nothing was found. Now the search has been reignited after claims by a local priest. The lake will be searched by submarines from October in a hunt financed by a group of unidentified businessmen. The priest, Erich Koehler, 77, who has researched the legend of the treasure, said: ‘They didn’t have the technology in the former East Germany to properly examine the lake. ‘But there are enough local people still around to know that the gold is there – and the bodies of the poor souls forced to dump it into the water.' Goering emptied his country home, Carinhall, of its loot and art treasures shortly before ordering it to be dynamited in the closing weeks of the war as the Red Army marched on Berlin. Magpie: A formal portrait of Goering, who amassed astonishing wealth from lands under the Nazi jackboot . According to authorities, the documents Mielke worked from still lie undiscovered in the millions of papers that make up the Berlin archive of the Stasi secret police. Goering garnered astonishing wealth from lands conquered by the Nazis in the Second World War, including dozens of rare masterpieces from galleries across Europe. Each weekend the ruins of Carinhall attract dozens of treasure hunters who believe that some of his wealth still lies in the grounds of the old mansion. The consortium have been bolstered in their confidence of finding treasure from papers found in the German Federal Archive in Koblenz. SS documents together with post-war eye witness statements to the events on the lake in March 1945, give credence to the theory that precious material was indeed dumped into the 400-feet deep lake. One witness, Eckhard Litz, told a post-war allied commission: 'I remember well the night that lorries with slit headlights drove up to the lakeshore and I saw about 20 to 30 skeletal figures dressed in striped concentration camp uniforms being forced to unload heavy boxes. 'These were put into two rowing boats which made six separate trips to the centre of the lake. 'When the last case had been thrown overboard, the men returned to shore, were lined up and the last thing I saw were the flashes of the machine guns of the guards as they were killed.' He said the bodies were then loaded back onto the rowing boats which were then taken out by the SS to the centre of the lake and sunk. A third boat brought back the SS men to the shore. Goering is alleged to have personally taken charge of numerous amounts of bullion from the national bank of Poland following the Nazi invasion in 1939. It is this gold which is believed to lie at the bottom of the lake, just a few miles from the estate that he owned.",Polish slaves later machine-gunned believed to have dropped loot in closing weeks of war .
"A top-secret weapon being developed by the US military was destroyed four seconds after its launch from a test range in Alaska early on Monday after controllers detected a problem with the system, the Pentagon said. The Advanced Hypersonic Weapon is part of a program to create a missile that will destroy targets anywhere on Earth within hours - traveling at speeds in excess of 3,500 miles-an-hour or Mach 5. The mission was aborted to ensure public safety, and no one was injured in the incident, which occurred shortly after 4 am EDT at the Kodiak Launch Complex in Alaska, said Maureen Schumann, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Defense Department. 'We had to terminate,' Schumann said. 'The weapon exploded during takeoff and fell back down in the range complex,' she added. The incident caused an undetermined amount of damage to the launch facility 25 miles from the city of Kodiak, Schumann said. Scroll down for video . Detonation: The moment the weapon exploded is captured by Scott Wight and shows the horizon from Cape Greville in Chiniak, Alaska . Officials said that the weapon system was not carrying a warhead when it was aborted. The rocket carrying the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon was terminated near a pad of the Kodiak Launch Complex on Kodiak Island shortly after liftoff, spokeswoman Maureen Schumann said. After an anomaly was detected, testers made the decision to destroy the rocket to ensure public safety, Schumann said. ""It came back down on the range complex,"" she said. ""Fortunately, no people on the ground were injured. There was damage, but I'm not sure of the extent of it at this time."" The launch complex is about 25 miles from the city of Kodiak. Witnesses watched the rocket lift off at 12:25 am, quickly head nose-down and explode, KMXT radio reported. According to the Washington Free Beacon, the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon is being developed as a joint project between the Army Space and Missile Defense Command and the Army Forces Strategic Command to form the Pentagon's Prompt Global Strike initiative. The Defense Department wants a weapon that can strike targets anywhere in the world within hours using a conventionally armed missile traveling at Mach 5 or 3,500 miles an hour. The missile would be used to hit terrorist targets identified on satellites thousands of miles away or weapons of mass destruction being moved in open ground that only have a small window within which to strike. The disastrous abort of the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon in Alasak follows a failed test by the Chinese military of a similar system. The Wu-14 missile is being developed by China to launch nuclear warheads or to strike ships and is being designed to travel at speeds of up to Mach 10 or 8,000 miles-an-hour. Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post, said that the Chinese test of the Wu-14 three weeks ago failed in similar circumstances to the American test. According to the Washington Free Beacon, Russia too is attempting to develop its own hypersonic weapon. Source: Washington Free Beacon . Kodiak photographer Scott Wight watched the launch from Cape Greville in Chiniak, about a dozen miles from the launch site. He described the explosion as quite loud and scary. A fire afterward burned brightly. The rocket was the booster for the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon, a glide vehicle designed to quickly reach a target. The design is one of several being tested by the Army under the umbrella of the Conventional Prompt Global Strike program, Schumann said. ""It's a concept that will allow the Department of Defense to engage any target anywhere in the world in less than an hour,"" she said. The first flight test of the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon on November 17, 2011, flew the weapon from Hawaii to Kwajalein Atoll in the South Pacific. The test Monday was designed to enhance previous ground testing, modeling and simulation, Schumann said. Traveling at hypersonic speed, the glider also was aimed at Kwajalein and was supposed to cover the 3,500 miles in less than an hour, Schumann said. Experimental: Traveling at hypersonic speed, the glider also was aimed at Kwajalein and was supposed to cover the 3,500 miles in less than an hour . Experimental: This US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency artists rendering shows the Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 (HTV-2). The US military had to detonate a hypersonic weapon seconds after lift-off on August 25, 2014 due to a technical problem, cutting short a flight test for the experimental project, officials said on Monday . Strike capability: The Falcon HTV-2 will be launched on a rocket into space then will glide back down to Earth. The 2011 test flight lasted only nine minutes before being deliberately crashed as a safety measure due to technical difficulties . It was a setback for the US program, which some analysts see as countering the growing development of ballistic missiles by Iran and North Korea but others say is part of an arms race with China, which tested a hypersonic system in January. Riki Ellison, founder of the nonprofit Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, said he did not think Monday's failure would lead to the program's termination. 'This is such an important mission and there is promise in this technology,' he said. He said officials aborted the mission after detecting a fault in the computers. Anthony Cordesman, a defense analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said the technology was best suited for use against smaller, less-developed countries with missiles. 'The United States has never assumed that these ... are going to be systems that you can use against a power like China by themselves,' he said. 'For a country like Iran or North Korea, they could be a very significant deterrent.' The rocket carrying the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon was terminated near a pad of the Kodiak Launch Complex (pictured) on Kodiak Island shortly after liftoff . James Acton, a defense analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the Pentagon had never been clear about the mission for the weapon, with some viewing it as an effective tool against terrorists and others seeing it as a counter to China or Iran and North Korea. While hypersonic weapons are unlikely to be fielded for a decade, Acton said the fact that Washington and Beijing were both testing the weapons indicated there was a real potential for an arms race. 'I believe the US program is significantly more sophisticated than the Chinese program,' he said. The weapon, known as the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon, was developed by Sandia National Laboratory and the US Army. Schumann said it included a glide body mounted on a three-stage, solid-propellant booster system known as STARS, for Strategic Target System. In a previous test in November 2011, the craft had successfully flown from Hawaii to the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, she said. On Monday, it was supposed to fly from Alaska to the Kwajalein Atoll. Acton said no conclusions could be drawn about the weapon based on Monday's accident because the launcher detonated before the glide vehicle could be deployed.","Rocket carrying an experimental Army strike weapon exploded early Monday after taking off from a launch pad in Alaska .

"A school girl who collapsed and suffered a cardiac arrest in the school playground has woken up after spending five months in a coma. Emma Ross, 10, stopped breathing when her father came to collect her from school in February and was placed in a medically-induced coma. The youngster, who woke up a few weeks ago, is now recovering from a pioneering operation to fit a pump to help her condition. Emma is the first child to be fitted with a £27,000 Baclofen pump, having been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy - a disease of the heart muscle. Emma Ross, 10, (pictured in hospital with her mother) stopped breathing when her father came to collect her from school in February and was placed in a medically-induced coma . The device was fitted at Yorkhill Children’s Hospital in Glasgow after a three-hour operation yesterday. It will allow drugs to be injected directly into her spine, which will hopefully stop the painful involuntary muscle spasms, which Emma has endured. Emma’s mother, Robyn Stewart, 32, said: ‘I was told so many times that she was not going to . make it, but she has made so much progress. She is my wee miracle. 'Emma had her op and it all went well, so we are so relieved. 'The surgery is very rare, she will be the first child to have that type of pump fitted in the hospital. ‘We are now hoping that it will help relax her muscles so she will be able to move around because right now her muscles are so tight and stiff. ‘She is awake and aware of people. She can sometimes move her hands and feet. If a song comes on that she likes then she will move her feet around. ‘All I want is for her to talk and tell . me how she feels.' Emma is the first child to be fitted with a . £27,000 Baclofen pump, having been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, which . is a disease of the heart muscle. She is pictured above (left with her couusin Lois and right) before she had the cardiac arrest . The . schoolgirl from Dumfries stopped breathing for 44 minutes and turned . blue when her father Lindsay, 36, came to collect her from Heathhall . Primary in February. Doctors . battled to save her life at Dumfries Infirmary before she was rushed to . Yorkhill Children’s Hospital in Glasgow and placed in a medically . induced coma. Ms Stewart has spoken of her fear at seeing her little girl lying ‘dead’ in the playground. Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle. It can run in families and can affect one or many members of a family. There are three different types of cardiomyopathy and each affects the size and shape of the heart. They can also affect the heart's electrical system. There is a small risk of sudden death in people with cardiomyopathy. Source: British Heart Foundation . She said: ‘When I arrived I saw Emma lying dead and motionless. She was completely blue and she was not breathing. Her teacher Mrs Black was standing over her giving CPR. ‘Since then it has been an absolute roller-coaster, we’ve had good days and bad days. She can now make noises, grunts and groans. ‘There was a high risk with the operation as it took three hours - she could possibly have had another cardiac arrest. ‘I . know she is going to pull through. She had a chance to leave me and she . didn’t. Three times I was told she was not going to make it, but she is . still fighting.’ Emma . has now been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, which is the same disease . of the heart muscle that almost killed footballer Fabrice Muamba in . 2012. She spent . her 10th birthday in hospital last month, while she was barely . conscious, but her party had to be cancelled because she urgently needed . a feeding tube inserted in her stomach. Her parents have been able to take Emma out of hospital in her wheelchair and her mum said she is always smiling. Emma's mother Robyn Stewart, said her daughter 'is awake and aware of people. She can sometimes move her hands and feet. If a song comes on that she likes then she will move her feet around'. Emma is pictured with Ms Stewart and her uncle Elliot Stewart . The schoolgirl from Dumfries stopped breathing for 44 minutes and turned blue when her father Lindsay, 36, came to collect her from Heathhall Primary in February. Emma is pictured left with her cousin Lois (right) in a trip away from the hospital . They have another daughter called Evie who is 18 months old and say they have been ‘overwhelmed’ by the support and kindness of people who have read Emma’s story. ‘Folk have been brilliant. We have been absolutely overwhelmed with all the support,’ Ms Stewart said. St Michael’s Church and donations from the public have enabled the family to stay near Emma in hospital. They will be doing a 10k run on August 31 along with Emma’s friends and teachers to raise money for Ronald McDonald House, which is a charity that provides free accommodation for 500 families each year whose children are critically ill patients in Yorkhill Hospital. People can sponsor Ms Stewart’s run by visiting her Just Giving page. Emma (pictured in hospital) can now make noises, grunts and groans but cannot yet talk . Contrary to popular belief, a cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack. A cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating due to a malfunction in its electrical system. It is caused by an abnormal rhythm, or arrhythmia. Anyone can suffer a cardiac arrest and it can happen at any time and without warning. Symptoms include unresponsiveness, loss of consciousness, lack of pulse and stopping breathing. In contrast, a heart attack can be thought of as a problem with the heart's plumbing - it occurs when an artery supplying the heart becomes blocked. This causes the heart muscle to begin to die slowly while the patient usually remains awake and alert.","Emma Ross, 10, stopped breathing when her father came to collect her from school in February .

The Prime Minister will award £1million to the person who solves the biggest problem of our time – we just have to figure out what it is first. David Cameron will today launch the global competition asking the brightest minds of the world to identify and solve humanity’s biggest challenge, hoping the result will change the world. The Prime Minister will announce the prize fund at the G8 Innovation Conference ahead of next week's meeting of leaders from the world's richest countries. It is hoped competition will result in the creation of revolutionary technologies such as new forms of low-carbon travel or advances in medical science to create replacement limbs. A Downing Street source said: ‘We want people to think big. What does the world need and how can we achieve that? 'We are looking for the next penicillin, aeroplane or worldwide web. ‘Can we grow limbs or create universal low-carbon travel? 'Something that is going to really revolutionise what we do and how we live our lives - sending us sprinting ahead in the global race.’ The initiative is inspired by the Longitude Prize set by the British government in 1714 which promised £20,000 to the person who mastered the challenge of calculating longitude at sea to help maritime navigation. Astronomer Royal Lord Rees will chair the new Longitude Committee, with £500,000 pledged by innovation organisation Nesta to support its work.

"A couple who tried to extort cash from an amateur photographer by threatening to expose his allegedly sleazy lifestyle are facing prison. Garry Faulds, 21, and his fiancée Laura Colquhoun, 17, hatched a plot to force the 53-year-old to hand over large amounts of money. The High Court in Edinburgh heard that the man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, spent more than a year taking pictures of Colquhoun, an aspiring model. Laura Colquhoun, 17, left, and Garry Faulds, 21, right, were convicted yesterday of robbing, assaulting and threatening to extort cash from the man at an address in Edinburgh on August 23 last year . He said she repeatedly performed a sex act on him and received £150 per photo session. The court was told the teenager allowed her boyfriend, dressed in a balaclava and boiler suit, into the local government worker’s Edinburgh home. Once inside, Faulds bound the man’s arms, legs and mouth together with gaffer tape and threatened him with a gas canister. He repeatedly struck the man and told him he was a member of an Ulster loyalist terror group who could cause him serious harm. He also said he would tell the man’s employers that he was taking illegal photographs of underage girls. The man has never been charged or prosecuted in connection with Faulds’ claims. The amateur photographer also claimed Faulds held a gun to his head during his ordeal, but the jury concluded there was not enough evidence to prove this. The pair were only caught after their victim notified his bosses. They brought in the police, who apprehended Faulds and Colquhoun days after the incident last summer. Colquhoun, right, wept, shook and sucked her thumb as prosecutor David Taylor told the court she had no previous convictions. The court heard that Faulds, left, has convictions for minor offences . The story emerged after Faulds and Colquhoun, of Paisley, Renfrewshire, were convicted yesterday of robbing, assaulting and threatening to extort cash from the man at an address in Edinburgh on August 23 last year. The jury took two hours and 40 minutes to return guilty verdicts. Colquhoun wept, shook and sucked her thumb as prosecutor David Taylor told the court she had no previous convictions. The court heard that Faulds has convictions for minor offences. The victim, an amateur photographer, said Laura Colquhoun, 17, pictured, repeatedly performed a sex act on him during their photo shoot sessions . Temporary judge Paul Arthurson, QC, remanded Faulds – described as a prisoner at Low Moss prison in Bishopbriggs, near Glasgow – in custody. Colquhoun was granted bail. Judge Arthurson deferred sentence on the pair for reports. He told them: ‘You have both been convicted of a serious offence which will almost inevitably result in prison sentences.’ At the start of proceedings on Monday, the jury of nine women and six men listened as prosecutors read the contents of a legal document outlining the pair’s actions. The document stated that on August 23 last year at an address in Edinburgh, the duo entered the photographer’s house and detained him there against his will. They assaulted him, repeatedly punching him on the head, causing the man to fall to the ground. They then tied his wrists and dragged him bodily into another room. Faulds then menaced the photographer with a blowtorch and forced him to provide them with passwords and access to his computers and bank accounts. Prosecutors originally stated that a gun was held to the man’s head and that he was forced to contact a bank employee in an attempt to obtain a new access code to an online account. Faulds and Colquhoun then forced him to hand over a bank card and a PIN number and used the card to withdraw £100 from an ATM machine. The pair also robbed him of approximately £800 of money, a quantity of photographic equipment, a set of keys, a Royal Bank of Scotland smart card and smart card reader. Judge Arthurson Colquhoun, left, and Faulds, right: ‘You have both been convicted of a serious offence which will almost inevitably result in prison sentences’ Both Faulds and Colquhoun also threatened to disclose details of the man’s personal life and activities to his employers and other persons unless he gave them cash. The pair then tried to extort a further £500 from him. Faulds and Colquhoun pleaded not guilty to a single charge and did not give evidence to explain their position. References to a firearm being used during the frightening attack were deleted as there was not enough evidence available to the jury to bring a conviction on the claim. The two lovers will be sentenced at the High Court in Edinburgh next month.","Duo hatched a plot to force the man, 53, to hand over large amounts of cash .

"Mounds of sand spotted in the Egyptian desert using Google Earth might be the site of long-lost pyramids. American archaeology . researcher Angela Micol . pinpointed two areas along the Nile basin, 90 miles apart, both . containing unusual shaped mounds last year. There was resistance by other . archaeologists about whether her find was indeed that of unknown . pyramids but now a preliminary ground study using ancient maps suggest that the location might, in fact, be correct. Scroll down for video . Unusual mounds of sand spotted by an American archaeologist on Google Earth last year might hide a pyramid larger than Giza. Antique maps support Anglea Micol's claims and a preliminary ground study of a site, pictured, close to the Nile has revealed cavities and shafts as well as north-facing tunnels . Micol made her discovery at home in North Carolina last year after combing images on Google Earth for a decade. She added that intriguing features including cavities and shafts have now been uncovered in a preliminary exhibition to the site, which is 12 miles from the city of Abu Sidhum along the Nile. The site includes a 620ft-wide triangular plateau that's almost three times the size of the Great Pyramid at Giza. If it is genuine, it could be the  largest pyramid ever discovered. She has also discovered that the formations are labelled as pyramids on a number of rare, antique maps, Discovery News reported. Micol's . extraordinary claim attracted criticism from a number of archaeological . and geological authorities who were skeptical that a tool like Google . Earth could lead to a real discovery. They reportedly dismissed the unusual mounds as anomalies or windswept rock formations that are common in the desert. The mounds discovered by Angela Micol are listed as pyramids on 34 antique maps owned by Medhat Kamal El-Kady, former ambassador to the Sultanate of Oman and his wife Haidy Farouk Abdel-Hamid, a former counselor of the Egyptian presidency, pictured . Years ago archaeologists reportedly tried to dig on one of the mounds, pictured, but struck hard stone that lead researcher Mohamed Aly Soliman thinks might have been granite . Micol said: 'After the buzz simmered down, I was . contacted by an Egyptian couple who claimed to have important historical . references for both sites.' Keen collectors of maps, Medhat Kamal El-Kady, former ambassador to the Sultanate of Oman and his wife Haidy Farouk Abdel-Hamid, a former counselor of the Egyptian presidency, said that the formations spotted by Micol were labelled as pyramids in several of their antique documents and maps. They told Discovery News they have 34 maps and 12 documents written by scientists and officials that support Micol's claims. The archaeologist also identified a second group of possible pyramids near the Fayum Oasis and three maps have since been identified to suggest that the four mounds hide ancient treasures. This photo was taken of a hole that was dug by the locals around the site of the mysterious sandy mounds. The site is believed to be haunted with several stories claiming the area contains 'great magic' One of the maps was drawn by an engineer of Napoleon Bonaparte. The couple said: 'They would be the greatest pyramids known to mankind. 'We would not exaggerate if we said the finding can overshadow the Pyramids of Giza'. Their documents suggest that the pyramids at Fayum were deliberately buried in a bid to strike them from memory, however the site has not yer been investigated by archeologists. However, Mohamed . Aly Soliman, who led the preliminary expedition to the site near Abu . Sidhum said the mounds are made of different layers not belonging the . the surrounding landscape, suggesting that they were indeed made by . Egyptians deliberately trying to bury a structure. He told Fox News that local people living near the mounds have suspected that they harbour ancient secrets for a while. As well as the larger mounds, the expedition team believes the site also features a temple or row of tombs next to the the mounds. They are shown in the red rectangle on this image created using false colour imaging technique developed by Micol . Years ago they reportedly tried to dig on one of the mounds but struck hard stone that Sidhum thinks might be granite. Mr Soliman said: 'What made us sure those mounds are hiding pyramids was a special cavity and metal detector we used over the mounds.' He said that the detector revealed an underground tunnel pointing north on both the big mounds, which is hopeful as most known Egyptian pyramids have north-facing entrances. Micol reportedly said that the Egyptian team thinks they have identified a temple close to the site and a row of possible tombs. To finance the exploration of the two mysterious sites, Micol has set up the Satellite Archaeology Foundation and started a crowd funding campaign. She hopes to journey to Egypt with a team of American scientists to prove if the sites she found on her computer are indeed those of ancient pyramid complexes. Vast: The giant triangular plateau near Abu Sudhum is three times the size of the great Pyramid of Giza . Smaller mounds found by Ms Micol still measure up to 330 feet across . Micol's 'second site' has four-sided 'pyramidal area', surrounded by further raised mounds . If the site, 12 miles from the city of Abu Sidhum, does include the remains of a genuine pyramid, it would be the largest ever discovered. The discovery was made by archeological researcher Angela Micol, from North Carolina . Just after her discovery last year, Micol said: 'Upon closer examination of the formation, this mound . appears to have a very flat top and a curiously symmetrical triangular . shape that has been heavily eroded with time.' The second site, 90 miles north, contains a four-sided shape that's 140ft wide. 'It . has a distinct square centre, which is very unusual for a mound of this . size and it almost seems pyramidal when seen from above,' Ms Micol . said. Speaking to Sky . News last year, she added that there were also three smaller mounds: similar to . the diagonal alignment of the Giza Plateau pyramids. 'The images speak for themselves. It's . very obvious what the sites may contain, but field research is needed . to verify they are, in fact, pyramids.' Both sites are significant because almost all the known pyramids were built around Cairo and these sites are much further south. It's . not the first archeological breakthrough to have been made thanks to . Google Earth - in May two years ago American Egyptologist Dr Sarah Parcak . identified 17 lost pyramids. And Micol herself has used the program to discover a possible underwater city off the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico. Pyramids were first built in Egypt in the 28th century BC as tombs for the nation's Pharoahs. The most famous Egyptian pyramids are those found at Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo. Vast and elaborate structures they took many years and up to 100,000 workers to construct. To date there are 138 known pyramids in Egypt. 2700BC - The first stone pyramid was built at Saqqara, just south of Giza, for the pharaoh Djoser. Unlike the later pyramids, it was made by building layers of stone on top of each other, so it resembled a set of steps. 2600BC - The Great Pyramid of Giza was built as a tomb for the Pharoah Khufu (Cheops). Standing 147 metres hihg and weighing an estimated 6,500,000 tonnes, it's the largest ever discovered. 2575-2150BC - The golden age of pyramids. Hundreds were constructed around Cairo. The new discovery is significant because almost all the 138 known pyramids are located near Cairo. Ms Micol's pyramid sites are much further south. Almost all the 138 known pyramids are located around Giza, in the outskirts of Cairo. Ms Micol finds are far further south, near Faiyum and Abu Sidhum . Square mound: A 150ft-wide truncated mound that Ms Micol located near the ancient and abandoned town of Dima .

The plight of the Yazidi people worsened today as the Islamic State - forermly called ISIS - threatened a fresh wave of violence against the Yazidi religious minority in Iraq, saying they will execute 300 families whom they have surrounded in northern Iraq. They had already taken hostage hundreds of Yazidi women in their stronghold city of Mosul on Friday, amid warnings that they had 'vicious plans' for their captives. Fighters for the Islamic State (IS), formerly known as ISIS, continue to lay siege to a mountain near the Turkish border, where as many as 50,000 of the minority - considered apostates and devil-worshippers by IS - have been holed up without food or water. They today received aid from Kurdish and American forces, who have intervened to protect the embattled minority group after an international outcry. Relief: Peshmerga and U.S. forces also delivered aid today - left a young boy is given food while, right, a girl prepares to receive longed-for water from a jerry can . Carried to salvation: A child needs to be lifted up by a comrade on the long journey away from the barren Sinjar mountain range . Hiking through the heat: With armed escort, hundreds of the Yazidi people were able to get off of the Sinjar mountains . Distressed: The Yazidi had been trapped on the mountainside for days with hardly any supplies . Kicking up dust: The Peshmerga intervention follows aid drops by the U.S. and Kurds . Desperate . masses: Stranded Yazidi men, women and children rush towards a Kurdish . helicopter carrying aid today, as IS fighters surround mount Sinjar . Tearful: Some children were carried off to safety, but thousands of the religious minority remains stranded on the mountainside . Under fire: The film crew, embedded with the Kurdish fighters, also saw a firefight between the helicopter gunner and IS forces with anti-aircraft weapons . Persecuted: Yazidi children (pictured) have taken to sheltering in the holy valley of Lalish, while others trapped in the Sinjar Mountains were flown renewed supplies by the U.S. today. The religious minority is not alone in being threatened by the militants, who also say Christians and Shia Muslims are heretics and should convert . Plight: Left, a Yazidi woman and a young baby shelter in Lalish, the religion's holy valley in northern Iraq. Right: A Yazidi girl who has escaped to the city of Sirnak, Turkey . Masses of desperate, crying Yazidis were filmed today by a crew from Rudaw news perched in a Kurdish helicopter as water and supplies were dropped, while the chopper came under fire from IS troops below. American plans also dropped supplies, and RAF helicopters were today dispatched to do the same. The latest threat to the three hundred families - who live in the villages of Koja, Hatimiya and Qaboshi - came after the Sunni militant group surrounded them, according to a Yazidi politician. It came as U.S. President Barack Obama said more air strikes were likely around the Sinjar Mountains where the Yazidis are trapped - and refused to give a timetable for how long the offensive might take. The U.S. and Iraqi governments have stepped up our military assistance to Kurds as they wage this fight,' he said. 'American aircraft are positioned to strike IS terrorists around the mountain to help forces in Iraq break the seige and rescue those who are trapped there.' He insisted he was pursuing a 'broader strategy' aimed at 'preventing an act of genocide'. 'Ultimately only Iraqis can ensure the stability and security of Iraq', he said. 'The United States can't do it for them.' But he added: 'We will protect our American citizens in Iraq whether they're diplomats, civilians or military. If these terrorists threaten our facilities or our personnel we will take action to protect our people. Threat: Islamic State fighters have continued their relentless sweep through Iraq, causing refugees to flee and carrying out brutal executions on their enemies . 'Long-term project': President Barack Obama said today that American involvement, which began yesterday with targeted air strikes, could prove protracted . How events unfolded: Yesterday marked a landmark campaign by the U.S., its first incursion into Iraq by air since troops pulled out of the country in 2011 . 'We will continue to provide military assistance and advice to the Iraqi government as they battle these terrorists so they cannot establish a safe haven. 'This morning I spoke with Prime Minister Cameron of the UK and President Hollande of France and I'm pleased that both leaders agree with our strong support. Once again America is proud to act alongside our closest friends and allies.' The haul on the C130 Hercules aircraft includes clean water, tents and tarpaulins for up to 75,000 people. A second plane left this afternoon - but the Ministry of Defence has been keen to stress there are no desires to enter another war. A spokesman told MailOnline today: 'We're talking about a humanitarian mission, not a military one'. And Britain has Special Forces in the region working with US counterparts, identifying potential targets for further air strikes aimed at stopping the advances of Islamists towards Kurdish areas or Baghdad. Many SAS men speak Arabic and know Iraq's mountains and cities well after a decade of missions. An MoD spokesman said: 'We do not comment on the movements of Special Forces'. Strikes: This images show the moment American fighter jets dropped their 500lbs payload on Islamic State outside Irbil yesterday . Smoke rising: There were two strikes launched less than two hours apart yesterday, which targeted mortar emplacements and a convoy . Yesterday extremists captured hundreds of Yazidi women in Mosul and held them in schools while thousands of other civilians fled in fear, according to officials. Kami Amin, a spokesman for Iraq's human rights ministry, said: 'We think that the terrorists by now consider them slaves and they have vicious plans for them. 'We think that these women are going to be used in demeaning ways by those terrorists to satisfy their animalistic urges in a way that contradicts all the human and Islamic values.' Escorted by two Navy fighter jets this morning, three planes dropped 72 bundles of supplies for the refugees trapped in the Sinjar Mountains in northern Iraq, where they are trying to escape to Turkey. The extremists' 'campaign of terror against the innocent, including the Yazidi and Christian minorities, and its grotesque and targeted acts of violence bear all the warning signs and hallmarks of genocide,' said U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. 'For anyone who needed a wake-up call, this is it.' To the rescue: An RAF C130 Hercules is pictured above taking off from Camp Bastion in Iraq, laden with aid for the stranded Yazidi refugees . London calling: Britain also joined in the aid efforts in Iraq - pictured above is an RAF Hercules being loaded with drinking water and tents for the beleagured Yazidis . Locked in: An aid worker piles the packages into the Hercules - they are due to be dropped from the skies above Iraq, where as many as 50,000 are stranded . The U.S. bombing yesterday was followed up by a second round of airstrikes near Irbil, the city where officials said the artillery would have been used. According to the U.N., more than 500,000 people have been displaced by the violence in Iraq since June, bringing the total this year to well over a million. Expanding from their stronghold of Mosul, Islamic State have captured a string of towns and Iraq's largest hydroelectric dam and reservoir in recent weeks. The group captured Mosul in June then launched a blitz towards the south, sweeping over Sunni-majority towns almost to the capital, Baghdad. It already holds large parts of western Iraq and neighboring Syria, and Iraqi government forces crumbled in the face of the assault but have since been able to prevent the militants from advancing into Shiite-majority areas. In the north, Kurdish fighters have been the main line of defense against the radicals but they are over-stretched and under-resourced. In contrast to Washington's decision to invade Iraq more than a decade ago, both the airdrop and the authorization of military action against the Islamic State group were widely welcomed by Iraqi and Kurdish officials fearful of the militants' advance. 'We thank Barack Obama,' said Khalid Jamal Alber, from the Religious Affairs Ministry in the Kurdish government. The International Rescue Committee said it was providing emergency medical care for up to 4,000 dehydrated Yazidis, mostly women and children, who survived without food or water for up to six days hiding in the Sinjar mountains before fleeing to a refugee camp in Syria, where a civil war is raging. Officials in Britain, Germany and elsewhere pledged financial aid to support humanitarian efforts in Iraq, and several top European officials supported Obama's decision to intervene with airstrikes.

"Moments don't get any more special than this one. A seven-week old baby hears for the first time and rewards his delighted parents with his very first smile. The heart warming video shows Victorian couple Michelle and Toby Lever overwhelmed with emotion at the 'truly amazing' moment a specialist fits their gorgeous baby Lachlan with a hearing aid. Now the video has gone viral worldwide, with more than 159,000 likes and 130,000 shares on Facebook. ‘I am so happy that we can share our magic moment with the world,’ Ms Lever told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I hope it can give some other families the realisation everything is going to be okay.’ Scroll down for video . A still from the  video, which shows Lachlan sharing his first smile at seven weeks old, as his hearing aid allows him to hear his father's voice . Lachlan gives a very sweet surprised expression when the hearing aid finally allows him to hear . Lachlan shares a smile with his mother, Michelle, who is moved to tears with happiness for her little boy. 'My baby's world opened up!' 'When they turned the headphones on and Lachlan smiled and his face lit up, it was the most magical thing I’d ever seen in my life,' said Ms Lever. 'I had never been more happy in my life.' Although the touching moment only came to light in the last week, the video was filmed in July 2012. ‘(The attention) has all come completely out of the blue. It started last Thursday, but it’s happening so quickly. I went to bed on Saturday with six thousand likes and when I woke up on Sunday there were 40 thousand!’ said Ms Lever. A newborn screening test allowed the Lever family to discover Lachlan's hearing disability from a young age. The Levers are grateful it was picked up so early, as they have been able to support their little boy and give him all the care he needs for his hearing impairment from birth . ‘It's such a happy, special moment. My baby’s world just opened up, it was so emotional. Now that it’s gone viral I'm reliving that moment all over again,’ said Ms Lever. Ms Lever wants other mothers to find hope in not only the video, but from the uplifting update about the wonderful, full life her son is leading - chatting to his sisters and singing and dancing to music. The tiny cherub in the clip is now a very cheeky toddler, who is adored by his parents and two big sisters, Chloe, 9, and Jessica, 6. 'He is the biggest chatterbox out there. He's only two so there’s a lot is gibberish that you can't understand, but when he’s telling you something, he makes sure you understand,' said Ms Lever. 'I will make sure he can reach his full potential, I'm willing to travel to the moon and back for him. 'It doesn’t matter that his specialist school is at Blackburn, which is an hour and 20 mins away. I will do anything it takes to help him.' Once Lachlan started smiling, it appears he never stopped! A photograph of the now two-year-old, who is a very cheeky 'chatterbox' according to his mother, and meeting all his milestones 'on-par' with other children his age . The family are absolutely thrilled with the happy life their son is able to lead. His mother says she is moved to tears when she witnesses the joy he experiences when he hears music. ‘He absolutely loves songs, it’s the most beautiful thing to watch,’ Ms Lever told Daily Mail Australia. 'In the car when we put on music, he’ll try to sing and wave his arms around like he’s dancing. ‘He absolutely loves to dance with my girls, it's wonderful’ said the doting Mum. ‘Lachlan continues to amaze us with his speech development.' Michelle Lever adores her son and is so proud of the little boy that 'inspires' her entire family . ‘We have learnt that Lachlan is no different to any other child. 'He just wears hearing aids which now seem invisible to us, to his family and friends.’ Ms Lever says although she was distraught when Lachlan was first diagnosed, she now loves the hearing aids that are such a crucial part of his life. ‘When he was first diagnosed and I didn't really have my head around the idea yet, I hoped no one would notice his hearing aids. I didn’t want him to feel different. ‘But I love when people talk to me about them now. I show him off, I think they really suit him! They’re just another part of him.' Lachlan loves to sing - especially 'happy birthday'. Here he is pictured on his second birthday with his parents and his older sisters, Chloe and Jessica . Mr and Mrs Lever did not know what to expect when it was first discovered that their baby boy had hearing loss during the newborn screening tests. Lachlan was diagnosed with moderately severe sensorineural hearing impairment in both ears at four weeks old and fitted with his first hearing aid three weeks later. ‘When we first heard of Lachlan's diagnosis, I was completely shattered and cried for 12 hours straight. I was so worried about what the future would hold for our son,’ said Michelle. ‘I thought Lachlan would not be able to talk, make friends and I was worried he would get teased. I now know that whilst those thoughts were completely normal, they are not true.‘ . Michelle didn't need to worry with Lachlan saying his first words at around six months old. Not only is Lachlan doing well with his learning – he is on par with the other children his age and meeting every milestone. 'Lachlan's most recent assessment by (his school) Tarayle's speech therapist showed that his speech and language were age appropriate. We are extremely proud of our gorgeous little boy.' Lachlan getting reading for his ECG: An electrocardiogram, which is a medical test that detects cardiac heart abnormalities. He undergoes many health checks, but is healthy and surprising his family with his wonderful communication and social skills. The Levers found there was a lot of support and information available to help them choose how to approach life with a child with a hearing impairment. 'Soon after Lachlan was diagnosed, we did lots of research and educated ourselves as to what was the best path for Lachlan and our family. 'We decided we wanted Lachlan to grow up in the 'hearing world' and thus decided not to learn sign language but join the Early Intervention Service Tarayle, the Oral Language Centre for deaf children. 'We have received an incredible amount of emotional support and expert advice from Tarayle. But there so many options, this is just what works for our family.' Photos show Lachlan is always sharing his cheeky smile with the world - not just on camera. Despite his hearing impairment, Lachlan is an outgoing little boy who is always 'happy and smiling.' The Levers say early diagnosis has made all the difference for their son. 'We believe that due to Lachlan receiving his hearing aids at such a young age, (we can) feel confident that Lachlan will attend a mainstream school with his sisters and reach his full potential,' said Ms Lever. 'He definitely wouldn't be able to develop normal speech without hearing aids.' Lachlan's behaviour changed almost immediately once he started wearing his hearing aids. 'He became a lot more interactive, there were more smiles and eye contact. He was vocalising and being expressive,' explained Ms Lever. 'The Newborn Hearing Test is so vital, if it wasn't for the test we might not have picked up on his hearing difficulties for another two or three years. 'I can't believe they could diagnose him at four weeks of age - he was barely doing anything but sleeping and drinking!' said Ms Lever. Michelle Lever and baby Lachlan, taken when Lachlan was a newborn . Ms Lever says she is thrilled to be able to help her son to meet his full potential, but to her he was always perfect. 'I didn't need him to be able to hear me to bond with him. Lachlan and I have always had that close bond. 'We were able to love and adore him with cuddles before he could hear us. 'We are so proud of him. His hearing disability is a part of his life, but I hope he won't feel different. We accept that and hope everyone else will too,' said Ms Lever. Lachlan's mother Michelle watches over her gorgeous newborn in the hospital . Lachlan as a baby, with his doting sisters Chloe and Jessica . Lachlan's mother says she knows how lonely and confusing it can be when your child is diagnosed with a hearing impairment, and admits that she felt 'shattered' at the time. She hopes parents in similar situations can find hope in the photos of her son and his cheeky grin. 'I want them to realise that there is alot of support and help available to them and it is extremely important that they link into an Early Intervention Service, such as Tarayle. 'Above all, be positive, proactive and spend as much time as possible with your baby and never forget that your child is the same child they were before you found out they were hearing impaired. 'There’s no such thing as a silly questions. Ask them all. 'And remember, everything is going to be okay!'

"A military charity launched a worldwide hunt today to track down the owner of a damaged pocket watch which is believed to have saved the life of an RAF servicewoman in World War Two - by stopping a bullet. The solid silver timepiece, which was made in the Victorian age, was discovered in a box of donated items left anonymously at a forces charity shop. A perfect bullet-shaped crater is evident in the protective flip cover of the watch which also damaged the 11’clock marking on the clock face. The 'bullet-damaged' WWII solid silver timepiece, which was made in the Victorian age, was discovered in a box of donated items left anonymously at a forces charity shop in Leominster, Herefordshire . A perfect bullet-shaped crater is evident in the protective flip cover of the watch, which belonged to RAF servicewoman Pte Hodgson . The case of the watch is inscribed with the name 'Pte Hodgson' alongside the military number 2055250. The final words on the case read: 'Farnboro [sic] Hants.' Official military records reveal Pte Hodgson was a woman who served in the auxiliary core of the RAF which was responsible for delivering newly built planes to military bases across Britain in 1941. A source at the Ministry of Defence said . no further information regarding the identity of the servicewoman could be . provided without a relevant birth or death certificate. It is believed Pte Hodgson came under enemy fire while inside the plane. Official military records reveal Pte Hodgson was a woman who served in the auxiliary core of the RAF which was responsible for delivering newly built planes to military bases across Britain in 1941. Above, servicewoman Diana Barnato Walker  collects a spitfire in Hamble, Hants, in 1945 . They were sleek, beautifully shaped, and earned something of a racy reputation. And that was just the Spitfires they flew. But even . away from the cockpit, the plucky young gals of the World War Two Air . Transport Auxiliary turned plenty of heads as well. In their . hastily adapted uniforms (one even had her jacket tailored in Savile . Row) they became the darlings of the air – and the unsung heroines of . the Battle of Britain. This was . the forgotten army of women who broke through male-dominated barriers . to pilot the aircraft – and to deliver them for service in the front . line. It was a . job that perfectly suited the Attagirls, as they became known, and not . just because they boosted the war effort with such pluckiness and . enthusiasm. Their . petite frames fitted the cramped interior of the Spitfire so snugly it . was, as one put it, ‘like wearing a well-fitting dress’. Only 164 women were allowed into the ATA. Back . then, they had to show plenty of determination to convince military . bosses that women were up to the task. But once accepted, they said, . they were treated no differently from the men. The ATA . delivered more than 308,000 aircraft from factories to airfields, also . returning damaged aircraft for repair. Sometimes the Attagirls would be . given only 30 minutes with a handbook before taking off in an unfamiliar . plane. Losses were considerable, with one in six becoming a casualty at . one stage. The role . of the ‘Spitfire Girls’ was largely overlooked until 2008, when the . then Prime Minister Gordon Brown was persuaded to honour them with a . commemorative badge. Churchill . and his government, however, never underestimated their contribution. Lord Beaverbrook, then his aircraft production minister, declared: ‘They . were soldiers fighting in the struggle just as completely as if engaged . on the battlefront.’ Military experts have identified the bullet which caused the dent as a 30mm calibre round - ammunition used in the MK108 auto-cannon which was mounted on German aircraft fighter planes. It is believed the watch saved the life of whoever was wearing it after the round ricocheted off the watch - which was traditionally worn in the breast pocket of service personnel. The watch was found dumped in the bottom of a box which was donated to the Forces Support charity, in Leominster, Herefordshire, on Saturday, March 3. Founder and chief executive of the charity, Bill McCance said: 'It is most remarkable - it has probably saved someone’s life. 'There’s a strong possibility that it has come from a mid-air fight rather than being fired ground-to-air. 'It’s hit the watch straight on and the case has taken the full impact - it would only have done this if the person had been on the ground or if it had been air to air. 'I’ve never had anything like it in 28 years in the second-hand trade, not at auction or in a shop window. 'After taking advice from two military experts including a former SAS soldier, it looks like the bullet has hit the watch and shattered the enamel, the copper case and the workings. 'They both agreed that it had stopped something with quite a high velocity. 'When the actual story comes out, I think it will be quite a romantic one, especially as women in the auxiliary core did fly planes around the country to deliver them once they were built. 'It could have saved the life of someone who was delivering one of the planes.' It is also possible the watch was given to Pte Hodgson’s squaddie sweetheart whose life could have been saved during a bloody frontline battle. Mr McCance, 45, added: 'It could have belonged to someone’s sweetheart - the person may have moved on since but I’m sure the memory is still very strong. 'It would be nice to get it back to the family of the person that it saved. 'I’ve read about rare finds like this in the paper but never actually discovered one myself. 'It’s the sort of thing you see in a film, not in a box of bric-a-brac.' The charity is now desperately trying to track down either the owner of the watch or the person who donated it. Mr . McCance said: 'It isn’t the sort of thing we would look to sell, so if . the owner doesn’t come forward we will probably have it on display in . the shop or on the counter. 'The . story should really still be alive in someone’s heart - it’s not the . sort of thing you would hear about and forget in a hurry.' Do you know the full identity of the watch owner?

"Manchester City will target Ross Barkley again next summer after their first bid for the England star failed. The champions were quoted an astonishing £50million for Barkley by Everton when they inquired in June, almost double their valuation of the player. City manager Manuel Pellegrini and football director Txiki Begiristain were not interested in pursuing a deal at that price. However, they still believe Barkley is a perfect fit for the club and will attempt to re-open talks with Everton at the end of the season. Manchester City will target Ross Barkley again next summer after their first bid for the England star failed . City only spent a net £9m in the summer and Pellegrini knows he has money for transfers. He is also a striker short after Alvaro Negredo returned to Spain for personal reasons, and Pellegrini is keen to buy English players, given that the club do not expect their new academy system to bear fruit for two or three seasons. City are aware English players tend to be hugely overpriced, as Manchester United’s £31m deal for defender Luke Shaw and Liverpool’s purchase of Adam Lallana would seem to illustrate. The club have also had their fingers burnt, with major domestic signings Adam Johnson, Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair all failing to live up to expectations. However, City need to ensure their quota of English players falls within domestic and European guidelines, and their research into Barkley’s lifestyle and temperament have shown him to be exactly what they require. Everton are sure to resist City’s advances but the Merseyside club’s recent history does show that they will often sell one high-profile player per summer. Manuel Pellegrini (right, talking to James Milner) baulked at the £50million quoted by Everton for Barkley . Vincent Kompany (right, embracing John Terry) thinks Frank Lampard's equaliser could be crucial . Lampard scored late on as 10-man Manchester City drew against Chelsea at the Etihad Stadium . City’s first-team squad contains two England internationals in goalkeeper Joe Hart and midfielder James Milner. Both will be offered new deals, with the club playing down suggestions over the weekend that Hart’s future at the Etihad Stadium is in doubt. Vincent Kompany believes Frank Lampard’s late equaliser against Chelsea on Sunday could prove crucial in City’s bid to retain the Barclays Premier League title. The Belgian star said: ‘Ever since I’ve been at this club, seasons and big moments have been decided on small events like this so I will never under-estimate what it could mean to our season. ‘He has such quality — the goal he scored is probably something you would have seen for the last 15 years in the Premier League. ‘He is so clever, still extremely motivated and he has the experience to keep cool in vital moments. ‘We are under pressure, we’re down to 10 men, how many players would’ve scored that goal? That’s ultimately what you need.’ Meanwhile, City’s first-team squad will move into the club’s new training ground opposite their stadium in just three weeks. A source said: ‘It’s a jaw-dropping facility. Probably the best in Europe.’","Manuel Pellegrini baulked at the price asked for by Everton in the summer .

"President Barack Obama insisted on Tuesday that he'll do 'what's necessary' to destroy terrorists who 'plot against America' but warned it will 'take time' - hours after launching airstrikes in Syria. 'Once again it must be clear to anyone who would plot against America and try to do Americans harm that we will not tolerate safe havens for terrorists who threaten our people,' the president said. Obama's remarks followed an announcement from the Pentagon on Monday night that the U.S. and a coalition of five Arab nations launched airstrikes on the Islamic State in Syria. The U.S. also bombed a separate al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist group it believed posed an 'imminent threat to American interests', the Pentagon said. Speaking from the White House lawn ahead of trip to New York for a United Nations meeting, Obama said the involvement of the Arab nations 'makes it clear to the world that this is not America's fight alone.' The president's decision to authorize strikes in Syria earned the support of even his top critics in Congress, many of whom have been urging the president to bomb the country for months. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama delivered a statement on the recent airstrikes against ISIS on the South Lawn of the White House this morning before taking off for a United Nations meeting in New York. American jets began bombing ISIS targets in Syria overnight Tuesday and focused on the stronghold of Raqqa . The United States government released this footage of Tomahawk missiles being fired from the USS Arleigh Burke - a guided missile destroyer stationed in the Red Sea - into Syria . The lawmakers made a point of noting that Obama waited far too long to take their advice but said belated action was better than no action. According to a statement issued by U.S. Central Command, CENTCOM, the U.S., along with Jordan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain, carried out strikes overnight against Islamic extremists in Syria. CENTCOM said Tuesday that the joint 'strikes destroyed or damaged multiple ISIL targets in the vicinity of Ar Raqqah, Dayr az Zawr, Al Hasakah, and Abu Kamal and included ISIL fighters, training compounds, headquarters and command and control facilities, storage facilities, a finance center, supply trucks and armed vehicles. 'All aircraft safely exited the strike areas,' the statement said. 'America's proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with these nations on behalf of our common security,' Obama said in his own statement today. Acting on it's own, the U.S. launched an additional eight air strikes last night, CENTCOM said today, on the Al Qaeda linked Khorasan Group to 'disrupt imminent attack plotting against the United States and Western interests.' Those strikes were made on targets west of Allepo. The President's decision to bomb terrorist cells in Syria on Monday was not entirely unexpected. Obama indicated in an address to the nation on September 10 that he would soon expand military strikes from Iraq to the neighboring country. 'I will not hesitate to take action against ISIL in Syria, as well as Iraq,' he said. 'This is a core principle of my presidency: If you threaten America, you will find no safe haven.' Obama reiterated today that the U.S. and a 'broad coalition' of 40 nations would work to cut off the Islamic State's funding and 'counter its hateful ideology' in addition to taking military action against the radical terrorist group. The U.S. has been attacking the barbaric terrorist group by air since early August. Already the U.S. has launched roughly 190 strikes on the group as part of it's effort to 'destroy and degrade' it. A chorus of of lawmakers, including some of the president's biggest detractors, lauded Obama on Monday for ramping up action against ISIS and called on the rest of the country to get behind him.

Multiple targets in multiple locations: A map of where the airstrikes took place overnight on ISIS compounds and also training facilities and explosive factories of the al Qaeda affiliated Khorasan Group . 'This is a very, very positive step and I think it’s really important for all of us to come together,' Republican Rep. Pete King said Monday evening on The Kelly File. 'Whatever happened in the past, that’s behind us.' House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mike McCaul concurred in a statement on Monday. 'When in times of war and of peace it is important that we come together as a nation,' the Texas Republican said. 'To defeat ISIS, we must cut off the head of the snake, which exists in Syria.' Arguing that the strikes on ISIS in Syria are 'long overdue,' House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, a Republican from California, said in a statement on Tuesday that an 'effective campaign to destroy ISIL can’t be limited to one side of the border between Iraq and Syria.' 'While this initial attack will be a big psychological blow to the terrorist group, an air campaign will need to be major and sustained,' he said. Likewise, House Speaker John Boehner said his support for the move was based on his 'understanding that this is just one step in what must be a larger effort to destroy and defeat this terrorist organization.' Obama said this morning that he was 'pleased' to know he has bipartisan support for the actions he's taking. 'America's always stronger when we stand united,' he said, 'and that unity sends a powerful message to the world that we'll do what's necessary to defend our country.' Syrians inspect a shop damaged after a drone crashed into a communication station in Raqqa . Islamist State militants contend that the drone, which crashed in the early hours of this morning, belonged to the U.S. While lawmakers from both political parties agree that Obama needs to go on offense against ISIS in both Iraq and Syria, there's no consensus on Obama's ability to continue strikes in Iraq beyond October 7 without first receiving approval from Congress. On that day the president's authority to engage in military action in the country under the War Powers Act will expire. The 1973 legislation mandates that the president must receive Congress' blessing to go to war with a country for more than 60 days. Obama declared last month that he has the jurisdiction to bomb both Syria and Iraq through an Authorization for Use of Military Force resolution passed in the wake of 9/11. That resolution gave the President of the United States permission to use 'all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.' The White House says that the Islamic State's rise from Al Qaeda provides the legal justification for Obama to carry out airstrikes against any group in any country outside the U.S. that he believes is a terrorist threat. Resistance to Obama using the 13-year-old AUMF cuts across party lines in Congress, with top Dems like House Armed Services ranking member Adam Smith and libertarians like Sen. Rand Paul siding against the White House. 'The Constitution is very clear. The power to declare war resides in Congress,' Paul tweeted after Obama's address to the nation earlier this month. Both chambers of Congress recessed last week until after November's federal elections without voting to authorize continued strikes on ISIS. Devastation: Fighters from Al Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front are seen standing among destroyed buildings  in northern Syria. The group were caught up in airstrikes  which were actually targetting at their Al Qaeda allies, the  Khorasan Group . President Barack Obama, accompanied by Secretary of State John Kerry, to his left, National Security Adviser Susan Rice, seated to his right, and US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power, left of Kerry, met with representatives of five Arab nations that participated in the strikes - Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, United Arab Emirates and Iraq - in New York today . Smith revealed Tuesday that House Democrats will consider asking the Speaker to reconvene Congress in order to take a vote in light of Monday's dramatic expansion of U.S. military efforts against the Islamic State. 'This is, without question, war,' Smith told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow in a phone interview on Tuesday morning. 'This is something that Congress should authorize.' Republican Rep. Bradley Byrne said in a tweet Tuesday morning that while he does 'believe air strikes in Syria are necessary' he continues to be 'concerned' Obama does not have the legal authority to take military action in Syria. 'A new ""Authorization for Use of Military Force"" is sorely needed,' Byrne said in a follow-up tweet. 'I would support returning to Washington to debate and vote on a new AUMF.' Meanwhile, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio noted in a statement that he's 'argued for months' that President Obama 'has the authority to confront' ISIS. 'Defeating this menace to all who value freedom and tolerance will not be easy, but is essential to our security,' he said.","Last night the U.S. and a coalition of five Arab countries took military action against Syria .

"In a surreal scene straight out of the movie The Hangover, a young mountain lion has been caught after trying to walk into a casino in downtown Reno, Nevada, ahead of the breakfast rush on Friday. Nevada Department of Wildlife spokesman Chris Healy says the young male cat's behavior was ‘almost the equivalent of being a stupid teenager.’ Healy said coming-of-age cougars often end up where they shouldn't after being chased out of a territory by adults. Furry troublemaker: A two-year-old mountain lion was tranquilized after being spotted holed up under an outdoor stage outside of Harrah's casino in downtown Reno . Lion's den of sin: The 100-pound cat was spotted by Harrah's guests while trying to negotiate the hotel's revolving door . Guests at Harrah's reported seeing the 100-pound cat trying to slip into the casino just before dawn on Friday. When the animal couldn't negotiate the revolving door, it hid under an outdoor stage in a nearby plaza. State wildlife officials tranquilized the two-year-old cat and on Saturday, it was released into the wild after being tagged for participation in a University of Nevada at Reno study. At around 5:16am on Friday, police started receiving calls about the big cat roaming the area around around the hotel. Officers who arrived on the scene set up a perimeter, warning the public to stay away and shutting down the main road through downtown Reno, KOLO-TV reported. The adolescent cat holed up under a . stage in the Harrah's Plaza in front of the casino. When wildlife . officials responded to the scene, the cougar was tranquilized with three . shots and transported by truck to Nevada Department of Wildlife's field . office in Reno and then to the department’s office in Carson City, the Reno Gazette-Journal reported.. Check-up: A wildlife official is inspecting the cougar's massive fangs after hitting it with three tranquilizing shots . Tagged: The male cat was fitted with a tracking collar that will allow researchers from the University of Nevada at Reno to monitor its movements and habits . The animal was unharmed and no injuries to people were reported. Wildlife experts believe that the young mountain lion likely arrived in Reno along the Truckee River corridor located just a few blocks north of Harrah’s. On Saturday morning, the two-year-old . cougar was released into the Carson Range in the Spooner Summit area . above Lake Tahoe's east shore, Healy said. ‘He . was fully ready to go,’ Healy explained. ‘He was feisty in the trap and . snarled if you got too close. Once he decided to go, he quickly ran off . into the underbrush and was gone.’ Wildlife . biologists said the Carson Range is good area for mountain lions that . features an abundance of mule, deer and smaller prey in the summer. Born free: The adolescent cougar was released into the Carson Range in the Spooner Summit area above Lake Tahoe's east shore . One strike, you're out: Wildlife officials say if the curious cougar is ever spotted in Reno again, it will likely be euthanized . Before the feline was released into its natural habitat, wildlife officials fitted it with a tracking collar that will allow researchers to monitor the cat’s movements and habits. Mountain lion sightings have been reported around Reno in the past, Healy said, but not in the downtown casino area. ‘The best-case scenario is we never see it or hear from it again,’ Healy said, adding the cat probably would be put down if it is spotted in the city again.","The two-year-old male cougar tried to enter through Harrah's revolving door .

"Islamic State has crushed a pocket of resistance to its control in eastern Syria, crucifying two people and executing 23 others in the past five days, a monitoring group said today. The insurgents, who are also making rapid advances in Iraq, are tightening their grip in Syria, of which they now control roughly a third, mostly rural areas in the north and east. Fighters from the al-Sheitaat tribe in eastern Deir al-Zor had tried to resist Islamic State's advance this month, according to residents near the area and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring organisation. Islamic State fighters crucified two Syrian tribesmen as they fled to a nearby village called Shaafa, while 23 others have been executed . In al-Shaafa, a town on the banks of the Euphrates river, Islamic State beheaded two men from the al-Sheitaat clan on Sunday, the Observatory said, and gave residents a 12-hour deadline on Monday to hand over members of the tribe. In other parts of Deir al-Zor province, the militants crucified two men for the crime of 'dealing with apostates' in the city of Mayadin, and two others were beheaded for blasphemy in the nearby town of al-Bulel, the Observatory said. Islamic State, which has fought the Syrian army, Kurdish militias and Sunni Muslim tribal forces, has made rapid gains in Syria since it seized northern Iraq's largest city, Mosul, on June 10, and declared an Islamic caliphate. A fighter from the Islamic State group inspects a military truck in Raqqa . Fighters from extremist Islamic State group during a parade in Raqqa, Syria. Activists have reported two cases of stoning this month in the Syrian northern province of Raqqa . The Observatory said a further 19 men from the al-Sheitaat tribe were executed on Thursday, 18 shot dead and one beheaded, on the outskirts of Deir al-Zor city. It said the men worked at an oil installation. 'No one will now dare from the other tribes to move against Islamic State after the defeat of the al-Sheitaat,' said Ahmad Ziyada al-Qaissi, an Islamic State sympathiser contacted by Skype from Mayadin. Tribal sources say the conflict between Islamic State and the al-Sheitaat tribe, who number about 70,000, flared after Islamic State took over of two oil fields in July. One of those, al-Omar, is the biggest oil and gas field in Deir al-Zor and has been a lucrative source of funds for rebel groups. The head of the al-Sheitaat tribe, Sheikh Rafaa Aakla al-Raju, called in a video message for other tribes to join the fight against Islamic State. Fighters from the Islamic State group stand on top of a military vehicle with anti-aircraft guns in Raqqa . 'We appeal to the other tribes to stand by us because it will be their turn next ... If [Islamic State] are done with us the other tribes will targeted after al-Sheitaat. They are the next target,' he said in the video, posted on YouTube on Sunday. A Syrian human rights activist from Deir al-Zor who fled for Turkey last year said rebels opposed to President Bashar al-Assad had retreated to al-Sheitaat tribal areas from which they had been trying to mount resistance to Islamic State. He said, on condition of anonymity, that the resistance had been crushed in the last few days. 'The situation is very bad, but the people can't repel them,' he said. He added that, in tandem with their violent campaign, Islamic State was distributing gas, electricity, fuel and food to garner local support. 'It is a poor area. They are winning support this way. They won a lot of support this way. They are halting theft and punishing thieves. This is also giving them credibility.,' he said. Another resident of Deir al-Zor, Abdullah al-Noami, said that four al-Sheitaat towns had fallen. 'These areas have fallen into the hands of Islamic State after the withdrawal of the (al-Sheitaat) fighters. The youths who were found were executed or their heads were cut off on the grounds that they fought against Islamic State,' he said. More than 170,000 people have been killed in Syria's civil war, which pits overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad, a member of the Shi'ite-derived Alawite minority, backed by Shi'ite militias from Iraq and Lebanon. The insurgency is split between competing factions, with Islamic State emerging as the most powerful. In Raqqa, Islamic State's power base in Syria, its hold appears to be growing only firmer even as Syrian government forces intensify air strikes on territory held by the group. One Syrian living in an area of Islamic State control near Raqqa said the number of its fighters in the streets had grown dramatically in the last few weeks, particularly since it captured the army's 17th Division at the end of July. The group has levied a tax on non-Muslims, and settled foreign fighters in confiscated homes, said the resident, who asked for anonymity due to security concerns. But despite that, as in Deir al-Zor, it has won a degree of respect among locals by curbing crime using their version law of and order. For youths without work, salaries offered by Islamic State are one of the few sources of income. 'The (Islamic) State has respect and standing and its voice is heard,' said the resident, speaking by Skype.","Islamic State tighten grip on Syria and are making rapid advances in Iraq .

"A disabled Yazidi boy has been rescued from certain death in the Iraqi desert after his parents were left with no choice but to abandon him as ISIS militants forced them to flee their home. The unidentified child, who appears to be about three years old, is paralysed down one side of his body and was found by Kurdish fighters in the desert outside the town of Sinjar in northern Iraq. Doctors believe he was left lying on his back without shelter in 50C temperatures for up to a day, and - due to his paralysis - was unable to move himself to shelter his eyes from the blazing sun. Scroll down for video . Helpless: The unidentified child, who appears to be about three years old, is paralysed down one side of his body and was found by Kurdish fighters in the desert outside the town of Sinjar in northern Iraq . Treatment: Doctors say the child's eyes dried out after spending up to 24 hours staring directly into the sun because his disability meant he was unable to turn his body to face in a different direction . The boy's plight was revealed in a video by the BBC's World Affairs correspondent Paul Wood. The child is now receiving treatment in an unidentified hospital in northern Iraq and is expected to survive - although he may have long-lasting or possibly even permanent damage to his eyesight. Doctors say his eyes dried out after spending up to 24 hours staring directly into the sun because his disability meant he was unable to turn his body to face in a different direction. It is not known exactly why the young boy was abandoned, or where his parents are now, . Some at the hospital believe his mother may have had to make the heartbreaking choice of which child to leave behind when she became too weak to carry them as the family escaped ISIS. One refugee has put forward the view that the boy's mother dropped him and ran off in a panic when ISIS militants began firing at their group. News of the boy's discovery comes amid increasing concern for up to 1,500 Yazidi women currently being held by ISIS. There . are fears that many are being forced to convert to Islam and marry . their abductors after witnesses in the town of Sinjar said younger women . had been separated from the main group.

A Japanese man believed to be a mercenary operating in Syria has been filmed being tied up and interrogated at knifepoint by ISIS jihadists speaking in British accents. Japan says it is investigating claims that one of its citizens has been captured by militants near Aleppo, as evidence emerged that the captured man appeared to be a self-styled security contractor. A video clip posted on YouTube showed a T-shirt clad man lying on the ground being questioned by unidentified persons and responding that he was Japanese and that his name was Haruna Yukawa. He told his captives that he was a journalist and doctor, but reports have subsequently emerged that his name matches that of the chief executive of a self-described 'private mercenary' and military firm. Up to 3,000 women and girls have been kidnapped by the jihadis in the north of Iraq in just a fortnight - and hundreds of men who refuse to convert to Islam are understood to have been massacred. The kidnappings appear to have happened in villages where residents took up arms against ISIS - and the women are being held separately from the men in IS-controlled Tal Afar, east of Mount Sinjar. Some 200,000 people escaped to safety in Iraq's Kurdish region, but others remain on the mountain. Donatella Rovera, Amnesty International's senior crisis response adviser, told the Agence France-Presse news agency: ‘The victims are of all ages, from babies to elderly men and women.’ ‘It seems they took away entire families, all those who did not manage to flee. We fear the men may have been executed.’ Two women - Leila Khalaf and Wadhan Khalaf - were among those kidnapped from Mujamma Jazira village, said their relative Dakhil Atto Solo. He added that the abductions happened after residents tried to resist the IS attack, telling AFP: ‘Of course we tried to defend our villages, but they had much bigger weapons. ‘All we had were our Kalashnikovs. They executed 300 men, and took the women to their prisons.  Only God can save them now.’ Their children, said Mr Solo, were rescued by the family. But the women were in a house surrounded by IS. We had to escape. Now, the children cry for their mothers all the time. ""Mama, mama,"" they wail. But there is no mama, we tell them.’ His comments on the dire situation came . as Islamic extremists shot dead scores of Yazidi men, lining them up in . small groups and opening fire with assault rifles before seizing their . wives and children.

Iraqi troops and Kurdish fighters have reclaimed control of the country's largest dam from ISIS militants who captured it less than two weeks ago, an army spokesman in Baghdad said. The development marks the first major victory for Iraqi and Kurdish troops since U.S. airstrikes began earlier this month - and could significantly boost the morale of forces trying to liberate territory that was overrun by the jihadist group in a lightning advance in June. The Mosul Dam - spanning the Tigris River just north of Iraq's second-largest city - holds great strategic value as the complex supplies electricity and water to a large part of the country. Forces: A Kurdish peshmerga fighter prepares his weapon at his combat position near the Mosul Dam, which security officials say has now been 'fully liberated . Key asset: The dam, located on the Tigris river, supplies electricity and water for irrigation to northern Iraq . Alarmed by the ISIS militants' continued advance and the brutal slaughter of anybody who gets in their way, the U.S. and Iraqi airstrikes pounded the area in the past two days. The U.S. military said its forces conducted nine strikes on Saturday and another 16 yesterday in efforts to help the Iraqis retake the dam. Army spokesman Lt. Gen. Qassim al-Moussawi said Kurdish peshmerga forces and Iraqi anti-terrorism troops 'fully liberated' the dam this morning and 'hoisted the Iraqi flag over it.' Al-Mousawi added that the troops were backed by a joint aerial support, but he didn't specify whether there were any U.S. airstrikes in the area of the dam this morning. The dam is around 30 miles from the city of Mosul, and 280 miles from the Iraqi capital Baghdad . Local residents and others in the area could not immediately be contacted to confirm the security forces' recapture of the dam. The U.S. launched airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq more than a week ago in a bid to halt its advance across the north. But the Sunni militants remain in control of vast swaths of northern and western Iraq, including the city of Mosul, as well as much of northeastern Syria. Some 1.5 million people have been displaced by fighting in Iraq since the Islamic State's rapid advance began in June. The scale of the humanitarian crisis prompted the U.N. to declare its highest level of emergency lasts week. The decision to launch airstrikes marked the first direct U.S. military intervention in Iraq since the last American troops withdrew in 2011. They are widely considered to reflect growing international concern about ISIS' activities.","Unidentified child was discovered in desert near Sinjar by Kurdish fighters .

"Osama Bin Laden was not shot dead by Navy SEALs but instead blew himself up with a suicide belt, the terror leader's former bodyguard has claimed. In a claim that counters previous reports, Nabeel Naeem Abdul Fattah said that the al-Qaeda chief triggered his explosive belt when U.S. Special Forces broke into his compound, killed two of his guards and shot him in the thigh  as part of 'Operation . Geronimo'. Speaking in an interview, Abdul Fattah conceded he had not been present at the time of Bin Laden's death but instead was told 'what had happened' from one of the terror leader's relatives. The account of Bin Laden's death at his Abbotabad compound on May 2, 2011 is being seen as the latest in a string of propaganda by his supporters. Claims: Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, left, was not shot dead by Navy SEALs but instead blew himself up with a suicide belt, according to his former personal guard Nabeel Naeem Abdul Fattah, right . Abdul Fattah told Gulf News he found the official story about the leader's burial at sea 'fishy' and accused US President Barack Obama of lying. He said: 'Bin Laden's body parts were cut into multiple pieces, which is similar to suicide attacks following the bombing so as not to leave any clue to the US forces to identify him.' Abdul Fattah said he had blown himself up to avoid capture and to 'keep his secrets' until death. Abdul Fattah claimed that Bin Laden had been wearing an explosive belt over the last ten years of his life. He was adamant he would not 'give himself up' to the Americans, he added. There have been several accounts of the final hours of the terror leader's death. US Special Forces (SEALs) claimed victory in 'Operation Geronimo', after they raided Bin Laden's Abbotabad compound in Pakistan on May 2, 2011 and 'killed the leader' On film: The shooting was featured in movie Zero Dark Thirty, including this scene showing Navy SEALs seen through the greenish glow of night vision goggles, as they prepare to breach Osama Bin Laden's compound . Nabeel Naeem Abdul Fattah was the leader of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad between 1988 and 1992. The 57-year-old, who was interviewed in Al Zaher, Cairo, did not say when he had been a personal guard to Bin Laden. But he had been locked up by former Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak for 20 years, and was only released from prison in March 2011, shortly after his fall, Gulf News reported. Egypt's Al Jihad organization has been active since the 1970s, with the goal of overthrowing the Egyptian Government and replace it with an Islamic state. It has now broadened its aims to include attacking U.S. and Israeli interests in Egypt and elswehere. Gulf News notes how the organization helped give birth to Al Qaida, and that Abdul Fattah was once 'the right arm' of Ayman Al Zawahiri, who now heads Al-Qaeda. He told the paper that he was the person who sent Mohammad Atta - the lead pilot of the 9/11 attacks - to Afghanistan. Just after midnight on the morning of . May 2, 2011, 23 commandos and their interpreter attacked Bin Laden's . compound. They shot and killed his two bodyguards, one of his sons and . the wife of one bodyguard. The first three soldiers to reach the . top floor of the house, where Bin Laden's bedroom was believed to be, . were 'the point man', 'the shooter' whom magazine Esquire profiled, and . the now-famous Matt Bissonnette, another Team 6 member, whose account . was published in best-selling book No Easy Day, which was written under . the pseudonym Mark Owen. All of these previous three accounts are in agreement. The . Shooter told Esquire that Bin Laden peered through his bedroom door and . the point man shot at and either missed or lightly wounded him, before . tackling two women nearby. The . Shooter claims he then ran alone into the room where he found Bin Laden . hiding behind one of his wives, perhaps using her as a human shield. Seeing a gun 'within reach' he shot the Islamist twice in the head. Another account emerged in March, which claimed that the point man shot and gravely wounded Bin Laden. Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari looks on . as President Obama makes a statement at the . White House in Washington. The bodyguard accused Obama of lying about Bin Laden's body being buried at sea . CNN security analyst Peter Bergen reported that the point man then leapt on the two nearby women - to absorb any explosion in case they were wearing suicide vests. Then two more SEALs went into Bin Laden's bedroom and, seeing he was mortally wounded, finished him off. The account is similar to that given in No Easy Day, where Bissonnette says he was one of the first in the room, saw Bin Laden close to death, then finished him off as he lay on the floor.","Nabeel Naeem Abdul Fattah said he'd not wanted to 'give himself up to US'

"A man convicted of possessing child pornography, a misbehaving politician seeking re-election and a doctor with bad reviews. These are among the flood of people who have already contacted Google demanding that their internet histories be deleted. Earlier this week Europe's highest court ruled people now have the 'right to be forgotten', meaning around 500million internet users could have links which tarnish their reputation removed. An investigation by Mail Online has found a paedophile has asked for stories about his conviction to be taken down from the site while a politician tried to have pieces about his behaviour in office deleted. Scroll down for video . The decision affects 500 million citizens and states that if search services don't comply, they face heavy fines. Google (pictured) began removing search results last month and said it has received more than 70,000 requests since it put a form online on May 30 . A physician who was unhappy about feedback posted on a review site also tried to have links to the page removed. The world's largest search engine is yet to put a process to . handle the expected influx of requests in place after Tuesday's ruling. The decision by European Court of Justice, requires that search services remove information deemed . 'inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant' and failure to do so can . result in fines. 'There's many open questions,' Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt said at the company's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday in response to a question about the ruling and its implications on Google's operations. 'A simple way of understanding what . happened here is that you have a collision between a right to be . forgotten and a right to know. From Google's perspective that's a . balance,' Schmidt said. 'Google believes having looked at the decision, which is binding, that the balance that was struck was wrong.' He was not asked about the recent take-down requests. MailOnline has contacted Google, but the firm has yet to reveal the number of take-down requests it has received. Google will need to build up an 'army of removal experts' in each of the 28 EU countries, including those where Google does not have operations, the source said. Whether those staffers merely remove controversial links or actually judge the merits of individual take-down requests are among the many questions Google is yet to decide, the source said. European citizens can submit take-down requests directly to Internet companies rather than to local authorities or publishers under the ruling. If a search engine elects not to remove the link, a person can seek redress from the courts. The criteria for determining which take-down requests are legitimate is not completely clear from the decision, said Jeffrey Rosen, a law professor at the George Washington University and head of the National Constitution Centre. The ruling was made by the European Union Court of Justice (pictured). It comes after a Spanish man complained an online auction note about his repossessed home infringed his privacy. Google told MailOnline it is 'disappointed' by the ruling and argued it should not be a censor for data held on websites in its index . The ruling seems to give search engines more leeway to dismiss take-down requests for links to webpages about public figures, in which the information is deemed to be of public interest. But search engines may err on the side of caution and remove more links than necessary to avoid liability, said Rosen, a long-time critic of such laws. He was asked by Google to speak to reporters on Tuesday's ruling, but has no formal relationship with the company. Search engines will also have to authenticate requests, he noted, to ensure that the person seeking a link's removal is actually the one he or she claims to be. Under the European Data Protection Regulation, Article 17 includes the ‘right to be forgotten and to erasure’.Under Article 17, people who are mentioned in the data have the right to ‘obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data.'This particularly relates to data about the person when they were a child, when the data is no longer relevant or necessary for the purpose it was collected, the person who owns the content withdraws their consent, the storage period has expired, or if it was gathered illegally.The EU defines ‘data controllers’ as ‘people or bodies that collect and manage personal data.’The EU General Data Protection Regulation means any data controller who has been asked to remove data must ‘take all reasonable steps, including technical measures' to remove it.If a data controller does not take these steps they can be heavily fined. Google is the dominant search engine in Europe, commanding about 93 percent of the market, according to StatCounter global statistics. Microsoft Corp's Bing has 2.4 percent and Yahoo Inc has 1.7 percent. Google has some experience dealing with take-down requests in its YouTube video website, which has a process to remove uploads that infringe copyrights. Google has automated much of the process with a ContentID system that automatically scans uploaded videos for particular content that media companies have provided to YouTube. Google may be able to create similar technology to address the EU requirements, said BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis. Even if Google does not automate the process, the extra cost of hiring staffers is likely to be insignificant to a company that generated roughly $60 billion in revenue last year, Gillis said. If Google were to pay staffers $15 an hour to process take-down requests, for example, the company could get a million hours of work for $15 million, he said. 'It's the cost of doing business for them.' Google has said it is disappointed with the ruling, which it noted differed dramatically from a non-binding opinion by the ECJ's court adviser last year. That opinion said deleting information from search results would interfere with freedom of expression. Yahoo is 'carefully reviewing' the decision to assess the impact for its business and its users, a spokeswoman said in a statement. 'Since our founding almost 20 years ago, we've supported an open and free internet; not one shaded by censorship.' Microsoft declined to comment. Brett Dixon, founder of DP Online Marketing, told MailOnline: 'The news that search engine operators will be subject to a European Union dictat on the right to be forgotten is ludicrous. 'This ruling advocates nobody being responsible for their own actions. Akin to press censorship, it's absolutely wrong that information that is of interest to the general public ought not to be in the public domain. You might as well say to a journalist who's written up a story that they have no right to publish it. 'The danger is that a public figure can behave as badly as they like, but with no consequences whatsoever, the story effectively becomes buried and forgotten about. 'There are a minority of cases whereby an individual is associated with unsolicited negative attention due to factually incorrect information on Google and other search engines, but cases such as these should not dictate the lay of the land for everyone.'","Search engine firm has already received a flood of requests to remove links .

"In a forceful appeal for international cooperation on limiting carbon pollution, President Barack Obama alerted world leaders on Tuesday that the globe's climate is changing faster than efforts to address it. 'Nobody gets a pass,' he declared. 'We have to raise our collective ambition.' Speaking at a United Nations summit, Obama said the United States is doing its part and that it will meet its goal to cut carbon pollution 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020. He also announced modest new U.S. commitments to address climate change overseas. The summit aims to galvanize support for a global climate treaty to be finalized next year. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . No free passes: President Barack Obama said Tuesday that the global community must make a commitment to reduce carbon pollution . Obama's strongest comments came as he sought to unify the international conclave behind actions to reduce global warming. 'The alarm bells keep ringing, our citizens keep marching,' he said. 'We can't pretend we can't hear them. We need to answer the call. 'We need to cut carbon emission in our countries to prevent worse effects, adapt and work together as global community to tackle this global threat before it is too late,' he argued. Obama said the U.S. and China as the largest polluters have a responsibility to lead. But, Obama added, 'No nation can meet this global threat alone.' More than 120 world leaders gathered on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly to organize support for a global climate treaty to be finalized next year in Paris. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the summit's host, asked representatives of nations to come to New York with specific pledges in hand to mitigate climate change, as a way to show they're serious about ambitious emissions reductions in the treaty. Obama's goals at the summit: to convince other nations that the U.S. is doing its part to curb greenhouse gases, and make the case that other major polluters should step up, too. 'It's very clear to the international community that the president is extending considerable political capital at home in order to implement his climate plan, and that's true,' said Nigel Purvis, a U.S. climate negotiator in the administrations of presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. 'The hope is that when we take action, others will do so as well,' Purvis said. Obama addressed the issue as part of the United Nation's climate summit, which was called by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. More than 120 world leaders convened for the meeting aimed at galvanizing political will for a new global climate treaty by the end of 2015 . Demonstrators make their way down Sixth Avenue in New York during the People's Climate March on Sunday. The march, along with similar gatherings scheduled in other cities worldwide, was purposefully scheduled two days before the U.N.'s climate event . Some of the tools the U.S. will offer developing nations were developed by NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey and are intended to help communities use data modeling, forecasting and science to anticipate the effects of climate change and make decisions about the best way to deal with it. Secretary of State John Kerry also announced that the U.S. would contribute $15 million to a World Bank program designed to stimulate funding for projects that reduce methane pollution. But the commitments were modest compared to what some had hoped the U.S. would put forth to show its commitment. By mid-morning, other nations attending the summit had pledged at least $5 billion to help the world become more sustainable. And the development organization Oxfam argued that the U.S. Agency for International Development already incorporates climate change resiliency in its programs. The one-day climate summit isn't formally part of the ongoing negotiations toward the climate treaty, which leaders hope will be more muscular than a lackluster agreement reached in Copenhagen in 2009. The idea is that by involving heads of state early, rather than leaving it to negotiators until the very end, prospects will improve for reaching a strong deal. Kerry attempted to put additional pressure on world leaders on Monday while giving remarks at New York City's Climate Week kick-off event. Calling climate change an 'international security challenge,' Kerry contended that it 'ranks right up there' with poverty and terrorism. 'You can make a powerful argument that it may be, in fact, the most serious challenge we face on the planet because it’s about the planet itself,' Kerry argued. Approximately 100,000 of activists, including prominent actors and former Vice President Al Gore, sought to bring national attention to the issue through a demonstration in New York on Sunday ahead of the U.N. summit. The U.N. Secretary General, Ban, and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio even joined the march, which stretched across two miles of Manhattan. Similar protests also took place in Brussels, Belgium; New Delhi, India; Istanbul, Turkey; and Sydney and Melbourne, Australia on Sunday. De Blasio announced his own city's plan to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent from 2005 levels by 2050 at the NYC event. 'Climate change is an existential threat to New Yorkers and our planet,' de Blasio said. 'Acting now is nothing short of a moral imperative.'","The U.N. Secretary General convened the summit to galvanize support for a global climate treaty to be finalized next year .

"A new teacher in Wagoner, Oklahoma, was arrested on her first day after she showed up at the school both drunk and without pants. School officials called Wagoner police around 9 a.m. on Monday morning to report that Lorie Ann Hill, 49, smelled of alcohol and was also missing the lower half of her clothing. She was discovered slumped over the desk by two teachers in an empty classroom she was claiming was her own, Fox 23 reports. Scroll down for video . Bad teacher: School officials called Wagoner police around 9 a.m. on Monday morning to report that Lorie Ann Hill, 49, pictured, smelled of alcohol and was also missing the lower half of her clothing . By the time police arrived, she was in the principal's office, and someone had managed to find a pair of shorts for her to wear. 'She was found in a room kind of disoriented,' Police Chief Bob Haley told the Tulsa World. 'By the time we got there she was in a room and wearing shorts.' Hill was interviewed by police and admitted she'd been drinking. A search of her car turned up an empty cup that reportedly smelled of vodka. Haley said, however, that there wasn't . enough evidence to prove she drove to the school drunk, and no 'credible . witnesses' at her home. Scene: The incident took place at Wagoner Public School, pictured, on Monday . She therefore escaped a DUI charge but was booked into Wagoner City Jail on suspicion of public intoxication. She was released Tuesday evening. Haley said Hill was recently hired by the school district, where classes start Thursday. She was reporting for her first day on the job as other teachers were returning from summer break. 'They didn't know who she was, she was apparently new and was supposed to start yesterday,' Haley told Fox 23. Parents were outraged by the teacher's behavior. Frank Sandiford said: 'I don’t know, as an adult, I just don't know how you can be a professional teacher and teaching young people, and then show up drunk.'","School officials called Wagoner police around 9 a.m. Monday to report Lorie Ann Hill, 49, smelled of alcohol and was missing some clothing .

"Hundreds of hospital wards have been forced to close due to the spread of the winter vomiting bug, as fears grow that this winter's outbreak could prove to be the worst on record. New figures released yesterday by the Health Protection Agency revealed cases of the bug are at a five-year high - with more than two-thirds as many people struck down this year as during the same period in 2011. In the past week, schools from Plymouth to Fife have been forced to close after soaring numbers of children have fallen victim to the highly contagious norovirus. The dotted line representing 2012/13 shows how, in the latter part of 2012, cases of norovirus have rocketed. Despite a recent dip, the number of cases is still high . A total of 335 hospital wards in England and Wales have been closed to new visitors since the start of this year's outbreak - with 43 shut down in the past fortnight alone. And as well as norovirus, there are numerous other vicious bugs going around. On Tuesday, 140 of the 639 pupils at Wimbledon Chase Primary School in south west London, were off sick. Staff said the number was unprecedented. The huge early outbreak is thought to represent the worst start to the norovirus season on record, with some experts blaming particularly frigid November temperatures for the staggering numbers of cases. The new HPA figures show there have been 2,630 confirmed cases - where samples have been checked in the lab - since July. This is 72 per cent higher than the same period in the last season when there were 1,533 cases reported. But this figure is likely to be only a . fraction of the true total as most sufferers do not see their GP. Officials at the HPA estimate that for every confirmed case there are . another 288 in the community. This means that 757,440 people could be affected by the stomach bug. There has been a slight dip in cases in the last week or two but an HPA spokesperson said this was no indication the virus was tapering off, particularly as the vast majority of cases in the community go unreported. John Harris, an expert in norovirus at the HPA, said: 'Our figures show a small drop in the number of confirmed cases over the last couple of weeks. 'We cannot read too much into this at present as this is typical of the norovirus season, where we see a series of sharp rises and falls in activity between October and April with the bulk of cases usually occurring between January and March.' Some experts say the highly contagious virus has arrived early this year and caught the NHS 'unawares'. Infections tend to peak in January and February. But this year's early outbreak could go on to see this norovirus season become the worst on record. Experts say the virus has arrived earlier than usual this year and caught the NHS 'unawares' In Scotland, parents have even been banned from nativity shows at one Midlothian school. More than a quarter of the 400 children at Mauricewood primary school . near Edinburgh have been struck down in the suspected norovirus . outbreak. Several teachers have also been affected. Few have escaped the clutches of the . virus. In Coventry, a bride and groom were among 40 guests taken ill . after their wedding reception. Just five people at Michael and Natalie Frost's party at the Chace Hotel, in Willenhall, on Saturday, were not struck down by a stomach bug. Several members of staff have also been affected. The cause of the crippling bout of sickness and diarrhoea is now being investigated by environmental health officers from Coventry City Council. But hotel bosses emphatically deny the food was to blame and said it was caused by the contagious winter vomiting bug. Dozens of hospitals have also been forced to close their wards. Unprecedented: At Wimbledon Chase Primary school in south west London (pictured), 140 of the 639 pupils were off sick with the bug yesterday . In . Staffordshire, four wards have been closed to new patients after an . outbreak at the county’s biggest hospital. The restrictions mean up to . 80 beds at the 1,100-bed University Hospital of North Staffordshire are . out of action and unable to take emergency cases from its overstretched . A&E unit. In Scotland, three wards at Dumfries Infirmary have been closed to new admissions. The outbreak is the second in a matter of weeks at the hospital, where 38 patients and 14 staff have been affected. And in Plymouth, three wards have been closed after the bug struck Derriford Hospital. The norovirus has even hit passengers on board a luxury cruise ship for a festive tour of Europe's Christmas markets. In an update on the situation, a spokeswoman for P&O's parent company Carnival said there had been 'an incidence of a mild gastrointestinal illness' among the passengers. She added that as of today, of 1,843 passengers, 'the number of passengers with active symptoms is six'. But she was unable to confirm how many people have been affected in total. The Health Protection Agency advises the following measures: . Do NOT visit your GP surgery or local A&E Unit. Norovirus infection . is a self-limiting illness and you will recover naturally without . treatment. It is, however, important to take plenty of drinks to replace . lost fluids. Use NHS . Direct's new diarrhoea and vomiting online health and symptom checker, . to get advice on how to manage your symptoms at home or help to access . the most appropriate health service visit the NHS Direct website: ww.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/CheckSymptoms/SATs/DandV5AndOver.aspx . Wash hands thoroughly and regularly at all times, but particularly after using the toilet and before eating. Do not visit friends or relatives in hospitals or residential care . homes as there is a real risk that you would introduce the infection, . putting vulnerable people at risk. One . passenger, who claimed crew members had ignored the plight of those . stricken by the bug, described the trip as 'a cruise to hell'. Dr . Bob Adak, head of the gastrointestinal diseases department at the HPA . said: ‘The norovirus season is always completely unpredictable as it . peaks and falls over several months – usually October to April. However, . one thing we do know is that every year we will see a large amount of . norovirus activity because it is highly contagious.' The bug can be transmitted by contact with an infected . person, by consuming contaminated food or water or by contact with . contaminated surfaces or objects. The virus spreads rapidly in closed . environments such as hospitals, schools, nursing and residential homes. Its . symptoms include a sudden onset of vomiting and/or diarrhoea.

"Concern: Families face the threat of not being able to go on holiday as an overwhelmed Passport Office struggles to deal with a mounting backlog in applications . Families face the threat of not being able to go on holiday as an overwhelmed Passport Office struggles to issue travel documents in time. Up to 500,000 may not get their documents before their planned departure date as the under-staffed department struggles to deal with the annual surge in applications. Labour and Tory MPs have warned that the service is in turmoil and say they have had hundreds of complaints from constituents about delays. Making changes to passports or issuing new documents should be done within three to four weeks, but travellers are complaining it is taking twice as long. Some have been advised to pay up to £55.50 extra each to get passports fast-tracked, which should guarantee they arrive  on time. In a bid to manage the crisis, a quarter of staff employed to detect fraudulent paperwork have been transferred to help process the thousands of delayed applications. But Labour’s immigration spokesman David Hanson has warned that reducing the size of fraud teams is a ‘real worry to the integrity and security of the passport system’. Mr Hanson said Labour MPs had been inundated with more than 400 complaints in the past six weeks from constituents struggling to get passports in time for holidays and trips abroad. The Passport Office, part of the Home Office, has received around 300,000 more applications since January than in the same period last year and has blamed the surge on ‘the improving economy and a rise in holiday bookings’. But unions have said job cuts and office closures have left it unable to handle the level of demand as the summer holidays approach. In turmoil: Up to 500,000 may not get their documents on time as an under-staffed Passport Office struggles to deal with the annual surge in applications . A leaked email from Paul Pugh, head of the Passport Office, reveals that approximately 80 staff, including about a quarter working in fraud teams, are being redeployed in a ‘last push’ to clear the backlog. He acknowledged ‘work-in-progress levels which are much higher than we would like’ and said: ‘We have seen very high volumes of contact with Members of Parliament.’ Warning: David Hanson has warned that reducing the size of fraud teams is a 'real worry to the integrity and security of the passport system' Mr Hanson said he plans to raise the redeployment of anti-fraud staff with the Home Secretary. He said: ‘There are now serious concerns that Theresa May’s mismanagement of resources has left the passport service so stretched that anti-fraud measures will be temporarily understaffed. ‘This is absolutely unacceptable and is a real worry to the integrity and security of the passport system.’ Richard Harrington, Tory MP for Watford, has also put down a parliamentary question on delays after receiving six complaints in a week. In a statement, Mr Pugh said extra staff had been brought in to respond to the extra demand and they were operating seven days a week. He added: ‘We have processed more than 97 per cent of straightforward passport renewal and child applications within the three week target turnaround time. There is no backlog, with over 99 per cent of straightforward applications being processed within four weeks.’ The Home Office said the fraud team staff who had been redeployed were those working on long-term investigations rather than checking applications. In summer 1999, at least 500 holidaymakers missed their departure dates following problems at the then Passport Agency when a new computer system left it unable to issue passports on time.","Passport Office struggling to issue travel documents in time for holidays .

"In a world where big numbers mean big business, the size of a celebrity's Twitter following is of great interest to fans and advertisers alike. But how many of the millions of Twitter users who follow stars such as Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber are real? Most people with Twitter accounts will have been bombarded with indecipherable messages apparently sent by 'spambots' who don't exist. And now a British firm claims it may . have found a way to root out the fake and fraudulent accounts that make . some celebrities' Twitter follower counts artificially high. Faking it: Lady Gaga (left) and Justin Bieber (right) each have almost 30million Twitter followers, but how many of them are real? High notes: Singer Katy Perry has the third most-followed Twitter account in the world . Start-up company Status People says it has devised a software tool that divides followers into three categories - the fake, the inactive and the good. It began working on the project after it was reported that the former Tory MP Louise Mensch had as many as 40,000 fake followers. The tool is intended to expose the true scale of the problem, and it matters because the number of followers a person has can be translated into financial worth by advertisers and marketing companies. Having a large Twitter following can help earn celebrities lucrative sponsorship deals to promote products on the web. Famous for their tweets: Ricky Gervais and Katherine Jenkins are both prolifc tweeters whose messages are followed by thousands of fans . Commercial break: Rio Ferdinand and Katie Price are among a host of celebrities who have used Twitter to promote products . British stars who have promoted items on the micro-blogging website include Katie Price and Manchester United footballer Rio Ferdinand. Twitter users seeking to increase their influence can pay websites to generate thousands of followers for them. 1. Lady Gaga (@ladygaga) 2. Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) 3. Katy Perry (@katyperry) 4. Rihanna (@rihanna) 5. Britney Spears (@britneyspears) 6. Barack Obama (@BarackObama) 7. Shakira (@shakira) 8. Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) 9. Kim Kardashian (@KimKardashian) 10. YouTube (@YouTube) Source: Twitaholic.com . It has been reported that as little as £260 could secure 220,000 new followers for an account. Lady Gaga and Bieber both have almost 30million followers, while fellow singers Katy Perry, Rihanna and Britney Spears each have follower counts in the region of 20million. But Status People's software suggest that a large proportion of those followers may be imaginary tweeters. Company executive Rob Waller told the Observer: 'A fake account is set up to follow people or send out spam. They normally have no followers, but follow large numbers of people. 'An inactive account is one in which there has been no activity for a while. They could be real people, but we would describe them as consumers of information rather than sharers of information. 'A good account is everything that remains.' Status People's tool, which analyses an account's 100,000 most recent followers, shows that only 29 per cent of Lady Gaga's are 'good'. Stars: American pop singers Britney Spears and Rihanna each have about 20million Twitter followers . Targeted: Former Tory MP Louise Mensch was reportedly followed on Twitter by about 40,000 fake followers . Similarly, only 30 per cent of the almost 5million accounts who follow Wayne Rooney are classed as good. David Cameron's official account has a slightly larger proportion of good followers - 37 per cent of the 2.1million users who receive its updates. After the revelation that she had fake followers, Mrs Mensch tweeted: 'I've asked @Twitter in the UK to see if they can remove the 40k spambots and reset me to my 66k count... need a better filter.' The former politician, who quit the Commons earlier this month to spend more time with her family, has since seen her follower count rise to about 96,000. Some businesses seek to gain more recognition by paying internet sites to help raise the number of Twitter followers they have. The exercise is artificial, involving the creation of thousands of fake accounts, but a quick search on the web brings up scores of sites that offer the service. The sites work in two ways. The first uses a type of software identifies Twitter accounts that include certain keywords, such as 'football'. Those accounts are then 'followed' in the hope that their owners will follow back. The other way in which sites operate is to use programs to create artificial accounts, which can then be sold by the thousand. The extra followers can be a nuisance for some Twitter users, however. Louise Mensch, pictured, found that thousands of fake followers were receiving her updates.","Pop star has almost 30million followers, but research by British company Status People finds that only 29 per cent are regular tweeters .

"The first six British patients have been implanted with  a wireless pacemaker – smaller than an AAA battery – that is set to revolutionise the treatment of heart disease. Standard pacemakers, which have changed little since 1958, regulate the pulse by sending electrical impulses into the heart via leads from a battery pack, implanted under the collarbone. The Nanostim, which has no leads, is a tenth of the size of the traditional device and sits permanently in one of the chambers of the heart. It can take under ten minutes to position, compared with up to 45 minutes for an old-style pacemaker. It is inserted through a vein via an incision in the leg, leaving no scars, and held in place by a screw-like anchor, which grips the inner wall of the heart. Aside from being an easier procedure, doctors hope the innovation will help eliminate complications caused by traditional pacemakers and their leads, which include infections and clots. Maureen McCleave, 77, was one of those given the new device at St Bartholomew’s Hospital in London this month. She says: ‘I was waiting for the sedation to kick in so that the surgeon could start. Suddenly he said it was over. He had implanted a pacemaker  into my heart in just seven minutes and I was completely oblivious.’ Professor Richard Schilling, who performed the procedure, says: ‘This is an incredible step. It has been dreamt about for years. I’m excited to be the first UK cardiologist to implant the device.’ Last year, more than 40,000 Britons had a pacemaker fitted. They are used to treat a variety of arrhythmias: problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat. Revolution: The new pacemaker could change the lives of millions of heart patients . In traditional pacemakers, up to three electrical leads run into the heart. Should the pacemaker sense abnormal rhythm, an electrical pulse is delivered. However, Prof Schilling says: ‘It is almost inevitable that some revision surgery will be performed. At most, the leads will last 15 years, so they will require replacement. Take away the box and leads and that risk of related complications is removed.’ The Nanostim is implanted directly into the heart in a minimally invasive procedure under local anaesthetic. A small amount of sedation is given  to the patient and local anaesthetic injected into the top of the leg. The pacemaker is inserted up the femoral vein in the leg within a flexible tube. When it is in the correct position, the pacemaker – at one end of which is a screw – is carefully pushed into the wall of the heart and turned one-and-a-quarter times. Mention TV drama Homeland to cardiologists and you may elicit a  weary sigh. One episode famously featured Nicholas Brody, played by Damian Lewis, hacking into Vice President William Walden’s pacemaker to deliver a fatal shock. Patients often ask Professor Schilling: ‘Could this really happen?’ The speculation about hacking relates to pacemakers using radio frequency – which allows communication between the device and the programmers in a clinic  or hospital. ‘Every time you initiate programming you have  to have a wand held physically over the pacemaker,’ he explains. ‘The patient also has to be within 6ft of a modem.’ Some pacemakers have the ability to act as a defibrillator – as Walden’s did – so arguably a homicidal doctor with all the right kit, in the same room as the patient could deliver a large painful shock. But this is unlikely to be fatal. The Nanostim uses a different communication method – with a professional physically placing electrodes  on the body – and it can’t be remotely monitored. So technically it would be even safer in such – implausible  – circumstances. ‘We check it’s in a good position by tugging gently,’ says Prof Schilling. ‘Like all pacemakers, it is battery powered and contains a computer chip which monitors electrical activity. Should it sense silence, a tinyelectrical pulse is released. ‘Most patients are interested in the lack of scar and bulky pacemaker,’ he says. ‘But we are thrilled about the lack of leads.’ The chances of the device dislodging and floating free are low, says Prof Schilling. ‘Should it dislodge, it would go into the lung and could be easily retrieved. It’s so small it wouldn’t block blood flow.’ The battery lasts up to 13 years. ‘At the end of this time you can either remove and replace it, or insert another one next to it,’ says Prof Schilling. Maureen, who lives with her husband Rod, 75, in Chingford, Essex, is of course one of the Nanostim’s biggest fans. She couldn’t even walk up the stairs without taking a rest. She developed atrial fibrillation a decade ago and following a stroke was on medication to slow her heartbeat. But this meant that her heart rate could drop to a dangerous 40 beats per minute. When she wore a monitor for a week, it stopped 41 times for up to 4.5 seconds. ‘Usually this happened at night,’ explains Maureen. ‘But they were worried it might happen in the day and I’d hurt myself. It was exhausting. Even the slight slope walking up my road exhausted me.’ She was waiting for a normal pacemaker to be installed, but Prof Schilling thought she would be ideal for the Nanostim. ‘I was very stressed before the procedure,’ says Maureen. ‘But once I was in there it flashed past. I was able to walk to the loo later that evening. I couldn’t believe there was something in my heart.’ She is feeling much more energetic and is also sleeping soundly. ‘Before, I’d wake up at night with my heart just beating madly. That has gone. I feel so well.’ Dr Andrew Deaner, consultant cardiologist at King George Hospital, London, and BMI The London Independent, suggests a downside is the chance of blood leaking around the heart during insertion. ‘It could cause complications, but you are still avoiding problems with the wires, the bulky box and the risk of infection.’ Nanostim’s US manufacturers, St Jude Medical, say that pacemakers are being implanted on a case-by-case basis depending on the patient. sjm.com/leadlesspacing .","The first six Britons have been fit with no leads pacemaker Nanostim .

"Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has taken a double swipe at Arsenal - 29 days before the start of the season. The Portuguese, speaking at his unveiling as a BT Sport ambassador, claimed summer signing Cesc Fabregas never wanted to return to the Emirates Stadium this summer and said Jack Wilshere has set a poor example to children after he was caught smoking in Las Vegas last week. Mourinho pulled off a coup by signing Fabregas from Barcelona earlier this summer, despite the fact Arsenal had first option on the midfielder. VIDEO Scroll down to watch some of Jose Mourinho's most memorable moments . Mastermind: Jose Mourinho missed his own son's football match to sign Fabregas for Chelsea . The Spaniard's move to Stamford Bridge came as a shock given his emotional ties with the Gunners, who he captained. Fabregas had indicated Arsenal snubbed the chance to re-sign, but Mourinho claims the midfielder never intended to go back to north London and says it it took him just 20 minutes to clinch his signing. 'How did I persuade him? I spoke to him for about 20 minute,' said Mourinho. 'I think he really wanted to come. Arsenal had an option where they could interfere, but I don't' think he was open to that. He was in our direction so it was easy for me.' And the Special One had his say on the smoking controversy that has engulfed Wilshere this week. The Gunners midfielder was photographed smoking and behaving outrageously during a holiday in Vegas. Easy decision: The Chelsea boss claimed it took just 20 minutes to convince Fabregas to join . It was the second time in nine months Wilshere has been snapped with a cigarette in his mouth, despite his protestations that he is not a smoker. And Mourinho says the England midfielder is not fulfillng his status as a role model after his Vegas escapade. 'What football players do, millions and millions are watching, lots of kids are watching,' said the Blues boss. 'I’m not a specialist, obviously, but I don’t think if a football player smokes one cigar or cigarette with friends in the summer when he is not training – I don’t think it affects his performance. 'What gets affected is that a kid at home says if a top football player can smoke then I can smoke and it is not a problem. Bad example: Mourinho also blasted Jack Wilshere who was photographed smoking this week . Got his man: Mourinho claims the signing of Felipe Luis represents a 'fantastic job' for his club . 'It is more a social consequence than a physical consequence. 'Would I be angry if it was my player? Being angry is not a solution but I would just explain exactly that, that everything they do or wear is part of the kids’ life. 'If they smoke, maybe the kids think they do it a lot of times and they will probably do the same.' Meanwhile, Mourinho insists Chelsea have finished their summer spending after completing their £16million move for Filipe Luis. The deal for Atletico Madrid left-back Luis was rubber stamped yesterday, adding to the captures of Fabregas and Diego Costa. Mourinho said: 'I have to say my club did a fantastic job, not just because of what we bought, but that we did it in almost in record time. Final piece: Felipe Luis is the last signing Chelsea will make this summer according to their boss . 'We have closed our market today. We knew the targets the club attacked them at an early stage. I don't think we will sign anyone else, we are happy with what I have. 'I'm square about the other teams, I'm just so happy with my squad and confident with what I have in my hands.' The Blues boss is still awaiting the return of his heartbroken Brazil internationals following their humiliating World Cup exit to Germany. Oscar, Ramires and Willian were part of Luiz Felipe Scolari's squad that slumped to that embarrassing 7-1 loss to the eventual world champions. Ready again: Willian (front right), Ramires (front, second right), and Oscar (front left) will all come back stronger after Brazil's disappointing World Cup defeat to Germany according to Mourinho . But Mourinho does not fear for his Samba stars, and has revealed he felt some of his Brazilian's had one eye on the World Cup during the closing stages of last season. 'I was more worried last season. Last season I felt them too much connected with the World Cup and we were January February and March and I was feeling them already there and that really worried me, it as a difficult situation. 'Now it was a big disappointment but you have to move on from that in football. I’m waiting for them and I don’t think it will be a problem. I have to try to use it in a positive way – you didn’t succeed so this season is important for you, lets change the image and the feelings and go back to what you are as what you were in the World Cup was your twin brother.' Trio: Oscar was one of three Chelsea players for Brazil at the World Cup . Fresh start: Mourinho doesn't believe the World Cup will haunt his players . Moving on: Mourinho wants Willian, Ramires and Oscar to leave their international disappointment behind . Mourinho is also expecting this year's Premier League title race to be as competitive as ever. He said: 'Last year, if you had asked me in July, I would never have said Man United would be outside the top four. This season I will tell you one (to miss out) and I have a big percentage of making a mistake. 'There were good teams last season and there will be better teams this season because everyone is investing. A few years ago you make a team to be champions and most probably you are champions. Now if you make a team to be champions, you try to finish in the top four. 'Why I like the Premier League so much is that at this moment, nobody knows who is going to win the title. I know that we want to and I know that we can, but it is the kind of competition where I can't say. At this moment, I think between us, Liverpool, Arsenal, Man United, Man City - who is going to be first, who is going to play in the Europa League, I don't know.'","Chelsea boss claims it took 20 minutes to convince former Gunners captain to choose Chelsea .

"Food prices are expected to surge after the worst drought in the U.S. for half a century destroyed one-sixth of the country's expected corn crop over the past month. The hottest July in U.S. history has caused irreparable damage to crops, forcing corn farmers to abandon fields greater in area than Belgium and Luxembourg. Soyabeans, which are used for animal feed and to make vegetable oil, have also been affected, with this harvest likely to be the worst for five years. Damaged: The worst drought for half a century in the U.S. has destroyed one-sixth of the country's expected corn crop . The crisis has prompted the US . Department of Agriculture (USDA) to forecast record-breaking price . rises, and some of the world's largest food manufacturers, including . Kraft, Tyson and Nestle, have already indicated that they will pass on . the increase to consumers. USDA now expects 10.8billion bushels of corn to be produced this year - 2.2billion bushels less than the projection it made last month. USDA chief economist Joseph Glauber told the Financial Times: 'We're going to see very high prices.' The problem could have far-reaching consequences internationally. In 2007-08, high food costs led to . riots in more than 30 countries, but Jose Graziano da Silva, the . director general of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation, said the . current crisis was not as severe. 'We do not have the demand pressure from China and India as five years ago.' Poor corn: The US Department of Agriculture has significantly reduced its forecasts for crop harvests . The situation has worsened since the week ending July 29, when USDA found that 48 per cent of the nation's corn crop was either poor or very poor. The department said 47 per cent of the soybean crop was in very poor or poor . condition. They were the worst ratings since the drought of 1988, which cut production by . 20 per cent and cost the economy tens of billions of dollars. With grazing pastures also parched and feed prices at record highs, . many ranchers are sending their animals to slaughter early because it is . too costly to keep them until full size. President Barack Obama's . administration has opened up protected US land to help farmers and . ranchers and has encouraged crop insurance companies to forgo charging . interest. It has also provided emergency . low-interest loans to farmers in 31 states, where disaster areas have been declared due to the drought. Help for farmers: The US Agriculture Department has unveiled new help for frustrated, cash-strapped farmers and crop insurers have agreed to provide farmers with a 30 day grace period on premiums .

"Here's another reason to ditch the car keys and put on your trainers. Walking to work each day could cut your chances of developing diabetes, claim researchers. They found people who get to work under their own steam are around 40 per cent less likely to have the disease as those who drive. Healthier choice: Workers in London walking home at the end of a weekday . Experts at Imperial College London and University College London examined how health is affected by the way people travel to work, using a survey of 20,000 Britons. They found cycling, walking, and using public transport were all associated with a lower risk of being overweight than driving or taking a taxi. Those who walked to work were far less likely to have Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes than drivers, and had a 17 per cent lower risk of high blood pressure. Cyclists were around half as likely to have diabetes as those who drove. Everyday exercise: Of the adults who use cars or taxis to get to work, 19 per cent are obese, compared to 13 per cent who cycle . High blood pressure, diabetes, and being overweight are all major risk factors for heart and circulatory disease, the UK’s biggest killer. The number of Britons diagnosed with diabetes hit three million this year for the first time – equivalent to almost one in 20 of the population. The majority have Type 2 which is strongly linked to being overweight or obese, leading a sedentary lifestyle and an unhealthy diet. In the study, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, British scientists used survey data from 2009-11 to find the links between active travel to work and diabetes or hypertension. Dangerous high: The number of Britons diagnosed with diabetes hit three million this year . They found wide variations in the modes of travel used in different parts of the UK. Public transport was used most in London, at 52 per cent, while only 5 per cent used it in Northern Ireland. Of the working-age adults who used  private transport such as cars, motorbikes and taxis to get to work, 19 per cent were obese, compared to 15 per cent of those who walked and 13 per cent of those who cycled. The researchers said people could reduce their risks of serious health problems such as heart attacks by avoiding using a car. Anthony Laverty, from the School of Public Health at Imperial College London, who led the research, said: ‘This study highlights that building physical activity into the daily routine by walking, cycling or using public transport to get to work is good for personal health. ‘It demonstrates associations between active travel to work and a reduced likelihood of being overweight, having diabetes and having hypertension.’ Robin Hewings, of Diabetes UK, said the charity ‘recommends that the best way to reduce your risk of . Type 2 diabetes is by combining physical activity with a healthy balanced diet that is low in salt, fat and sugar and rich in fruit and vegetables’. He added: ‘Walking to work is a great way to improve your overall health and we recommend people walk where possible in place of a car or public transport.’ A study by Leicester University earlier this year found those at high risk of developing diabetes can reduce the likelihood by cutting the time they spend sitting by 90 minutes a day.","Doctors are urging people to include physical activity in their routines .
Those who walk to work are far less likely to have Type 1 or 2 diabetes .

"Online retailers are seeing their fastest growth in sales in 13 years, confirming Britain as the internet shopping capital of the world. Web sales rose by 13 per cent last month compared with August, and were 20 per cent higher than in September last year, said the e-Retail Sales Index compiled by industry experts IMRG and Capgemini. Clothing, particularly lingerie, saw strong increases following the success of sites such as ASOS, which has grown into a global brand. Booming: Web retailers such as Amazon are experiencing the fastest growth in more than a decade . There has been a 150 per cent increase in shopping via smartphones, such as the iPhone or Samsung Galaxy, compared to a year ago. Shopping over the internet has also been boosted by the fact more companies, such as ASOS and Dixons, offer same-day delivery. The September figure was the fastest increase for the month in the 13 years that the e-Retail Sales Index has been running. The same index suggested total sales in September were some 20 per cent higher than the same month last year. While high street bricks and mortar stores are seeing a fall in sales of fashions and shoes, this is being more than made up by increases over the web. More than 10 per cent of all retail sales are now made over the internet in the UK, with this proportion predicted to more than double by 2020. Web shopping in Britain is particularly strong because the nation is doing a significant amount of its weekly food purchases  online, alongside all the other products, from clothes and books to TVs and other gadgets. Some 21 per cent of families here shop online for food and groceries, compared to less than 10 per cent in Europe and the rest of the world. Freshly clicked: The UK's fondness for online shopping helped the internet shopping sector grow faster than in the US . A new EU study shows 82 per cent of British internet users regularly shop online, which is the highest of the 28 member states. Denmark and Sweden come in second at 79per cent, with Germany on 77 per cent, Luxembourg on 73 per cent and Finland at 72 per cent. At the other end of the scale are Italy and Estonia, at just 29 per cent, and Romania at just 11 per cent. The research showed that internet users in the UK lead for online purchases of clothes and food, while Sweden is number one on travel and Luxembourg for books. Internet shopping is also stronger in the UK than the US, because web purchases of food and groceries has not taken off there to the same extent. Last week, Marks & Spencer launched a new online butcher and fishmonger, while the Morrisons chain will start selling food over the web with home deliveries in partnership with Ocado in January. IMRG said web sales of clothing were up by 18 per cent to this time last year, with lingerie up 30per cent, accessories by 20 per cent and footwear by 20 per cent. Tina Spooner of IMRG, said: ‘The latest Index results are encouraging as we enter the fourth quarter, with retailers preparing for the crucial festive trading period. ‘The record monthly growth in September is an indication of increasing consumer confidence and with smartphone year-on-year sales growth reaching an impressive 150 per cent, it is also evident that shoppers are becoming more comfortable with shopping via their mobile devices.’ Chris Webster, the head of retail consulting at Capgemini, said: ‘This month’s Index is a good indicator that we are headed towards economic recovery, and a great sign for a strong Christmas. ‘The fact that e-retail has seen its sharpest period of growth for September suggests that consumers are shopping with confidence.’","Online sales increased by 13 per cent in a month .
They rose 20 per cent in comparison with last September .

"Women desperate for a baby are being given false hope by profit-hungry fertility clinics, Robert Winston has warned. The IVF pioneer and broadcaster said that the private sector – which has the lion’s share of the market – is an unregulated ‘jungle’. He said because the industry is becoming ‘more and more commercial’, women are being fast-tracked into IVF when there are cheaper treatments that might work better. Lord Winston accused the fertility watchdog of presiding over an unregulated 'jungle' In other cases, women are paying for . tests that could actually cut their chances of motherhood, said the . Labour peer, who has long warned of the dangers of expensive but . unproven fertility treatments. Lord Winston, who made his name on TV . programmes such as Child of Our Time and The Human Body, said: ‘IVF is . being offered as a blanket treatment when there is a whole variety of . other things that you could do that might be more effective. What is . happening in the jungle is actually pretty frightening. ‘Of . course there are lots of good people doing good work but what is . happening is that infertility is increasingly not being treated as a . symptom. Nowadays, if you go in with a symptom of infertility, you . automatically get IVF though there are many cheaper treatments that . might be more effective.’ He accused the fertility watchdog of incompetence, adding that he thinks it is ‘frightened of being sued and has had its day’. Lord . Winston, emeritus professor of fertility studies at Imperial College . London, also questioned whether women are informed that freezing their . eggs does not guarantee they will have children. Embryo selection for IVF: Lord Winston said: 'IVF is being offered as a blanket treatment when there are a whole variety of other things that you could do that might be more effective' He . told a Sunday newspaper that although egg freezing is becoming ‘big . business’, success rates are low. ‘That’s not to say it shouldn’t be . done, provided it’s safe,’ he said. ‘But I don’t think people who are . having their eggs frozen realise just how low their chances of having a . baby are.’ Another . expensive treatment may actually cut a woman’s odds of having a baby. He . said that some clinics are over-prescribing a form of checking embryos . for abnormalities called PGS.

"Given her fiery reputation, it perhaps wasn’t the most sensible thing to say. Unsurprisingly, Nancy Dell’Olio took great exception to being described by Bruno Tonioli as looking as though she had 'inhaled two gallons of Veuve Clicquot' during her latest Strictly performance. She was so furious that she told friends she was considering legal action against the judge. Salsa: Nancy Dell'Olio with dance partner Anton Du Beke (left) and on the judges' table (right) Elegant: Nancy and Anton dance the waltz in an earlier episode. She is said to have told friends she was 'furious' over Bruno's comments . Miss Dell’Olio, 50, claimed that although her penchant for champagne is well known, she did not drink at all before the live broadcast. And she insisted she does not keep ten to 15 bottles in her dressing room at any one time, as has been rumoured. Instead, she said a case of champagne in her room was for stylists and other production staff, to show her gratitude. Miss Dell’Olio performed at the weekend despite having a torn ligament in her knee. She received the lowest score from the judges, but viewers kept her in the show at the expense of Edwina Currie. Jibe: Bruno's comments were tongue in cheek and not meant to cause offence, a BBC spokesman said . One friend said: 'She was having trouble walking and her leg was in real pain – but she thought the show must go on, so took to the floor. 'To then have Bruno accuse her of being drunk, she found very upsetting. She has considered legal action – but everyone’s been calming her down.' It was believed last night that the American-Italian had been persuaded against suing. A BBC spokesman said: 'The judges always look to give constructive criticism to all of our dancers and this is often delivered with humour, given that Strictly is an entertainment show.

"More than 200 prison officers have billed the taxpayer to hire dinner suits to allow them to attend awards ceremonies in style. New figures reveal thousands of pounds of public money are spent each year by jail staff to rent evening dress, including ballgowns and bow ties. Ministers have ordered a review of all civil service perks, but argued that without paying the clothing bill prison staff would not be able to attend glitzy bashes. Officials at government departments can claim back the cost of hiring or buying dinner suits or evening dresses to attend official functions (file picture) In the last five years the prison service has paid almost £14,800 in evening dress allowance, the Ministry of Justice revealed. Having fallen when the coalition was first formed, last year the bill increased by almost a third to £2,734.25. Justice minister Helen Grant said: ‘No Ministers or senior MoJ officials have made these claims. ‘These claims relate to a number of claims by prison officers for evening attire for a specific awards event, where the hire cost might otherwise affect their attendance.’ She added that in some cases prison officers could have submitted multiple claims. ‘Civil service terms and conditions are currently being reviewed through the civil service reform programme,’ Miss Grant added. In May, MailOnline revealed how Government departments continued to spend thousands of pounds on perks for staff in the face of the age of austerity. Party time: Ministers insisted that without the allowance prison staff would not be able to attend awards ceremonies . Since then the Department for Work and Pensions, which is overseeing deep cuts to the benefits bill, has admitted spending thousands of pounds on evening wear. Since 2008-09 DWP staff have claimed £6,473 under the perk, including £1,700 since the coalition was formed. In the last five years the Health and Safety Executive has paid out £2,600 in the evening dress allowance. Under official Whitehall rules staff can claim for the cost of hiring evening dress to attend official work functions. And if there are three events in the diary they can ask the taxpayer to help to buy them a suit or a dress. The figures were uncovered by Tory MP Priti Patel, who has called for an end to the perks to cut the costs of Whitehall. 'British taxpayers will be astounded to see that they have been footing the bill for new suits and gowns for civil servants attending fancy events,' she said in May. At the Ministry of Defence alone, expense claims for evening dress have reached almost £16,000 since 2008. Vince Cable's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills paid out almost £3,000 from December 2011 and to May 2013. At least five other departments offer the evening dress allowance but could not say how much it cost the taxpayer. A Government spokesman said: 'We are reviewing Civil Service terms and conditions as part of our Civil Service Reform programme. 'The Civil Service will remain a good employer so it can attract and retain high quality staff. 'However some of its conditions have become outliers in comparison to the wider public and private sector and these will be addressed.'","Whitehall staff able to claim expenses for an 'evening dress allowance'

"Arrested: Officials released this photo of Wilbert Thibodeaux, 48, after treatment  for wounds he sustained during a gun battle with police . A man shot three police officers - one fatally - in southern Louisiana Saturday with a shotgun after mysteriously torching a mobile home inside of which fire officials later discovered the charred remains of a 78-year-old local man. Wilbert Thibodeaux, 48, of Charenton was taken into custody after doctors treated him for a superficial gunshot wound he suffered when authorities returned his initial salvo of shot. 'We've got a lot of unanswered questions,' State Police Capt. Doug Cain said of the affair in St. Mary's Parish, 45 miles southeast of Lafayette, and about a quarter-mile from the Cypress Bayou Casino. The Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana reportedly operates the casino. Killed in the affair was an as-yet unnamed Chitimacha tribal officer - one of seven full-time lawmen who patrol a 260-acre reservation that has roughly 150 homes, a grocery store, a small school and government offices. 'He's a real great guy. Extremely dedicated to his job. Very brave,' Tribal councilman Toby Darden said, adding the slain officer is married and has two grown children. 'Everybody knows the officers personally. It's devastating.' Thibodeaux also critically wounded a pair of St. Mary's Parish sheriff's deputies who responded as well to a report of a shotgun-wielding man walking down a road near the Cypress Bayou Casino, NBC33 News reports. 'Thibodeaux fired at the Chitimacha Officer, fatally wounding him,' the state police said in a news release. Scroll down for video . Tribal officer slain: The shootings occurred less than a mile from a casino operated by the Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana . 'As two St. Mary Deputies, who were in the same car, arrived at the scene, Thibodeaux fired multiple shots hitting the deputies. During the encounter, Thibodeaux was shot.' Investigators later found the burned remains of Eddie Lyons, 78, also of Charenton, after extinguishing a fire at a mobile home that Thibodeaux is suspected of setting before the officers arrived, Louisiana State Police Trooper Stephen Hammons said. 'Detectives suspect Lyons was shot by Thibodeaux before the fire,' state police said in a news release. 'We've got a lot of unanswered questions' Hammons said investigators were questioning Thibodeaux Saturday evening, adding the shootings occurred near - but not on tribal land. Charges against the gunman are pending. 'Today is a difficult day for our partners in St. Mary Parish,' Col. Mike Edmonson, the State Police superintendent, said in a statement. 'My thoughts and prayers are with the deputies and the officer's families tonight. 'I know the coming days and weeks will be difficult ones for the men and women of the Chitimacha Police Department and the St. Mary Parish Sheriff's Office,' Edmonson added. 'We will assist their agencies in any way we can during these trying times.' The casino is run by the Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana and is less than a quarter-mile from the scene of the shootings. Mystery: State Trooper Stephen Hammons told reporters the gunman is thought to have shot a 78-year-old man whose body was found inside a torched mobile home prior to confronting police . ""Everybody is just in shock. It's small-town America,"" said Jacqueline Junca, the tribe's secretary and treasurer. Police didn't immediately release the names of the officers. Authorities said they will do so at a Monday news conference. The Chitimacha Tribe reportedly claims around 1,200 members, roughly half of whom live on the reservation. Access to and from the casino was restricted for roughly 90 minutes as a precautionary measure while police responded to the shooting, said casino spokeswoman Nancy Herrington. Charenton is located about 45 miles southeast of Lafayette. Smoldering: The charred remains of 78-year-old local man Eddie Lyons was discovered inside a torched mobile home following the gun battle with Thibodeaux . ""We are very much in business and have been,"" Herrington said later Saturday. ""We have events tonight. All of those are taking place."" One of the injured deputies was taken to a hospital in New Orleans and the other was taken to a Lafayette hospital. Both were listed in critical but stable condition Saturday evening, Hammons said.","Shooting occurs in southern Louisiana's St. Mary's Parish .

"Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere appears to have mastered Cristiano Ronaldo's famous stance during his lengthy spell on the sidelines with an ankle injury. Wilshere, who has been out of action since Arsenal's 2-1 defeat against Manchester United on November 22, struck a similar pose to the Real Madrid star during Monday's training session. Ronaldo usually stands with his feet wide apart while tensing his upper body before taking free-kicks in order to psych himself up during a match. Jack Wilshere takes up a similar stance to Cristiano Ronaldo during an Arsenal training session . Arsenal midfielder Wilshere trained alongside the likes of Danny Welbeck and Calum Chambers .

"This week sees London packed with tattoo events, launches and concept exhibitions, as the London Tattoo Convention - arguably the best in the world - arrives in the capital. One such event was the world's first human gallery of tattoos in Soho's Riflemaker gallery last night,  curated by two of the biggest names in the art, Cally-Jo and Lal Hardy. The pair searched far and wide for people with the world's greatest tattoos, and last night their work came together when a mix of vibrantly inked individuals came together in London to create a human gallery. Scroll down for video . The human canvases were displayed in hanging frames normally associated with oil paintings . Cally-Jo and Lal have been curating the world's greatest tattoos on human canvases this week . Tattoos on show represented a wide breadth of styles, large scale body pieces, intricate sleeves and neck pieces inspired by traditional Japanese paintings, cubism and old romantic artworks. The human canvases were displayed in hanging frames normally associated with oil paintings at The Riflemaker in Soho for four hours, and revellers were treated to canapés and whisky. New entertainment channel truTV commissioned the event to celebrate the second season of tattoo competition reality show Ink Master, hosted by Dave Navarro. The programme sees tattoo artists go head to head in a series of challenges to prove their skills and to be crowned the ultimate Ink Master - a bit like the Great British Bake Off but with tatts instead of tarts. FEMAIL caught up with Cally-Jo Pothecary, 24, who tattooed Rihanna's hand, and legendary tattooist, Lal Hardy, ahead of the launch. Lal Hardy said: 'Many of the practitioners involved in the project are the Rembrandts, Van Gogh's and Titians of the skin embellishment world. 'There's no better way to celebrate the ink masters of the modern era than at the opening of the art gallery of skin.' Tattoos on show represented a wide breadth of styles, plus intricate sleeves and neck pieces . Last night, a vibrant mix of inked individuals came together in London to create a human gallery . truTV commissioned the event to celebrate the second season of tattoo competition reality show . A spokesperson for Turner Broadcasting said: 'We are seeing a growing popularity in the UK for shows where contestants are pitted against each other in a series of challenges to become the ultimate master in their field. truTV's Ink Master combines this increasingly popular format with the UK public's growing obsession with tattoos. Our Ink Master Human Gallery is a celebration of this, and a chance to observe the beauty of human inking with the same respect as its oil, watercolour and pencil counterparts.' These days with everyone from Rihanna to David Beckham covered in tattoos, many are still waiting for the right moment. Leading artist Cally-Jo, 24, says don't dwell on waiting for that right 'meaning' or pivotal point in your lift for which to mark you body, and instead pick something that looks nice. She encourages you to think of it as a timeless piece of clothing that's tailored beautifully and suits you - compared to something emotional such as a must-have item that you may go off in a few months. The event provided a chance to observe human inking with the same respect as watercolour counterparts . 'I don't think it has to be a major moment [in your life] at all,' she tells MailOnline. 'Choose an image you're going to be happy to wear forever. Meanings are not going to stay. None of mine have meanings, apart from the portrait of my grandma. 'I blame this notion on shows like Miami Ink. They want to use people with interesting stories because it makes good TV, but you have to really like the design. Also,  the tattoo won't take 10 seconds. 'In terms of what makes a good tattoo, I'm looking for longevity. If too small, it wont last. It needs to be something that will last forever. Clean, bold lines and smooth shading... 'Rihanna has good tattoos, Cara Delevingne does also, but does have some weird ones. David Beckham has some beautiful tattoos.' Cally-Jo (left) who tattooed Rihanna's hand (right) curated the Human Gallery of tattoos for last night's event at the Riflemaker Gallery in Soho, Central London marking season two of Ink Masters on truTV . Cally-Jo has a  long waiting list of eager clients, but she's only been in the business three years. 'I've been a fine artist for a long time and did art training for six years before I started tattooing,' she says. As well as pure determination, being motivated and grabbing every opportunity; Cally-Jo credits social media and consequently celebrity clients with raising her profile. 'Rihanna was pretty big news - especially as it's on her hand, her entire hand.' She recommends those hoping to follow in her footsteps remember it's important to stay humble and not let things get to your head, and to also use the internet and social media, which is 'so huge'. Cally-Jo helped adapt Rihanna's Maori tribal tattoo, which was originally inked painfully in the traditional  way . Rihanna grimaces as she gets a Maori tribal tattoo inked the traditional way (l) and Cally-Jo helped edit it (r) 'The best platform is Instagram,' she says. 'Most people follow at least one [tattooist]. 'I started Instagram a couple of years ago and it kind of blew up from there, I suddenly had hundreds of thousands of followers - one of which happened to be Rihanna. She knew of my work anyway and she contacted a friend of mine in the shop I was working in [Bang Bang Tattoo in New York City's Lower East Side].' Rihanna flew Cally-Jo and Keith McCurdy 1,500 miles to the Dominican Republic to adapt her tribal New Zealand tattoo. 'She had [the original design] done as a spur of the moment thing; and she was freaking out about it... I tattooed her entire hand. She wanted a henna style tattoo and after looking at lots of styles I drew it on free hand.' Many of the practitioners involved in the project are the best of the best in the skin embellishment world . Lal is a tattooing legend who has tattooed numerous footballers including Jack Wiltshire, as well as musicians like Dave Grohl and Liam Gallagher, and has been in the business for more than 35 years. He ran a trade magazine for 15 years, has had four books published, and has always spoken up for the trade. But then there's also the personal level through which he connects to the art - at his shop. 'I'm really lucky that I've got the gift of the gab, an old school tattooist is usually a bit of a showman and a chameleon with people,' he tells MailOnline. 'Sometimes a bit of a lairy lad taking about to football, and then I'm also there for a client if their kid's died; I can sit there and be with them while they're in tears. That's the experience of coming here. '[My shop] is in the middle of nowhere in Muswell Hill, but people from all over the world come here.' Lal says the fear of the unknown has been taken away by celebrity culture. Now that so many people want to brave their first inking, he recommends researching the artist thoroughly. And while he considers the look more important that the meaning, he does rate personal, poignant tattoos. 'There's always the skin of the artist which is important. You've got to research them. If you've got an artist that's not skilful he won't be able to create a nice piece of work on the person. The aesthetic should please them. A tattoo is good if the person is really happy with it. I like tattoos to look good and to be executed nicely. 'One of my favourite pieces that I've done is a whole Japanese body suit,' says Lal of this piece on display . 'But at the same time, I really love when tattoos have a meaning to them - I don't mean they see a programme where someone gets three stars and say 'they represent my family' and just copy that... 'For example, a guy came in recently who was retiring and he wanted to get his business card on his chest - that was quite unique... 'One of my favourite pieces that I've done on someone is a whole Japanese body suit - flowers dragons the lot. I love that tattoo... Favourites change through the years, though. Sometimes they're on people you've got a great friendship with. 'My favourite tattoo that I've got is in the centre of my chest that I got done in Yokohama by the greatest tattoo artist in the world, Horiyoshi III, almost 25 years ago. 'As I once said, ""In the diary of life, tattoos are inky memories"".'

"The Government's eavesdropping agency GCHQ is to give a parliamentary committee full details of its links to a controversial US internet monitoring programme, it has been revealed. The Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) will receive a report on claims that it received material through the secret Prism scheme 'very shortly', according to chairman Sir Malcolm Rifkind. He said: 'The ISC is aware of the allegations surrounding data obtained by GCHQ via the US Prism programme. 'The ISC will be receiving a full report from GCHQ very shortly and will decide what further action needs to be taken as soon as it receives that information.' MPs from the ISC will also seek reassurances from Washington that US spies are not snooping on the emails of British webs users on a trip to the US next week. Sinister powers: Britain's Government Communications Headquarters, based in Cheltenham, Gloucs., is largely responsible for monitoring the phone calls and emails of terror suspects . The ISC is going on a week long tour of the US and will meet senior figures from US intelligence agencies. The development comes after it was claimed yesterday that British spies had access to the Prism system. Secret documents published yesterday . suggest the US National Security Agency (NSA) has direct access to data . held by internet giants including Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, Facebook, . YouTube, Skype and Apple. The . documents – which appear to be slides from a 41-page training presentation for . intelligence agents – suggest the agency can access email, photographs, . social network information, chat records and other ‘stored data’ held by . the companies, as part of its ‘Prism’ project. They also suggest the British . government’s listening centre, GCHQ, has had access to the system since . at least June 2010. The project generated nearly 200 . intelligence reports in the 12 months to May 2012, a 137 per cent increase on the previous year. It is unclear whether other agencies, such as MI5 . and MI6, were also involved, meaning the true extent of the snooping . could be higher. A GCHQ spokesman said ‘we do not . comment on intelligence matters’, but added: ‘Our work is carried out in . accordance with a strict legal and policy framework.’ Privacy campaigners warned that the . revelations suggested the creation of a ‘Snooper’s Charter by the back . door’. They come after a proposed plan to pay internet companies to . collate user data from UK computers was dropped only last month in the . face of opposition from Tory backbenchers and Liberal Democrats. Pressure: The disclosure will pile pressure on David Cameron to explain how much he knew about the intrusion as he prepares to attend the secretive Bilderberg conference today, a closed-door meeting that conspiracy theorists already believe is where leaders plot world domination . I know what you're doing this summer: The Obama administration defended the order on Thursday, calling it 'a critical tool in protecting the nation from terrorist threats' 'Reprehensible': Director of National Intelligence James Clapper branded the program 'reprehensible' and said it risks Americans' security . Last night Labour called on David . Cameron to come clean to MPs on the extent of Britain’s role. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: 'It is important for the UK intelligence community to be able to gather information from abroad including from the United States, particularly in the vital counter-terror work they do. 'However, there also have to be legal safeguards in place, including proper protection for British citizens' privacy, proper oversight and checks and balances to make sure intelligence powers are not misused. 'And the public need confidence that their privacy is being properly respected and protected. 'That is why the Prime Minister, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary, and all the intelligence agencies should provide full information to the Intelligence and Security Committee as swiftly as possible, and the ISC should have full support to pursue this and report.' The Guardian said it obtained the slides from a whistleblowing intelligence officer worried about invasions of privacy. According to the newspaper, the Prism programme appeared to allow GCHQ to circumvent the formal legal process required to obtain personal material, such as emails, photographs and videos, from internet companies based outside the UK. Reports by the paper and The . Washington Post suggested the FBI and the NSA can tap directly into the . central servers of nine leading internet companies. But a number of . them, including Google, Apple, Yahoo and Facebook denied the government . had ‘direct access’ to their servers. Microsoft said it does not voluntarily . participate in any government data collection and only complies ‘with . orders for requests about specific accounts or identifiers’. Yet one slide appears to be a timeline . of when the companies began to participate in Prism, starting with . Microsoft in September 2007 and ending with Apple in October 2012. According to the reports, Prism was . established under President Bush in 2007 and has grown ‘exponentially’ under President Obama. Bombshell: NSA and FBI have been extracting audio, video, photos, e-mails, documents and other data from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, YouTube, Skype, AOL and PalTalk . Key source: PRISM has been described by NSA officials 'as the most prolific contributor to the president's Daily Brief,' providing analysts with a wealth of 'raw material' Classified: The particulars of the PRISM data-mining program have been outlined in a top-secret PowerPoint presentation for senior intelligence analysts, which ended up being leaked . Participants: This graph shows when each of the nine tech companies joined PRISM, with Apple being the latest addition in October 2012 . Spying: The NSA has been getting millions of phone records from Verizon on a daily basis for months without any justification for the order, that was only revealed today . Plundered: The NSA and FBI have been pulling personal data directly from the mainframes of top US tech giants, including YouTube, Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Verizon for the past six years . The Director of US National . Intelligence said that the law ensures that only ‘non-US persons outside . the US are targeted’, raising the likelihood that Britons are among . those captured in its net. Emma Carr, of Big Brother Watch, said: . ‘We already have laws which allow law enforcement officials to request . information about British citizens using American services. ‘If these laws are being circumvented by using these NSA spying arrangements then that would be a very serious issue.’ Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil rights group Liberty, said: 'These reports suggest a breach of trust on the grandest scale with the US Government, Internet Service Providers and our own UK intelligence community showing contempt for privacy, legality and democracy itself. 'Don't we still believe that spies should be accountable to the public they serve and protect? 'This is the kind of arrogance behind the attempted ""snoopers' charter"". Have those who failed to persuade in the Parliament chamber decided to smuggle blanket surveillance in through the back door?' Revelations about the snooping . programme follow separate reports about the NSA being allowed to collect . all telephone user data from Verizon, one of the largest telephone . firms in the US, for three months. Set up by Harry Truman in . 1953, the NSA is the eyes and ears of America across the globe, . intercepting 1.7 billion emails, phone calls a day’. It . is the the secretive body that serves the military and intelligence . communities by collecting all forms of foreign communications to prevent . attacks on the US. It was . prohibited by law from intercepting domestic communications without a . warrant until George W. Bush issued a caveat in the wake of 9/11 under the controversial 'terrorist surveillance program'. Nonetheless, over the years the NSA has been engulfed in a number of snooping scandals. They . include President Nixon's illegal wiretapping, through the NSA, of five . members of his national security staff, two newsmen, and a staffer at . the Department of Defense in a bid to uncover who was leaking . information about his plans for the Vietnam War. In . 2005 it was revealed George W Bush had authorized the NSA to eavesdrop . on Americans calling abroad without warrants in a bid to thwart . terrorism. He strenuously denied the allegations until he finally . conceded he had committed an impeachable offense. And in 2009, under President Obama, the US Department of Justice acknowledged . the NSA had gone beyond its remit in tapping the phonelines of American . citizens, including a Congressman, but claimed that the acts were . unintentional and had since been rectified. Last month, it was accused of building an £800million cyber base to keep tabs on American citizens. The state-of-the-art data centre in the Utah desert – codenamed Bumblehive – is intended to bolster online security efforts. But former employees say it could be used to monitor people’s private emails. The . NSA branded the allegations 'unfounded', adding that it remained 'unwavering' in its respect for . U.S. laws and American citizens' civil liberties, and noted that it was . subject to broad oversight by all three branches of government.","NSA's Prism program launched in 2007 to mine personal data from 9 firms .

"The United States has no plans to send troops back into Iraq despite the bloody resurgence of an al-Qaeda faction that has captured major cities, seized hundreds of millions of dollars and forced more than a half-million people to flee their homes this week. America has 35,000 troops station around the Middle East, a Pentagon official confirmed on Wednesday, including 10,000 in nearby Kuwait. A State Department official told MailOnline on background that there are no plans to use them. The Sunni-led group called the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) – also known as the Islamic State of Iraq in Syria (ISIS) –  was formerly known as Al-Qaeda in Iraq. On Tuesday the White House touted its past support of the Iraqi government with copious amounts of military hardware, but hinted that a return of armed personnel would be out of the question. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . U.S.Special Forces participated in the 'Eager Lion' joint military exercises in the Gulf of Aqaba on June 5, along with Kuwait, Jordan and France; the US has 2,000 troops stations there, along with a contingent of F-16 fighter jets, and left a Patriot missile battery behind after the war games concluded . Warlord Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has seized control of the Iraqi provincial capital of Tikrit just a day of gaining power in the country's second biggest city Mosul. ISIS militants gathered in this photo in Iraq's Nineveh province . Iraqi soldiers were no match for the group formerly known as Al-Qaeda in Iraq as Jihadists seized all of Mosul and Nineveh province and also took areas in Kirkuk province, to its east, and Salaheddin to the south . 'Our shipments, in terms of assistance to Iraq, have included the delivery of 300 Hellfire missiles, millions of rounds of small arms fire, thousands of rounds of tank ammunition, helicopter-fired rockets, machine guns, grenades, flares, sniper rifles, M16s and M4 rifles to the Iraqi security forces,' Deputy White House Press Secretary Joshua Earnest eagerly cataloged. And a Pentagon source told MailOnline that the U.S. expected to speed up a planned transfer of Apache helicopters – a sale that was put on the back burner after Iraq made a large purchase of guns and ammunition from neighboring Iran. America's support of Nouri al-Maliki's Shia Muslim-led government, Earnest said Tuesday, has been 'rapid, comprehensive, and is continuing.' But Maliki, he said, must 'step up to the plate' and 'better meet the needs of the Iraqi people,' rather than counting on America to ride to the rescue. Separately, Earnest praised former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for 'ending the war in Iraq, responsibly winding down the war in Afghanistan, and decimating and destroying core al-Qaeda.' Clinton is a likely Democratic front-runner for the presidency in 2016. Aboard Air Force One en route to Massachusetts on Wednesday, Earnest stayed away from any suggestion that President Obama and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel might intervene with boots on the ground. 'The United States is deeply concerned about the continued aggression of ISIL in Iraq,' he said, referring to the deterioration of security there as a humanitarian issue. 'The situation in Iraq is grave,' Earnest said, according to a White House pool reporter. There is no doubt that the situation has deteriorated over the last 24 hours.' Earnest, the pool reporter wrote, 'said Washington was continuing to work with the Iraqi government to see how it could help.' The United States has considerable forces at its disposal that could be sent into Iraq, or maneuvered to patrol its waters, if Obama should decide to intervene. A Pentagon official told MailOnline that the U.S. maintains a fighting force of approximately 10,000 troops in Kuwait and 2,000 in Jordan. The units in Jordan include a detachment of F-16 fighter jets and a Patriot missile battery that remained behind after the 2013 joint 'Eager Lion' drills with the Jordanian military. The U.S. also maintains a Combined Air Operations Center in Qatar, and the Navy's 5th fleet in Bahrain. Asked for a comprehensive list of forces in the area, . U.S. Central Command spokesman Commander Bill Speaks told MailOnline: . 'That's kind of a loaded question. Certainly we have a significant . military presence there.' 'Of course, we will not provide details of military assets,' Cmdr. Speaks said in a followup email, 'but there are roughly 35,000 total US forces in the Middle East region.' The U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet is based in the island nation of Bahrain, just 300 miles from Iraq's shores on the Persian Gulf . America has an estimated 35,000 troops in the Middle East, many of whom could quickly reach Iraq if the White House should decide to intervene against ISIS . EXODUS: As many as 500,000 Iraqis have been forced to flee the country's second biggest city of Mosul after militants from an al-Qaeda splinter group seized control . The State Department said Tuesday that the U.S. 'supports a strong, coordinated response to push back against this aggression in Mosul,' Iraq's oil-rich and second largest city, which is now in ISIS hands. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of the so called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, is a warlord considered more dangerous than the late Osama bin Laden . But it made no suggestion that American troops should be part of that response. On Wednesday, ISIS and its terrorist warlord Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi took control of Tikrit, another Iraqi city. Maliki has asked his parliament to declare martial law throughout the country. But the U.S. government, like Britain's, has signaled that moral support and armaments will be the limit of its help. The U.S. pulled its last ground troops out of Iraq in December 2011, following nearly nine years of costly and controversial deployments involving 1.5 million troops. More than 30,000 Americans were wounded in the conflict, and nearly 4,500 were killed. The Obama administration took a victory lap at the time of the final pullout, with the president declaring in a speech at Fort Bragg, N.C. that from that day forward 'Iraqis future will be in the hands of its people. America's war in Iraq will be over.' 'It's harder to end a war than begin one,' Obama said, presaging the slogan that has marked his military withdrawal from Afghanistan. 'Indeed, everything that American troops have done in Iraq – all the fighting and all the dying, the bleeding and the building, and the training and the partnering – all of it has led to this moment of success.' ISIS now controls Mosul, Tikrit and parts of Syria . He also claimed then that U.S. forces had 'broken the momentum of the Taliban' in Afghanistan, and had 'gone after al-Qaeda so that terrorists who threaten America will have no safe haven and Osama bin Laden will never again walk the face of this Earth.' But according to a senior U.S. intelligence official who spoke with The Washington Post, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the ISIS leader who also goes by the moniker 'Abu Dua,' is 'more violent, more virulent, [and] more anti-American' than bin Laden. He claims to be a direct descendant of the Muslim prophet Muhammad. The U.S. currently has a $10 million bounty on his head. Republican Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Kelly Ayotte said Tuesday that a 'growing threat to our national security interests is the cost of President Obama’s decision to withdraw all of our troops from Iraq in 2011, against the advice of our commanders and regardless of conditions on the ground.' 'Unfortunately,' they said in a statement, the president is now making the same disastrous mistake in Afghanistan, increasing the risk that al-Qaeda and its terrorist allies will return there just as they are in Iraq.'","The US has 35,000 troops stationed in the Middle East including 10,000 in Kuwait – plus 10,000 troops, an F-16 detachment and a .

"Mothers are made to feel 'marginalised and ashamed' when they breastfeed in public, according to an international study. Researchers also found that many new mothers are put off breastfeeding by negative comments from health workers. Mothers reported being stared at or tutted at and felt as if they were seen as 'hippies' or 'weirdos'. Others said they wanted to breastfeed after 12 months but feared public disapproval.

Other findings included: . * mothers fear if they breastfeed in public they may be seen as 'hippies, weirdoes or naturalists' while others reported being stared at, frowned at and tutted at . * new mothers in hospital wanting help with feeding were asked to 'stop buzzing' and some were told their baby was 'too lazy' or 'too eager' * others felt distressed by midwives objectifying and handling their breasts in front of their partners . * experiences of shame over baby feeding mean the process can be seen as 'effectively a disease or analagous to one' * a family history of breastfeeding encouraged women to do the same but negative family comments put women off . * women breastfeeding children of 12 months or older felt 'uncomfortable' due to being seen as 'not normal' Dr Gill Thomson, of the Maternal and Infant Nutrition and Nurture Unit at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston, led the study, which also involved researchers in Germany and Sweden. The research, published online in Maternal & Child Nutrition, involved interviews and focus groups with 63 women from a range of backgrounds in two primary care trust areas in North West England. Two thirds of the women were breastfeeding at the time they were interviewed but the duration of breastfeeding varied from a few days to more than 12 months and only a small minority said they breastfed in public. Breastfeeding is known to have important health benefits for mothers and babies. According to the NHS, breastfed babies have less chance of diarrhoea and vomiting, fewer chest and ear infections and less chance of becoming obese, while women who breastfeed have a lower risk of breast and ovarian cancer. But only 46 per cent of UK mothers exclusively breastfeed their child at one week old compared to 83 per cent in Sweden, the authors state. Many new mothers are put off breastfeeding by negative comments from health workers, the study found . At six months, less than one per cent of UK mothers are still exclusively breastfeeding compared to 11 per cent in Sweden. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends breastfeeding exclusively for the first six months of a child's life – and continuing to provide breast milk until a child is two or beyond. The authors wrote: 'The findings of this paper highlight how breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding women may experience judgement and condemnation in interactions with health professionals as well as within community contexts, leading to feelings of failure, inadequacy and isolation.' They added that the findings 'emphasise how breastfeeding women feel equally marginalised and shamed [as non-breastfeeding women], as expressed in their social and clinical encounters and fears about breastfeeding in public spaces. 'As poor care and negative emotions are experienced by women irrespective of their infant feeding methods, these insights highlight how breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding women require targeted needs-led support throughout the perinatal period.' Many of the women felt 'out of control' due to poor information about feeding choices or lack of support. New infant feeding groups that put breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding women together could help provide better support, the authors argued. At six months, less than one per cent of UK mothers are still exclusively breastfeeding compared to 11 per cent in Sweden . The research was part of an evaluation of the UNICEF Community Baby Friendly Implementation project, which accredits maternity and community facilities that adopt internationally recognised standards of best practice. Janet Fyle, professional policy advisor at the Royal College of Midwives, said: 'At the end of the antenatal period the health service dumps women and sends them home with very little support, even though they've been told that breastfeeding is best. 'A lot of women are crying out for help and that's one of the reasons they give up breastfeeding. 'There's a shortage of midwives and if they have to prioritise they will prioritise the women in labour, not the ones who have already given birth.' She said 'outward signs' from society that breastfeeding in public is not welcomed were also a problem. 'If you go to a major store in the UK they put the breastfeeding area in a toilet. Even in an NHS trust a woman has been asked to stop breastfeeding.'","Survey asked 63 mothers who said they were tutted at and seen as 'hippies'

"After the disastrous mid-term elections for President Barack Obama and the Democratic party, the commander in chief could be in dire need of a way to 'shake off' his party's failure at the polls. The answer could be in this hilarious mash-up song which debuted on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon on Tuesday. In the clever clip, a speech by President Obama is woven into Taylor Swift's popular hit song 'Shake it off' and it sounds as though Obama is doing the back up vocals for the track.

Popular: Swift is enjoying a surge in popularity after her new album 1989 notched up the biggest sales week of the last 12 years . The segment uses a part of Obama's speech where he repeats the word 'vote' numerous times in an effort to galvanize his supporters.

"A care worker has appeared in court charged with attempted murder after staff and residents at a sheltered housing complex were taken ill with food poisoning-type symptoms. Melissa Swift was charged following the incident at Goldfield Court, West Bromwich, in which 16 people - including one in their 90s - suffered with nausea and diarrhoea. The 23-year-old, from West Bromwich, is also accused of making threats to kill in relation to the incident at the extra care unit for the elderly. Melissa Swift has been charged with attempted murder after 16 people from Goldfield Court, an extra care unit for the elderly in West Bromwich, pictured above, became ill . Ms Swift was arrested on August 4 after staff and residents reported suffering severe headaches, intense nausea and diarrhoea. Four elderly residents were hospitalised. All have since made a full recovery. In a statement, Housing & Care 21, which runs the care home, told MailOnline: 'Housing & Care 21 puts the safety and wellbeing of our residents first in everything we do. 'We have been working closely with the police to assist them in their investigation.We have kept our staff and residents fully informed and will continue to support them as necessary. 'We are pleased to confirm that those affected have recovered and there have been no further reports of illness.' Goldfield Court is described as 'extra care housing' for older people. There are 93 flats at the site, run by Housing & Care 21. Police forensic officers carried out investigations at Goldfield Court last month, pictured above, . after residents and staff were taken ill .

"Iraqi government forces fled the country's second city yesterday as it was stormed by an al Qaeda group that torched buildings, seized weapons and set hundreds of prisoners free. Security forces ran in terror from the city of Mosul after Islamic militants captured the city - raising black banners marking the Islamic State above seized security bases, police stations and government headquarters. Dramatic photographs showed military vehicles ablaze last night after members of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) captured Mosul. Fearing for their lives, hundreds of families fled the city - a majority Arab area with Assyrian, Turcoman and Kurdish minorities - in a bid to make it to safety. The eventual fall of the city on Tuesday followed four days of fierce fighting in Mosul and the surrounding area - and came as government forces in the region appeared to collapse. Scroll down for video . Scores of Iraqis fled violence in the Nineveh province today after terrorists overrun Mosul. Pictured is hundreds of people waiting in their vehicles at a Kurdish checkpoint in Aski kalak, 40 kms West of Arbil . Smoke rises from a collection of buildings in Mosul. Terrorists have seized numerous government buildings in the city in a day of action today . A car burns during classes between Iraqi security and ISIL forces in Mosul, northern Iraq today . People gather in the city of Mosul - which has been described as the 'gateway to Syria' Groups of children wait with their families on the outskirts of Mosul - hoping to travel to safety . Yesterday, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki pressed parliament to declare a state of emergency following the action. The loss of Mosul marks a heavy defeat . in Baghdad's battle against a widening insurgency by the breakaway . al-Qaida group which has been . trying to seize territory both in Iraq and . neighboring Syria. Earlier this year, the group captured . another Iraqi city, Fallujah, in the west of the country, and . government forces have been unable to take it back after months of . fighting. The far larger Mosul is an even more strategic prize for the extremist group. The city and surrounding Ninevah province are a major export route for Iraqi oil and a gateway to Syria. Mosul, where a majority of the population are Arab (with Assyrian, Turcoman and Kurdish minorities), is located in northern Iraq, close to the borders of Turkey, Syria and Iran . Hundreds of Iraqis pack items in to bags on the outskirts of Mosul as they attempt to flee the city .

Another Iraqi family - all carrying large bags -makes their way through the checkpoint in a bid to avoid danger . Civilian children stand next to a burnt vehicle following violent clashes in the region today . A vehicle set alight during conflict near to the country's third largest city . Regaining Mosul poses a daunting challenge for al-Maliki. The city has a Sunni Muslim majority and many in the community are already deeply embittered against his Shiite-led government. During the nearly nine-year American presence in the country, Mosul was . a major stronghold for al-Qaida and U.S. Iraqi forces carried out . repeated offensives there, regaining a semblance of control but never . routing the insurgents entirely. Insurgents . overran the Ninevah provincial government building in the city - a key . symbol of state control - in the evening, and security forces fled many . of their posts. The fighters stormed police stations, bases and prisons, capturing weapons and freeing prisoners.

Tuesday, Mosul residents said the militants appeared to be in control . of several parts of the city, raising the black banners that are the . emblem of the Islamic State. The residents spoke to The Associated Press by telephone on condition of anonymity, fearing for their safety. In . a nationally televised press conference Tuesday, al-Maliki asked . parliament to declare a state of emergency, acknowledging that militants . had taken control of 'vital areas in Mosul.' He said the public and . government must unite 'to confront this vicious attack, which will spare . no Iraqi.' Military soldiers prepare to take their positions during clashes with militants in the northern city of Mosul, Iraq yesterday . Military vehicles take position on a street during clashes with militants in the northern city of Mosul, but radical Sunni Muslim insurgents seized control  early today . Mr al-Maliki admitted: ‘Iraq is undergoing a difficult stage.’  He said the public and government must unite ‘to confront this vicious attack, which will spare no Iraqi’. Regaining Mosul poses a daunting challenge for Mr al-Maliki. State TV said parliament would convene Thursday. Under the constitution, parliament can declare a 30-day state of . emergency on a two-thirds vote by its members, granting the prime . minister the necessary powers to run the country. Legal experts said . that could include powers to impose curfews, restrict public movements . and censor the media. 'What . happened is a disaster by any standard,' parliament speaker Osama . al-Nujaifi - a Sunni from Mosul - said in a televised address. 'The presence of these terrorist groups in this vast province ... threatens not just the security and the unity of Iraq, but the whole . Middle East,' he said. He . said militants had seized helicopters at Mosul airport and captured . weapons depots, and captured several villages and a military airbase . further south in Salahuddin province, he said. Residents began fleeing Mosul - though the size of the flight was not yet clear. The fall of Mosul deals a serious blow to Baghdad's efforts to fight Sunni militants who have regained ground and momentum in Iraq over the past year and pushed into Mosul last week . Police, military and security officials said  the insurgents, armed with anti-aircraft weapons and rocket-propelled grenades, had taken over almost all police and army checkpoints in and around the Mosul . A . government employee who lives about a mile from the provincial . government building, Umm Karam, said she left with her family Tuesday . morning. 'The situation is . chaotic inside the city and there is nobody to help us,' she said, . speaking on condition she be identified by a nickname for fear of her . safety. 'We are afraid ... There is no police or army in Mosul.' The . assault in Mosul is also a sign of Iraq's reversals since American . forces left the country in late 2011. Militants ramped their insurgency . back up over the past two years. The Islamic State has presented itself as the Sunni community's . champion against al-Maliki's Shiite-led government as the group fights . on both sides of the border in what Iraqi officials have said is an . attempt to carve out an enclave for itself in western Iraq and eastern . Syria. The group, which . was once al-Qaida's branch in Iraq, was thrown out of the terrorist . network after it expanded its operations in Syria against the orders of . al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri. It is considered one of the most . ruthless rebel forces fighting to topple President Bashar Assad in . Syria, where it has in seized a major city in the east and other . territory. Two Iraqi army officers said security forces had received orders to leave the city after militants captured the Ghizlani army base in southern Mosul and set more than 200 prisoners free from a high security jail . The retreating army and police forces set fire to fuel and ammunition depots in order to prevent the militants from using them, the Iraqi officers said . In Iraq, the . group rose up earlier this year to take over Fallujah and parts of the . nearby city of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province. It has also been . carrying out a campaign of bombings and other violence in Baghdad and . other parts of the country. In . the Mosul fighting, insurgents armed with machineguns and . rocket-propelled grenade launchers stormed the provincial headquarters . building late Monday, overpowering guards in a short firefight, . according to Ali Mahmoud, the media official for Ninevah province. He . confirmed accounts by Mosul residents that many of the police and army . forces that had been stationed in the city had disappeared by Tuesday. Provincial . governor Atheel al-Nujaifi, the parliament speaker's brother, was in a . nearby guest house. He managed to escape the area and left the city, . though he continues to monitor the situation, Mahmoud said. On Monday, the governor had urged residents to fend off the attackers. 'I . call upon the men of Mosul to stand firm in their areas and to defend . them against the strangers and to form public committees in their . districts to help their people and to protect their areas,' he said in a . transcript of a speech posted online.","Families fled Iraq's second city today after it was overrun by terrorists .

"Protestants are no longer America's religious majority. New figures reveal that for the first time ever just 47 per cent of the United States identifies with the denomination. And more than one in five citizens are religiously unaffiliated.

White Evangelical Protestants: Though once the majority, this map shows the few states where the demographic is still a majority . Thirteen states are largely non-religious, which is 22 per cent of the country. The highest figures fall in Oregon (37 per cent), New Hampshire (35 per cent), Washington State (33 per cent), and Vermont (32 per cent). That is almost tied with the nation's Catholic population, which stands at 23 per cent. Catholicism is most prominent in the Northeast where 34 per cent identifies with the religion. Rhode Island is home to the majority of the region's Cathoilcs, with 44 per cent. Unaffiliated: The number of Americans who do not identify as religious is rising, particularly in the Northwest . Catholic: Catholicism remains strong, particularly in the Northeast, with a strong group of Hispanic Catholics in the South . Though the majority of Catholics are white, Hispanic Catholics are a growing demographic. Around 49 per cent of Catholics under 29 are Hispanic.

"'Untenable position': Former Navy officer David Axon, above,  was relieved of his command of the HMS Somerset after junior officers complained of bullying . A disgraced Royal Navy captain is suing the Ministry of Defence for more than £300,000 damages after a civil servant exposed his bullying in a newspaper. Former commander David Axon says his human rights were breached when a military press officer leaked the story of how his verbal abuse of junior officers led him to be relieved of the command of the warship HMS Somerset. He is seeking the damages on the grounds that the MoD employed Bettina Jordan-Barber – who was later charged with misconduct in public office for selling stories to the press – and that she obtained the details of his punishment from colleagues or office computers. Last night, one leading media lawyer warned that the case could trigger a flood of copycat claims. Mr Axon’s legal team say the disciplinary action, which was taken after two junior naval officers accused him of intimidating them, should have remained secret, and that its exposure caused him ‘loss, distress, anxiety, humiliation and damage to his reputation’. ‘The claimant suffered the humiliation of having his reputation sullied in the national press. The articles were read by family and friends as well as potential employers,’ they say in a High Court writ, which has been seen by The Mail on Sunday. They also highlight the ‘failure’ of the MoD to ‘acknowledge its wrongdoing or to apologise’. The writ was drawn up by Hugh Tomlinson QC, a human rights barrister who sits on the board of media regulation pressure group Hacked Off. He has also represented celebrities seeking privacy injunctions. Mr Axon – who ironically now delivers speeches about workplace bullying – is being represented by leading libel lawyers Carter-Ruck. The 49-year-old was an officer in the Royal Navy from 1986 until 2004 when he was abruptly removed from his command of the Type 23 frigate HMS Somerset at Gibraltar after a six-month tour of the Gulf. First, a male junior officer had used a 24-hour helpline to complain that Mr Axon’s style of leadership amounted to bullying. A female crew member later came forward with similar claims. After a ‘confidential internal equal opportunities investigation’, Mr Axon was told his position in the ship was ‘untenable’. He was given a desk job and later received a ‘censure’ – a formal written warning to remain on his file for five years. Mr Axon's lawyers say the disciplinary action should have remained secret, and that its exposure caused him ‘loss, distress, anxiety, humiliation and damage to his reputation’ (HMS Somerset above) Meanwhile, Ms Jordan-Barker ‘unlawfully and corruptly disclosed’ details to The Sun. She was paid £5,000 for the information and the paper published two stories about Mr Axon in December 2004. According to the writ, only a handful of senior naval figures knew about what had happened and all MoD employees ‘had a duty to keep the information confidential’. Military press officer, Bettina Jordan-Barber, leaked news of Mr Axon's punishment to the Sun newspaper . Mr Axon’s lawyers claim: ‘In corruptly disclosing the claimant’s [Mr Axon’s] information to The Sun newspaper, Ms Jordan-Barber was acting in the course of her employment with the defendant [the MoD] and the defendant is vicariously liable for her wrongdoing.’ This is because she ‘obtained the claimant’s information from other employees or from the defendant’s computers or filing systems’. ‘The wrongful conduct was, in all the circumstances, so closely connected with acts which Ms Jordan-Barber was authorised to carry out that the wrongful conduct could fairly and properly be regarded as being in the ordinary course of her employment.’ Mr Axon found out what had happened only last year when he was contacted by police investigating phone hacking and corrupt payments by newspapers. The high- profile trial of senior figures at The Sun and News of the World was told that Miss Jordan-Barker was paid more than £80,000 over five years for providing exclusive stories. So far, at least ten police officers, prison guards and press officers have been charged with selling stories to newspapers under Scotland Yard’s Operation Elveden. Lawyers now believe that even notorious criminals who had confidential details of their lives behind bars leaked by corrupt prison guards could serve writs against the Ministry of Justice. Media lawyer David Banks said: ‘This would seem to open a real can of worms. This case is the trigger for others in this situation to take action. Even a criminal who has information leaked by a prison officer about them could say it is a breach of confidence.’ An MoD spokesman said: ‘Due to ongoing legal proceedings, it would be inappropriate for us to comment.’ Mr Axon could not be reached for comment.","Former commander David Axon was accused of bullying junior officers .

"Murdered: Christiane Remacle was savagely beaten and raped, and her clothes had been ripped off, apart from one of her stockings . For the family of 19-year-old Christiane Remacle, the unending torment began on New Year’s morning 25 years ago. Entering their daughter’s room to wish her seasonal greetings and ask about the party she’d attended the night before, her parents found her bed empty and undisturbed. As Christiane had never stayed out overnight without telling them, they immediately sensed something was wrong. But when they tried to find out what had happened to the teenager — a pretty, bright girl who was ‘the apple of their eye’, according to her older sister, Annie — her friends were baffled. They’d last seen her setting off to walk home, they said. It was not until mid-January of that year, 1989, that the grim truth emerged. A police search had failed to find Christiane, but her body was discovered by a hunter, in a forest close to the party venue, in Antwerp, Belgium. She had been savagely beaten and raped, and her clothes had been ripped off, apart from one of her stockings. The other, which had been used to strangle her, was still wrapped around her neck. There was one obvious suspect. Then 25, Frank Van Den Bleeken had already committed a string of serious sexual offences, yet thanks to Belgium’s scandalously lenient justice system, he had been freed from jail and was prowling his old haunts again. Desperate to keep his liberty, he denied the murder, and it was only when he was confronted by his mother that he confessed. Cunning as ever, Van Den Bleeken convinced a judge he was insane, and was sent to a secure institution — a decision which satisfied Christiane’s family, since they believed he would be locked away for many years. Disgracefully, the burly sex fiend was freed after just seven years, whereupon he brutally attacked three more victims within a few weeks (one was just 11 years old) before, finally, he was locked away indefinitely. This was in the mid-Nineties. Since then, Christiane’s parents, Gustaaf and Mary, have both died, effectively killed by their grief, their family believes. But Van Den Bleeken, 50, has also been suffering — at least, that is, if we believe his lawyers. Unable to escape his overwhelming predatory urges, and denied the psychiatric treatment that might help him, they say, he has endured terrible mental anguish at the prospect of being trapped with his thoughts for ever. Controversial: Van Den Bleeken's lawyers argue that the 50-year-old has also been suffering in jail . Indeed, they have been arguing in the Belgian courts for the past three years that so unbearable is his existence that he ought to be allowed to end his life — or rather, have doctors end it for him, by a lethal injection — under the country’s liberal euthanasia law. It is rather like Ian Huntley, say, or Rosemary West, asking a British judge for the right to die because they could no longer tolerate life inside their top-security prisons. Just imagine the outcry among both the public and their victims. Remember the furore when Ian Brady tried recently to win permission to move from a secure hospital to prison, so that he could starve himself to death without being stopped by staff. In Belgium, however, as in neighbouring Holland, whose dubious moral and ethical values have permeated across the border, they do things very differently from the rest of Europe. Unlike the assisted dying bill being proposed in Britain, which would give terminally ill people the right to end their lives, and only in the rarest of circumstances, the rules in the Lowland countries are considerably more lax. ‘Unbearable suffering’ is the vague yardstick by which it is permitted. Recently, Belgium even sanctioned euthanasia for children, and last year more than 1,800 people were granted permission to commit suicide — a 27 per cent increase on 2012. Thus, to the disbelief of Christiane’s surviving relatives, this week her killer’s death-wish was finally granted. In ghastly contrast to the suffering he caused his victims and their loved ones, Van Den Bleeken’s end will be pain-free and quick. Early next week, when the final legal formalities have been completed, he will be allowed to spend two days saying his goodbyes to family and friends. Then, in a pleasant hospital room, he will be sent into an everlasting sleep. ‘The process is very simple,’ says a source close to the case. ‘There is no question of any pain. Chemicals are injected into the body, creating a feeling of relaxation, then he will drift into unconsciousness and life will stop. It is utterly humane.’ Van Den Bleeken is in a secure unit in Bruges with some 150 other patients, and his lawyer told the Mail last night: ‘It is unbearable for him. He hears the other patients shouting and crying all day and night, and cannot live with it. ‘He knows he could live for another 30 years — he’s in a good physical state, but his mind is dead. He has stopped walking, as he used to do, and just sits in his cell all the time. He does, however, go to mass once a week. He has become very religious. Plea: It is rather like Ian Huntley (right) or Rosemary West (left), asking a British judge for the right to die because they could no longer tolerate life inside their top-security prisons . ‘He knows he’s made mistakes and in his own mind he doesn’t deserve to be alive.’ The Antwerp-born killer hails from a traditional Belgian working-class Roman Catholic family, an irony given the Catholic Church’s strong opposition to euthanasia. He claims he, too, was raped, when he was 15. Of course, there will be some in Britain who take a cynical view of Van Den Bleeken’s victory. They will point out that there are 11,500 sex offenders in our prisons: one in eight of all inmates. The cost of keeping them off the streets is more than £50,000 per prisoner: a staggering £575 million. If they are really so keen to expunge themselves, why not let those who are seeking an easy way out of their punishment do the taxpayer a favour? Yesterday, however, campaigners on either side of the debate were almost universal in their condemnation of the decision to allow Van Den Bleeken to end his life when he chooses. Christiane Remacle's family can barely believe that Van Den Bleeken (pictured) has been spared a possible 30 or 40 more years of incarceration . According to Dan Boucher, director of parliamentary affairs for the Christian charity CARE, which opposed the UK bill, it proves that, having opened the doors to assisted suicide 12 years ago, Belgium has already slid dangerously far down the slippery slope. Indeed, during the 24 hours since the Van Den Bleeken judgment was handed down, at least 15 more Belgian prisoners have lodged right-to-die requests with the country’s Federal Euthanasia Commission, and many more are expected to follow. ‘Once a country embraces the culture of death with its laws, then it’s not surprising that legality should start to widen the categories of people who can access it,’ Dan Boucher told me. ‘If we allow a sex offender to end his life, then who comes next?’ Who indeed. The respected medical ethicist Dr Helen Watt puts it this way: ‘We should never agree with a suicidal prisoner, or any other suicidal person, that his life is not worth living. Those who are rightly being punished for their crimes should receive proper health care, and their doctors should not be co-opted for procedures that are the very reverse of healthcare. ‘This is not capital punishment, but is billed as a “medical procedure” based on the prisoner’s low sense of self-worth. It is a clear sign of the slippery slope in euthanasia.’ Dr Iain Brassington, meanwhile, a senior lecturer in bioethics at Manchester University Law School, takes a different view. He says the issue hinges largely on whether society sees the purpose of prison as retribution or rehabilitation, and whether a prisoner committing suicide could truly be said to be ‘cheating justice’. Those who have suffered at Van Den Bleeken’s hands have no truck with such intellectual debate. Though his lawyer portrays him as remorseful, and attributes his personality disorder to a disturbed childhood which saw him placed in care at six, they can barely believe that he has been spared a possible 30 or 40 more years of incarceration. ‘Commissions, doctors and other “experts” have all investigated the highs and lows of our sister’s killer,’ Annie Remacle said yesterday. ‘And during all these years, not a single commission has examined the case of our parents’, or ours. ‘Not a single doctor or expert has asked us how we are. Now his lawyers say how much their client suffers! Well, we are suffering, too.’ Quite so, and for all those who loved the pretty young woman who went to a New Year’s party and never returned, there is no easy escape from the agony.

"Super model Kate Moss has been super busy lately landing jobs as the face of Versace and St Tropez, posing on the cover of Allure magazine ... and now designing a range of phone accessories for Carphone Warehouse. The High Street phone brand might not be as glamorous as her usual collaborations, but no doubt the deal to lend her name to a 'fash-tech' collection for the company is helping to pay for her recent string of luxury holidays. And, as demonstrated in the designs unveiled today, fashion's most famous face has managed to inject some serious style in to the everyone's favourite accessory. Kate Moss has designed an accessory range for Carphone Warehouse . A first look at a new range of tech accessories for Carphone Warehouse designed exclusively by Kate Moss . Black is the new black for Kate whose designs include delicate studs and a mock croc effect . The accessories feature a small anchor, inspired by a tattoo Kate has on her right wrist . The collection draws inspiration from the style icon’s own wardrobe and is intended to capture her classic, understated style in a range of leather and metallic cases. The designs are simple and subtle and all come in the fash pack's favourite colour: black. They include a patent crocodile skin design with gold . embellishment that Kate designed around her favourite vintage lighter; a . bold metallic, star case that was inspired by a diamond necklace from . Kate’s jewellery box; and the simple anchor emblem taken from a tattoo on her wrist that has become her personal monogram across the whole range. Kate Moss said, 'The range is a reflection of my personal style and every piece was inspired by something I already own and wear.  After spending time designing each piece individually, I’ve loved seeing the range and my vision come to life. Julian Diment, Marketing Director at Carphone Warehouse comments, 'We’re excited to see our customers’ reaction when the range goes on sale next week. We know they’ve been waiting for a credible, fashion line for their phones and Kate has really delivered. Our design team is already hard at work with Kate on the next collection, and exploring the full potential of ""fashion-tech"".' The range has been inspired by items that Kate owns and loves including a vintage lighter and jewellery box . Personal touch: The logo across the range is an anchor that Kate has tattooed on her wrist . Last month pictures were released of . Kate meeting with the Carphone Warehouse team to discuss her collection, . which is  geared towards 'fashion conscious smartphone users'. Kate Moss’s latest career move is a bit more down to earth than her usual high fashion jobs. Miss Moss, who has posed for exclusive designers including Chanel and Burberry, is working on the range for an undisclosed fee. The company recruited the model in a bid to cash in on what it calls ‘fashion tech’ – or phone . accessories aimed at customers who ‘are crying out’ for something more . stylish than cheap plastic cases. For . Moss, it may lack the glamour of strutting the catwalks in Paris or . Milan, but Carphone believes adding her touch to the humble phone case . will tempt female customers who see her as a style icon. Decisions decisions: The collection, due to launch later in the summer, will combine Kate's love of all things fashion with technology . Pensive: The 39-year-old met with the team to discuss her upcoming designs, which are geared towards 'fashion conscious smartphone users' A lucrative four year partnership with . Sir Philip Green at Topshop, reported to have earned her more than . £3million, ended in 2010. She . no longer acts as the face of Mango, the Spanish clothing chain, with .

"A mystery woman was on the bridge alongside cowardly captain Francesco Schettino when his ship ran aground off an Italian island on Friday night, it emerged today. The blonde woman is a 25-year-old Moldovan crew member who was not properly identified by investigators as she reportedly did not appear on any official manifest for the Costa Concordia. She is passenger rep Domnica Cemortan, possibly hired without a proper contract. Reports speculated she may have been on the bridge because Schettino was trying to impress her. Mystery: Moldovan Domnica Cemortan, 25, was on the bridge with Schettino when the Costa Concordia crashed . The Moldovan dancer admitted she was Captain Francesco Schettino's lover and boarded the Costa Concordia without a ticket . Prosecutor Francesco Verusio had asked police to try and trace the woman, pictured on the doomed Concordia just before it left Civitavecchia harbour on the evening it ran aground. She is swiftly emerging as a key witness to the chain of events up until the liner struck an underwater reef just off the island of Giglio. Witnesses have said that she appeared to know Schettino. But a statement from Costa Cruises later confirmed Ms Cemortan was an authorised passenger. It said: 'Costa Cruises would like to clarify that the law as it stands, safety regulations and the control systems applied meticulously by the company do not permit the embarkation of unregistered passengers. 'Based on the pictures broadcast by the media, the woman stated as being in the company of Captain Schettino on the evening of January 13th was certainly embarked on January 13th in Civitavecchia and duly registered. 'The company is ready to provide the authorities, when requested, with the identity of the person and the number of the ticket purchased.' Investigators want to find out where she was at the moment the Concordia hit the rocks. There is also the possibility she would have key evidence on what happened in the moments after the fatal 'sail by' which was apparently carried out by Schettino as a 'salute' to a former captain. It is believed that Miss Cemortan, from Chisnau, Moldova, was working as a passenger rep for Costa Cruises and gave a brief interview to the media defending Schettino, adding that his actions had helped save the lives of holidaymakers and crew. She has also said in an interview on Moldovan TV that she did have dinner with the captain, but that she went to the bridge after the impact to give instructions to Russian speaking passengers. Rescue: Firefighters climb up a ladder on to the Costa Concordia as it lies on its side off the island of Giglio, Tuscany . Race against time: A technician aims a laser scanner at the cruise liner. There are fears impending bad weather could cause the ship to fall off the ledge on which it is resting . Italian newspapers suggested that she . was the blonde woman seen dining with Schettino at around 9pm - just . under 30 minutes before the disaster - but there is also the possibility . she may have been the guest of another officer on the liner. Last . night in a bizarre twist a male passenger had to be taken off the . Concordia's sister ship Serena after suffering a heart attack as the . liner sailed past Giglio at the start of a seven-day cruise. Searching . has resumed on the stricken vessel with divers focusing primarily on . the stern by the deck four restaurant muster station, where the majority . of the 21 people still listed as missing were thought to be. The area is where seven of the bodies recovered so far have been found. Operation: Italian divers will use explosives to get into the hull of the Costa Concordia . Impact: A satellite image shows the stricken cruise liner on its side in shallow water . The operation is now focusing on retrieving the remaining bodies before the weather worsens. Diving . teams will use explosive charges to get into the superstructure of the . Concordia's hull so that they can reach areas of the liner more quickly . as there are fears the ship could topple over the rock ledge on which it . is resting. Searches . have been called off twice after movement was detected - if the . Concordia does slip it will plunge almost 100m to the bottom of the . Mediterranean. They were given up to 24 hours to complete their search this morning as predictions of rough seas were made for later today. Eleven people died and 21 are still missing after the Costa Concordia hit a submerged reef off the island of Giglio on Friday night. It comes after a member of the crew on board the cruise liner told the Italian coastguard the vessel had only suffered a power outage and there was no emergency, according to a new recording. News channel Sky TG 24, which broadcast the tape, said it was the first radio conversation between the coastguard and the ship after it hit a rock off Tuscany's coast on Friday night. The conversation began at 21:12GMT - around 30 minutes after the accident. By then, many passengers had called relatives on their cell phones asking them to alert the police, who in turn told the coastguard to check on the state of the ship. Operation: Firefighters travel past the vast cruise liner . Despair: Relatives and friends of victims of the cruise liner disaster arrive at Giglio Porto . 'Good evening Costa Concordia, please, do you have problems on board?', a coastguard official asks the bridge. An unidentified member of the crew replies: 'We've had a blackout, we are checking the conditions on board.' The coastguard asks: 'What kind of a problem? Is it just something with . the generator? The police ... have received a phone call from the . relatives of a sailor who said that during the dinner everything was . falling on his head.' He says some passengers were already wearing life jackets. The crew member simply repeats that there has been a blackout. 'We are . checking the conditions on boar,' he says, promising to keep the . coastguard informed. Search: 21 people are still unaccounted for with time running out for the divers searching the cruise liner . Vigil: Family and friends of Jerry and Barbara Heil, the only Americans still unaccounted for on the Costa Concordia, attend a prayer service in White Bear Lake, Minnesota . Eleven people were killed in the accident and 24 are still unaccounted . for, although some of the dead have yet to be identified. The captain of the ship, Francesco Schettino, is under house arrest and . has been accused of multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and . abandoning ship. In another leaked recording released this week, the Italian coastguards . are heard angrily pleading with Schettino and telling him to return to . his listing ship. The ship operators have blamed him for the disaster and praised the rest of the crew for their efforts to save lives. Passengers have complained that they were left for hours waiting in . lifeboats, stairwells and assembly points before the order to evacuate . was issued. By the end of the week the salvage operation is expected to begin on the 2,200 tonnes of heavy-duty diesel in the Concordia's tanks which could cause an environmental disaster if it leaks. Once the go-ahead is given for the pumping to begin - and a huge salvage barge is already at the dock in Giglio - it will take as long as a month to remove all the fuel.

"The female air force pilot whose missions against Isis were dubbed 'boobs on the ground' has reportedly been disowned by her family and labelled an 'ingrate'. Mariam Al Mansouri's participation in F-16 bombing raids for the UAE was celebrated in the West, but an anonymous statement claiming to be from her family 'disowned' her for 'taking part in the brutal international aggression' against Syria. It also expressed support for the Islamic State, saying 'we are proud of the Sunni heroes in Iraq and the Levant'. The brutal terrorist group's original name was the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or Isil. Scroll down for video . Courageous: Major Mansouri, from Abu Dhabi, made a remarkable rise through the ranks of the UAE air force. She's pictured here in an F-16 Desert Eagle . Major Al Mansouri's F-16 fighter was one of several from a group of Arab nations that are blitzing Isis . In the name of God All Merciful. 'O ye who believe! Take not your fathers or your brethren for friends if they favour disbelief over faith. Those of you who taketh them for friends are wrong-doers.' [Quranic verse] . 'Renouncement of Mariam Al Mansouri: . 'We the Mansouri family in the United Arab Emirates hereby publicly declare that we disown the so-called Mariam Al Mansouri as well as anyone taking part in the brutal international aggression against the brotherly Syrian people, starting with our ingrate daughter Mariam Al Mansouri. 'We hereby remind the Muslim nation all over the world of its duty to defend the causes of the nation [meaning the Islamic nation], and we urge them to take up the jihad [holy war] for the sake of God to support the blessed Syrian revolution against the descendants of Ibn Al Alqami.' [Sunni Islamist insurgents refer to the Shi'a as 'alqami' - a reference to Mu'ayyad al-Din Muhammad Ibn al-Alqami, a Shi'ite minister in the last Abbasid caliphate, who purportedly assisted the Mongols in conquering Baghdad in 1258.] . 'We call upon all factions and battalions operating on the Syrian battleground to unite and join efforts and forces towards the single objective of overthrowing the monstrous Assad regime perched on the pure and blessed Syrian land. 'Al Mansouri family, in the UAE and abroad, takes this opportunity to declare its support for the blessed Syrian revolution and to all free men defending their rights everywhere in the world. 'Our family is proud of all free men who defend their cause and of all those who take up arms to defend the honour of their nation [The Islamic Nation}. We are proud of the Sunni heroes in Iraq and the Levant and all those who take up the banner of righteousness wherever they may be. We may not know them, but God knows them and would champion them. 'We ask our countrymen not to burden us with the consequences of the actions of the so-called Mariam Al Mansouri. All the honourable members of our family have agreed to this statement. 'Al Mansouri family.' The statement also expressed support for the Syrian revolution, according to the Palestinian Wattan news agency. It said: 'We the Mansouri family in the United Arab Emirates hereby publicly declare that we disown the so-called Mariam Al Mansouri as well as anyone taking part in the brutal international aggression against the brotherly Syrian people, starting with our ingrate daughter Mariam Al Mansouri. 'We ask our countrymen not to burden us with the consequences of the actions of the so-called Mariam Al Mansouri.' It continued: 'We call upon all factions... on the Syrian battleground to unite and join efforts and forces towards the single objective of overthrowing the monstrous Assad regime. 'Our family is proud of all free men who defend their cause and of all those who take up arms to defend the honour of their nation [the Islamic Nation]. We are proud of the Sunni heroes in Iraq and the Levant and all those who take up the banner of righteousness wherever they may be.' It's not clear whether the views expressed in the statement represent those of the entire family or indeed if it is genuine. The Mansouri tribe has some influential members, including the country's economics minister, but it's also very large – the second biggest in Abu Dhabi, the capital of UAE, so it certainly can't be assumed that the views expressed in the statement are representative of the whole group. The statement could well have been made anonymously out of fear of punishment, as voicing dissent against the UAE government can result in imprisonment. If true, the statement won't represent the first time the Mansouri family has been linked to extremism. In January this year high-profile lawyer Mohammed al-Mansoori was jailed for allegedly trying to set up an 'international' branch of the controversial Muslim Brotherhood in the UAE, according to the BBC. Major Mansouri, from Abu Dhabi, made a remarkable rise through the ranks of the UAE air force. She joined it in 2007 and is now a squadron commander. She is one of eight children and has a degree in English literature. The UAE is known to have the most liberal views on women's rights in the Middle East and Mansouri said that she was treated as an equal by her commanding officers. She told Deraa Al Watan magazine: 'Everybody is required to have the same high level of combat competence.' She says that her nearest relatives are supportive of her role in the air force. There was also no difference between men and women with regards to training and assignments, she said. 'Everybody is required to have the same high level of combat competence,' Earlier this week Fox News host Eric Bolling apologised for calling Major Mansouri's missions as 'boobs on the ground'. Major Mansouri, from Abu Dhabi, made a remarkable rise through the ranks of the UAE air forc . A Fox News host has issued an apology after making a sexist comment about a female fighter pilot earlier this week on The Five. During a segment about Maj. Mariam Al Mansouri, a female pilot from the United Arab Emirates who led a mission this week against ISIS in Syria, Eric Bolling referred to her mission as 'boobs on the ground.' Now, after outrage from viewers, and even his own wife, following these insensitive remarks, he has apologized. 'I made a joke and when I got home, I got the look, and realized some people didn't think it was funny at all,' Bolling said on the air today. 'I said sorry to my wife and I apologize to all of you as well and want to make that very clear.' This all began when Bolling's cohost, Kimberly Guilfoyle, praised Maj. Mansouri on the program Wednesday afternoon. 'Hey ISIS, you were bombed by a woman,' Guilfoyle said. 'Oh yeah, hell came down on ISIS in Syria, because guess what: the first female pilot piloting for the [United Arab Emirates], there she was, leading the strikes. Dropped the bombs on ISIS Monday night.' Maj. Mansouri, 35, was the first woman to join the Emirati Air Force. 'This is really incredible,' Guilfoyle continued. 'Major Mariam Al Mansouri is who did this. Remarkable, very excited. I wish it was an American pilot. I'll take a woman doing this any day to them. Right after she said this, the men on the panel began making sexist jokes. It comes as Britain, Belgium and Denmark on Friday joined the U.S.-led coalition of nations that are launching airstrikes on Isis. The European politicians flatly described the moves as critical to security on home soil, arguing that facing down terrorists has become a matter of urgency. Prime Minister David Cameron made a passionate plea for action in drastic terms - noting that the militants had beheaded their victims, gouged out eyes and carried out crucifixions to promote goals 'from the Dark Ages.' 'This is about psychopathic terrorists that are trying to kill us and we do have to realize that, whether we like it or not, they have already declared war on us,' he said. 'There isn't a `walk on by' option. There isn't an option of just hoping this will go away.' Cameron told a tense House of Commons during more than six hours of debate that the hallmarks of the campaign would be 'patience and persistence, not shock and awe' - a reference to the phrase associated with the invasion of Iraq. That unpopular intervention has cast a shadow over the discussions because critics fear that Europe will be drawn into a wider conflict, specifically taking on the Islamic group's fighters in Syria. British MPs voted 524-43 for action after being urgently recalled from a recess. Belgian lawmakers also overwhelmingly approved, voting 114-2 to take part, despite widespread concerns that more terrorism may follow in their homeland as a result. The White House said in a statement that it welcomed the countries to the coalition. 'These decisions - along with those by Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Qatar to participate in airstrikes against ISIL in Syria - demonstrate the clear commitment of the international community to take action together against these terrorists,' the statement reads.","Mariam Al Mansouri's F-16 bombing raids were celebrated in the West .

"A 14-year-old babysitter has been arrested outside Dallas after she drowned a three-month-old girl while the baby's mother was away at work, police say. The teen, who was not named, is a relative of the dead infant, though police did not say how they are related. The drowning shocked residents of the apartment complex in southern Dallas County, Texas, where neighbors say the teen girl and her twin sister were often seen walking to school. Police were called to the apartment about 6.15am on Monday and found the infant already dead. It is believed that this is the 14-year-old girl accused of drowning a three-month-old baby while the infant's mother was at work . Detectives said they believe the drowning was intentional. 'It breaks my heart anytime you respond to a call and someone so innocent…no one more innocent then an infant child… and to try to ascertain what was could have been going through anyone’s mind that would cause the death of innocent child. My heart goes out to the family,' Dallas police Sergeant Warren Mitchell told KTVT-TV. The station reports that the mother rushed home after learning about the death. She could be heard screaming outside her apartment as detectives conducted their investigation. The drowning happened about 6.15am. When authorities arrived, the infant was already dead . As distraught family members gathered outside the home, at least one woman collapsed and had to be taken to the hospital for examination. At least one other teen was in the apartment at the time of the drowning. That teen is being questioned as a witness. So far, the teen babysitter has not been formally charged. She is being held at a juvenile detention center. Detectives did not comment on a motive behind the killing.","The girl is a relative of the dead infant, police say .

"Daniela Vargova, (pictured) whose heart is too weak to pump blood around her body, is being kept alive by hi-tech equipment in her handbag . A young woman whose heart is too weak to pump blood around her body is being kept alive thanks to hi-tech equipment in her handbag. Daniela Vargova, from Chippenham in Wiltshire, almost died when her heart began to fail. The 30-year-old now relies on a battery-powered pump to operate her bionic heart and keep her alive. Having to keep the device with her at all times means Ms Vargova carries the life-saving pack in her handbag. She will rely on the pump, which is known as a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) until a donor heart becomes available, after suffering a series of cardiac arrests. ‘Sometimes I find it tough carrying the LVAD around with me all the time,' she said. 'It’s quite weird knowing that it’s thanks to something in my handbag that I’m alive. ‘But I know how lucky I am - I’ve been given such a great chance to live that not everyone has. ‘I wouldn’t get the opportunity to do all those little things in life that people love if it wasn’t for my LVAD.’ She said that because the device is stashed away in her handbag, people fail to realise she has heart problems and it enables her to spend time with her husband, Feliks Rahuoja, 29, and family. In August 2013, Ms Vargova underwent almost 4 hours of surgery to be fitted with the LVAD at the Harefield Hospital in London. She also received treatment closer to home at the Bath Royal United Hospital. ‘It’s been a long road but now I get to live life normally,’ she said. ‘The LVAD is fitted internally - so there is a wire that goes from the external pack into my groin and travels up to my chest. ‘The external part are the batteries that keep the pump going - which is the part I carry in my bag. The 30-year-old must keep the power pack for her bionic heart with her at all times, so she carries it around in her handbag (pictured) In August 2013, Ms Vargova (pictured) underwent almost four hours of surgery to be fitted with her LVAD at Harefield Hospital. 'It's been a long road to but now I get to live life normally,' she said . ‘It weighs about two and a half kilos, so it’s pretty tiring to carry it around all day. ‘I have to change the batteries every six hours so I always keep two spares too. ‘There is no limit to how long I can have it in - there are some people I know who have had an LVAD for several years. ‘It’s hard to live with sometimes but it certainly does the trick. I could have quite easily died last year, so I just feel so lucky that I’m alive.’ Ms Vargova was fitted with her LVAD after suffering a life-threatening cardiac arrest in July last year,  having had problems for around six months. She first began to become unwell in December 2012, when she suffered with a severe cough and chest pains. ‘I knew something was seriously wrong because I was just so ill all the time - I could hardly do basic day to day things,’ she said. ‘Eventually we went to hospital and on the way there I had a cardiac arrest. Ms Vargova (pictured left) said that because the device is stashed away in her handbag, people cannot guess she has heart problems and it enables her to spend time with her husband, Feliks, and her family . Ms Vargova’s surgeon, Mr André Simon, director of transplantation at the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘A ventricular assist device (VAD) is a mechanical blood pump that is used to support the function of a failing heart. ‘They are used in patients like Daniela, whose only option is a heart transplant and this is known as a ‘bridge to transplant’. ‘The VAD enables patients to leave hospital and continue to live their life until a much-needed donor heart can be found. ‘Many people are able to go to work, school or university and we even have patients who travel abroad with their VAD. ‘Unfortunately there is a severe shortage of donor organs and many patients are living with a VAD for several years before receiving a transplant.’ ‘I was diagnosed with ventricular arrhythmia - an abnormal heart beat - and we were told that it was fairly easy to manage and I would be fine - I was given an ICD [a type of pacemaker] and we thought that would be the end of it. ‘But the symptoms came back and that’s when I was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy…which meant my heart was too weak to pump the blood around my body. ‘I was told my only option was a heart transplant and was transferred to Harefield Hospital. ‘It was just so unexpected and overwhelming - I’ve never heard of anyone having a transplant before.’ Ms Vargova’s heart was only functioning at 10 per cent and after three months in hospital she had a cardiac arrest. ‘Doctors told Feliks that I had a very low chance of survival and he should call my family as it was unlikely I would make it,’ she said. ‘I was rushed to theatre because the ICD hadn’t kicked in and my heart function was below one per cent. Ms Vargova's problems began six months before she was fitted with the LVAD. She was given a pacemaker but was later diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy and had a cardiac arrest. Doctors told her husband Feliks (pictured with Ms Vargova) she had a 'very low chance of survival' ‘I was in theatre for almost 10 hours and came out the next morning on ECMO – a type of life support. ‘It was really touch-and-go but luckily I managed to come around nine days later.' After she woke up from the operation, Ms Vargova was told by her cardiac surgeon that she would be given an LVAD. ‘Feliks and I had seen some other patients with them, and the nurses had told us about them, so we knew how incredible they were - we couldn’t believe that I might actually be given one. It was fantastic,’ she said. Mr Rahuoja said: ‘When Daniela had her cardiac arrest I was told that she probably wouldn’t make it out of theatre. ‘I had to wait in a little room whilst she was in surgery for almost ten hours. I can remember that room perfectly - it was a horrible time. ‘But luckily, she made a wonderful recovery and she’s doing so well now. It’s been amazing.’ Ms Vargova said: ‘It’s [The LVAD] given me my life back and I couldn’t be happier. ‘I want to say a big thank you to everyone in Harefield and Bath RUH Hospitals, especially my cardiologist Rob Lowe, my cardiac surgeon - or superman – Mr André Simon, and the transplant and VAD teams. Without them, I wouldn’t be here.’ 'The LVAD is fitted internally - so there is a wire that goes from the external pack into my groin and travels up to my chest.

"He has a shiny gold Olympic medal sparkling on his mantelpiece. But the self-styled Ginger Wizard admits he has sacrificed rather a lot to get it - most recently of all, his relationship with his girlfriend of eight years. Team GB's gold-winning long jumper Greg Rutherford has split up with fashion PR Liz Rose, citing his overnight fame for their sudden drift apart. Calm before the storm: Greg Rutherford says the stresses of travel and his overnight fame after winning Olympic gold this summer led to his break-up with 'beautiful' Liz Rose . The 26-year-old sportsman from Milton Keynes said the break-up was 'sad and a big change after eight years but it's for the best'.

On Friday, 11 people were killed in clashes between . police and protesters who were marking the second anniversary of the . uprising that overthrew longtime leader Hosni Mubarak. President Mohammed Morsi canceled a . scheduled trip to Ethiopia Saturday and instead met for the first time . with top generals as part of the newly formed National Defense Council. The violence in Port Said followed . the court decision when angry relatives of those sentenced tried to . storm the prison to free the defendants, shooting dead two police . officers, according to reports. Egyptian . security officials said the military had been deployed to the city, . where most of those sentenced are from, as police became embroiled in . violent clashes with protestors. Officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets at those demonstrating, who feel aggrieved that they are shouldering the blame for the riots. The violence during the match last year was the world's worst football related disaster in 15 years. Fans of Al-Ahly, whose stands were . attacked by rival club Al-Masry in the . Mediterranean city of Port Said, had promised more violence if the . accused did not receive death sentences.

Sentencing: The judge will sentence a further 52 people, charged in connection with the riots, in March . The judge said in his statement, read . live on state TV, that he would announce the verdict for the remaining . 52 defendants at a later date. While many of those on trial included alleged football hooligans, nine security officials also face charges. The death sentences will be sent to a top religious authority, the Grand Mufti, for approval, as is customary in Egypt. Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt said the violence which has been seen in the past two days 'can have no place in a truly democratic Egypt'. 'I am deeply concerned by reports of violent clashes resulting in a . number of deaths and injuries, following demonstrations to mark the . second anniversary of the 25 January revolution and the verdict in the . Port Said court case today,' he said. 'This cannot help the process of dialogue which we encourage as vital . for Egypt today, and we must condemn the violence in the strongest . terms. Desperation: Thousands of desperate supporters trying to board a train after fleeing from the stadium . 'We call on all parties to exercise maximum restraint and to ensure that . all protests remain peaceful. I offer the condolences of the UK to the . families of all the victims.' The UK remained 'committed as a strong friend of Egypt and the Egyptian . people to support the aim of strengthening true democracy', he went on. 'The right to peaceful freedom of expression and assembly is an . essential part of this, but the violence we have seen today can have no . place in a truly democratic Egypt.' Many violent soccer fans, known as Ultras, have taken a leading role in protests over the past two years. Both . Al-Ahly Ultras and Al-Masry Ultras widely believe that ex-members of . the ousted regime of Hosni Mubarak helped instigate the attack. The police are also accused of gross negligence over their handling of the incident.

Another 52 people are awaiting sentencing . It is not clear what kind of . evidence, if any, was presented to the court to back up claims that the . attack had been orchestrated by regime officials. All of the defendants - who were not . present in the courtroom today for security reasons - have the right to . appeal against the verdict. The clashes occurred during a match between Port Said's Al-Masry and Cairo's Al-Ahly, the country's most successful club, on February 1 last year. The final whistle prompted more than . 13,000 home fans, armed with knives, iron bars and machetes, to storm . the pitch and attack rival Al-Ahly players and their 1,200 supporters. Authorities shut off the stadium lights after the game, plunging it into darkness. In the exit corridor, the fleeing . crowd pressed against a chained gate until it broke open. Many were . crushed under the crowd of people trying to flee. In the days leading up to the . verdict, Al-Ahly fans warned of bloodshed and 'retribution' if death . sentences were not handed down. Hundreds of Al-Ahly fans gathered . outside the Cairo sports club in anticipation of the verdict, chanting . against the police and the government. While there has long been bad blood . between the two rival teams, many blamed police for failing to perform . usual searches for weapons at the stadium.

"Sure, Wolverine's claws were impressive, but how would one of the most famous X-Men have coped if he'd tried to survive at a height of over 14,000ft (4,270 metres)? The answer would most likely be 'not well', but while off-limits to some, it turns out that people such as Tibetans can thrive in the thin air of high-altitude areas thanks to an 8,000 year-old mutation. Researchers say they've successfully identified this genetic variation for the first time, and it could explain how some people can survive in these extreme environments. Researchers say Tibetans (pictured) have a genetic variation that enables them to survive in high altitude, low oxygen environments. This could explain how they can survive at heights of 14,800 feet (4,510m) The research from the University of Utah appears in the journal Nature Genetics and looked at areas such as the Tibetan Plateau. 'These findings help us understand the unique aspects of Tibetan adaptation to high altitudes, and to better understand human evolution,' said Dr Josef Prchal, senior author and University of Utah professor of internal medicine. In 2010 Prchal’s group was the first to establish that there was a genetic basis to Tibetan high altitude adaptation. Since then, together with Dr Felipe Lorenzo, the team have proved that the DNA of Tibetans has a slight variation that prevents their body struggling with a lack of oxygen. Instead, 88 per cent of Tibetans have the mutation that enables their bodies to thrive in low-oxygen environments, something that is virtually absent from closely related lowland Asians. It is believed the change began 8,000 years ago, when the gene EGLN1 changed by a single DNA base pair. The findings indicate the tiny genetic change endows its carriers with a selective advantage. For his research, Dr Prchal needed Tibetans to donate blood, from which he could extract their DNA, a task that turned out to be more difficult than he ever imagined. It took several trips to Asia, meeting with Chinese officials and representatives of exiled Tibetans in India, to get the necessary permissions to recruit subjects for the study. But he quickly learned that official documents would not be enough. Wary of foreigners, the Tibetans refused to participate. To earn the Tibetans’ trust, Dr Prchal obtained a letter of support from the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. 'The Dalai Lama felt that a better understanding of the adaptation would be helpful not only to the Tibetan community but also to humanity at large,' said Dr Prchal. He also enlisted the help of native Dr Tibetan Tsewang Tashi, an author and clinical fellow at the Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah. More than 90 Tibetans, both from the US and abroad, ultimately volunteered for the study. When traveling with Dr Tashi in Asia, Dr Prchal was surprised at how he got Tibetans to grasp the research they were being asked to take part in. Dr Tashi simply helped them realise that their ability to adapt to life at high altitude was unique. 'They usually responded by a little initial surprise quickly followed by agreement,' said Dr Tashi. 'It was as if I made them realise something new, which only then became obvious.' The mutation, believed to have originated 8,000 years ago, gives Tibetans a selective advantage in their environment over other humans. The finding could lead to novel solutions for diseases such as cancer. Tibet is a high-altitude plateau region north-east of the Himalayas in China (shown) For his research, Dr Prchal (shown) needed Tibetans to donate blood, from which he could extract their DNA, a task that turned out to be more difficult than he ever imagined. It took several trips to Asia, meeting with Chinese officials and representatives of exiled Tibetans in India, to get the necessary permissions . Dr Prchal collaborated with experts throughout the world, including co-senior author Dr Peppi Koivunen from Biocenter Oulu in Finland, to determine that the newly identified genetic variation protects Tibetans by decreasing an aversive over-response to low oxygen. In those without the adaptation, the thin air causes their blood to become thick with oxygen-carrying red blood cells, often causing long-term complications such as heart failure. The EGLN1 variation however, together with other unidentified genetic changes, collectively supports life at high altitudes. Dr Prchal says the research also has broader implications. Because oxygen plays a central role in human physiology and disease, a deep understanding of how high altitude adaptations work may lead to novel treatments for various conditions, including cancer. 'There is much more that needs to be done, and this is just the beginning,' he said. 88 per cent of Tibetans have the mutation that enables their bodies to thrive in low-oxygen environments, something that is virtually absent from closely related lowland Asians.

"When Felice Cohen posted a video online of how she fitted her life into an apartment the size of a walk-in closet, she was an inspiration to penny-pinched tenants across the world. But now the professional organiser has moved out of the home - where she could not sit up in bed and had to store bananas in her microwave - for an apartment more than five times its size. Ms Cohen, who is also a writer and artist, had paid just $700 a month for the 90-square foot home in one of New York City's priciest neighbourhoods. Scroll down for video . Snug: Felice Cohen, a professional organiser, lived in the 90-square ft apartment in New York for five years . The rent - particularly low cost for its Upper West Side location - meant Cohen could save enough money to move into a 500-ft apartment just around the corner. In 2010, Ms Cohen posted a video of how she worked with the pokey space, receiving millions of hits from impressed viewers. The 'microstudio', which was lined with clearly-labelled storage boxes to the ceiling, had no kitchen. Instead, she relied on a miniature fridge and would use a toaster over and hot pot to cook meals. She also owned just two plates, one fork and one spoon, to save on space. Massive upgrade: Ms Cohen has now moved into a 500-square ft apartment just two blocks away . She climbed a ladder to get into bed, . where she slept with her face just inches from the ceiling. It was so . cramped she suffered a panic attack on the first night she slept there. In her bathroom, which she claimed was . 'pretty big' for the size of the flat, she had to be careful not to bash . her knees on a cupboard as she sat sideways on the toilet. By the bathroom door, Ms Cohen stored her clothes behind a curtain, and would regularly fillet the wardrobe to make sure it did not grow beyond the boundaries of its small space. The 'living room' was little more than a chair by the window with a reading lamp. Genius: In her old apartment, Ms Cohen cleared out furniture and made sure she stored upwards . Inventive: With no kitchen in the tiny flat, Cohen bought a miniature fridge and stored fruit in the microwave . 'I looked at the space like a challenge. I knew I could make it work,' Ms Cohen, 42, told the New York Post. 'I . never felt cramped. I also never thought I’d stay five years.' Cohen said it was help from her father - . a bankruptcy lawyer - and her grandfather - who survived the Holocaust - . that taught her to live frugally. 'How much stuff do we really need? It's less than you . think,' she said. But she . needed to look for a new place after her landlord saw the video she had . made about the tiny space last summer and kicked her out - as she was . illegally subletting. Cramped: Cohen demonstrates how close she slept to the ceiling. The first night, she had a panic attack . Balance: Using the bathroom, which Cohen claimed was 'pretty big', proved to be tricky business . 'I didn’t even know it. Now my landlord said he will renovate the space and up the rent to $1,200,' said Cohen, who as a professional organiser has worked for celebrities including Naomi Campbell. Ms Cohen told MailOnline she had been living with her uncle in . the Bronx, New York when she heard about her old apartment. 'A friend told me that if Michael Jordan stretched his . hands out he could touch both the walls,' she said. Prime location: Cohen loved the area of the flat, which was just one block from Central Park. She saved so much money on rent she can now afford a 500-square ft apartment in the same neighbourhood . Privilege: Felice paid just $700 a month - but now the landlord is raising this to $1,200 a month . She spent around $1,000 on shelving, the bed and other . storage units to make it as homely and manageable as possible. Her new apartment is just two blocks away - and friends have joked about how she will cope. 'Everyone is teasing me - what I’m . going to do with all that space,' she told the Post. 'I’m going to . bounce off the walls, I guess.' See below for video .","Felice Cohen posted a video showing how she dealt with the 90-square ft flat .

"Budapest was on high alert yesterday as the River Danube threatened to burst its banks and flood the historic city. The river peaked at record highs as desperate homeowners, hotel staff and military reservists piled sandbags in front of their buildings to protect the Hungarian capital. Tens of thousands have been forced to leave their homes and at least a dozen people have been killed in floods that have hit central Europe in the past week. In front of Hungary's parliament buildings volunteers joined together to protect Budapest by making sandbags . The River Danube in the centre of Budapest is nearly 29ft higher than normal . Anxious locals watched the Danube in the centre of Budapest, at it reached its highest ever recorded level . Thousands have been put up in emergency shelters waiting for the waters to recede so they can get back to their homes. Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Poland and the Czech Republic have all been affected by the worst floods in central Europe in a decade. The Danube – Europe’s second longest river which flows through four capital cities and ten countries – started rising rapidly in Hungary last Friday. The country announced a state of ‘extreme danger’ which is likely to last into next week as the waters are expected to recede very slowly. Central Europe has seen a week of torrential rain and perilous flooding . Twenty people reportedly have died in the floods across central Europe after several days of heavy rains . The flooded water of River Danube rolling along at Margareth Island in Budapest . At least 1,200 people from 28 towns and villages have been forced to leave their homes and 44 roads have been closed, it was reported. The Danube was expected to peak at 29.4 feet in Budapest last night – worryingly near the river's flood fences which are 30.5 feet tall. The previous record high was 28 feet in the 2006 floods. In a devastating flood in 1838, the Danube killed 150 people and left more than 50,000 homeless. Men, women and children joining together to protect their city, making sandbags themselves . Military reservists were joined by locals who filled sandbags and packed them on top of walls along the river . Tens of thousands have been forced to leave their homes in central Europe but residents in Budapest are still trying to protect their city . The deluge reached Hungary on Friday but Prime Minister Viktor Orban  said 'the next two days will be decisive' Yesterday, crowds gathered along the . river to watch as water streamed past the bank and trickled through gaps . in the wall, reaching the highest point ever recorded. Staff from hotels on the bank of the Danube massed sandbags outside their buildings in a forlorn attempt to avoid the problem. Men, . women and children all helped to fill sandbags as the city attempted to . avoid devastating floods. More than six million have been used to shore . up river defences. An aerial view of the swollen Danube River in Esztergom, 43 miles west of Budapest showed what the capital had in store on Sunday .

However, authorities have said that river defences designed to withstand floods would be high enough to protect the city. The Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban said dykes had been strengthened at critical points in Budapest. Residents clear flood waters from their house in Dunabogdany, north of Budapest . Prime Minister Viktor Orban says water levels are expected to recede only very slowly next week, leaving many houses and villages cut off . No roads were left visible in the partially submerged village of Nagymaros, 37 miles west of Budapest . In Budapest the government is reportedly planning a crisis meeting with the other countries affected to see how the cost of the disaster can be shared . He warned the next two days would be ‘decisive’ in the battle against the floods. He added: ‘The (floods) are approaching the heart of the country now, we can say that the next two days will be decisive. Referring to increased pressure on the sewage network from the Danube, he said: ‘In Budapest ... it is not simply the flood which is the problem ... but the complicated public works system through which all kinds of problems can arise.’","River Danube has reached highest level in 500 years after days of rain .

"Disillusioned: Anne said she 'could not adapt' to the pace of modern life and new technology . A second British woman who grew 'tired of life' has been helped to die at a Swiss suicide clinic. The woman, who was 99 and from London, was not ill or disabled and simply chose to end her life. It comes after a retired art teacher committed suicide . at the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland after she grew weary of the pace . of modern life and how technology was changing society. The . 89-year-old felt that her failing health, as well as her belief that . people were becoming ‘robots’ attached to their gadgets, gave her little . reason to live. The woman, . who wanted to be known only as Anne, had suffered from worsening health . in recent years, but was not ill or infirm. The deaths have stoked the ongoing debate over balancing a right to die against the dangers that vulnerable people could be exploited. Retired doctor Michael Irwin has helped a number of Britons end their life at Swiss suicide clinics. He told the Sunday Express that 3,000 ­patients are helped to die every year. He said: 'Doctors do not wish to stand by and watch their patients suffer needlessly. It has always gone on.' He said that the second woman had not used Dignitas, but instead a smaller clinic. He said: 'She was not terminally ill, nor was she particularly severely disabled, yet she could not find much enjoyment in living any more and felt the time was right to say goodbye.' Mr Irwin, who founded the Society for Old Age Rational Suicide and helped with Anne’s application to Dignitas, said: ‘She was a feisty individual and a very independent person all her life. Controversial clinic: The retired art teacher committed suicide at the Dignitas clinic (pictured) in Switzerland . When she became elderly and her daily activities became increasingly restricted, she decided to go to Dignitas. ‘If you are mentally competent you can rationalise whether or not you want to end your life, after you take a look around and decide you don’t like what you see.’ He said there were at least three people in similar circumstances to Anne who ended their lives in Switzerland in recent years. There is to be a free vote in Parliament on the Assisted Dying Bill, under which two doctors could prescribe a lethal dose of drugs to a terminally ill patient with less than six months to live.","Woman was neither terminally ill nor disabled, but ended life at Swiss clinic .

"Stephen Sutton’s mother has spoken for the first time of her anger that her son’s cancer took six months to diagnose since his death. Stephen raised nearly £5million for charity before he died after a four year battle with bowel cancer and was awarded the MBE for his efforts. He touched people across the world when a bucket list containing the 40 things he hoped to do before his death went viral. Scroll down for video . The 19-year-old helped raise almost £5million for cancer research charities after his struggle with bowel cancer went viral . The teenager's mother Jane Sutton (pictured) said she was immensely proud of her son, but claims doctors could have done more. They are pictured with David Cameron and Professor Gary Middleton earlier this year . But yesterday Jane Sutton, 50, told of how doctors insisted that the 19-year-old was suffering from constipation – despite concerns raised by the family that the condition was far more serious. At the time, Stephen, aged 15, was suffering from pain, weight loss and fatigue – three of symptoms of bowel cancer. She told an event organised by the Teenage Cancer Trust that doctors ‘completely ignored’ the possibility that he may be suffering from cancer. His 'weird and wonderful' bucket list included skydiving and organising a charity gig . Hugging an animal larger than himself was one of the goals on the 19-year-old's bucket list . He crowdsurfed in a rubber dingy at a gig and organised parties in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust . His bucket list won the hearts of thousands  - including comedians John Bishop (left) and Jimmy Carr (right) Mrs Sutton told of how she had made doctors aware that there was a history of Lynch Syndrome, a genetic condition which increases the risk of bowel cancer, in the family. She said the family had even taken a booklet about the condition to doctors. Mrs Sutton told the conference yesterday: ‘Stephen wasn’t a child who went to the doctors. ‘He had gone from being a healthy, sporty young lad to having three of the signs of cancer, plus a family history, and all of that was ignored. It is not good enough, really.’ His most important goal on the bucket list was to raise £10,000, but he also visited Number 10 Downing Street . She stressed the importance of GPs listening to young patients and their parents so that early signs were not overlooked. In an interview with the Mail before his death, Stephen said: ‘On the whole, the NHS has been brilliant, but there will always be a kind of . . .Well, probably just anger.’ He added: ‘There always will be anger. If it had been caught earlier it could have led to a better prognosis. It could have changed the situation. ‘But even saying that, I’m not one to dwell on the past. It is what it is.’ Yesterday Labour MP Debbie Abrahams, chair of Labour’s Health Committee, said it was ‘not acceptable’ for young patients to be ‘fobbed off’.","Stephen Sutton, 19, raised almost £5million for the Teenage Cancer Trust .

"Privacy campaigners condemned Twitter yesterday for allowing businesses to buy access to its archive of millions of tweets. About seven million people in Britain use the social networking website to post short messages to ‘followers’. Most believe their tweets are unavailable to those outside their chosen network after a week because that is when they can no longer be searched for on the site. More than 1,000 companies have joined a waiting list to use the data, compiled from around 250 million Tweets a day . But Twitter has archived every tweet – there are about 250million a day – and has agreed a deal allowing the UK-based company Datasift to trawl through all those posted since January 2010. The company will use the information to help firms with marketing campaigns and target influential users. The licensing deal is part of Twitter’s plan to generate revenue from its service, which is free to its estimated 300million users worldwide. But the move has alarmed privacy campaigners, with the online rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation describing it as ‘creepy’. Nick Pickles, director of the Big Brother Watch campaign group, said: ‘People may consider tweets to be personal property but this deal makes clear they are not. Our personal posts on social media are yet another way for advertisements to be better targeted and that’s a very lucrative industry. ‘It’s clear that if you’re not paying for a service, you are not the customer – you’re the product.’ Datasift charges companies up to £10,000 a month to analyse tweets posted each day for anything said about their products and services. It claims to have a waiting list of up to 1,000 clients wanting to riffle through the huge Twitter archive for data that could help them target advertising and develop marketing campaigns. Private accounts and tweets that have been deleted will not be indexed by Datasift. Gus Hosein, of the watchdog group Privacy International, said: ‘People have used Twitter to communicate with friends and networks in the belief that their tweets will quickly disappear into the ether. ‘The fact that two years’ worth of tweets can now be mined for information and the resulting “insights” sold to businesses is a radical shift in the wrong direction. ‘Twitter has turned a social network that was meant to promote global conversation into a vast market-research enterprise with unwilling, unpaid participants.’ Justin Basini, of the data privacy company Allow, said: 'Marketers will stop at nothing to get hold of your data. This move shows all those throwaway tweets have suddenly become a rich new revenue stream for Twitter. 'It has taken a stream of consciousness, . analysed it, bottled it and sold it for a profit. And the worst thing . is, you never knew it was going to happen.' Datasift searches through 250 million Tweets a day. It is one of two companies so far offered access to Twitter's 'firehose' - all the information that flows through the site . Graham Cluley from security firm Sophos said, 'The news will surprise some. Twitter has found another . way to monetise its service, having partnered with a firm which will . make it simple for market researchers working for big companies to . search and analyse the last two years of your Twitter updates. 'You thought that tweets you posted months ago had vanished, or were simply hidden away so deeply and awkwardly . on the Twitter website that they would be too difficult to uncover? Think again.' But Datasift’s Tim Barker said: ‘It should come as no surprise to users that their tweets are archived – they can see every update they have ever sent on their timeline. ‘Twitter was always created to be a public social network.’ The row comes amid privacy concerns on other social networks. Facebook has been criticised after admitting it can read the text messages of those who use the service on their mobile phones. And the web giant Google has also come under fire for collecting data about internet users. Datasift is one of two companies granted access to Twitter's 'firehose' - the full amount of data streaming through the site. 'DataSift goes beyond what many social media monitoring companies do,' says founder Nick Halstead. 'Instead . of just searching on keywords such as 'Nike', DataSift can search on . all the people, products, and links associated with the company, then . slice and dice the data for different departments such as marketing, . product and the like.'","Firm called Datasift has bought access to two years' worth of Tweets .

"Islamic militants in Iraq have taken over an ancient city which featured in The Exorcist film, it has emerged. The Hatra complex, a Unesco world heritage site which features 200ft-high temples, now stands in territory claimed by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isis) group. There are fears the stone statues within the area could be destroyed by jihadists, who have already demolished a statue of Iraqi musician and composer Othman al-Mousuli 70 miles away in Mosul. Scroll down for video . Concerns: The elegant ancient city of Hatra in Iraq, dating to the third century BC, which is under threat .

It withstood invasions by the Romans in 116 and 198 AD . Millennia old: The statue of a robed woman, believed to be the spouse of a king, stares down at visitors in Hatra . Some 20 Iraqi police officers who had been guarding the ancient area in Hatra - which features at the start of the 1973 horror film - had left after it fell to Isis militants two weeks ago. Hatra councillor Mohammed Abdallah Khozal told The Daily Telegraph: ‘The guards all ran and left their weapons behind when they heard that the tribes and Isis were coming. ‘Currently there is no one protecting the temple at all, and it is in control of the rebels. I am concerned about its safety, although I am also worried about government forces doing bombing.’ Last week, Unesco Director-General .

"Aiden Elmore has been jailed for 21 years after setting light to a block of flats, killing a 68-year-old man . A jilted boyfriend who killed a pensioner when he burned down a block of flats because he was upset about being dumped has been jailed for life. Aiden Elmore, 21, went on an arson spree just hours after his girlfriend Lauren Wellings, 17, broke up with him by text. He went on the rampage in Willenhall, near Walsall setting fire to gardens before pushing a blazing wheelie bin against a block of flats barricading the exit. Pensioner Victor Moore, 68, became trapped in the communal hallway of the building as the devastating blaze took grip - reaching temperatures of up to 1,000 degrees. The external doors were fused shut due to the heat and Mr Moore tragically died after being overcome by the heavy fumes on October 8 last year. Other locals were forced to jump from the flats to save their lives while one resident described the heat as though they were 'on top of a bonfire'. After igniting the blaze drunken Elmore - who had been drowning his sorrows over the split all day - set two more fires including one outside his ex-partner’s mother’s house. Elmore pushed wheelie bins up against patio windows before lighting them - but passing police officers spotted eight-foot-high flames before the fire could spread through the house. Police officers flooded the area on the lookout for the arsonist and at 4.10am a 'shaking and nervous' Elmore was arrested wandering along a nearby street. He claimed to officers he had burned his own tracksuit top bought by his ex as a Father’s Day gift and the flames had spread. But when confronted with CCTV evidence showing him igniting the bins he admitted being reckless but denied intending to harm anyone. Elmore went on a rampage in Short Heath near Walsall after a drinks and drugs binge. He set fire to the gardens before pushing a burning wheelie bin against the building, barricading the exit . Wolverhampton Crown Court heard Elmore, 21, went on the arson spree just hours after his then girlfriend Lauren Wellings, 17, dumped him via text message . After a four-week trial Wolverhampton Crown Court Elmore was found guilty of murder and two counts of arson with intent to endanger life by a jury. Judge John Warner told him he must serve at least 21 years behind bars before he is considered for release, adding that it was a matter of chance that more victims were caught in the blaze. He also handed the killer separate eight and 11-year sentences for each arson offence, to run concurrently. Passing sentence Judge Warner said Elmore had created . a scene of 'fear and panic' in which people could be heard screaming . and were forced to escape through windows. He told Elmore: 'Quite what your motive was for what you did remains a mystery to me. 'Only you know what your thinking was and you have not yet chosen to say. 'It was purely a matter of chance that Mr Moore was the only person to lose his life in that horrific fire.' Elmore, who was on . bail at the time of the murder in October 2012, smirked at members of . the public from the dock before the start of the sentencing hearing. Judge Warner commended the bravery of two gas engineers, a police officer and a member of the public who attended the scene. 'They went there in the course of their employment or they went there in a public-spirited effort to assist,' the judge said. 'On behalf of the community they deserve commendation for their actions that night.' In . a victim impact statement read to the court, an unnamed relative of Mr . Moore said: 'There are no words that will describe how my family feel . and he did not deserve to die in the way that he died.' Pensioner Victor Moore died as temperatures reached 1,000 degrees, after he became trapped in the communal hallway. Elmore had barricaded the exit with a burning bin . Detective Sergeant Mick Ross, from . West Midlands Police, said: 'Elmore had been drinking, taking drugs and . was emotional after separating from his partner. 'But his actions were a clear attempt to cause serious harm - and he will now spend the next 21 years behind bars. 'Elmore . positioned bins against doors, barring residents’ likely exit route and . forcing people to jump for their lives from windows. 'He . did the same again in Wychbold Close where only the brave actions of . police officers stopped the blaze spreading into the property; there . were young children at the address and the officers’ actions may well . have saved more lives. 'Elmore . made a determined effort to light the bins: CCTV showed him trying to . light the rubbish for around 20 minutes before it finally took hold. 'It’s . understood vengeance over the split led him to target the home in . Wychbold Close, but it’s still unclear why he sparked the fire that cost . Mr Moore his life.' Residents were forced to jump from their flats as one described the heat and situation as 'like being on top of a bonfire'. One woman was taken to hospital with a broken ankle after her leap to safety . During his trial the court heard how father-of-one Elmore had been dumped by his girlfriend Lauren by text three hours before his arson spree. Giving evidence she told the court: 'We were speaking quite a bit on the night. 'We were talking about getting back together. 'But at about 10.30pm I messaged him saying we were over for good.' Elmore, from Wolverhampton, then spent the night of October 8 drinking all night at a local pub. During the blaze, one woman was taken to hospital with a broken ankle having jumped from a window. Around 50 people were evacuated over fears of an explosion as several blazing bins had been placed near a gas main behind the maisonettes.","21-year-old Aiden Elmore went on the rampage three hours after girlfriend Lauren Wellings split up with him via text message .

"Sarah Smith, 43, said she lived in fear of her pupils or their parents noticing her spelling and grammar mistakes . My hands were feeling clammy and beads of sweat broke out under my collar as I shifted nervously in my seat. It was parents’ evening. As a teacher with six years’ experience, you might imagine that I would have been in my element as I chatted about the eight-year-olds in my charge and offered their parents encouragement and advice. Instead I was consumed with embarrassment. And no wonder. The father opposite me — a lawyer — was looking at me as if I was dirt under his shoe. I had been telling him about the new drive to improve literacy standards in our school when he had interrupted me. ‘Can you repeat what you just said?’ he said. ‘I’m not sure I could possibly have heard you correctly.’ I had no idea why he was getting so agitated. To humour him, I repeated slowly: ‘I said that me and the headmistress are doing all we can to improve standards.’ I might as well have told him that we were planning to bring back the birch. Throwing his hands up in the air, he launched into a tirade that left me red hot with shame. ‘Me and the headmistress?’ he ranted. ‘Don’t you know it should be: “The headmistress and I”? How can you call yourself a teacher when your grammar is so poor?’ I wanted the ground to swallow me up. Many years later, I still feel there was no excuse for his rudeness, but I can understand why he was so angry. I’d feel the same if a child of mine was being taught by a teacher like me. And the shocking truth is that there are thousands of teachers in schools the length and breadth of the country who are just like me. We have degrees in English from respectable universities, yet wouldn’t know a subjective pronoun from an objective one if it hit us in the face. I joined the profession in 2005 and quit last year, eventually worn down and depressed at seeing a generation of schoolchildren let down by an education system that not only allows woefully ill-prepared teachers like me into the job, but doesn’t pick up on our failings. For the truth is that I had no idea I had said anything untoward that day. And most of my colleagues — experienced, highly qualified teachers in their 30s and 40s — wouldn’t have known either. The products of a liberal education system that eschewed the ‘rules’ of the English language for trendy educational methods, we were as bemused as the children we taught. So how on earth are teachers going to deliver the Government’s demanding new school curriculum with its emphasis on grammar? Alice Phillips, the president of the Girls’ Schools Association, caused uproar last week by admitting that when it comes to grammar, even university-educated English teachers like me are at sea. Mrs Phillips said that when she’d introduced a grammar course for 11-year-olds at her fee-paying school — St Catherine’s, Bramley, near Guildford, Surrey — she’d been shocked to discover that some of her staff were ill equipped to teach it. ‘Many of our brightest, most enthusiastic teachers have little or no grounding in English grammar,’ she said. ‘They are completely at sea with many aspects of proper usage.’ The problem is so bad that two years ago, the head of my inner city primary school in South Yorkshire had to employ a literacy expert — to teach the teachers. Our grasp of grammar and spelling was so poor that we couldn’t even be trusted to teach children aged four to eight. I always found it particularly stressful towards the end of term when I knew that I’d be put on the spot when writing school reports. It used to cause me endless sleepless nights — not because of my assessments of the pupils, but my poor spelling. Ms Smith said she was not taught the basic rules of grammar at any point during her education and blames that on Harold Wilson's government axing the 11-plus . I used to write achieve as ‘acheive’. ‘I before e’ was never my strong suit. Thank heavens the head was there to correct such errors before the reports were sent off to the parents. She was the one we relied on to make sure our spelling mistakes were never discovered. If only the parents had seen our internal memos and emails — ‘your’ instead of ‘you’re’, missing apostrophes from ‘its’, wrongly added apostrophes in words such as ‘pie’s’. The clangers were horrific. And then there was the time I prepared a lesson on nutrition and vegetables. Thankfully, a colleague, not one of my pupils, changed ‘brocolli’ to broccoli. I used to live in fear of the children pulling me up on my spelling. One morning I asked my class for their ideas on a subject, which I would then write on the board. One boy called out the word ‘simultaneously’. I struggled to spell it twice and in the end had to give up and write ‘at the same time’. My apparatus cupboard had even been labelled ‘aparratus’ until one of the smarter children in the class piped up: ‘Miss, are you sure that’s spelt right?’ Mrs Phillips blames the problem with teachers’ grammar on the shocking education standards of the past. She’s right. And I’m afraid the knock-on effect will be felt for generations to come. The stark truth is that most people educated in a state school in the Seventies and Eighties had little or no grounding in grammar. And many of us have become teachers. Scarred ourselves, we have passed the damage on. I’m convinced the rot started in 1964 when Harold Wilson’s Labour government came to power and abolished the 11-plus in many areas. Parents were told this was to enable primary schools to develop a more informal, child-centred, progressive style of teaching, with the emphasis on learning by discovery. As a teacher, I can see this is rubbish. The belief that grammar could be ignored was virtually all pervasive until 1988, when the Conservative government introduced the National Curriculum. I’m 43 and from the day I started junior school in Solihull in 1979, I experienced a grammar-free education until I left comprehensive school in 1987. For me and many of my peers, there is a vast chasm in our knowledge and basic abilities. While previous generations had grammar drilled into them and were taught by rote, we were encouraged to get ‘a feel’ for sentences. This left me with a terrible grounding in the three Rs. Basic grammatical rules elude me. When do you use ‘which’ or ‘that’? Is the bag ‘hers’ or ‘her’s’? Until recently, I didn’t even know there were different types of nouns. I wasn’t taught any of this at secondary school. I even managed to get a degree in English literature from Sussex University — the alma mater of novelist Ian McEwan — without anyone pulling me up on my diabolical use of the language. And I sailed through my teacher training as a mature student before landing my first job in a state primary school in South Yorkshire. I had been in the job only a few weeks when I learned, with a sickening sense of dread, that part of my literacy duties was to instruct my nine-year-old pupils on the use of ‘modal verbs’. I had never heard of them and rushed home that night to research them on Google. Only then did I discover they are words such as ‘can’ and ‘could’, ‘shall’ and ‘should’, which are used to describe if something is certain, probable or possible . As I furtively mugged up on them overnight, I felt ashamed. I was also terrified that I would be caught out. After all I was only one small step ahead of my pupils, and with a horrible, haunting feeling of being a fraud. Most of the parents — products of the same dire education system as me — were as much in the dark about grammar as me. But I will never forget the embarrassment of being publicly humiliated at that parents’ evening. As other parents craned their necks to hear what was going on, I felt intense shame. And I knew I deserved it. At least I realised my shortcomings and was conscientious enough to do my own homework to fill in the gaps. I always planned my lessons. If that meant I had to teach myself first, I did so. But some teachers feel there was no need to understand all those ‘tricky bits’. There’s also the issue of teaching assistants, many of whom are excellent and work tirelessly for poor pay. But I’ve seen comments such as ‘thats grate’ or ‘your a star’ on children’s homework. They would congratulate children who had done well by saying ‘it were easy for you’. I would interject: ‘We say “I should have” rather than “should of.” ’ But there are only so many times you can correct people without looking like a bully. In my experience, one in five children left primary school without the basics. Luckily, some children have parents, such as that bad-tempered lawyer father, who can help them. But, sadly, many don’t and those are the ones who are truly failed by teachers. Thankfully, I had the good grace to quit teaching and take a job in the media. I now experience parents’ evenings on the other side of the desk, as a mother to a nine-year-old and five-year-old. So far, I haven’t encountered any terrible grammatical clangers to match my humiliation, but yes, mistakes are still being made. My experience has taught me to be ever vigilant and never to assume the teacher knows best. Because, as I know all too well, they often don’t.","Ex-teacher Sarah Smith obtained an English degree from Sussex University .

"It is a controversial topic and one that may make for uncomfortable viewing. BBC drama Call The Midwife is to tell the story of a pair of disabled lovers forced apart and ridiculed after the woman becomes pregnant. Disability charities yesterday welcomed the plotline, saying it highlights how far society has come since the judgmental 1950s in which the programme is set. The episode will feature Sally Harper who is pregnant and has Down¿s Syndrome and Jacob Milligan who has cerebral palsy . The episode, which is to be aired on . Sunday night, will feature the characters of Sally Harper, who has . Down’s syndrome, and Jacob Milligan, who has cerebral palsy. The pair live in an institution, having been sent there by their parents – as was common at  the time. But . after they fall in love and Sally becomes pregnant, the  couple are . separated and Sally faces ridicule from her mother and father. The episode deals with the prejudice and stigma she would have experienced. Call . The Midwife is shown on BBC One before the nine o’clock watershed, and . in the past storylines featuring abortion, incest and infidelity have . shocked viewers. But yesterday campaigners welcomed the inclusion of . disability and love as a theme. The . character of Sally is played by Sarah Gordy, and Jacob by Colin Young. Both actors have the disability that they portray on screen. Forced apart: Mrs Harper played by Debra Gillett and Sally Harper played Sarah Gordy in the episode of Call the Midwife . Mr . Young has called for more TV programmes to deal with the issue, saying: . ‘You don’t see much in the media about people with disabilities and . relationships. Having a relationship with cerebral palsy isn’t easy. I’d . like to find a partner and have a family of my own one day. ‘My . relationships have mostly been with other disabled people because I’ve . found there’s often a kind of mutual understanding of life,’ he added. ‘Heidi . told me she wanted to write this episode for a long time,’ he said of . writer Heidi Thomas, whose brother David had Down’s syndrome and died at . the age of 15. ‘She wanted to express the difficulty of disabled people . wanting to find love. I would say attitudes are similar towards sex . now.’ Call The Midwife is not the first drama to try to tackle the theme of relationships and disability. Cynthia Miller played by Bryony Hannah, Sally Harper played by Sarah Gordy and Chummy played by Miranda Hart . In . 2012 The Sessions, a film starring John Hawkes and Helen Hunt, told the . story of a sex surrogate hired by a man who had been left paralysed by . polio. And the issue of . disabled  people being assisted to have  sex divided opinion in 2010 – . when it emerged that a government scheme was going to pay for a man with . learning disabilities to visit a prostitute in Amsterdam. Last . night a spokesman for disabilities charity Scope said: ‘It’s great to . see two disabled actors taking centre stage in a well-loved drama like . Call The  Midwife. The storyline also highlights just how far we have . come since the 1950s. ‘However, . many disabled people continue to experience prejudice today, and face . scrutiny over personal decisions that they make, like sexual . relationships or starting a family. ‘Hopefully . as we see more disabled actors and storylines on TV and in the media, . people will become more comfortable and accepting of disability.’","Disabilities charities have welcomed the plotline .

"Warning: Khalil Jamil blamed his behaviour on his restrictive background . A pharmacist who made crude remarks to three of his female colleagues has escaped with a warning after a panel heard he came from a 'restrictive Muslim background' and was unaware of the offence his conduct had caused. Khalil Jamil asked one of the women about her favourite love-making position and quizzed another about the mating habits of her horses - but a professional panel ruled his behaviour was not sexually motivated. The General Pharmaceutical Council panel found Jamil acted inappropriately by making the comments and standing too close to his assistants. However, they accepted that his background in a strict Muslim community meant he was unfamiliar to working in such an open environment with women and his basic social skills meant he lacked understanding of appropriate conduct. As the remarks were not sexually motivated the panel cleared Jamil of misconduct and gave him an official warning. It also took into consideration the fact that Jamil had remedied his actions by attending a 'dignity at work' course. Panel chairman Patrick Malmo QC said: ‘He felt the source of this behaviour in 2009, was that he comes from a very restrictive background, with little social life, and none at all outside of his own community. ‘He lacked social skills, and had little knowledge of how one should be when working with colleagues. ‘He was unable to distinguish between friendliness and over familiarity.’ Mr Malmo added: ‘We do not think there is a serious risk of this kind of conduct being repeated. ‘Although we do not find the registrant impaired, we have the ability to issue a warning, and given the circumstances of this case, we believe it is necessary to do so.’ In a statement read to the hearing one of Jamil’s colleagues, referred to as CH, said she was working with Jamil at the Cooperative Pharmacy in Fauldhouse, West Lothian, in July 2009, when he asked: ‘Do you have a boyfriend? Do you want a boyfriend?’ She said: ‘Whenever it went quiet he came back to me and stood close again. He asked me if I was into sports, I said “No”. ‘He said he was into boxing and said feel my stomach. He grabbed my wrist and tried to get me to touch his stomach.' Jamil had told the hearing that he had no desire to be in a relationship with the woman saying: ‘I suppose I was showing off, at the time, that I train, I work hard.' He made similar remarks to another assistant, referred to only as SS, while he was working as a locum at a Morrisons pharmacy in St Andrews, Fife, in November 2009. The pharmacist approached her while she was at the computer at and asked her if she had a boyfriend and how she liked to have sex with him. A similar incident occurred the following week in which he put his arms around her waist. One of the incidents happened while Jamil was working at the Cooperative Pharmacy in Fauldhouse, West Lothian (pictured) A third woman, known as SR, was working at the same pharmacy when Jamil stood close to her that as she bent down to pick up some prescriptions, she could not help but back into him. She added that he had asked if getting her horses’ castrated had affected the animals’ sex drives and whether it would have the same effect on a man. He had admitted that all the incidents took place but denied any possible sexual motivation. Speaking afterwards Graham Edwards, said on behalf of Mr Jamil: ‘I think the panel’s decision was overall correct. ‘Although Mr Jamil had not acted with sexual motivation, and although he had crossed professional boundaries, it is clear that through his insight and his remedial actions and courses followed, the correct decision has been made to assess that he is not impaired. ‘However it must be said that with Mr Jamil’s failure to observe professional boundaries, which brought him to this hearing, it is correct that the panel warned him about his future behaviour. ‘The duration of the inquiry into these matters, being three years, has caused Mr Jamil and his family to be emotionally damaging, at a great deal financial of cost.’","Professional panel accepted Khalil Jamil's conduct was not sexually-motivated .

"White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough has come out to deny allegations the administration threatened the families of journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley not to pay ransoms to the Islamic State. Foley and Sotloff were each executed last month by beheading, in graphic videos released by ISIS. Before their deaths, the terrorist group reportedly approached their American families and offered to release the journalists for a ransom. McDonough appeared on several Sunday morning talk shows to discuss ISIS, and took to the chance to respond to the families claims they threatened prosecution. 'We didn’t threaten anybody, but we made clear what the law is,' McDonough said on Fox News Sunday. 'That’s our responsibility to make sure we explain the law and uphold the law.' Scroll down for video . Journalists James Foley (left) and Steevn Sotloff (right) were executed last month by ISIS in graphic televised videos. The White House has denied claims that it threatened the jounalists' families if they paid a ransom . Under U.S. law, it is illegal to pay ransoms to such organizations since it is thought to financially support terrorism and encourage more kidnappings. However, this was hard news to hear for the families of Sotloff and Foley who were left helpless. Barak Barfi, a spokesman for the Sotloff family, says they had a meeting with a State Department official in May and the 'material support' law was brought up several times. 'The family felt completely and utterly helpless when they heard this,' Barfi told RT. The mother of James Foley says she experienced the same thing when the family was approached by ISIS with a ransom. Diane Foley told CNN that 'as an American', she was 'embarrassed and appalled' at efforts to rescue her son from captivity.

Elliot Rodger, 22, carried out a deadly murder spree on May 23, killing six and injuring 13 near the Isla Vista, University of California campus. In the wake of the massacre, the film . director and his ex-wife released a statement saying it was 'hell on . earth' learning their son was the perpetrator, but neither had given a . formal interview. Mr Rodger said this week: 'It's a reverse nightmare situation when I go to sleep. I might have a nice dream but now I wake up and slowly . the truth of what happened dawns on me. My son was a mass murderer.' Walters asked if the father had any clue that his son was suicidal or even homicidal. Mr Rodger replied: 'There is no way I thought that this boy could hurt a flea. The most unbelievable thing, what I don't get, is that we didn't see this coming at all.' The special episode of 20/20 will air on June 27 at 10pm.

The interview will air in a special episode of 20/20 on Friday at 10pm . While she won't have a regular show anymore, Walters will continue contributing to ABC for special projects like the interview with Mr Rodger. The ABC interview comes just a month after the shooter's father met with the father of one of his son's victims. Dramatic photos show Peter Rodger and Richard Martinez embracing in an emotional moment just two weeks after the spree left Mr Martinez's son Chrisopher, 20, dead. The parents of two young men shot dead by Elliot Rodger spoke out today about losing their sons in a tragedy which they feel could have been prevented. David Wang, 20, and George Chen, 19, were stabbed to death by their roommate Rodger, 22, at their beach-side apartment near the UC Santa Barbara Campus on May 23. Rodger also killed James Hong, Christopher Martinez, Katherine Breann Cooper andVeronika Elizabeth Weiss before taking his own life. George's mother Kelly Chen broke down as she told CBS: 'We have love in our heart, tears in our eyes, responsibility on our shoulders, and we hear the voice from our children from heaven. We want to do something.' The devastated parents of David Wang, Charlie and Jane Wang (right) and George Chen, Johnny and Kelly Chen (left) spoke for the first time about their sons who were the joy of their lives.

Kelly Chen and her husband Johnny along with Charlie and Jane Wang believe that there were 'missed opportunities' that could have prevented Rodger's killing spree. They also expressed their outrage at the media attention focused on the killer and an interview with the victim's father Peter Rodger. They said that Mr Rodger had not reached out to them to offer his condolences. Following the interview, Mr Rodger sent the families a letter of apology. The two families, who both immigrated to the U.S. from China to give their sons' better opportunities, had said they did not want to speak out following their sons' deaths. However they feel strongly that they must do all they can so no other family would have to endure their pain. Just a month on from their sons' deaths, the parents said they struggle to cope with the idea that their boys are never coming home. Charlie Wang, David's father, said: 'I still think my son is alive and not gone. I still don't understand why this happened to such beautiful heart, beautiful lives.'

'We plan to work together so other families such as ours will not suffer as ours have,' Mr Martinez said at the time. Elliot . Rodger's parents issued a statement the morning after the killings that . they were 'staunchly against guns' and support gun-control laws. 'We . are crying out in pain for the victims and their families. It breaks . our hearts on a level that we didn't think was possible,' Peter and Chin . Rodger said in the statement.

"A former Minnesota Vikings star player has died from ALS at the age of 42. Orlando Thomas, who was a defensive back for the team in the late 1990s, died on Sunday in his home town of Crowley, Louisiana. Mr Thomas played for the Vikings for seven seasons and retired from the league in 2001 when he was 29 years old. Orlando Thomas, who was a defensive back for the team in the late 1990s, died on Sunday in his home town of Crowley, Louisiana . The former player weighed just 70lb when he died after battling the disease for seven years - less than a third of his 225lb weight at the height of his career. In a statement, his agent Mark Bertelstein told ESPN: 'This was a devastating way for it to happen. But it was inevitable. 'To watch what he went through since he came down with this disease never showing an ounce of self-pity. He never wanted to talk about his plight.' Thomas revealed in June 2007 that he was suffering from the neurodegenerative disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) which is also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. The player came to rely on his wife Demetra and two children, after losing his ability to speak, blinked letters to communicate. Thomas was drafted into the NFL from the University of Southwestern Louisiana in 1995. The funeral is yet to be arranged. In a statement today, the Minnesota Vikings said: 'The Vikings are deeply saddened by the loss of Orlando Thomas. Orlando was an outstanding player for the Vikings for seven years, but more importantly, he represented the franchise and the state of Minnesota with the utmost dignity and class. While his outgoing personality made him a favorite among his teammates, Orlando’s involvement in the community made him a favorite outside of Winter Park. Mr Thomas played for the Vikings for seven seasons and retired from the league in 2001 when he was 29 years old . On a Twitter account attributed to Orlando Thomas, the last post in May 2013, was this picture with the message: 'Chillin' with my nephew' 'Since 2007, Orlando fought this disease with tenacity and optimism. Throughout his difficult battle, he refused to allow ALS to define him, instead putting others’ needs in front of his and focusing on making those around him smile. 'Orlando will always remain a member of the Minnesota Vikings family. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife Demetra and their family.' ALS causes sufferers to get progressively weaker due to muscle wasting and causes trouble in speaking, swallowing and breathing. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death. In the U.S. up to 30,000 Americans are currently affected by LAS with more than 5,600 new cases diagnosed each year. About one in four NFL players are likely to end up suffering dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease or other cognitive impairments during their lifetime, according to a report filed in court by the league's lawyers. The NFL submitted the summary of the findings of an actuarial study it had commissioned in the U.S. District Court for Eastern Pennsylvania in September as part of the ongoing litigation between former players and the league. The study by the Segal Group, based in New York City, used a database of the medical history of retired players as part of its method. The chances of players developing these problems 'are materially higher than those expected in the general population,' the lawyers' summary of the report said. Players will develop these diagnoses 'at notably younger ages than the general population,' the summary said. In 2013, the NFL agreed to pay more than $760 million to settle a lawsuit brought by more than 4,500 former players who had sued the league, accusing it of hiding the dangers of brain injury while profiting from the sport's violence.  It is unclear if Mr Thomas was one of those seeking compensation.","Orlando Thomas, who was a defensive back for the team in the late 1990s, died on Sunday in his home town of Crowley, Louisiana .

"A sex party dubbed ‘dirty Downton’ which was due to be held at a prestigious British manor house has been cancelled, after the historic property was taken over by new owners. Bovey Castle, a 64-bedroom retreat in Devon, was to host five nights of naked pool parties and sex shows next summer. Adult travel company shoesonly.com had hired the Grade II-listed manor house for its event, which had been billed as ‘Downton Abbey, only sexier’. Bovey Castle, a 64-bedroom retreat in Devon, was to host five nights of naked pool parties and sex shows next summer . But a hotel chain has since taken over the 100-year-old property and they say the raunchy antics conflict with their ‘core values’. US company Shoes Only chose the period drama-style setting because it is ‘steeped in romantic literature, a place of striking beauty and romance’. But a spokesperson for Eden Hotel Collection said: ‘The booking was made as we were acquiring the hotel earlier this summer and at the time we were unaware of the precise details of the proposed event. ‘Having investigated further, we have taken the decision that the event in no way fits with the core values of our businesses and have taken immediate steps to cancel the booking.

The castle has hosted regular guests since 1930, when it was turned into a hotel by the Great Western Railway, before being sold to the British Transport Commission in 1948. In the 1990s entrepreneur Peter de Savary refurbished the 64-bed retreat. It was in September this year when it was revealed that Shoes Only had booked out the castle for summer 2015, shortly after hosting a similar event in July this year. Around 100 couples had paid up to £4,800 to enjoy seedy romps inside the Jacobean-style manor and its 275-acre grounds.

"A dozen men were seized and stripped naked before they were forced to undergo circumcisions in western Kenya as part of a 'ceremony', it has been reported. The 12 men, from the Luo, Turkana, Iteso and Luhyia communities, were reportedly subjected to the procedure after their wives revealed they had not had it done previously. A number of women in the town of Moi's Bridge, in western Kenya, where the incident took place, said they were pleased the men went through the procedure because it made them cleaner and perform better in bed. Scroll down for video . A dozen men have been forced to undergo circumcisions in western Kenya. File picture shows a male Masai as he is circumcised by a nurse during an initiation ceremony in the village of Eremit in 2012 . According to Kenyan radio station West FM, the men who underwent the procedure had either previously avoided having it done or had come from a Luhyia sub-tribe which did not carry it out. A crowd reportedly sung circumcision songs as they gathered the men up before taking them to a nearby medical centre where the operations were carried out. One of the wives, Anne Njeri, who witnessed the incident on Friday, told the radio station: 'We are happy with the move to have such men cut because uncircumcised men are dirty and do not perform well in bed and thus we are sure their wives will now enjoy their marriages.' Each of the men have been provided with money by others in the town for treatment, according to the report. The men who carried out the procedure have said all the men who have not been circumcised will undergo the procedure in what has been dubbed 'circumcision season', according to theKenyan Daily Post . The season is said to last for the first three weeks of August, the International Business Times has reported. A number of women in the town of Moi's Bridge, in western Kenya, where the incident took place, said they were pleased the men went through the procedure because it made them cleaner and perform better in bed . About 50 men have now reportedly asked police for help to protect them from the forced procedure. In January this year it was reported that three teenage boys were hospitalised following a circumcision ceremony in the Northern Territory of Australia. The boys were evacuated to Darwin from a remote community near Borroloola, 700km away in the Gulf of Carpentaria, after suffering severe cuts during the ceremony. The incident sparked anger and debate in the community over safety procedures surrounding indigenous initiation ceremonies.","Men forced to undergo procedure after wives reveal they had not had it done before .

"A mother of three, who taunted authorities to catch her as she stole about $20 million from the IRS, has been jailed for 21 years. Rashia Wilson, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft earlier this year, admitted to stealing more than $3 million but the figure is believed to be much higher. Tampa police were first alerted to the fraud in 2010 when they noticed a drop in drug dealing in the area. Taunt: Rashia Wilson, who boasted on Facebook that she was untouchable, has been jailed for 21 years . As Wilson, who became known as the 'First Lady of tax fraud' was sentenced on Tuesday, she was denied the chance to hug her three children, aged between 2 and 12, good-bye, according to the Tampa Bay Times. 'She knew what she was doing was wrong. She reveled in the fact that it was wrong,' U.S. District Judge James. S. Moody Jr. said. The 27-year-old, who also pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, had boasted on Facebook that she was untouchable. 'I'm Rashia, the queen of IRS tax fraud,' the post stated. 'I'm . a millionaire for the record, so if U think indicting me will B easy it . won't, I promise you! U need more than black and white to hold me down N . that's to da rat who went N told, as if 1st lady don't have da TPD . under her spell. I run Tampa right now.' A psychologist brought in to testify for the defense argued the Facebook post was a sign of Wilson's bi-polar disorder, which made her liable to brag. Lavish: Wilson, who lived in a large house, spent the money on designer handbags, big screen TVs and cars . Pay back: Wilson's $90,000 Audi A8 is towed from her Florida home . Valerie McClain told the court that 'adolescent bragging' in Facebook posts is consistent with manic-phase behavior. Wilson had bi-polar diagnosed when she was 14. Wilson's fraud was discovered during a two-year investigation called 'Operation Rain Maker', named in reference to all the money raining down on the suspects' mail boxes, according to ABC News. The multi-agency investigation included Tampa Police Department, IRS-Criminal Investigations, the Secret Service, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the Hills­borough County Sheriff's Office. Those involved in the tax fraud operation used stolen Social Security numbers to file returns, according to the Global Dispatch. The scam meant that ordinary taxpayers had to wait for up to a year to receive their refunds. Sentenced: Rashia Wilson, who has been jailed for 21 years, has been in trouble with the police before . Previous convictions: The 27-year-old has been booked on several occasions by Florida police since 2004 . Arrest record: Wilson has been arrested previously for grand theft auto, robbery, battery and affray . Wilson, whose mother was addicted to . cocaine when she was born, and whose father was in prison while she was . growing up, came from a life of poverty to extreme wealth. $90,000 on an Audi A8. $30,000 on her son's first birthday party, which included carnival rides for children to play on. Designer handbags from Prada, Gucci and Louis Vuitton. Jewellery, including a custom-made necklace spelling out her name in jewels, which she wore in a photograph that showed her posing with stacks of money. When police searched her Wimauma home they removed electronic goods, including large flat-screen TVs. Although she still claimed food stamps during her fraud, she used the ill-gotten gains to fund a lavish lifestyle which included spending $30,000 on her son's first birthday, buying a $90,000 Audi and designer handbags and sunglasses. Wilson also had a custom-designed necklace, spelling out her name in jewels, made for her, according to Fox News. As well as finding designer goods at her home in Wimauma, police said the number of security cameras around the property had raised suspicions. Wilson has been ordered to $3.1 million in restitution. The amount reflects the estimated loss to the government at the time of her plea. The investigation later found the figure to be higher but the judge agreed to honor the plea agreement. She will owe the restitution with co-defendant Maurice Larry, who has sentencing hearings due in August and September. Scam: The investigation was named Operation Rain Maker because of the money raining down on suspects' mail boxes . At the time of the investigation, 13 people were arrested for charges including identity theft, scheming to defraud and fraudulent use of credit cards. Tampa police major Ken Morman told ABC last year that a decline in drug dealing suggested criminals had found a more lucrative business. He said the suspects would use hotel rooms and rented houses to train recruits about how to commit the fraud.","Mother of three boasted she was 'Queen of IRS fraud' on Facebook .

"The IRS 'lost' the emails of six other agency officials associated with a scheme to target conservative organizations – in addition to those of former official Lois Lerner – and kept it a secret for months, the House Ways and Means committee learned on Tuesday. The news prompted the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to issue broad subpoenas on Tuesday afternoon for hard drives, thumb drives and other backups that Lerner and the tax authorities may have used to archive her messages. Ways and Means chairman Dave Camp and Rep. Charles Boustany, who chairs the Ways and Means oversight subcommittee, said that the IRS has known as far back as February that it no longer had email correspondence for Lerner and other key players implicated in the tea party targeting scandal and failed to share that information with Congress. 'It looks like the American people were lied to and the IRS tried to cover-up the fact it conveniently lost key documents in this investigation,' the duo said in a press release. 'Plot lines in Hollywood are more believable than what we are getting from this White House and the IRS.' Scroll down for video . House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, pictured here at the end of May, and his committee discovered today that the IRS 'lost' the emails of six other IRS officials in addition to Lois Lerner . The Exempt Organizations Division of the IRS is at the center of a scandal involving years of intrusive screening of . conservative groups that sought tax-exempt status beginning in 2009. Hundreds of them saw their applications delayed or denied while . politically liberal organizations skated by and quickly received . approval. The . IRS informed the committee on Friday that 28 months of emails of the former head of the tax-exempt division, Lois Lerner, had been lost in a computer crash and could not be recovered because many records were not backed . up on servers, tapes or external drives. Its own guidelines require that . 'IRS offices will not store the official recordkeeping copy of e-mail . messages that are federal records ONLY on the electronic mail system.' It also requires its offices to back up email messages to 'a separate electronic recordkeeping system.' The Daily Caller reported on Tuesday that IRS regulations require employees to print out copies of all communications that are subject to federal recordkeeping laws. 'The Treasury Department’s current email policy requires emails and attachments that meet the definition of a federal record be added to the organization’s files,' the agency's employee guidance reads, 'by printing them (including the essential transmission data) and filing them with related paper records.' According to the IRS, none of this happened and Lerner's emails from January 2009 to April 2010 are missing. Now the IRS says its also missing emails for Nikole Flax, who served as Chief of Staff to Steve Miller, then- Deputy Commissioner of the IRS. Flax visited the White House more than a dozen times between July 2010 and April 2013, according to a Politico. The Ways and Means committee leaders said Tuesday that Flax's repeated visits to the White House were suspicious and will be the subject of further investigation. 'Who was she visiting at the White House and what were they talking about?  Was she updating the White House on the targeting or was she getting orders? These are answers we don’t yet have, because – surprise, surprise – a few computers crashed,' they said. Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen will be hauled before two House committee hearings next week to explain how Lois Lerner's emails could have been lost despite robust data-retention standards in the U.S. government . Cruella de Washington: Lois Lerner retired with a full government pension and has refused to testify about her role in a years-long scheme to target tea party groups with politically imbalanced scrutiny . Camp and Boustany said Monday that 'we are simply not going . to accept the IRS claim that these documents are not recoverable. We . will demand the president live up to his promise to work ""hand in hand"" with Congress to get the facts.' The . two lawmakers wrote to President Obama yesterday asking for its . records of emails between Lerner and employees the White House, the . Treasury Department, the Department of Justice, the Environmental . Protection Agency, the Federal Election Commission and the Occupational . Safety & Health Administration. That . move came hours after Ways and Means committee staff interviewed government employees . charged with running the IRS's internal computer networks. A . committee aide told MailOnline that those IRS workers confirmed that . budget and space limitations forced the agency to limit officials' access to networks that would ordinarily store email archives. They . also said, according to the aide, that other executive branch agencies . have their own independent archives of the records now lost at the IRS. Camp and Boustany asked Obama to order 'an exhaustive search for all Lois Lerner emails' throughout the executive branch. Republicans . hope to establish whether or not Lerner colluded with Obama . administration officials to play political favorites and single out . right-wing groups for special scrutiny. But . the White House is likely under no obligation to cooperate. President . Obama has already referred to the IRS matter as one of several 'phony . scandals' that he believes are politically motivated. Yet in May 2013 when the scandal first erupted, Obama pledged that his administration would 'make sure that we are working hand in hand with Congress to get this thing fixed.' Subpoena: Rep. Darrell Issa is demanding Koskinen show up for an evening interrogation on June 23 . The Ways and Means Republicans threw that phrase back in the president's face on Monday. 'In order to ensure accountability and “get this thing fixed,” please provide ... all communications between Lois Lerner and any persons within the Executive Office of the President (EOP) for the period between January 1, 2009 and May 1, 2011,' they wrote. 'Also, please indicate in writing when the EOP [Executive Office of the President] was informed, and by whom, that the IRS had lost critical Lerner documents.' Yesterday, California . Rep. Darrell Issa, who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform . Committee, demanded that IRS Commissioner John Koskinen explain – in person – . how 28 months of emails to and from . Lerner were 'lost' to a computer crash. Issa wrote to Koskinen in reaction to his agency's claim Friday . that the IRS no longer has copies of emails between Lerner and anyone . outside the IRS from January 2009 through April 2011. Issa demanded in his letter that Koskinen appear in a rare evening hearing on June 23, a . half-day before he's scheduled to testify before the House Ways and . Means Committee. 'I . will not tolerate your continued obstruction and game-playing in . response to the Committee’s investigation of the IRS targeting,' he . wrote. 'For . too long, the IRS has promised to produce requested – and, later, . subpoenaed – documents, only to respond later with excuses and . inaction.' In the House Oversight Committee, Issa hammered Koskinen for promising in a March 26 hearing that he would deliver every email Congress sought. At the time, however, he insisted that it would take 'years' for lawyers to sift through them all and excise private taxpayer information that the IRS isn't permitted to share – not even with other arms of government. And simply searching through Lerner's individual email storage, Koskinen said then, wouldn't produce an exhaustive record. 'They’re stored somewhere,' he explained to Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz during the hearing. 'They get taken off and stored in servers and you’ve got 90-thousand employees,' he insisted, but 'we can find, and we are in fact searching – we can find Lois Lerner’s emails.' At the time, he didn't mention the computer crash which became an overnight butt of jokes among conservatives. 'It's OK. The NSA has the original files,' Capitol HIll speechwriter Amanda Carpenter tweeted. 'Wonder what the #IRS would say if we told them we couldn’t submit tax documents because of a computer crash?' replied her boss, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. 'Wheel of Fortune' game show host Pat Sajak, who has begun wearing his conservatism on his sleeve in recent years, tweeted: 'Weird. Hundreds of emails to & from someone named Lerner just showed up in my spam. Must be British. Lots of tea talk.'","A congressional committee has issued subpoenas for all the hard drives the IRS and former official Lois Lerner used to back up her emails .

"The number of people in the UK has risen by five million over the past 12 years, growing faster than anywhere else in Europe. Last year, the population soared by more than 400,000 to pass 64million for the first time, according to the Office for National Statistics. Estimates released yesterday show that from 2001 to 2013, the population went up by five million. The previous five million increase took three times as long, over 37 years between 1964 and 2001. The figures reveal the rapid change since Labour’s open-door immigration policy under Blair fuelled a population explosion. Immigration started to pick up in the late 1990s, after years in which net migration stayed well below 100,000 – to which Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged to return it. Net migration is the total change when all those entering and leaving the country are counted up. Many fear soaring numbers are placing a gathering strain on key services such as housing, health, education and transport. If this rate of growth continues, Britain will hit the landmark 70million mark – the level some analysts believe will overstretch resources – by the late 2020s. Last year, the population soared by more than 400,000 to pass 64million for the first time . The ONS said that in mid-2013, there were 400,600 more people than a year earlier, equivalent to a city the size of Bristol. Immigration was directly responsible for 46 per cent of that rise. Migrants also play a major role in the current baby boom, with one in four infants now born to a mother who was born abroad. Other European countries have fallen far behind. Both Italy and France saw their populations rise by 291,000 in the year to mid-2013, while Germany, the only other country over the 100,000 level, saw a rise of 196,000. Paul Vickers, of the ONS, said UK net migration for the year was 183,400, while an excess of births over deaths added more than 212,000 extra people. He said: ‘Births were down on last year but still above average for the decade. Deaths have risen since last year, and are slightly higher than the decade average.’ Alp Mehmet, of the pressure group MigrationWatch UK, said: ‘Population growth on this scale is clearly unsustainable and raises serious questions about the ability of public services and infrastructure to cope. ‘The Government will have to build schools, GP surgeries, hospitals and homes . . . when there is very little money to spare.’ Simon Ross, of campaign group Population Matters, said: ‘Economic growth does not improve living standards if the benefit has to be spread across ever more people.’ The Government should push for ‘balanced’ migration and smaller families, he added. In the 30 years before 2001, immigration was responsible for just 12 per cent of population growth. But in the peak year of 2005, it accounted for almost 70 per cent of growth as Britain’s labour market was opened to Poland and seven other new EU members, attracting more than a million Eastern Europeans. Net migration was 48,000 in 1997, but by 2001 had more than trebled to 171,000, with record arrivals from Asia and Africa and a boom in asylum claims. Over the next decade, net migration was consistently higher than 200,000. One insider has said mass migration under Labour was a deliberate tactic. Former Blair adviser Andrew Neather wrote in 2009 that, from 2000: ‘I remember coming away from some discussions with the clear sense that the policy was intended – even if this wasn’t its main purpose – to rub the Right’s nose in diversity.’ The ONS said of the figures: ‘Since 2001 there have been high levels of net inward immigration, adding to the population at younger working ages. ‘In part this was driven by the expansion of the European Union in 2004 and 2007. This period has also seen an increasing number of births, driven by both the immigration of women of childbearing age and rising fertility among UK-born women.’ England’s population grew the most, the ONS said, by 0.7 per cent in a year to 53.9million. Scotland’s went up 0.27 per cent to 5.3million, with similar increases in Wales, which has 3.1million people, and Northern Ireland, at 1.8million. London was the fastest-growing region, with 108,000 extra people.","Population grows by 400,000, the same as a city the size of Bristol .

"The Tory MP who organised a Nazi-themed stag do for a friend and then tried to downplay his role in planning the party, last night announced he would step down at the next election. Aidan Burley was allowed to remain as MP for Cannock Chase after pictures were published in the Mail on Sunday of him attending the distasteful event – despite a party inquiry last month which called his actions ‘stupid and offensive’. The Oxford graduate always insisted that the stag do, which took place two years ago in the French ski resort of Val Thorens, was not anti-Semitic. Scroll down for video . Happier times: David Cameron with Aidan Burley who announced he was quitting Parliament after a 'difficult time' Aidan Burley is seen over the shoulder of Mark Fournier in a Nazi style SS uniform at a venue in Val Thorens in the French Alps in 2011 . Mr Burley, 35, issued a grovelling . apology after details of the party were revealed, and said he wished he . had left ‘as soon as I realised what was happening’. But it later emerged that – as the best man – he had bought a Nazi uniform for the groom. And he did not leave straight after the meal as he initially told the inquiry, but went on to a local bar with the group. Labour frontbencher Jon Ashworth . said: 'It shows huge weakness that David Cameron wasn't prepared to take . action against his disgraced MP, but it's right that Aidan Burley has . finally done the right thing in stepping down.

Hitler’, while one raised a toast to the ‘Third Reich’ during the dinner . party in December 2011, a police tribunal in Albertville heard. Mr Burley has repeatedly courted controversy, condemning the London Olympics and taking a phone call while on a visit to Auschwitz . Mr Burley later visited Auschwitz concentration camp but courted more controversy when he was seen using his . mobile phone there. Mr Burley was sacked as a ministerial . aide at the Department for Transport when the details of the party in the ski resort of Val . Thorens emerged. The groom was wearing the uniform and guests made toasts to the Third Reich. In 2012 he caused more upset when he condemned the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games as 'leftie multicultural cr*p'. He wrote on Twitter: 'The most leftie opening ceremony I have ever seen - more than Beijing, the capital of a communist state!' He later insisted he had been 'misunderstood'. Tonight Tory chairman Grant Shapps said: 'Aidan has a strong record in his constituency from securing the future of Cannock Chase Hospital, to setting up local job fairs and getting hundreds of people back to work.

No court can order a child from Europe to be taken from their parents or given up for adoption, said Britain’s most senior family law judge, Sir James Munby. Overseas authorities should always have a say in cases involving their nationals, and the future of foreign children must be decided by courts in their own country, he said. Judges and social workers must no longer keep their decisions secret or try to gag foreign media either, he added. Sir James, the president of the Family Division of the High Court, laid down rules for judges dealing with such issues as he handled the case of a 12-year-old boy from Slovakia. The judge said the Slovak boy - whose . case has been heavily reported by newspapers in Bratislava - should live . with an aunt. Slovak authorities were closely involved in the case. It comes six weeks after the scandal over Alessandra Pacchieri, an Italian mother who was forced by a British judge in the secretive Court of Protection to undergo a compulsory caesarean. Miss Pacchieri, 35, who suffers from bipolar disorder, was sectioned under the Mental Health Act after suffering a breakdown at Stansted Airport during a short visit to Britain. In secret court hearings, a Court of Protection judge ordered that she undergo a compulsory caesarean, and a family court judge in Chelmsford overruled her pleas and ordered that her baby daughter should be adopted in this country. Last month Sir James rejected an application by Essex social workers forbidding British and Italian newspapers from naming Miss Pacchieri. He said that the attempt to deny her a right to speak out in public was ‘an affront to humanity’. Miss Pacchieri may now be named in public, while the name of her baby being brought up in Essex, and her adoptive parents, remain secret. The case of Miss Pacchieri and the future of her baby have yet to be finalised by the courts. But yesterday in the similar case of the Slovak boy Sir James laid down a series of rules for judges ‘in a wider context’ which he said courts must follow in future. Sir James said: ‘To seek to shelter in this context . behind our normal practice of sitting in private and limiting the . permissible flow of information to outsiders is not merely unprincipled; . it is likely to be counter-productive and, potentially, extremely . damaging. Controversial: Several decisions have been made by the Court of Protection, which sits mostly in secret and presides over cases involving mental health issues or people deemed unable to decide for themselves . ‘If anyone thinks . this an unduly radical approach, they might pause to think how we would . react if roles were reversed and the boot was on the other foot.’ He added: ‘It is one of frequently voiced complaints that the courts . of England and Wales are exorbitant in their exercise of their care . jurisdiction over children from other European countries. ‘The . number of care cases involving children from other European countries . has risen sharply in recent years and significant numbers of care cases . now involve such children. Abuse: There has been a sharp rise in care cases coming to British courts (photo posed by model) ‘It . would be idle to ignore the fact that these concerns are only . exacerbated by the fact that the UK is unusual in Europe in permitting . the total severance of family ties without parental consent. 'The outcome . of care proceedings in England and Wales may be that a child who is a . national of another European country is adopted by an English family . notwithstanding the vigorous protests of the child’s non-English . parents. 'It is one of the frequently voiced complaints that the courts of England and Wales are exorbitant in their exercise of their care jurisdiction over children from other European countries.’ The judge said children must live in Britain for British courts to hold sway. For a family judge to act, foreign authorities must be permitted in court and kept fully informed, he added. He said English courts should allow European judges to decide on the lives of children who live mainly in their countries, and English judges should make declarations that they have no jurisdiction in such cases. Sir James also condemned efforts by social workers and courts in England to silence foreign newspapers. ‘As a general principle, any attempt by the English court to control foreign media, whether directly or indirectly, is simply impermissible,' he said. 'For the courts of another state to assume such a role involves an exercise of jurisdiction which is plainly exorbitant, not least as involving interference in the internal affairs of another state. 'What would we think, what would the English media think, if a family judge in Ruritania were to order the Daily Beast to desist from complaining about the way in which the judicial and other state authorities in Ruritania were handling a case involving an English mother?'","High Court family judge Sir James Munby spoke out in case of Slovak boy .

"The White House held an event this morning to honor a group of young illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. when they were children as 'Champions of Change'. The ceremony was intended to highlight the 'success stories' of the president's two-year-old Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) program that allowed young adults who came to the U.S. illegally when they were 16 or under to stay in America indefinitely. The timing of the event may cause alarm over the mixed signals being sent out from the White House after recent reports revealed that the U.S. border with Mexico has seen a huge increase in the number of children crossing illegally in the hope of starting a life in the US. This morning the White House held an event to honor a group of 10 young illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. when they were children as 'Champions of Change' Up to 400 children a day are pouring over the U.S. border with Mexico, many of whom are unaccompanied by adults. The president's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program is being blamed for this humanitarian crisis . Chart shows the number of unaccompanied children (age 17 or younger) apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol, fiscal years 2008-2014; statistics show a dramatic increase in children coming across the U.S.-Mexico border since 2012 . Since the DACA memorandum was issued, young people from Central American countries have scrambled to enter the U.S. illegally even though they are not eligible for amnesty. To be considered for deferred action, individuals must have been in the U.S. on June 15, 2012 when the memo was issued and lived in the U.S. continuously since for five years. DACA clearly states the eligibility requirements for deferment, however, children and teenagers, coming primarily  from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, have poured into the United States throughout the last two years. The flood of unaccompanied minors coming in through the border has become 'an urgent humanitarian situation' President Barack Obama said recently, and over the weekend the White House announced that Vice President Joe Biden would travel to Guatemala to meet with senior representatives of Central American countries to clear up 'misconceptions' about the deferred action program.A senior White House official told reporters on a conference call Sunday night that a stop in Guatemala had been added to Biden's trip to Latin America at the last minute so he could meet with senior representatives of the governments of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to discuss the 'root causes' behind the mass migrations. The 10 young people who were honored at today's event for 'exemplary leadership in their communities' all came from other countries and not all of them are Hispanic. The young people that are now crossing the U.S. border with Mexico illegally are not eligible for the president's deferred action program, yet floods are them are coming anyway because of 'misconceptions' about the policy . Rhustie Marcelo Valdizno immigrated to the U.S. from the Philippines when he was 15. He is currently a student at Bergen Community College in New Jersey and is a leader of Revolutionizing Asian American Immigrant Stories on the East Coast (RAISE). Valdizno hopes to attend med school and become a doctor some day. Pratishtha Khanna came to the U.S. from New Delhi, India when she was 10. She is a senior at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County who is majoring in biology and also plans to attend medical school. Khanna has been an active advocate of the DACA and the DREAM Act legislation that would provide amnesty to illegal immigrants who came here as children and completed college or served in the military. Esther Yu Hsi Lee's parents brought her to California from Taiwan when she was a child. She is currently the immigration reporter for progressive think tank Center for American Progress's online publication Think Progress. Of the other seven young people being commended as role models, one recipient is from Morocco, and another is from Columbia. The other five honorees came to the U.S. from Mexico. Throughout the Obama administration the White House has honored Champions of Change in areas it has deemed legislative and political priorities such as clean energy, transportation, infrastructure, and healthcare reform. The White House has made immigration the focus of it's Champions for Change program several times in the past, but this is the first time it has honored a group of illegal immigrants.","On June 15, 2012 President Barack Obama ordered immigration officials to stop deporting illegal immigrants under the age of 31 who had lived in the U.S. for the last five years continuously, had no criminal record and had come to the U.S. when they were under the age of 16 .

"China's economy is continuing to grow at breakneck speed but - as these pictures show - the giant nation's infrastructure is quite literally buckling under the strain. At least three people were killed and five injured when this motorway bridge in Heilongjiang province in north east China collapsed today sending four huge trucks crashing 100ft to the ground below. The tragedy comes after what is claimed to be the world's largest 'sofa chair' was unveiled in Shanghai - showcasing the more positive side of China's incredible economic growth. Collapse: Huge trucks lie on their side after being thrown off the Yangmingtan Bridge after it collapsed in Harbin in Heilongjiang province, north east China .

Thrown off: A truck lies on its side surrounded by its spilled load after crashing to the ground when the bridge collapsed . Devastation: The shattered remains of the truck, and another behind it, show the force of the impact when they hit the ground . The bridge collapse is one of a number of . horrifying accidents on China's expanding road and rail networks in . recent years - leading to fears that safety is being sacrificed for the . speed of construction. Four trucks crashed to the ground, crushing their occupants and sending their loads spilling across the ground. The tragedy comes just ten months after the multimillion pound roadway was constructed and was one of two transport disasters to hit the . province this week, with a train crash at a railway station on Thursday . also injuring at least 24 people. Xinhua news agency said it was at least the sixth major bridge collapse across the country since July last year - fuelling fears over the safety of China's fast-expanding infrastructure. But despite fears about its infrastructure, China continues to amaze the world with the sheer scale of its economic growth. And . nothing could symbolise this expansion better than the world's largest . armchair, which has been put on display in a Shanghai department store.

"The Louisiana family behind Duck Dynasty is also attempting to build a political dynasty. A nephew of patriarch Phil Robertson has announced plans to run for the U.S. house. Zach Dasher, a 36-year-old Republican, is looking to replace Representative Vance McAllister, who the famous family had previously supported. McAllister. who ran on a platform of conservative Christian family values, landed in hot water in April after video emerged of the married Republican enjoying a long smooch with a female staffer - the wife of one of his best friends. The 40-year-old has been branded the 'Kissing Congressman' after the incident. He initially said he would not run for reelection this year, but later seemed to renege on that pledge.

"A minuscule apartment, only 86 foot square, may not sound like an enticing place to live, but this particular teeny weeny flat in Paris has been transformed into an enchanting foldaway living space. Hidden behind the cupboard doors is a secret bed, wardrobe, table and chairs, bookcase, bathroom and kitchen. The flat at the top of one of Paris's Haussmann buildings was historically a maid's quarters but was more recently used as a storage room. Scroll down for video . The room is the architectural incarnation of a Swiss Army Knife and includes a hidden bed, staircase and bookcase (left) and foldaway table and chairs (right) The wall stickers  transform the space from a utilitarian cupboard into something a little more enchanting . It was only when the family who owned it had an au pair arriving but no space in their apartment for her to live that they decided to convert the storage room into a mini bedsit. To create the transformation, they enlisted the help of architects Morgane Guimbault and Gaylor Lasa Zingui from Kitoko Studio architectural firm. 'Despite the small area, the space had to be functional in order to sleep, and also to cook, eat, wash, work and store a maximum of items,' said Morgane. The firm came up with the concept of a room that works like a Swiss Army knife. Left: A view of the bed, bathroom and storage cupboard, which also houses the boiler; Right: The wardrobe space slides out from underneath the bed . Architectural plans of the 86sq ft apartment show a bird's-eye-view of the tiny space . 'The Swiss Army Knife is a simple knife but, by a game of sliding and folding, it can contain a multitude of tools in a very small object,' Morgane explains. Hidden within the compact space is  a bed, a table, a wardrobe, a staircase, a micro fridge, microwave, a toilet, shower, bookcase, hidden sink and removable cooking plate. All the amenities are fully integrated and can be closed away when no longer in use. Once all the elements are folded and stored, it frees up half of the area of the room. Left: The wet room is tucked away behind a cupboard door; Right: The apartment when the bedroom, wardrobe, bathroom and table are stored away . A table and stools live inside one of the cupboards. The kitchen sink can be covered and the apartment also has a mini fridge, microwave and removable cooking plate . The architects were also inspired by Japanese apartment design. 'It's really efficient in small spaces,' Gaylor explains. 'The biggest challenge was first to fit a full-size bed in such a small room - then finding the correct position for it. Fitting a bathroom with all the necessary amenities was also quite a challenge. After that, all the other parts of the design started to be obvious.' But despite those challenges, Morgane says the hardest part of the project was convincing the clients to go ahead with it. 'The space was hard to understand on the 3D images,' she admits. Once the work was finished, the wall stickers helped transform the space from a utilitarian cupboard into something a little more enchanting.","The space at the top of one of Paris's Haussmann buildings was historically a maid's quarters .

"The world's oldest tree has been found on a mountain in central Sweden – and it is still growing. The 9,500-year-old Norwegian Spruce was discovered by scientists at Umeå University during a 2004 tree census in Fulufjällets National Park in Sweden. The age of the tree was established using carbon-14 dating at a laboratory in Miami, Florida after an investigation by the university. Growing old: The 9,500-year-old Norwegian Spruce is believed to be the world's oldest tree, and grows on a mountain in central Sweden . The tree, named Old Tjikko, pictured on a less cold day, was found by a team of scientists during a 2004 census . It has been able to survive so long thanks to the process of vegetative propagation, which means it is able to effectively clone itself. While the visible portion of the 13ft tall tree is relatively new, its root system has been growing for almost ten thousand years. The parts of the root system that were sent to the United States dated back nearly 10,000 years, it is possible that other parts are older, locals told Aftonbladet. Cold and old: The tree's age was established by a laboratory in Florida which analysed parts of the root system . Spruced up: The trunk and firs are significantly younger than 9,500 years, but the root system has been growing underground since the last ice age . ‘During the ice age sea level was 120 meters lower than today and much of what is now the North Sea in the waters between England and Norway was at that time forest,’ Professor Leif Kullman, professor of Physical Geography at Umeå University, said. 'I can imagine that it may be probable that the first firs came from these areas.' Professor Kullman has named the tree Old Tjikko, after his Siberian Husky. He says wind and low temperature have seen the tree end up 'like a bonsai tree' with a lot of firs and a small trunk. 'Big trees cannot get as old as this,' he told Aftonbladet. The tree on Fulufjallet is older than most things we take for granted. It took root as humans had just begun to move north into Sweden and the rest of Scandinavia as the last ice age was beginning to end.

"It has played host to more than two million visitors who poured through the gates to witness two weeks of spectacular sporting achievements from the world's top athletes at the London 2012 Olympics. And plans are in place to ensure London's Olympic Park continues to draw crowds long after the 2012 Games have drawn to a close. The venue is set to reopen to the public from July 27 next year as the newly named and new-look Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Legacy: The Olympic Park, which is to be renamed the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, will re-open to the public in July next year . Transformation: An aerial view of the London 2012 Olympic Park, which will become a visitor destination 'like no other', according to the London Legacy Development Corporation . The venue is being billed as a visitor . destination and community park unlike any other in the UK, with some of . the venues which have been graced by the world's top sport stars at . London 2012. Transformation of the 560-acre site in Stratford, east London, is set to take 18 months from October. Major international competitions will be held at the Olympic Stadium even though its new tenants have not yet been confirmed. Four bids are in the running to make the showpiece venue their new home after the Games. Bids from West Ham United, Leyton Orient, Intelligent Transport Services in association with Formula One, and UCFB College of Football Business will be assessed to ensure they are compliant, before being evaluated ahead of negotiations, according to the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC). It is set to become the new national home for athletics and to host the IAAF 2017 World Athletics Championships. The venue has been earmarked to become a leading centre for technology, design and research which could generate more than 4,000 jobs. Up to 20,000 journalists used the venue during the Games. Afterwards, the Broadcast Centre will offer 95,000 sq ft of office space over five floors and 575,000 sq ft of commercial space over two floors. The five-storey press centre will provide around 317,000 sq ft of prime office space with the potential for retail use on the ground floor. The aim is for it to be a digital hub which could use local east London talent but also with a community focus after the Games. A conference centre and a pedestrian square for broadcasting major sporting events, along with cafes, restaurants and bars, are among the plans. The LLDC claims it has set 'tough but achievable' requirements that must be met before any agreement for lease is formally signed. Estimates suggest 800,000 visitors a year will use the Aquatics Centre when the Park reopens. The two temporary wings will be stripped away to cut the capacity to 2,500 after the Games. It will be possible to increase the venue capacity for major competitions, the LLDC said. It had a 17,500-capacity for the Games, under a 160m x 80m wave-like roof which has a longer single span than Heathrow Terminal 5. It features a 50m competition pool, a 25m competition diving pool, a 50m warm-up pool and a ""dry"" warm-up area for divers. Users will range from community clubs to schools and elite swimmers and the venue's moveable booms and floors can be shifted to create different depths and pool sizes to fit swimmers of various abilities and experience. A creche, changing facilities, a cafe and a new public plaza in front of the building are some of the features that will be installed. Crowds: Thousands of visitors can be seen swarming the Olympic Park in Stratford during the 2012 London Games . Greenwich Leisure Limited has been named as the operator. The Copper Box, where the handball and some modern pentathlon disciplines were held, is to become a multi-use sports centre for the community, athlete training and events. Greenwich Leisure Limited has again been named as operator. Its flexible design and retractable seating mean it will be suitable for activities ranging from international competition to community sports. Legacy chiefs hope indoor sports such as basketball, handball, badminton, boxing, martial arts, netball, table tennis, wheelchair rugby and volleyball could be played there. A health and fitness club with changing facilities and a cafe for use by the local community are also planned. Temporary areas used for the media and technology equipment during the Games will be converted to provide extra spectator facilities. The athletes' changing rooms will be turned into changing areas. The first homes on the Park are to be ready at the end of 2014. The North Park, a nature-themed community sector and playground also including the 7,500 multi-use sport, entertainment and community arena, will be the first area to reopen in July next year. The east London boroughs of Hackney, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest will all have entrances to the North Park and visitors could walk there through Eton Manor. The rest of the North Park, including the Lee Valley VeloPark and more visitor access points, is set to open at the end of 2013. The South Plaza, sitting between the Olympic Stadium, Aquatics Centre and the ArcelorMittal Orbit, is set to open at Easter 2014. At this point visitors will have access to the whole of the Park. New entrances will open via Westfield shopping centre and Stratford High Street in Newham. Planners see this area as tree-lined promenades which connect spaces that can be used in a variety of ways including for cultural programmes, pop-up street food stalls and community events. Structures used during the Games, such as temporary venues, bridges, walkways and roads, will be stripped out during the transformation. The closure is also when the Park will be connected to the surrounding area with new roads, cycleways and foot paths. Permanent venues, bridges and parklands will be completed ready for everyday use by residents and visitors during this time.","Venue will be renamed the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park .

"Owen Paterson said  support for flawed wind and solar power cost billions and made electricity and gas needlessly expensive . The former Environment Secretary attacked a so-called ‘green blob’ at the heart of Government yesterday – accusing Whitehall officials and ministers of raising energy prices for the poor. Owen Paterson said their support for flawed wind and solar power cost billions and made electricity and gas needlessly expensive. He said the ‘green blob’ included civil servants and quangos in thrall to the climate change and environmental lobby. He claimed it had blocked him from prioritising shale gas exploration as a more efficient way to secure energy for the future. Mr Paterson, who was removed as Environment Secretary in July, said the only way to ‘keep the lights on’ was to scrap the Climate Change Act, which requires the UK to use more renewable energy and is backed by civil servants. He warned claims of impending environmental disaster were ‘widely exaggerated’, and accused a series of energy secretaries – including the Lib Dem incumbent Ed Davey – of being ‘Sheriffs of Nottingham’ by taking from the poor. He said: ‘It amazes me that our last three energy secretaries, Ed Miliband, Chris Huhne and Ed Davey, have merrily presided over the single most regressive policy we have seen in this country since the Sheriff of Nottingham: the coerced increase of electricity bills for people on low incomes to pay huge subsidies to wealthy landowners and rich investors.’ The former minister also said he was disgusted by rich film stars who fly to Africa to preach against the burning of fossil fuels there. His reference to the ‘green blob’ follows former Education Secretary Michael Gove’s description of the teaching establishment as the ‘blob’. Speaking to the Global Warming Policy Foundation think tank, Mr Paterson claimed the effects of climate change had been ‘consistently and widely exaggerated’, and policies to encourage onshore wind farms will cost £1.3trillion by 2050. He said wind turbines had ‘devastated landscapes, blighted views, divided communities, killed eagles, carpeted the countryside and the very wilderness that the “green blob” claims to love with new access tracks cut deep into peat, boosted production of carbon-intensive cement, and driven up fuel poverty – while richly rewarding landowners’. Mr Paterson claimed the effects of climate change had been ‘consistently and widely exaggerated’, and policies to encourage onshore wind farms (pictured) will cost £1.3trillion by 2050 . Current energy policy, he said, was a ‘slave to flawed climate action’, adding: ‘It neither reduces emissions sufficiently nor provides the energy we need as a country.’ Offshore wind farms were ‘proving a failure’, hydro-electric power was ‘maxed out’ and solar power was an ‘expensive red herring’. He condemned solar farms as a ‘futile eyesore, and a waste of land that could be used for other activities’. He urged greater investment in shale gas – pointing out that 40 per cent of Britain’s coal was from Russia and adding: ‘It is better to burn Lancashire shale gas than Putin’s coal. ‘We must be prepared to stand up to the bullies in the environmental movement and their subsidy-hungry allies.’ ÷Greenpeace was yesterday denounced as ‘evil’ by Dr Patrick Moore, who helped to found it 40 years ago. The ecologist, 67, accused it of risking lives by opposing the development of genetically-modified ‘golden rice’ with added vitamin A, which could save malnourished children. He told Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘They lost concern for humans. They have turned into basically an evil organisation.’ But Dr Doug Parr, of Greenpeace, said there were better alternatives to golden rice. The group was condemned this year when it emerged that one executive was flying several times a month from Luxembourg to Amsterdam.","Former Environment Secretary said support for flawed wind and solar power cost billions and made electricity and gas needlessly expensive .

"People living in Blackpool, Manchester and Middlesbrough are twice as likely to die as other parts of the country, a new study revealed today. Analysis of death rates shows how differences in income, employment and health impact on the life chances in different areas. A new interactive map shows how mortality rates differ, and how improvements in health mean there have been large falls in some areas including Cambridgeshire, Tamworth and Camden. In 2012, the average mortality rate in the UK was 538.6 deaths per 100,000 people. The rate was lower in England (523.9), but 567.8 in Wales, 640.1 in Scotland and 567 in Northern Ireland. The interactive map released by the Office for National Statistics shows how mortality rates have changed across the country from 2001 to 2012 . In England, the North East had the highest mortality rate with 592.9 deaths per 100,000 population, while the lowest was in the South East with 482.8 deaths. The local authority in England with the highest Age-Standardised Mortality Rate was Blackpool (721.0 deaths per 100,000 population) while Christchurch had the lowest (379.6 deaths per 100,000 population). Among men, the death rate in Blackpool was 879.3 per 100,000, Burnley 841.8 and Manchester 836.5. For women the death rate was highest in Middlesbrough (604.8), followed by Burnley (602.7) and Blaenau Gwent (596.9). A new map released by the ONS also shows changes in mortality rates in the decade from 2001 to 2012. Mortality rates for men slumped by 40 per cent East Cambridgeshire, 38 per cent in both Tamworth and Camden and 37 per cent in Epsom and Ewell. For women, Camden saw a 39 per cent fall, Uttlesford was down 35 per cent, Lichfield 33 per cent, Chiltern 32 per cent and Haringey 31 per cent.

"Hundreds of babies have been rescued by police in China after a crackdown was launched on trafficking infants. The nationwide bust saw 1,094 people arrested as officers acted on information relating to four major internet-based baby trafficking rings. China's Public Security Ministry said 382 babies were rescued after four websites were found to be selling children under the guise of adoption. Hundreds of babies have been rescued after police in China launched a crackdown on four baby trafficking websites. Nearly 2,000 suspects were arrested as a result of the nationwide operation . The ministry said the internet has helped baby traffickers, by providing a more secretive cover for the illegal business. Child abduction and trafficking is widespread in China, where strict population control rules have encouraged the traditional bias for sons. The strict laws limit many families to one child, and with boys being favoured as heirs to the family name, many female babies are sold, aborted or abandoned. Poverty fuels the trade, while illicit profits tempts traffickers, resulting in a thriving market for babies and toddlers. To address the issue, China is considering tougher penalties for parents who sell their children, as well as for those people who are found to have bought a child. Around 118 boys are born for every 100 girls, against a global average of 1003 to 107 boys per 100 girls. The imbalance has created criminal demand for kidnapped or bought baby boys, as well as baby girls destined to be brides attracting rich dowries in sparsely populated regions. 'Child traffickers have now taken the fight online, using 'unofficial adoption' as a front,' state news agency Xinhua quoted an unidentified police official as saying. 'They are well-hidden and very deceptive.' Zhang Shuxia, an obstetrician involved in baby trafficking, standing trial in Weinan Intermediate People's Court in Weinan, Shaanxi province in December. She was handed a suspended death sentence for stealing seven babies and selling them to traffickers . The traffickers arrested today used websites like China's Orphan Network and Dream Adoption Home. State news agenct Xinhau did not say what steps the authorities were taking to reunite the rescued babies with their parents. Parents in China have been warned to guard against kidnappers, who could pose as nurses in hospitals or lie in wait outside school gates to bundle unsuspecting children into vans or speed off with them on motorbikes. Last month a Chinese court handed down a suspended death sentence to a doctor who sold seven newborns to human traffickers in a case that sparked public anger. Zhang Shuxia, 55, an obstetrician in northwestern Shaanxi province, was found guilty of selling the babies for as much as 21,600 yuan ($3,600) each between 2011 and 2013, the court said. Last year, China, which has a population of about 1.4 billion, said it would ease family restrictions, letting millions of families have two children, in the country's most significant liberalisation of its strict one-child policy in about three decades.","China's Public Security Ministry launched the nationwide crackdown .

"A 72-year-old woman has been sentenced to 420 hours of community service and three years' probation for trying to cut off her husband's penis. Virginia Valdez pleaded guilty to one count of assault with a deadly weapon over the 2011 attack on Cesar Valdez, then aged 62, at their home in Palm Springs, California. The victim said he accepted the plea deal so he could 'move on' but slammed the justice system for not taking his case seriously because he is a man. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Escaped jail: Virginia Valdez, 72, got 420 hours of community service and three years' probation for trying to cut off her then-husband's penis using industrial kitchen scissors during a bitter divorce in 2011 . Discrimination? The victim Cesar Valdez, 64, and his attorney Gloria Allred (pictured together) spoke out brandishing an identical pair of scissors to say the case would have been heard earlier if he weren't a man . 'There is no doubt in my mind that had I been the aggressor and not the victim my case would have been heard much sooner. 'I am here in front of you today to emphasize that male spouses can also be victims of domestic violence, but in some cases, men are afraid to talk for fear of ridicule or for fear of being labeled as some sort of freak or a wimp,' he said. The couple of 32 years were going through a divorce when Mrs Valdez attacked Mr Valdez. Mr Valdez called the police after his . wife's brutal assault as he screamed with pain and tried to stop the . bleeding using bathroom towels. Attack: Mrs Valdez attacked Mr Valdez at their home in Palm Springs in 2011 while they were estranged . 'I am here in front of you to emphasize that male spouses can be victims of domestic violence,' Mr Valdez said . 'Bitch tried to cut my d*** off,' he told an operator, according to the arrest warrant. Mrs Valdez had been 'massaging the intimate areas of the victim such as his testicles and inner thigh' when she stopped suddenly, telling him she was going to brush her teeth. But instead she grabbed a pair of scissors and savagely cut at her husband's penis and 'disfigured the victim's genitals'. Gloria Allred, who represented Mr Valdez, appeared with the victim outside court to address reporters, brandishing a pair of kitchen scissors. 'This is what was used on his penis,' she said. 'There was a lot of blood coming out of his penis as a result of her attack on him.' Allred added: 'He feels that if he had been a woman victim of domestic violence that the case would not have been permitted to be delayed for so long and that the punishment for Virginia would have been harsher.' Mrs Valdez, who had faced a potential nine-year jail term, refused to speak to reporters. The former couple are now embroiled in civil suits against one another. Sergeant Kyle Stjerne told the Los Angeles Times that Valdez tried to pick the best tool for the job, adding: 'They were more heavy duty than the standard office scissors.' Mr Valdez was treated at the local hospital for non-life-threatening wounds and was released later that evening while 5ft 4in Mrs Valdez was detained.","Virginia Valdez, 72, attacked Cesar Valdez, 64, with scissors in 2011 .

"Allen Lambert, 65, used banned pesticides to kill ten buzzards and a sparrowhawk at the Stody estate near Holt, Norfolk, to protect its pheasants . A judge yesterday warned the rural aristocracy that they must take responsibility for the actions of their employees after a gamekeeper was spared jail for poisoning birds of prey. Allen Lambert, 65, used banned pesticides to kill ten buzzards and a sparrowhawk at the Stody estate near Holt in Norfolk to protect its pheasants. He claimed to have found the bodies in the 4,500-acre grounds and that he was being ‘set up’ by a local men with a grudge against him. But the explanation was dismissed as a ‘fairy story’ by the prosecution and he was found guilty of charges including killing the birds and possessing banned pesticides following a trial at Norwich Magistrates Court last month. The RSPB has described it as ‘the worst case of bird poisoning’ ever detected in England. Lambert faced up to six months behind bars and a £5,000 fine for the death of each bird between October 2012 and April last year but was given a ten-week suspended sentence. Sentencing Lambert at Norwich Magistrates’ Court, district judge Peter Veits said: ‘The only motivation I can see for this is to protect the birds the estate breeds for its shoot. ‘Those who employ gamekeepers have a strict duty to know what is being done in their name and on their property.’ Lambert had worked on the estate for 24 years and was originally employed by Ian MacNicol, who was president of the Country Land and Business Association from 1997 to 1999. The father-of-four died in 2006 and his family still own the estate. Lambert was caught after a member of public found the decomposing bodies of four buzzards and contacted police. John Hughes, defending, said his client had been verbally promised a home for life in the grounds but had been ordered to leave as a result of his arrest. Lambert, pictured leaving court, faced up to six months behind bars and a £5,000 fine for the death of each bird  but was given a ten-week suspended sentence .

He was found guilty of charges including killing the birds and possessing banned pesticides. He admitted inappropriately storing a rifle. Lambert, who retired around the same time, refused to comment yesterday. The estate also declined to discuss the case. Detective Constable Richard Moden, of Norfolk Police, said: ‘Lambert has shown a total disregard for the laws surround the protection of wildlife.’ The RSPB released this photo, which nine of the buzzards which were killed by Lambert on the estate .

"A rare species has been sighted in a Mexican lake just a month after scientists said it may be extinct in the wild. The axolotl is a newt-like creature which has furry external gills, small feet and a tail and its only known natural habitat is one lake system near Mexico city. Scientists thought it had become extinct last month, killed by pollution from surrounding slums and out-competed by larger fish, after they failed to find one while surveying the waters. Researchers investigating the axolotl in Mexico say they have spotted the creature twice after a previous group of researchers said it may be extinct in the wild . The newt-like animal has only one known habitat, the Xochimilco series of lakes and canals near Mexico city which were built by ancient Mayans to grow food . However a different team say they have twice spotted the small creature, nicknamed the 'water monster', although they have yet to catch one. Biologist Armando Tovar Garza, of Mexico's National Autonomous University, said: 'We weren't able to capture them because the behavior of the axolotl makes them very difficult to capture. 'We haven't had any captures, but we have had two sightings. That's important, because it tells us we still have a chance.' Its only natural habitat is the Xochimilco network of lakes and canals — the 'floating gardens' of earth piled on reed mats that the Aztecs built to grow crops. The axolotl is scientifically important because, aside from its strange looks, it also has the ability to regenerate severed limbs. The animal has external gills which form a sort of mane around its head, a tail, small feet and a mouth which curves into a weird smile - all contributing to its strange appearance . Scientifically the axolotl is interesting because it has the ability to regenerate severed limbs . Some axolotls still survive in aquariums, water tanks and research labs, but experts said those conditions aren't the best, because of interbreeding . The axolotl is endangered because of sewage from nearby slums which leak into the waters of the lake, and also competition from fish such as carp and tilapia which have been introduced . Releasing captive-bred axolotls into the wild could spread a fungus infection that is fatal to them and could reduce their genetic diversity. Tovar Garza said some small mutations, possibly the result of interbreeding, have already been seen. Alarmed by the creature's falling numbers in recent years, researchers built axolotl ""shelters"" in Xochimilco to help them breed in the cleanest part of their remaining habitat. Sacks of rocks and reedy plants act as filters around a selected area, and cleaner water is pumped in, to create better conditions. The shelters also include permeable cages and other devices intended to help protect axolotls from non-native carp and tilapia that were introduced to the lake system years ago and compete with axolotls for food. Growing up to a foot long (30 centimeters), axolotls use four stubby legs to drag themselves along the bottom or thick tails to swim in Xochimilco's murky channels while feeding on aquatic insects, small fish and crustaceans. But the surrounding garden-islands have increasingly been converted to illicit shantytowns, with untreated sewage often running off into the water. The Mexican Academy of Sciences said in a statement that a 1998 survey found an average of 6,000 axolotls per square kilometer, a figure that dropped to 1,000 in a 2003 study and 100 in a 2008 survey.","Axolotl is a strange newt-like creature which lives in Mexico .

"The two pilots at the helm of the missing Malaysia Airlines passenger jet which vanished a week ago with 239 people on board are being investigated amid fears the plane was hijacked. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, and Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, are the subject of a police investigation, airline executives have admitted, and could have their homes searched. Police in Malaysia have said they are looking at the . psychological background of the pilots, their family life and . connections as one line of inquiry into flight MH370's disappearance. Online, Malaysians have rushed to defend the reputations of the pilots, Zaharie Ahmad Shah (left), 53, and Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27 (right) Pilots: The men were flying the pictured plane on route MH370 when it disappeared . In the days since the flight, from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, went missing it has emerged that Shah was so passionate about flying he has is own flight simulator at home, and that Hamid once invited two women to spend an entire flight in the cockpit with him. The men may have their homes searched . as part of the probe, as new information suggests that the plane's . course was diverted by capable pilots. Earlier today two . sources familiar with the . investigation said radar evidence suggests that the route the plane is thought to have taken after its last known position suggested it was being flown by trained pilots. They believe the flight was moving between fixed waypoints which guide professional pilots along well-trodden routes. It was also pointed out that the first communication system to lose track of the plane - its on-board transponders - can be turned off by the pilots. While . there is no evidence linking them to any wrongdoing, airline executives . admitted that police were pursuing the line of enquiry. The . possibility has also been raised that the pilots were acting 'under . duress'. Many have also rushed to defend the pilots' good names in light . of the investigation. Details of their backgrounds have emerged from interviews with neighbours, Malaysia Airlines staff, a religious leader and from social networks. A woman walks past the house of missing Malaysia Airlines co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid in Shah Alam, outside Kuala Lumpur . Muslim men leave a mosque after Friday prayers, just down the road of the home (pictured) of Fariq Abdul Hamid, co-pilot of the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner MH370 . According to a local mosque leader, Hamid is a 'good boy, a good Muslim, humble and quiet'. Ahmad . Sarafi Ali Asrah, who works near Fariq's two-storey home in a . middle-class are of Kuala Lumpur, also spoke of the distress his . disappearance. He described Hamid's parents as distraught and the community solidly behind them, supporting the family in prayers. 'His father still cries when he talks about Fariq. His mother too,' said Ahmad Sarafi. Hamid, . the son of a high-ranking civil servant in Selangor state, joined . Malaysia Airlines in 2007. With just 2,763 hours of flight experience he . had only recently started co-piloting the sophisticated Boeing 777. He had a short brush with fame when he was filmed recently for a CNN programme. Reporter . Richard Quest called it a perfect landing of a Boeing 777-200, the same . model as the twin-aisle plane that went missing. An online tribute page . to the pilots shows a photo of Fariq in the cockpit with Quest, both . smiling. Neighbor Ayop Jantan said he had heard that Hamid was engaged and planning his wedding. The eldest of five children, his professional achievements were a source of pride for his father, said Jantan, a retiree. Jonti Roos (centre) claimed she and her friend were allowed in the cockpit by Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, during a flight three years ago . Hamid's superior, Shah, joined Malaysia Airlines in 1981 and has more than 18,000 flight hours. His . Facebook profile includes pictures of him flying remote-controlled aircraft, posting pictures of his collection which . included a lightweight twin-engine helicopter and an amphibious . aircraft. Born in northern . Penang state, the bald-headed captain and grandfather is also an . enthusiastic handyman and proud home cook. As part of what he called . 'community service', he had posted several YouTube videos including how . to make air conditioners more efficient to cut electricity bills, how to . waterproof window panes and how to repair a refrigerator icemaker. A . Malaysian Airline stewardess who had flown with Shah several times said . he was 'very nice, very friendly and safety-conscious'. She didn't want . to be named because of company policy prohibiting employees from . speaking to the media. Neighbours . of both men also praised their commitment to the community. Hamid . played futsal, a modified form of soccer popular in Southeast Asia, with . neighborhood youngsters and paid for their sports shirts. Shah was known for bringing food he cooked himself to community events or making sure his wife and children did when he couldn't attend. A supporter of Malaysia's main opposition parties, he had volunteered to be a poll monitor in recent elections. Yet both Hamid and Shah have quirks that reveal a more colorful side to their pilot personas. Grabbing attention were pictures Shah posted online of the flight simulator he built for his home using three large computer monitors and other accessories. Asked at a news conference whether it was unusual for pilots to have such equipment at home, Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said 'everyone is free to do his own hobby'. Shah is certified by Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation as a flight simulator examiner, according to Malaysia Airlines. Special prayers were held at the KLIA Mosque near the Kuala Lumpur International Airport today for those on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 which has now been missing without trace for nearly a week . Hamid has drawn greatest scrutiny after the revelation he and another pilot invited two women boarding their aircraft to sit in the cockpit for a flight from Phuket, Thailand, to Kuala Lumpur in 2011. During the flight, the pilots smoked and flirted, one of the women, South African Jonti Roo, said in an interview broadcast by Australia's Nine Network. The claims were backed with numerous photos showing Roos and her friend posing in the cockpit. Though initially thrilled by the experience, Roos also described it as 'possibly a little bit sleazy'. Malaysia Airlines said it was shocked by the claims and is investigating. 'I don't think he is a playboy,' said Ahmad Sarafi, the imam at the mosque Hamid prayed at. 'But I don't know about his personal life.'","Officers investigating Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, and Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27 .

"A pensioner who suffered years of torment from having 'How Much is that Doggie in the Window' playing  in her head, says the tune has finally stopped - only to be replaced by a new song. Susan Root, of Coggeshall, Essex, has a rare form of tinnitus, also known as musical hallucinations, and hears constant music. But after enduring four years of hearing the 1952 Patti Page novelty tune on loop, the 65-year-old says she is now being plagued by Judy Garland's 'Somewhere over the Rainbow', from the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. Scroll down for video . Plagued: Susan Root has been hearing 'How Much is that Doggie in the Window' in her heard for four years - only for the tune to change to Judy Garland's 'Somewhere over the Rainbow' For the last two weeks, she says the music has been getting worse and now feels she is at breaking point. It plays in her head all day and even keeps her awake at night. She said: 'It used to just be How Much is that Doggie in the Window but now I am getting all the different tunes. 'Now it is mostly Somewhere over the Rainbow. 'I also hear Happy Birthday now and again and Auld Lang Syne.

After enduring years of the 1952 Patti Page novelty tune on loop, the 65-year-old says she is now being plagued by Judy Garland's 'Somewhere over the Rainbow' from the 1939 classic film The Wizard of Oz (pictured) She first heard How Much is that Doggie in the Window while working four years ago and has heard phantom music playing ever since. 'It's been terrible recently - it's just been constant for this past fortnight,' said Mrs Root, who retired as a cleaner at Honywood Community Science School last year after 27 years. 'I wake up hearing Somewhere over the Rainbow. According to the British Tinnitus Association, musical hallucination (MH), also known as musical tinnitus, is the experience of hearing music when none is being played. Hearing sound that no-one else can hear is quite common, but the experience is normally of a simple sound such as a buzzing, ringing, or sizzling: this is known as tinnitus. In a small number of people however, these experiences can be more complex and emotive, and music can be heard. Musical hallucination, also known as musical tinnitus, is the experience of hearing music when none is being played (file picture) Although anyone can experience MH, it is more common in women than in men, as well as in those over 60 years of age. Individuals who live alone, and those with hearing loss are also more likely to experience MH. Some people with MH are worried that it might represent a mental health condition, such as schizophrenia. Although in schizophrenia it is common to hear voices, it is in fact very rare to experience MH and there is thought to be no connection between the two conditions. 'It's worse at night because it is quieter. 'I am getting really fed up, people think it is funny but they don't understand - it's hell. 'I just want it to stop. I have to have the TV on when I try to go to sleep to drown out the noise.' Mrs Root, who sometimes hears clicking or whistling instead of music, said doctors, neurologists and therapists have all failed to make the problem go away. She has also tried listening to calming sounds, such as waves crashing and birdsong. She has had ear problems since she was young, including infections, a perforated ear drum, problems with her balance and has undergone two operations. Mrs Root, who has been married to retired lorry driver Graham since 1974, said: 'He shouts at me because I can't hear very well.'","Susan Root has a rare form of tinnitus also known as musical hallucinations .

"One of London’s canal ways has received a Japanese makeover with the opening of the Merchant Square footbridge. Spanning the capital’s Paddington Basin, the structure looks like a conventional bridge six days of the week. But come noon on Friday, and it transforms into an incredible fan as it lifts up to let passing boats through the canal. Scroll down for video . The design uses five steel beams which move using hydraulic jacks to open and close like the blades on a fan. The bridge spans the 65ft (20 metre) width of the Grand Union Canal in London’s Paddington, close to Thomas Heatherwick's Rolling Bridge that curls into a ball. High Wycombe-based design group Knight Architects and structural engineers AKT I won a competition to design a kinetic sculpture and have created the ‘Fan Footbridge’ as result. The bridge’s five beams, which range from six to seven tonnes, rise to different angles creating a fan effect and are balanced by a 40 tonne counterweight which keeps the beams stable. High Wycombe-based design group Knight Architects and structural engineers AKT I won a competition to design a kinetic sculpture and have created the ‘Fan Footbridge’ as result . ‘Shaped counterweights assist the hydraulic mechanism and reduce the energy required to move the structure,’ said a spokesperson from Knight Architects. ‘The bridge balustrades are formed from twin rows of inclined stainless steel rods, overlapping to form a robust yet filigree and highly transparent structure.’ The Rolling Bridge unfolds across Grand Union Canal every Friday at noon . The fan bridge spans the 65ft (20 metre) width of the Grand Union Canal in London’s Paddington, close to Thomas Heatherwick's Rolling Bridge that curls into a ball. The Rolling Bridge unfolds across Grand Union Canal every Friday at noon. A conventional opening bridge mechanism relies on a single rigid element and lifts up to let boats pass. But the rolling bridge folds up out of the way of oncoming traffic by curling up into an octagon. The design feat, which is the brainchild of British designer Thomas Heatherwick, was built in 2004 as part of the newly developed Paddington Basin. The bridge consists of eight triangular sections hinged at the walkway level and is connected above by two part links that collapse towards the deck under the control of pistons. ‘The most challenging part of the fabrication was the required accuracy. For safety reasons, gaps between the beams had to be no bigger than 3mm over a length of 20 metres’, project architect, Bartlomiej Halaczek told Dezeen. ‘As impressive was the fabrication accuracy of the conical counterweights, which sink into the engine room turning into a set of walkable steps flush with the granite slabs around them.’ The bridge will let boats past and, when it is fully closed, pedestrians can walk along the 9.8ft (3 metre) wide new design, which is illuminated by LED lights.

"The billionaire husband of alleged child rapist Molly Shattuck has been granted a quick divorce and the legal documents immediately sealed. Molly Shattuck, a former NFL cheerleader and mother-of-three, has been charged with rape after allegedly performing oral sex on a 15-year-old boy. Her ex-husband is Mayo Shattuck, the current chairman of energy provider Exelon. Mr Shattuck filed for divorce against his wife on October 6 after rumors about his wife's inappropriate liaisons ran wild in the close-knit, upscalle community of Owings Mills, Maryland, 11 News reported. Scroll down for video . Molly Shattuck, a former Baltimore Ravens cheerleader, and her estranged husband Mayo with their three children. He filed for divorce against his wife after allegations about her sexual assaults of a 15-year-old boy began to circulate . Molly Shattuck (above), 47, has been charged with rape after allegedly performing oral sex on a minor . Less than a month later, on November 3, Mr Shattuck was granted a divorce by a court in Baltimore County on the same day his wife was indicted by grand jury in Delaware. The billionaire businessman was able to obtain a divorce faster than is normally possible in Maryland, 11 News reported, as it typically takes at least three months for uncontested proceedings. Shattuck had been separated from 60-year-old Mayo Shattuck III. The couple have three children - Spencer, 15, Lillian, 11, and Wyatt, 8. Disgraced Shattuck was indicted last week on two counts of third-degree rape, four counts of unlawful sexual contact and three counts of providing alcohol to minors. She has resigned from her job on the board of the Baltimore School for the Arts in Maryland. The 47-year-old allegedly became involved with the teenage boy in May this year when Shattuck posted a compliment on a photo of the teen on Instagram. The victim replied with a private message of thanks, but Shattuck's son then forwarded his mother's cell phone number, saying: ‘You should text my Mom, she is obsessed with you,’ according to court records. The pair first met a month later while the teen was visiting a friend in her neighborhood, reports DelawareOnline. Billionaire business executive Mayo Shattuck III, 60, the current chairman of energy provider Exelon, divorced his wife at the start of the month . The meeting ended with a hug but no other physical contact between the 47-year-old and 15-year-old boy, court records said. The pair started to meet for make-out sessions in Shattuck’s Cadillac Escalade. Court records revealed that a meeting at an AMC movie theater was followed by another in a school parking lot. Shattuck, 47, pictured in her police mugshot last week . In July, Shattuck picked the teenager up from summer school ‘five or six times’ at lunchtime and they would ‘talk and eat and then get in the back of the car and kiss or make out,’ police said. It was during one of these incidents that Shattuck allegedly touched the teenager's penis. ‘Between their encounters, Shattuck asked for pictures via text message’ and he would send pictures of himself shirtless and one in his underwear, the victim told police. For Labor Day weekend Shattuck took her children and some of their friends - including the victim - to stay at a rented beach house in Bethany Beach. 'Sometime around 2am on Sunday morning, they drove to a liquor store and (Molly) Shattuck purchased a 12-pack of Miller Lite and a 12-pack of Bud Light for them,' state the court documents. Once back at the house, Shattuck is alleged to have performed oral sex on the boy at least twice - first outside the home while walking the dog and then again in her bedroom. The documents state '(the boy) described the undergarments (Molly) Shattuck was wearing when he entered her bedroom.' Shattuck is alleged to told the boy 'if he wanted to have sex she would. The boy opted out. He decided to leave. At that point, she told him to come back later but he did not go back.' The next day the boy's father collected him. Shattuck is also alleged to have sent the teen pictures through Instagram of him taken at the beach over the Labor Day weekend. On September 26, the boy's family reported Shattuck to the police who executed a search warrant at her $2.5 million home on October 1. For Labor Day weekend Shattuck rented this beach house in Bethany Beach where she is alleged to have plied her 15-year-old victim with beer before performing oral sex on him at least twice . Shattuck tweeted about her trip to Bethany Beach over the Labor Day weekend where she took her children and some of their friend - including the alleged victim . The search warrant led investigators to seize her cell phone and her computer. Two days later, Delaware State Police became involved due to the seriousness of the allegations. On September 29, Molly Shattuck separately filed for divorce but whether she knew the investigation was underway is unclear. Detectives also specifically sought a pink lace bra and panties that the victim described her as wearing in the bedroom of her beach house. The grand jury indictment against Shattuck reveals that the two counts of rape in the third degree are for 'putting her mouth on his penis'. There four counts of unlawful sexual contact in the second degree are 'touching his penis,' causing or allowing the teen to 'touch her breasts with his mouth,' causing or allowing the teen to 'touch her vagina with his hand,' and for causing or allowing the teen to 'touch her vagina with his penis.' The three counts of providing alcohol to minors are for providing alcohol to three different minors. Shattuck appeared in court last week where she pleaded not guilty to the charges. She was released on $84,000 bond after an arraignment on Wednesday at Sussex County Superior Court in Georgetown, Delaware. The indictment from the grand jury was also sealed, 11 News reported. In 2005, Baltimore native Shattuck became the oldest NFL cheerleader in history up to that time when the Ravens selected her for the squad on her first tryout. She cheered for two years and was a part-time coach for six more years. Shattuck was a fitness consultant and advocate and published a book in February called Vibrant Living .

"With streets and Tube trains packed with workers and tourists jostling for space, central London can be anything but relaxing. But an oasis of calm away from packed public transport could soon be on its way with a piece of countryside set to land on the River Thames. Thomas Heatherwick, the creator of the London 2012 Olympic cauldron, has unveiled plans for a £60million bridge full of trees and flower beds to span the river from Temple to the South Bank. It would be the first new crossing across the Thames since the 'wobbly' Millennium Bridge opened in 2002 and London's answer to New York's High Line, where a disused train line has been transformed into a lush aerial park. A computer-generated image shows how a garden bridge across the River Thames could look. Olympic cauldron designer Thomas Heatherwick is looking for backing for the £60million project . The bridge would link Temple to the South Bank, with pedestrians enjoying stunning views of St Paul's Cathedral and the City of London to the east . The project, which is being developed with engineering firm Arup, will go ahead only if Heatherwick can raise money from private backers and will not receive public funds. It could open as soon as 2016 and give stunning views along the river of St Paul's Cathedral and the City of London to the east. He told the Evening Standard: 'The idea is simple - to connect north and south London with a garden.' The design was the result of a Transport for London tender to find ways of improving travel for those on foot. It is hoped that cycle lanes would be improved on nearby Waterloo and Blackfriars bridges if pedestrians opt for the new walkway. The idea of garden bridge across the river has long been backed by actress Joanna Lumley. She told the Daily Telegraph: 'This . garden will be sensational in every way: a place with no noise or . traffic where the only sounds will be birdsong and bees buzzing and the . wind in the trees, and below the steady rush of water. Thomas Heatherwick, left, has found a celebrity supporter for the garden bridge in Joanna Lumley, right . 'It will be the slowest way to cross the river, as people will dawdle and lean on parapets and stare at the great cityscapes all around; but it will also be a safe and swift way for the weary commuter to make his way back over the Thames. 'I believe it will bring to Londoners and visitors alike peace and beauty and magic.' Isabel Dedring, London's deputy mayor for transport, told the Evening Standard: 'The mayor has been keen to find an iconic piece of green infrastructure . that can symbolise London as a high quality of life place to live. 'It is a great example of a project where in our view there doesn’t need . to be a major public contribution. But if private sector funding isn’t . forthcoming then the project isn’t going to be able to go ahead.' Thomas Heatherwick also designed the cauldron for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games . Heatherwick also designed new Routemaster buses for London, which were nicknamed 'cauldron on wheels' following air-conditioning problems in the heatwave . Heatherwick has previously designed state-of-the-art Routemasters for the capital, which were dubbed 'cauldrons on wheels' earlier this month after temperatures soared to 30C onboard because of faulty air-conditioning. The Olympic Cauldron was made of 204 petals each engraved with the name of a participating country, which were presented to the nations following the closing ceremony of the Paralympics in September. Heatherwick was awarded the CBE in January for services to the design industry.","Thomas Heatherwick is searching for private funding for the garden bridge .

"A Nantucket woman who killed her three-year-old daughter because she thought the girl was possessed by the devil was found not criminally responsible because of mental illness. Dora Tejada, 28, was found not guilty by a judge today in Nantucket Superior Court and instead committed to a state mental health institution for six months of observation and treatment. She will be re-evaluated after that to determine whether she should stay in custody or be released with conditions. Tejada, a housecleaner originally from . El Salvador, suffocated three-year-old Nicole Garcia inside their home . in March 2011, authorities said. Suffering bipolar: Dora Tejada (pictured at court) all concluded that her extreme bipolar disorder and psychosis left her unable to understand her actions . Tejada told investigators God told her to push a rose in the girl's throat to exorcise the devil. Tejada also shoved her fist down the . girl's throat, police said. A medical examiner determined that the cause . of death was homicidal asphyxia. Three forensic psychologists hired by the defense, prosecution and the court to evaluate Tejada all concluded that her extreme bipolar disorder and psychosis left her unable to understand her actions and conform her behavior to the law on the day she killed her daughter, the Cape Cod Times reported. 'Usually, with a lack of criminal responsibility, you don't get three experts that agree,' James Caramanica, Tejada's lawyer, said outside court after the verdict. 'But this case was so clear to everyone involved.' Found not guilty: Dora Tejada was found not guilty by a judge Wednesday in Nantucket Superior Court (pictured) and ordered committed to a state mental health institution . Prosecutors did not challenge the decision. 'All . the evidence - the testimony, the physical evidence, everything - it . all supported the experts' finding in this case,' Assistant District . Attorney Sharon Thibeault said . During . the three-day trial, friends and relatives described Tejada as a loving . and responsible mother whose religious convictions increased after she . attended a retreat about a week before the killing. One . psychologist also noted that Tejada had suffered from chronic . depression for about a decade and had a traumatic childhood in El . Salvador. Police were . called to the house of Pleitez in March, 2011, who told authorities the . Holy Spirit can speak through her, and found Nicole lying on a table . inside. Discovered: Police found Nicole lying on a table inside the Nantucket house . Pleitez originally told police she fell from a sofa in her home in Massachusetts  with . Nicole whilst asleep and woke up to people asking if anybody had hurt . her daughter. She sang and prayed while being questioned, and when left alone . in the interview room she assumed a crucifixion pose for several . minutes, police said. But she was taken to hospital after investigators saw skin hanging off of her hand. Pleitez then said during treatment that she stuck a rose down her . daughter's throat to rid her of demons because God told her to do it, according to court records. However she later explained to her pastor Carlos Patiño Villa that the . rose was actually her fist and the devil bit her hand through . Nicole, investigators said. Pink roses and rose petals were allegedly found on the floor of the home's living . room and her son may have also been in danger, reported the Cape Cod . Times. She said through a Spanish translator that she had ‘thought about . fighting the demons out of both children and that at one point had a . child in each arm’.","Dora Tejada suffocated the three-year-old by pushing a rose down her throat to 'exorcise the devil'

Hilarious footage of the 23-year-old being shut out of playing by the 38-year-old NFL legend was broadcast to a sympathetic nation on Sunday.

Osweiler turns to see Manning running out to marshal his troops - like he does every Sunday . Oh man.........The realization that Manning will never yield to him, despite throwing the Broncos to a 31 point victory dawns on Osweiler . However, in a split second his face becomes a picture as he turns to see the older man running onto the field causing him to raise his other arm in total exasperation. At that priceless moment, Osweiler probably realized why Manning has in excess of 1,000 career touchdowns and is widely regarded as one of the best quarterbacks of all time. However, it wasn't all that bad for Osweiler. Probably protecting his ageing frame, Manning did let the younger man take to field in the fourth quarter. However, whereas Manning finished with 31-of-44 completions for 340 yards and five TDs, Osweiler came on for two of five passes for a grand total of 13 yards. Am I ever gonna get a go?

"A teenage girl suffered a horrific allergic reaction to heartburn tablets that left her skin falling off 'in chunks'. Leanne Howes, 17, was given just 10 per cent chance of survival after suffering a one-in-a-million allergic reaction to widely available Zantac tablets. The potentially fatal condition - Stevens-Johnson syndrome - gripped her entire body, causing her skin to burn up, scab over and fall off. Leanne Howes, 17, was given just 10 per cent chance of survival after suffering a one-in-a-million allergic reaction to Zantac heartburn tablets . The trainee hairdresser took a 150mg dose of Zantac Ranitidine prescribed by her doctor to treat Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) The trainee hairdresser, from Hoveton, Norwich, developed the syndrome after taking a 150mg dose of Zantac Ranitidine prescribed by her doctor to treat Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). The illness left her in hospital for weeks while it ran its devastating course. Zantac Ranitidine is available in tablet, . injection and syrup form. It is widely available to buy off the shelf . in supermarkets and chemists across the UK. Miss Howes' nightmare began in September 2013 when she suddenly fell ill. Initially, she believed she was suffering from heat rash, but became worried as an itchy, red rash spread across her entire body and her skin broke out in blisters the size of tennis balls. Miss Howes developed the potentially fatal condition Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The condition gripped her entire body, causing her skin to burn up, scab over and fall off . Miss Howes had initially believed she was suffering from heat rash, but was horrified as an itchy, red rash spread across her entire body and her skin broke out in blisters the size of tennis balls . She said: 'I'd not felt very well at work, so I went to the chemist to pick up some tablets. 'Once I got home, I was fine, but when I woke up the next morning, I was tired and nauseous. 'And then when I looked in the mirror, I saw that I had a terrible rash.' Worried, Miss Howes and her boyfriend, car salesman Jake Round, 25, drove to her mother's house, where her condition rapidly worsened. Stevens . Johnson Syndrome (SJS) is a severe adverse reaction to a medication. It . was named after two U.S paediatricians who described it in 1922. It affects around two people per million and is more common among women. Symptoms include skin rashes, blisters in the mouth, ears and nose and swelling of the eyelids. If left untreated the condition can result in death. Possible complications include permanent blindness and lung damage. Once diagnosed doctors will immediately stop the patient taking the offending drug. Treatment . includes IV fluids and high calorie formulas  to promote healing. Antibiotics are given when necessary to prevent secondary infections . such as sepsis. Pain medications such as morphine can make the patient . more comfortable. During the night, blisters formed inside her throat and on her tongue and she woke up the next morning struggling to breathe. With blisters covering the soles of her feet, Miss Howes was forced to crawl to the bathroom and attempt to call for help. Her terrified mother, retail manager Amanda Corley, 38, found her lying on the bathroom floor and the teenager was rushed to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital. Doctors immediately gave her morphine and applied soothing cream to her face and chest. But her skin began to fall off on a doctor's fingertips as he examined her. Over the next few days, she lost most of the surface of her face. Parts of her chest, arms, back and stomach also fell away. Miss Howes said: 'I thought I was going to die. 'I couldn't move, and my face was so swollen that my eyes had fused shut. 'Everywhere was itching, and my skin was weeping a thick, yellow pus. 'I had agonising blisters the size of tennis balls, and was slipping in and out of consciousness. 'When I came round the next day, my mum told me that doctors had said if I got through the night, it would be a miracle. I was just so happy to be alive.' Once it strikes, there is no way to stop Stevens-Johnson syndrome, so Miss Howes had to fight for her life as the condition ran its course. Sufferers are treated in the same way as burns victims and are given pain relief and fluid replacement. Doctors worked around the clock to make her skin function normally again. She spent the next four weeks on a morphine drip in hospital, unable to walk or talk properly. She was so weak that she had to use a wheelchair. Her hair, nails, eyelashes and eyebrows fell out and at 5ft tall, her weight plummeted from 7st to a dangerous 5st 10lbs.

Her hair, nails, eyelashes and eyebrows fell out and at 5ft tall, her weight plummeted from 7st to a dangerous 5st 10lbs . She had to be fed through a tube, and doctors covered her entire body in petroleum jelly up to three times a day. Her mother, Amanda, and boyfriend Jake took it in turns to stay by her bedside as she recovered. Miss Howes was finally discharged in October 2013, but back at home she was forced to come to terms with her new appearance. She said: 'I'd always been proud of the way I looked. Miss Howes with her grandfather, Lesley before the allergic reaction. She said: 'I now realise how lucky I am to be alive' 'I liked taking care of myself, and I followed all of the latest fashion trends . 'Losing my hair, eyelashes and nails was devastating, but Jake tells me that I am beautiful all of the time, which really helps. 'When I look back at the pictures of me in hospital I can't believe it's me. I look like a monster from a Halloween movie. 'I now realise how lucky I am to be alive.'

Today Miss Howes suffers from dry, bumpy skin and has to take eye drops twice a day as the condition scarred her tear ducts, leaving her with watery eyes. Stevens-Johnson syndrome is incurable and 40 per cent of people who contract the condition do not survive. Doctors say it is likely that Miss Howes will have another severe reaction if she ever takes Ranitidine again. The terrifying incident has left Miss Howes (pictured with boyfriend Jake, mother Amanda and her boyfriend) too frightened to take other medication such as paracetamol in fear of another reaction . The terrifying incident has even left her too frightened to take other medication such as paracetamol in fear of another reaction. She said: 'I'm absolutely terrified to take any more medication now. 'I'm so scared it will happen again and I might not be as lucky.' Dr Clive Grattan, an expert Dermatology consultant at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, said: 'At its worst, the condition can be lethal. And the reaction is often completely unexpected. Stevens-Johnson syndrome is an extremely rare condition - around one in a million people will experience this kind of reaction. Doctors say it's likely that Miss Howes will have another severe reaction if she ever takes Ranitidine again . 'Scientists are still trying to confirm how it happens, but it is believed that the immune system releases chemicals in reaction to the triggering medication, and this causes damage to the outer layer of the skin.' A spokesperson for GSK Pharmaceuticals which produces Zantac said: 'We deeply sympathise with anyone suffering from SJS. 'We are committed to the highest standards of patient safety, and as such take reports of side effects very seriously. We have a robust and ongoing safety monitoring system for all of our medicines. 'If a patient has concerns or experiences side effects relating to any medicines, they should talk to their doctor, pharmacist or nurse as soon as possible.'","Leanne Howes took 150mg dose of Zantac Ranitidine to treat her IBS .

She said: ‘The most difficult part of my recovery was having to go around in a wheelchair, and even when I could walk, for a year even simple tasks made me very tired. ‘But I suppose the most long-standing difficulty I have is fear of roads - and though I'm doing better now, I still get frightened crossing them or being in a car on tight roads. ‘Daniele and I have decided to stay engaged until we recover, as it threw our jobs, plans and savings into the air. So while it is still our plan to get married, we won't be setting a date for now.’ Wreckage: Miss Strutt's bicycle is pictured under the lorry that injured her while she cycling to work at the Royal Acore School near Milan in May 2011.

"A suspected American member of Islamic State has been arrested at JFK airport amid fears he may be trafficking guns to the terrorist group and preparing for jihad. FBI agents swooped on Donald Ray Morgan, 44, after he arrived in New York on August 2 following an eight-month stay in Lebanon where his wife lives, the New York Daily News reports. A Brooklyn judge ordered the 44-year-old be held without bail following allegations he had been brokering deals for military-grade weapons and ammunition in his home state. Swoop: FBI agents arrested Donald Ray Morgan, 44, as he arrived at JFK airport in New York following an eight-month stay in Lebanon where his wife lives . Morgan, from North Carolina, was indicted for being a felon in possession of a firearm. He has a previous conviction for firing a gun. Counter-terrorism agents were alerted to a series of worrying twitter posts made by Morgan while in the Middle East under the alias Abu Omar al Amreeki. Tweeting under the alias alias Abu Omar al Amreeki, Morgan is understood to have pledged his allegiance to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi . In one post he pledged his allegiance to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Others appear to suggest he had been preparing for jihad in Syria, Iraq or possibly the U.S. At a bail hearing last week Assistant Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Nadia Moore suggested Morgan was too dangerous to return to North Carolina on his own. She told Brooklyn Federal Court: 'It’s possible that he traffics in guns to people in this organization (ISIS)', the New York Daily News reports. Federal defender Peter Kirchheimer argued that there was no evidence to prove that Morgan was either a member of ISIS or had provided the group with material support. But judge Ramon Reyes said the tweets had implied to him that Morgan is 'trying to go to Syria or Iraq as the next step and trying to be actively engaged'. ISIS, which is now known as Islamic State, currently controls a large area of Iraq. It has gained a reputation for appalling brutality after videos appeared on the internet of fighters performing mass executions and crucifixions.

After numerous trips to different doctors, medics realised that the large, open wound was caused by the cowpox virus – a virus so rare that many doctors have never come across it. A Dutch teenager has been infected with an incredibly rare virus - the cowpox virus - after attempting to rescue a drowning kitten. Cowpox is only found in Europe - mainly in the UK . The teenager developed a wound on her wrist shortly after coming into contact with the kitten which died shortly afterwards, Live Science reports. It slowly blistered before turning black. At the same time, she also developed uncomfortable red lumps which spread the whole way up and down her arm. When the teenager first sought medical help, doctors assumed that the wound was infected with bacteria so prescribed her antibiotics but this did not help. The patient, whose case was reported in the British Medical Journal Case Reports, then developed a fever so went to hospital. ‘When I saw the wound, I expected it to be a normal wound, so I was quite surprised when I saw the big ulcer,’ Dr Jojanneke Heidema, a specialist in pediatric infectious disease at St Antonius Ziekenhuis Hospital in Nieuwegein, Netherlands, told Live Science. The 17-year-old developed a blackened wound on her wrist after picking up a dying kitten from a ditch. Doctors initially thought it was caused by a bacterial infection but it failed to respond to antibiotics . ‘It did not look like a normal bacterial infection, so I went looking for other causes of a necrotic ulcer [a wound with dead tissue].’ The teenager’s doctors started to suspect that the problem could be caused by the cowpox virus so they contacted a virologist who was able to test for the virus. Cowpox is a skin disease caused by the cowpox virus. It manifests itself in the form of red blisters which are transmitted from infected animals to humans. It is similar to, but more mild than, smallpox and it was the basis for the first smallpox vaccines. Humans usually only become infected after contact with an infected cat or rodent. The disease tends to remain localised and is self-limiting. However, in patients with a suppressed immune system, it can be fatal. It is only found in Europe - mainly in the UK - and infection is very rare. Infections are most commonly seen in the autumn and are usually from domestic cats. These tests revealed that the cowpox virus was indeed responsible. Cowpox is a self-limiting disease so the teenager did not require treatment. She started to get better a week after her diagnosis and the ulcer healed completely within two months. However, she has been left with a scar. Doctors believe that she contracted the disease, which is extremely rare, because she had a cut her wrist before she picked up the kitten. However, it is also possible to be infected with the virus without having a cut. Cowpox is a skin disease caused by the cowpox virus.

"Hillary Rodham Clinton returned to Iowa for the first time since her failed 2008 presidential campaign on Sunday in an high-profile appearance that drove speculation about another White House bid into overdrive. The former New York senator and first lady did not directly address any potential campaign, but admitted she was ‘thinking about it.’ 'It's true, I am thinking about it. But today, that is not why I'm here. I'm here for the steak,' she joked. Scroll down for video . Hillary Rodham Clinton returned to Iowa for the first time since her failed 2008 presidential campaign on Sunday, but once again refused to confirm if she is planning to stand in 2016 race . 'I'm here for the steak': Former Sec. of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, former President Bill Clinton and U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin work the grill during Harkin's annual fundraising Steak Fry in Indianola, Iowa, on Sunday . 'Hello Iowa. I'm back!' Clinton declared as she took the podium at retiring Sen. Tom Harkin's annual steak fry fundraiser, a fixture on the political calendar in the home of the nation's first presidential caucus. Clinton joined her husband, former President Bill Clinton, in a tribute to Harkin that brought them before about 10,000 party activists who form the backbone of Iowa's presidential campaigns every four years. The couple arrived as anticipation builds over the possibility of another Hillary Clinton presidential campaign in 2014. She told Democrats that voters face a choice between ‘the guardians of gridlock’ and those who push for shared opportunity and prosperity. Later she said that 'too many people only get excited about presidential campaigns. Look - I get excited about presidential campaigns, too.' But she said the upcoming midterm elections would be pivotal for the state's voters. 'In just 50 days Iowans have a choice to make - a choice and a chance. A choice between the guardians of gridlock and the champions of shared opportunity and shared prosperity,' she said, urging voters to elect leaders who would 'carry on Tom Harkin's legacy of fighting for families.' The couple arrived at Sunday's event as anticipation builds over the possibility of another Hillary Clinton presidential campaign in 2014 . Both Bill and Hillary Clinton appeared at the Democrat campaign event which paid tribute to retiring Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin at his final steak fry fundraiser . Following a summertime book tour, Clinton was making her biggest campaign splash in 2014 so far, opening a fall of fundraising and campaigning for Democrats who are trying to maintain a Senate majority during President Barack Obama's final two years. The event also served as a farewell for Harkin, a liberal stalwart and former presidential candidate who is retiring after four decades in Congress. Obama defeated Clinton in the state's leadoff presidential caucuses in January 2008, and the former secretary of state has not returned since. Iowa Democrats said Clinton remained widely popular and predicted she would receive broad support if she chooses to run again. ‘Barack Obama was a phenomenon. He just was. I'll give him credit, he worked hard in Iowa, but so did she,’ Harkin said, when asked if Clinton would do things differently in Iowa if she runs in 2016. ‘I don't think she ran a bad campaign at all. I just think Obama was on a roll.’ The hotly-contested 2008 caucus created a record turnout of more than 239,000 Iowans, far above the 124,000 who participated in 2004.

Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton poses for a photo with a supporter at the 37th Harkin Steak Fry in Indianola, Iowa, on Sunday . The Clintons' arrival offered the possibility of a fresh start for the former New York senator and first lady, whose campaign stumbled in the months leading up to the caucuses. Anti-war activists opposed her vote to authorize the Iraq war in 2002 and coalesced around Obama, who had opposed the war as an Illinois state senator. Clinton was often insulated by a large entourage in a state where face-to-face retail politics has long been a hallmark of campaigns. Clinton, who has conferred with Iowa Democrats in recent days, would enter a presidential campaign with a large advantage over potential rivals. Early polls have shown her leading other Democrats by wide margins, including Vice President Joe Biden and Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. Biden is traveling to Des Moines next week and has not closed the possibility of another campaign while O'Malley has made several visits to the state and dispatched staffers to Iowa this fall. Harkin's final steak fry was expected to be the largest since Hillary Clinton's last appearance in 2007, when she was joined by Obama, Biden and other Democrats running for president. Bill Clinton has appeared at the event three previous times. Clinton told Democrats that voters face a choice between ‘the guardians of gridlock’ and those who push for shared opportunity and prosperity. Hillary Rodham Clinton returned to Iowa for the first time since her failed 2008 presidential campaign, right, while husband Bill had sought Senator Harkin's support back in 1992, left . It was also serving as a pep rally as Democrats try to hold onto Harkin's seat. Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley faces Republican state Sen. Joni Ernst in one of the nation's most competitive Senate campaigns. Clinton is also expected to make the case for Staci Appel, a Democrat running in an open congressional seat against Republican David Young. No woman has ever been elected to Congress or governor in Iowa. Clinton has said she expects to decide on another campaign early next year. The Clintons were attending a private reception for Harkin at Principal Park, the home of Des Moines' minor league baseball team, before traveling to the hot-air balloon field where the senator has held the fundraiser since the early 1990s. The Clintons count Harkin and his wife, Ruth, as longtime friends. Harkin was a vocal supporter of Bill Clinton during the impeachment crisis and Hillary Clinton served alongside Harkin for nearly a decade. Bill Clinton faced Harkin in the 1992 presidential primaries but never competed in Iowa. The candidates bypassed the state because of the Iowa senator's role. Ready for Hillary, a super PAC laying the groundwork for a Clinton campaign, plans to be visible at the steak fry, handing out T-shirts and signing up volunteers.","Hillary Clinton returned to Iowa for the first time since her failed 2008 presidential campaign on Sunday .

"Southern Charm star Jenna King is in for a reality check. Recently split with wealthy 55-year-old real estate mogul, Lou, Jenna’s now proclaiming her undying love for 30-year-old bad boy Ronald ‘Ronnie’ Radke. 'You are my end game! I love you, I love you, I really f***ing love you,’ gushed Jenna, who is following Radke to Belgium to see him perform at Groezrock Music Festival on May 3. Danger: '[I am] in fear for any other woman involved with him,' Sally Watts tells MailOnline of Jenna's new boyfriend - Sally's ex - in an exclusive interview . Nightmare:  'May 1, 2012. This was taken in fear, but is now shared to offer hope,' Sally Watts writes in the caption of her photo showing a nasty black eye that resulted in Radke's arrest. 'You are never alone. There's always a way out' But ‘bad boy’ may be an understatement.‘It is now nearly two years since I went to the police to report the domestic abuse I suffered by Radke I am terrified by what I know he is capable of doing to another woman,’ Sally Watts exclusively tells MailOnline of her ex. While Lou was a respected businessman who could whisk 29-year-old Jenna around the world on private jets and keep her clothed in Chanel and Gucci, Radke the lead vocalist of rock band Falling in Reverse, offers up a dark past, including a history of domestic violence, drug addiction and a stint in jail for his involvement in a brutal 2006 murder. The singer was arrested at his home in Glendale, Calif., for reportedly physically attacking his then girlfriend, Sally, 30. In a shocking photo Sally posted to Twitter on the night of the alleged assault, she has a nasty black eye. Sally wrote: ‘May 1, 2012. This was taken in fear, but is now shared to offer hope. You are never alone. There’s always a way out.’ A step down: 'Just sittin on a stoop with my mannnnnnn' writes Jenna. She split with wealthy Lou and took up with Ronnie, but does she care about dark past? Glendale police sergeant Tom Lorenz revealed that on the night in question Sally had accused Radke of cheating on her. Among other allegations, Sally told authorities that she had ‘her hair pulled by Mr. Radke and had her head and face forced down into the floor,’ reports Lorenz. So far, Radke has managed to avoid facing the judge in the disturbing case. ‘The case is still pending in the LA criminal court, as he continues to postpone each pretrial,’Sally tells MailOnline . She alleges that the singer has used this time to continue his campaign of making her life a living hell. ‘While he has been permitted to keep touring and recording, (in one song he even makes defamatory claims about me and outlines the event very untruthfully), the postponements have never allowed me any peace or sense of justice,’ she says. ‘They keep me emotionally bound, and the trauma still haunts me and impacts my life, every single day.’ Worse, Radke’s followers have been just as relentlessly unforgiving. ‘I have been invalidated, harassed and threatened by his fans after he has provoked them with his lies about me, and in fear for any other woman involved with him,’ Sally reveals. Busted: Radke was arrested for domestic abuse against Sally Watts on May 1, 2012. The case is still pending in the LA criminal court . After the vicious fight with Sally, Radke moved on with a new girlfriend and eventual fiancée, Crissy Henderson. Sadly, it seems she also may have had a volatile relationship with Radke, and Sally reached out to the L.A.-based model and actress via Twitter this past December. ‘A big help in my recovery was [Sally Watts] and I didn’t deserve her grace,’ Crissy wrote. ‘I was led to believe she was a monster & liar…’ Crissy also hinted: ‘I speak in truth and I’ll never be silent to protect someone who commits a crime,’ she insisted. ‘Esp when it involves putting your hands on a female.’ In a twist that puts Southern Charm resident bad boy Thomas Ravenel to shame, Radke reportedly cheated on Crissy while she was carrying their child, a girl they named Willow, born in June 2013. Not long after, he officially moved on with Southern Charm reality star Jenna, who seems completely blinded by her love for Radke — she’s gone as far as getting his zodiac sign, the Sagittarius archer, tattooed on her hand for him. ‘I can’t comment on [Radke and Jenna’s] relationship other than hope they’re happy,’ is all Crissy would say about her ex on tumblr. ‘I love my child and that’s my focus. Being a good mom. Arrested development: This time, Radke was arrested not for beating his girlfriend, but a fan. He supposedly threw four mic stands into the crowd at the band¿s show at Six Flags in New Jersey and split open a girl¿s head and broke her hand . Unfortunately, cheating is the least of Radke’s sketchy history. In May 2006, while Jenna was attending Trident Technical College in Charleston, South Carolina, Radke was across the country in Las Vegas and became involved in a spat that would result in the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Cook. The trouble started when the singer’s longtime friend and former Escape the Fate band mate, Max Green, had a silly MySpace miscommunication with a fan, who felt he had slighted her. ‘I always stick up for Max, he’s a smaller guy, and I’d always be his bigger brother, you know, people would have to come through me first to get to him,’ explained Radke. ‘But [brothers Michael and Marcel Colquitt, who had been threatening to beat up Greene for offending their female friend] started calling me and harassing me, saying they were going to come to my house and murder me. Then they started calling me “pussy” and this and that if I don’t show up to fight them.’ Baby mama: Actress Crissy Henderson, who was engaged to Radke and had his baby, thought Sally was just a scorned woman. But she says Sally was a big help in her recovery from her dysfunctional relationship with the rocker. 'I didn't deserve her grace,' Crissy says. Both sides got their gangs of friends together and met up to settle their differences. ‘…From there you see where it went — it turned into something bigger than it was,’ said Green not long after the deadly incident. ‘The next thing we hear, people are dead.’ Radke’s friend Chase Rader reportedly ended up shooting and killing Cook during the fight Radke helped organize in a desert lot located in northwestern Las Vegas. In January, 2008, the singer pleaded guilty to a single charge of battery with substantial bodily harm and a judge sentenced him to pay over $92,000 in restitution to Cook’s mother, Ceda Freeman, and serve five years’ probation as well as a stint in drug and alcohol rehab. ‘I don’t think probation is good enough for him,’ said Freeman at the time. ‘He has absolutely destroyed my family.’ The new Kimye: Jenna dubs the new couple Radking on instagram. Radke admits that the murder that resulted from the brawl he helped organize 'has changed my life in every possible way¿ and ¿will haunt me forever' It didn’t take long for Radke to have another run-in with the law. Three months after his sentencing, Radke failed to check in with a probation officer and officially became a fugitive for nearly eight weeks. According to U.S. Marshals, Radke used his influence as a rocker in a sinister way. Officials say he stayed on the lam for so long by getting money and other aid from his devoted friends and fans. He was sent to High Desert State Prison after the Nevada Parole and Probation Department put him on the news and the public helped hunt him down. Tat's amore: Jenna and Radke got zodiac tatoo's together, she got his sign and he got hers . ‘That guy is not one to think before he acts,’ said band mate Green, adding that Radke had ‘done a lot of bad things to a lot of people.’ The musician noted that the majority of the money Radke got at the time ‘went to drugs,’ adding that ‘jail is the best place for him...’ During an October 2008 interview from the Nevada prison where he spent over two years serving time, Radke admitted he was to blame for all the problems he had encountered over the previous years. ‘I deserve to be in here for the things I’ve done to other people,’ he confessed. ‘That’s my karma man.’ The question now is whether Radke’s bad karma will affect Jenna’s fate, too.","Falling in Reverse rocker Ronnie Radke is reality star Jenna King's new squeeze.

"San Francisco 49ers defensive lineman Ray McDonald will not be charged with assaulting his pregnant fiancée, the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office said Monday. The decision ends a nearly 10-week investigation of the eight-year National Football League veteran by San Jose police detectives and prosecutors from the District Attorney's Office. 'After our thorough review of all the facts, we do not have evidence sufficient to convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. McDonald committed a crime,' District Attorney Jeff Rosen said in a statement. Scroll down for video . San Francisco 49ers' Ray McDonald pictured during an NFL football game against the Dallas Cowboys in Arlington, Texas in September . Both the 49ers and the NFL declined to suspend McDonald during the police investigation into the Aug. 31 incident, deciding to let the legal process play out. The incident occurred while McDonald was celebrating his 30th birthday at his home with teammates and friends. 'We have said from the beginning that we will consider the information available, allow the facts to lead to our decisions and respect the judicial process,' the 49ers said in a statement. 'Based on the information available to us and the District Attorney's decision not to file charges, there will be no change in Ray's status with the team.' Conflicting accounts of the incident, the lack of 'verifiable' eyewitnesses and the 'seemingly minor nature' of the injuries led to the decision not the file charges, Rosen said. The NFL has come under fire in recent months over a perception that it deals too lightly with players accused of domestic violence. The league has since strengthened its policies in dealing with players accused of domestic violence, and two top players are hoping to get back on the field. Ray Rice was cut by the Baltimore Ravens and suspended indefinitely by the NFL after video emerged of him punching his then-fiancée in an Atlantic City casino hotel elevator. Former NFL Most Valuable Player Adrian Peterson pleaded no contest last week to a misdemeanor charge of reckless assault for hitting his 4-year-old son with a tree branch. The Rice case is being reviewed by an independent arbitrator, while the league is deciding whether to allow Peterson to return to the Minnesota Vikings.","McDonald won't be charged following the 10-week investigation .

"It’s a habit that divides opinion, but new scientific evidence reveals that chewing gum is actually good for the brain. Chomping away boosts thinking and alertness and the study reveals reaction times among chewers are up to 10 per cent faster. The report will be welcome news to celebrity gum chewers such as football manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who is rarely seen on the touchline without a stick of gum in his mouth. Chomp-ian: Sir Alex Ferguson is rarely seen on the touchline without a stick of gum in his mouth . The Japanese research published in the journal Brain and Cognition suggests as many as eight areas of the brain are affected by the simple act of chewing. One theory to explain the greater performance is that chewing increases arousal and leads to  temporary improvements in blood flow to the brain. Volunteers carried out tasks while chewing and not chewing gum as their brains were scanned to see which areas were active. During the 30-minute tests participants pressed a button with their right or left thumb in response to the direction of an arrow on a screen. Benefits: Chewing gum increases arousal and leads to temporary improvements in blood flow to the brain . Men and women who were not chewing took 545 milliseconds to react, compared with 493 milliseconds among the chewers. The brain regions most active during chewing were those involved with movement and attention. Professor Andy Smith of Cardiff  University, a leading specialist in health-related behaviour, said: ‘The effects of chewing on reaction time are profound. Perhaps football managers arrived at the idea of chewing gum by accident, but they seem to be on the right track.’ ‘Our results suggest that chewing . induced an increase in the arousal level and alertness in addition to an . effect on motor control and, as a consequence, these effects could lead . to improvements in cognitive performance,’ said the researchers from . the National Institute of Radiological Sciences in Japan, and other . centres. However, research carried out last year suggested chewing gum could interfere with short-term memory. Stimulating: Chewing leads to the production of higher levels of insulin, which stimulates areas of the brain .","Tests show that reaction times amongst chewers are faster .

"A British woman was been forced to move home from Australia after discovering she was recorded as a male on her birth registry - and now claims she is technically locked in an 'illegal gay’ marriage. Mother-of-five Kim Walmsley, 49, says her world has been turned upside down after it came to light the registrar wrongly recorded her as a male when she was born in February 1965. Mrs Walmsley says when she first noticed the mistake more than a decade ago when she applied for a full-time Australian visa she 'laughed it off' and thought it would be put right straight away - but after years living in the UK unable to move back she has turned to the Prime Minister for help. Error: Kim Walmsley, 49, disocvered in 2003 that she had been registered as male at birth . Documentation: The details were later amended, but institutions including the Australian immigration office have told her the entry is legally binding - meaning she could not extend her visa . But she was then told the information could not be altered because it is a legal document - which she claims has made her 23-year marriage to husband Jack, 49, invalid. The family, who were living their dream life in Australia, have since been forced to move back to the UK after Mrs Walmsley was unable to renew her passport due to the error. Mrs Walmsley says the cost of the move and the paperwork trying to fight it has cost £150,000 - and the only person left who can help is David Cameron. She said: 'The whole thing is absolutely disgusting. I’ve lived nearly 40 years not realising I was actually registered as a boy and then all of a sudden my whole life fell apart. 'It means my marriage is a complete farce because technically it’s illegal. We had a big white wedding in a church and spent a fortune and it was all for nothing. 'Invalid': A vicar at the church where Mrs Walmsley married told her that the birth certificate error means her wedding is not valid . 'In the eyes of the law we were technically two men marrying and that was against the law at the time'. Following her birth her parents were given a birth certificate correctly stating she was a girl - but it had been wrongly recorded in the register’s office records that she was a male. Mrs Walmsley found out in September 2003 when she ordered a copy of her birth certificate so she could apply for a permanent Australian visa. Although the General Registry Office accepted it was an error they said it was against the law to change it and there was nothing they could do. Mrs Walmsley said: 'Since I found out I have tried everything I can possibly think of to get it changed but it’s like banging your head against a brick wall. 'As far as I know I’m the only person this has happened to and I feel like people don’t understand and nobody wants to help. 'We are a Christian family and it’s a massive problem to me that my marriage is illegal. Wedding: The ceremony marrying Mr and Mrs Walmsley 23 years ago, pictured, is reportedly invalid because of the birth certificate error . Marriage: According to church experts, the marriage recorded in the above certificate is not valid due to the error . 'I want to marry Jack again as husband and wife but how can I when I’m still classed as a boy? It’s a disgrace. It’s clearly an error but due to statuary rules they won’t change it.' The couple contacted five different solicitors and spent money on legal fees as well as the cost of moving back to the UK - around £150,000 in total. They were told that their marriage in August 1991 was illegal and they never should have been allowed to wed. A letter from the Archbishop of Canterbury in June last year apparently confirmed that the marriage was invalid in the eyes of the Church. Mrs Walmsley, lives in Liverpool with her husband and their five children Jack, 26, Harry, 24, Jimmy, 23, Charlie, 21, and nineteen-year-old Melissa. She says when the situation become known locally the family have even been the victims of homophobic abuse because of the 'gay marriage'. She said: 'They’d picked up on what was going on and had told other kids at school that their parents were two men, even though I’m quite clearly a woman. 'There was a period of about two weeks when our home was vandalised and the word ""queers"" was painted all over the garage and the garden wall. Vanished dream: The family, pictured above in Australia, say they had to return to the UK because of the mix-up . 'Silly string was sprayed everywhere too and we were so scared we had to put up security cameras. 'We washed the paint off and the cameras stopped them doing it again but we were incredibly embarrassed by the whole thing. 'We live in a small community and we felt really intimidated. I’m worried about the stigma this is giving my kids and I don’t want people thinking I’ve had a sex change. 'Some people might think the kids are adopted and that I’m trying to hide the fact I’m a man. 'My death certificate will say I’m a boy too and so when I’m dead and buried, my family down the line will think there was this huge scandal.' The family, who moved to Australia on a four-year visa in 2004, were forced to move back to the UK a year later after living their dream life in the Gold Coast. Mrs Walmsley said: 'It has always been our dream to move there for as long as I can remember. We finally emigrated on a temporary visa and planned to extend it permanently after that. Birth: The mistake was made almost 50 years ago. Mrs Walmsley is pictured above after her Christening . 'I’d found out the year before we went about the issue with my birth certificate but I didn’t think for a million years it would have any impact on my passport. 'Then, when I saw my passport was due to run out in 2006, I started looking into it. The rules said it is a criminal offence if your circumstances change and you fail to notify the passport office. 'I was terrified of what would happen but I knew I had to tell them. When I explained they said they couldn’t issue me a new one unless I managed to correct the mistake on my birth resigtrar. 'I felt sick with worry and I knew I had to come home to sort it. I thought if I didn’t, I’d end up stranded in Australia or worse, I’d get arrested.' The pair, who had set up a successful magazine business in just three months, were forced to pack their bags and return to the UK after just under a year living down under. Mrs Walmsley said: 'It hit us all really hard when we had to come home. At first I thought maybe I’d get it sorted but that didn’t happen and our temporary visa soon ran out. 'I feel like I’ve been a prisoner in my own country for ten years and I want nothing more than to enjoy a family holiday with my kids. 'We used to love going away together and I feel like this issue has not only affected me but it has deprived my children too. 'I’m not getting any younger and my time is running out. This has to stop.' Mr Walmsley said: 'This has really battered us. We are at breaking point and I don’t know what to do. It’s made a mockery of the whole system and yet a lot of people don’t seem to understand the seriousness of it. Our life in Australia was unbelievable and we’ve lost all that. 'We are a very strong family and I know we can get through anything but this has been difficult for all of us.' Kim’s local MP Bill Esterson has taken on her case and has written to David Cameron asking for her birth entry to be corrected.","Kim Walmsley, 49, was wrongly registered as male when she was born .

"England goalkeeper Joe Hart has promised his 'hungry' team-mates will not surrender their Premier League title without a fight ahead of Sunday's trip to Anfield. City are aiming to bounce back from a disappointing Champions League defeat against Barcelona on Tuesday but can close the gap on Premier League leaders Chelsea to two points by beating Liverpool at lunchtime, with Jose Mourinho's men occupied in the Capital One Cup final. Hart has already won two championship medals with City but says it has done nothing to dampen his desire to collect more despite Chelsea being odds-on favourites to claim the crown in May. Joe Hart is in excellent form and hoping to help Manchester City to defend their Premier League title . Hart rushes out to deny Lionel Messi during the 2-1 Champions League defeat to Barcelona in midweek . 'Chelsea are performing well this season but there are plenty of twists and turns to come. Last weekend (when Chelsea and Burnley drew 1-1) proved that. 'We have had results like that too and it's a damn hard league to win. That's why we are so proud of the two we've won so far and why we want three, four, five. 'People write you off but we have proved them wrong before and we will do it in the Premier League. We are 100% fit with an amazing squad, look at the quality we have in our squad. We are in the right place it's now down to us. Hart saved a crucial penalty to keep City in the tie, and is now turning his attention back to the league . Chelsea dropped points against Burnley last week, and City can further close the gap on Sunday . 'We won't give in, we are here to win and that's all we want to do. It is what we believe in together and we are hungry to try to do that.' Hart has had an outstanding season and signed a new long-term contract after losing his place to Willie Caballero early on. He accepts criticism as part of the job at City and is quick to defend manager Manuel Pellegrini, whose tactics were questioned against Barcelona. 'That's life being at Manchester City. I let a goal in and I'm under pressure. We miss chances and we don't score the lads are under pressure,' he said. Hart believes City have enough quality in their squad to defend the title which they won last May . 'But that's why we are at this club. We aren't here to hide. The manager doesn't want to be manager of this club so he can hide. He fronts it up. 'He has been a great manager for us and will continue to try and win things with us and we want to win things with him.'","Defending champions Manchester City are five points behind Chelsea .

"Spared jail: Natasha Sultan, 21, was today given a supervision order for killing her daughter when she had postnatal depression . A mother who admitted killing her baby daughter while she was 'in a maelstrom of fatigue and mental disorder' caused by postnatal depression has been spared jail. Natasha Sultan, 21, sobbed as she was sentenced today following the death of six-week-old Amelia-Lilly, in October last year. The defendant was due to go on trial for . murder yesterday but the prosecution accepted her guilty plea to a . charge of infanticide. Judge Jeremy Richardson QC told her: 'You are an utterly broken woman who will have to live with this for the remainder of your life, whether it's short or long.' The judge gave her a three year supervision order and added: 'If you should ever have any other children, the social services department will plainly be involved and it may be that you are not permitted to bring up any future child given what has happened.' Hull Crown Court has heard how Amelia-Lilly was taken to hospital from her home in Welton Grove, Hull, on October 8 suffering from a head injury and later died. Sultan eventually admitted inflicting the injury on her daughter and Judge Richardson said he accepted the balance of her mind had been disturbed at the time. The judge told Sultan: 'For the remainder of your life you will have to live with the fact you killed your six-week-old daughter. That burden will never be lifted.' He told the court that Amelia-Lilly was a much wanted child but he said it was 'plain' that following the birth, Sultan suffered from postnatal depression and could not sleep. A psychiatrist said this was a 'moderate form of depression'. The court heard how Sultan went to her GP and was prescribed anti-depressants but she did not take the full dose. 'It seems there was some reluctance to do so based upon a feeling of shame that you were unable to cope as a mother,' Judge Richardson said. 'It is self-evident you were very tired and suffering from the effects of untreated postnatal depression when the events of the night of October 7, 2012 took place. 'You were exhausted by the demands of constant night time care for your baby who at that stage was only six weeks old.' Death: Sultan admitted inflicting the fatal injury on her six-week-old daughter (pictured on the day she was born) but the judge in the case accepted the balance of her mind had been disturbed at the time . The judge said Sultan killed Amelia-Lilly 'by deliberately impacting her head upon a hard surface'. Bereft: Amelia-Lilly's father James Curtis at court today. He found the baby unconscious next to his partner Natasha Sultan when he returned from a night shift . He said: 'During the first feeding session there was a sudden explosion of violence whilst your mind was disturbed.' Judge Richardson told her: 'There will be many parents of infants who appreciate the situation in which you found yourself. The sudden explosion of violence was due to your unbalanced mind derived from postnatal depression. 'What is harder to understand, however, is your conduct afterwards. 'You went to bed having visited serious violence upon your daughter. 'You neglected her obvious and urgent need for medical attention. You simply went to bed.' The judge outlined how Sultan then lied to doctors about what happened and repeatedly lied to investigating police. 'You even went through the charade of endeavouring to show how the accident, as you then called it, might have happened,' he said. The judge went on: 'I also will not lose sight of the fact of your disturbance of mind as revealed in the psychiatric report. 'It is clear you were in a maelstrom of fatigue and mental disorder when you acted as you did throughout the whole episode.' He said the court had heard how Sultan was 'a loving mother who deeply wanted a child and adored your daughter'. The maximum sentence for infanticide is life imprisonment. Judge Richardson said there were no sentencing guidelines to help him or any relevant previous cases on which he could base his sentence. Suspended sentence: A Judge at Hull Crown Court, pictured, decided not to send Harrison to jail . He said he believed the case had 'passed the custody threshold' but he said: 'However, you are an entirely broken woman and your disturbance of mind at the time, coupled with your guilty plea, enables me to take a different course. 'A short prison sentence would be inappropriate. A long prison sentence would be unjust.' The judge barred Sultan from engaging with children in regulated activities and disqualified her from working with children. Sultan was still crying as she left court comforted by family members.","Natasha Sultan fractured the skull of her six-week-old child Amelia-Lilly .

"A 'devoted' son who cared for his elderly mother is believed to have murdered her before killing himself amid fears his own health problems meant he would not have been able to continue looking after her. The bodies of Stephen Dohoney and his mother Ethel, also known as Olwen, were discovered by neighbours at their home in Wythenshawe, Manchester. Mr Dohoney, 55, was found hanged in the attic while his 86-year-old mother's body was discovered in her bed. Stephen Dohoney and his mother Ethel, known as Olwen, who were discovered by a neighbour at their home in Wythenshawe, Manchester . Investigation: Police were today continuing investigations at the house where a son is believed to have murdered the elderly mother he cared for before killing himself in a suspected murder-suicide . Detectives are treating the incident as a murder-suicide and are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths, it is understood. According to reports, former civil servant Mr Dohoney had quit his job to care for his mother full time after she had started to suffer from a number of ailments in recent years. But it is believed he himself had to undergo tests to diagnose a health problem amid fears he might have had cancer. He is said to have snapped over the level of 24/7 care he was providing for his mother at the end terraced home they shared for more than 40 years. Officers were called to the house after a concerned neighbour made the gruesome discovery. A police source said: 'We can’t be sure at the moment but the most likely scenario is that the 55-year-old resident has killed his mother and hanged himself. 'A concerned neighbour has let themselves in to check on them and found this horrific scene. 'The house was secure. There was no sign of a break in.' Scene: Stephen Dohoney was found hanged in the attic while his mother's body was discovered in her bed at their home in Wythenshawe, Manchester . Police were last night standing guard at the door of the neat corner terraced house on a small crescent. Forensic officers could be seen going in and out carrying suitcases and taking photographs inside and outside the property. Nearby resident Lee Gardener, 28, said: 'They were quiet and just went about their own business. There were no arguments or any trouble or anything like that. 'He was very devoted to his mother. It is a real shock' - A nearby neighbour . 'It was just the two of them in the house. She was quite small with permed hair. I did not see him as much but I do not think that he worked. It is just sad and my heart goes out to the family. 'Nobody wants something like this to happen around where they live. I think it is important not to judge because you do not know what goes on behind closed doors. 'We have heard that the man killed his mother then took his own life. It is just a tragedy.' Another neighbour said the Dohoneys had lived in the house since 1972. She added: 'He was very devoted to his mother. It is a real shock.' Neighbour David Gage said: 'It’s a shock. She was a nice lady. She was friendly. 'She only came out of the house about once a month. She had been ill for a long time.' Post-mortems were due to take place today. Discovery: Officers were called to the house after a concerned neighbour made the gruesome discovery . Detective Chief Inspector Colin Larkin said: 'At this time we are making initial enquiries into the death of this man and woman and a post-mortem is yet to take place. 'The community will be understandably concerned therefore we do have extra patrols in the area to offer some reassurance. 'A full investigation into the circumstances surrounding their deaths is now underway.'

"A fire department that sponsors a controversial cull of squirrels in a village in New York State has come under fire from animal rights protestors. The Holley Fire Department, in the Village of Holley, in eastern Orleans County, has been hosting 'Squirrel Slam', an event promoting the hunting of the animals for prizes, for the past six years. This year's event, set to take place on February 16, includes a 14 years and under prize category, a move that has drawn the ire of animal advocates. More than 7,500 people have signed petitions started by animal charity Hand4paws and Texan animal rights activist Julie Gallagher calling for a halt to the event. The annual 'Squirrel Slam' in Holley, NY, has attracted criticism after offering youngsters prizes to kill the woodland animals. File picture . The Hand4paws petition, which will be presented to Mayor John W. Kenney, Jr states: 'With so much controversy surrounding guns, and guns in the hands of children, the public is outraged that this event targets a children’s category that allows a child to take home money for killing squirrels. 'It is a sadistic form of entertainment that is sponsored by the Holley Fire Department. Although it is stated that this event follows all the hunting rules of the state of the New York, it does not mean that just because it is legal, that it is morally right. 'The Holley Fire Department is said to follow federal, state and local standards, and yet it is unreal that they promote such act of violence in the hands of young people or that the whole state of New York finds this event as something that represents their culture and beliefs. The annual cull is in its seventh year and is sponsored by the Holley Fire Department, a volunteer service. File picture . Under New York state regulations, 12-15 year-olds can hunt small game, which includes game birds, small mammals - such as squirrel and rabbit - and reptiles and amphibians. Young hunters must have completed a hunter education course and have a junior hunting license. Hunters aged between 12 and 13 must be accompanied by a parent, legal guardian, or a person who is 21 years or older and fully-licensed and accredited, while 14-15-year-olds youth must be accompanied by an 18-year-old. Hunting with rifles for big game like deer and bear is still prohibited for those under 14 in New York. It continues: 'Just this past December 24, the nation saw the fatal shooting of two firemen in western New York, yet the Holley Fire Department has no respect for those that lost their lives, and continues patronizing this senseless massacre for what they call a ""tradition"".' There is also a Facebook page, 'Stop the 7th Annual ""Hazzard County"" Holley New York Squirrel Hunt' which now has nearly 1,000 followers. The Holley Fire Department is a volunteer organisation and was not available for comment at time of writing. However, the website states that the event follows all the hunting rules of the state of the New York. The website www.holleyfire.com has . recently posted on their website an event that calls for people to . register in the adult and the youth category of the event, although it was today inaccessible.","NY village sparks fury after inviting children under 14 to take part in cull .

"It won't be easy for the families of Newtown, Connecticut, to forget last Friday's horrific events. But a group of cuddly Golden Retrievers are at least providing some comfort to the children and parents heartbroken after days of lingering sadness. The loving dogs - nine in all - have travelled 900 miles from Illinois, where they were sponsored and trained by Lutheran Church Charities and they have been making their way through the close-knit town since Saturday. Scroll down for video . Affection: Maili Pieragostini, 6, front, plays with Golden Retrievers Ruthie and Hannah at Excel Tutoring in Newtown on Tuesday . 'There's such a huge demand,' Dona Martin, coordinator of the charities' K-9 Comfort Dog Ministry, told The Hartford Courant. The dogs are trained to be calm and social and have been offering comfort and solace to those shattered after 20-year-old gunman Adam Lanza stormed Sandy Hook Elementary school on Friday morning, killing 20 children and six school staff. On Tuesday, two of the 'comfort dogs' - Ruthie and Hannah - stopped into Exel Tutoring and cuddled up to Maili Pieragostini, 6, whose little friend Charlotte Bacon, was among the children tragically shot dead in her class. Sad: Maili, pictured, lost her friend, Charlotte Bacon, in Friday's shooting . Comfort: The comfort dogs are provided by the Lutheran Church Charities from Illinois . Grieving: While with the dogs, Maili created a card for her friend Charlotte Bacon, whose life was tragically cut short . While Maili attended a different school, the two girls were good pals and often had play dates together, her mother, Katja, said. The comfort dog ministry program began in 2008 following a shooting at Northern Illinois University. Martin told The Courant the dogs had helped children and adults to deal with several devastating events since then. Most recently, some of the dogs were in New York and New Jersey to comfort people affected by Hurricane Sandy, she said. The charity sent nine of its 50 dogs to the grieving community of Newtown. Playmate: Addison Strychalsky, 2, pictured, plays with Libby, at a memorial for the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims on Tuesday . Touring: The loving pets have been spreading their love around the grieving Newtown community since Saturday . Stay in touch: Each of the nine Golden Retrievers visiting Newtown have Facebook pages so they children they meet can keep in touch . In this case, Martin said, the need was so strong that the dogs and their handlers were split into teams and sent to different areas of the mourning town. Earlier on Tuesday, the dogs visited Newtown High School where they were introduced during a school assembly and given green and white ribbons — the colors of Newtown — to wear in memory of the victims. But it's not just children who benefit from contact with the dogs, which each have a Facebook page for new friends who want to stay in touch. Trained: The animals are trained to provide comfort and solace after tragedies and disasters such as Friday's shooting . Helping paws: They will be in town until the weekend but will come back if needed . Teams: The need is so great in Newtown that the dogs and their handlers have split into teams to help more people . According to Martin, people of all ages have stopped to pet the dogs as they visit the many memorials that have been created around town and as the funerals of the victims continue to take place. '(They) are very grateful,' Barb Granado, a volunteer at Lutheran Church Charities, said of the residents who encounter the affection animals. Fighting back her tears, Granado added: 'It's going to take a long time for the community to heal.' The 'comfort dogs' will remain in Newtown at least until the weekend, but Martin insisted they wouldn't leave the community in the cold. 'If we are needed, we'll come back,' she said.","Nine Golden Retrievers trained to provide comfort and calm to devastated community .

Named Vantablack, or super black, it also conducts heat seven and half times more effectively than copper, and is ten times stronger than steel . Most of the light is then absorbed as it bounces around, the Independent reports, creating the illusion of a black hole. It has been grown on sheets of aluminium foil which can be seen in pictures released by the company. While the foil is crinkled and uneven, the surface covered by Vantablack appears completely smooth because of its light absorbing property. The super black material has been developed for use in astronomical cameras, telescopes and infrared scanning systems and will be launched at the Farnborough International Airshow this week.

"A 63-year-old woman has been left brain damaged after undergoing routine surgery to remove a small tumour on her adrenal glands . A 63-year-old woman has been left brain damaged after undergoing routine surgery to remove a small tumour. Michelle Peters from the Northern Territory went in for an operation last month to remove a tumour on her adrenal gland when a surgical mishap saw carbon dioxide being pumped through the her liver and into her bloodstream. The incident forced doctors to place Mrs Peters in an induced coma for two days, spending the next five days in intensive care at the Royal Darwin Hospital. 'You put a lot of trust in them and you think they’re going to do the right thing and when they don’t you do feel betrayed,' Mrs Peters told the NT News. Mrs Peters has been left with memory loss and hindered motor skills. 'It's about the worst thing that could happen to you at this stage in life,' she said. 'They're going to take my licence away from me and I won't be able to go back to work because I'm a chef,' she said. 'I want to go back to work ... I loved my job.' Mrs Peters also fears how she will get by in life without 'any income coming in'. Four-years ago the 63-year-old widow was given a  chance at new life,  marrying subcontractor Garry Peters. Mr Peters has been left devastated and uncertain with what the future holds. 'She’s just not same... They can’t tell us how long it’s going to take to get better or if it is going to get better,' he said. Now a full-time carer to his wife, Mr Peters has had to turn down jobs to look after his brain damaged wife. The incident forced doctors to place Mrs Peters in an induced coma for two days, spending the next five days in intensive care at the Royal Darwin Hospital . Mrs Peters has been left with memory loss and hindered motor skills . 'I had to turn down a really good opportunity ... it would have been a big break for us, I’ve lost a lot of money.' The incident has forced the couple to have to rely on Centrelink. 'I’ve had to apply for a disability pension for Michelle and a carer’s pension for me,' Mr Peters said. Sharon Sykes, the acting chief operating officer of Top End Health Service, said senior management at the hospital were 'aware of this case'. 'The Division of Surgery has been in discussion with the family and is sensitive to the distress they are experiencing,' Ms Sykes said. 'Royal Darwin Hospital is a fully accredited facility that practices under the national standards. Should an adverse event occur within any of our hospitals we observe national incident management processes which include undertaking a full investigation; observing National Open Disclosure processes by discussing the event openly with patients, families and carers; and ensuring any remedial systems improvements and leanings are implemented as part of our safety and quality focus.' Despite everything, Mrs Peters still  has the small tumour on her adrenal gland. The hospital has offered to fly her to any hospital in Australia to have the operation. 'I won’t have the operation here after everything, would you?' Sharon Sykes, the acting chief operating officer of Top End Health Service, said senior management at the hospital were 'aware of this case'","Michelle Peters, 63, has been left brain damaged after undergoing an operation to remove a small tumour on her adrenal gland .

Many other businesses have tried to whip up interest on Twitter only for it to blow up in their faces, while others initiatives have just been plain poorly judged or in bad taste. In 2009 the Daily Telegraph wanted to show how techno-savvy it was by allowing tweets about the Budget to appear on its website automatically using a Twitterfall. If someone used the hashtag #budget it would pop up on telegraph.co.uk but it was quickly hijacked by those who used it to make jokes at the paper's expense (pictured right) Some choice comments included: 'Even the Indie is better than this drivel'. McDonalds also wanted to boost its profile online by using the hashtag #McDStories to ask people to regale stories of their hard-working staff - but it didn't go at all to plan. Tweeters came straight back with their horror stories at restaurants, claiming they were given food poisoning, and that one burger contained a finger nail. Search engine giant Bing also courted controversy when it pledged to donate to charity following a devastating Japanese earthquake in a stunt they believed would also boost their profile online. Their staff tweeted: 'How you can #SupportJapan – For every retweet, @bing will give $1 to Japan quake victims, up to $100k'.

"Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said today on 'Face the Nation' that the Republican Party 'clearly has to change' if it is to stand a chance of winning another presidential election in the future. Despite his shock at Romney's defeat in November's general election, Gingrich blamed overly conservative policies as the reason why the party has failed to connect with minority groups and young people across the country. 'When I said as a candidate we're not going to deport a grandmother if she's been here 25 years, we had a nominee who said yes, we would, that she would self-deport,' Gingrich said. ' Scroll Down for Video . Newt Gingrich appears on 'Face the Nation' this morning to speak about his views on the Republican Party and modernisation . 'I think at that point we lost Asians, we lost Latinos. You can't lose Asians, Latinos, African Americans and young people, and think you're going to be competitive. 'I think we have to come to grips with the reality. 'We have to learn to communicate in the world of young people on their terms but we also have to understand that we need to be a country of immigrants where Republicans are seen as welcoming, hard-working, competent people, not prepared to kick grandmother out.' Gingrich, who lost to Mitt Romney in the GOP primaries explained his shock at the former Massachusetts Governor's loss to President Barack Obama. Newt Gingrich appeared on the political show with Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn who echoed his sentiments . 'I mean, maybe we could have won or not won this year,' said Gingrich. 'I was certainly wrong - I thought Romney would win up until about 5.30 on Election Day.' Gingrich spoke about Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal's well received speech last week to the Republican National Committee in Charlotee. Gingrich recommended 'to every Republican' Irving Kristol's 1976 essay, 'The Stupid Party.' Then 'Ronald Reagan came along with Jack Kemp,' Gingrich continued, 'and they basically moved us back to being an idea-oriented party. I think we clearly have to change.' Appearing alongside Gingrich this morning was Republican and Tennessee Representative Marsha Blackburn, who said that Jindal was 'right on track' with his modernisation comments in North Carolina. 'What we need to do is get rid of 'Grand Old Party.' We are the 'great opportunity party.' said Blackburn. 'We're the 'growth and opportunity party.' We are the 'government of the people' party. 'And that needs to be upon point of view and the perspective we come from and we carry our message forth.' Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, speaks at the podium as he concedes the presidency at the Boston Convention & Exhibition Center on November 7, 2012 . Last week, Bobby Jindal called on the Republican Party to 'stop being the stupid party' on Thursday as GOP leaders promised fundamental changes to help stave off future losses. In the keynote address at the Republican National Committee’s winter meeting, Jindal said the GOP doesn’t need to change its values but “might need to change just about everything else we are doing.” 'We’ve got to stop being the stupid party. It’s time for a new Republican Party that talks like adults,' he said. 'We had a number of Republicans damage the brand this year with offensive and bizarre comments. I’m here to say we’ve had enough of that.' Jindal, thought to be a potential 2016 presidential contender, offered little detail in the 25-minute address. He called on conservatives to shift their focus from Capitol Hill number crunching to 'the place where conservatism thrives — in the real world beyond the Washington Beltway.' Hours before the speech, Republican leaders promised to release in March a report, dubbed the 'Growth and Opportunity Project,' outlining recommendations on party rules and messaging designed to appeal to a rapidly changing American electorate. Former Republican presidential candidate Newt gingrich and his wife Callista arrive for the 57th Presidential Inauguration ceremonial swearing-in of President Barack Obama at the US Capitol on January 21, 2013 in Washington, D.C. President Barack Obama’s November victory was fueled, in part, by overwhelming support from the nation’s Hispanic, Asian and African-American communities. Republicans presidential nominee Mitt Romney struggled last fall to win over women and minorities, who overwhelmingly favored President Barack Obama’s re-election bid. GOP officials conceded this week that they must change their tone and message, if not their policies, if they hope to expand their appeal in the coming years. Romney alienated many Hispanic voters by highlighting his support for a fence along the Mexican border and “self-deportation” of illegal immigrants. Down-ticket Republican candidates alienated female voters by backing new abortion laws in a handful of swing states like Virginia and New Hampshire, while Senate candidate Todd Akin of Missouri hurt himself and his party by declaring that women’s bodies could prevent pregnancy in cases of 'legitimate rape.' In the keynote address at the Republican National Committee¿s winter meeting, Jindal said the GOP doesn¿t need to change its values but 'might need to change just about everything else we are doing.' GOP strategist Ari Fleischer suggested that his party could learn an important lesson from Democrats on messaging: 'Republicans talk policy and Democrats talk people. Republicans can learn a little bit from Democrats on how to make those people connections with our policies.' Asked whether he was considering a presidential bid in 2016, Jindal brushed aside the question. 'Any Republican that’s thinking about talking about running for president in 2016 needs to get his head examined,' he said. 'We’ve got a lot of work to do.' Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., told reporters on the sidelines of the meeting Thursday that Republicans also need to develop a sound strategy for confronting the Obama administration, suggesting House Republicans could use hearings to expose waste and promote better ideas. 'A lot of Republicans, frankly, spent the last two years saying, ‘Oh, gee, we don’t have to do much because after Obama loses we’ll work with the new Republican president.’ Well, that world ain’t there,' Gingrich said. “So now they have to make adjustments. They’ve got to understand that this is a different game.'","Appears on 'Face the Nation' this morning and says the Republican party needs to modernise .

"A controversial documentary premiered at the Sundance Film Festival claims the Church of Scientology broke up Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Going Clear, created by Alex Gibney, makes a number of startling revelations about the organisation - including allegations they used aggressive intimidation tactics to force the Hollywood couple apart. The film, based on the book by journalist Lawrence Wright, is an expose of the controversial religion - claiming that it evades taxes and abuses its members. Marty Rathbun, formerly the second highest-ranking official, claims he had been appointed to 'facilitate the breakup' because the head of the church, David Miscavige, was suspicious of Cruise's second wife.

It also alleges that during the filming of Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut, Cruise wasn't returning Miscavige's phone calls, even though he was the best man at the actor's wedding. Rathbun suggests this is when the aggressive campaign to tear the couple apart begin. It included wiretapping Kidman's phone and psychoanalyzing Cruise and his movements around the clock. Concerns: Kidman (pictured with Cruise in 2001) was listed as a 'Potential Trouble Source' because her father was a psychologist in Australia . Anger: The film alleges that during the filming of Stanley Kubrick's, Cruise wasn't returning Miscavige's (pictured) phone calls, even though he was the best man at the actotr's wedding . The personal information they gathered was then passed to Miscavige who is believed to have condemned Cruise for his 'sexual festishes'. Rathbun even states that the Church of Scientology 're-educated' Cruise's adopted children, Connor and Isabella, so they would turn against their mother in a bid to make Cruise's custody case stronger. Before Going Clear's first screening, HBO hired 160 lawyers to look through the film. It is expected to air on the channel March 16. The church also took out an advert in the New York Times claiming the film was a a Rolling Stone/UVA redux, even though they had not seen it. Despite the furor surrounding the production, Gibney hopes it will lead to more investigations and reports into Scientology. He told Variety magazine: 'We hope that this film and Larry’s book will start the process where more media will say well we don’t care anymore. We’re going to pursue this no matter what. According to the credits at the end of the film, Cruise and Kidman refused to be interviewed. The pair divorced in 2001 and following the split, Cruise became more active in the Church of Scientology, receiving the church’s Freedom Medal of Valor in 2004.

"A woman set out to prove that females get catcalled no matter what they're wearing created a blog on which women could post the outfits, some mundane, that solicited unwanted attention. The page titled, 'But What Was She Wearing: Stop the Cat Call' created by Kati Heng documents what girls were actually wearing when harassed on the street-and it may surprise you. The page seeks to move the blame away from the girl who is often asked 'but what were you wearing' after expressing discomfort after receiving comments from lecherous men. Scroll down for video . No you may not: This submission from Anatomydork tells a story of when she was on her way to her first half marathon and a man asked her if he could touch her privates . Covered up: A submission from Janinne details how a man said he wanted to know what she looked like under her headscarf also called a hijab . Casual attire: Amanda Bush says she was called the 'C' word after she didn't acknowledge a man's advances when she was wearing this outfit in a local parking lot . Many of the women's outfits consist of everyday sweat pants or jeans and modest dresses. BuzzFeed spoke with Heng that the blog’s aim is to share women’s stories of street harassment without allowing anyone to put the blame on what she wore. 'So often, when women try to talk about the harassment we face, we’re met with that stupid question, ‘What were you wearing?’ as if WE are the ones responsible for what happened to us,' said Heng. 'By having the selfies of what we were wearing upfront, it takes the question away, forcing people to get past it and just read the stories.' Heng told BuzzFeed that her own personal experiences motivated her to create the page. 'A couple days before I launched, I got catcalled twice in one weekend – the first time, wearing a shorts and a baggy flannel, walking with my boyfriend, some dude yelled out his car to my boyfriend, ‘Hey, I want to f***k your girlfriend!’ That one was really upsetting because I wasn’t even the object of harassment anymore; I was just an object for men to compete over.' Homophobic remark: Holly Stewart Sanchez Perry says a man on the street told her he hoped she wasn't a lesbian because that would be too bad for men who fancy her . Covered for a reason: Abbie Amiotte said men on the street told her her sweater was too long and that they wanted to see what was hiding under it . Prairie girls get catcalled too: Eryn Schlote who was dressed in a uniform she wears at a theme park got harrased by a 40-year-old man who gave her an unwanted hand massage . Her story has motivated other girls to come forward with their own and form a sisterhood of women who are saying no to the catcall. A similar story to this one is the video of 24-year-old aspiring actress who was filmed being catcalled 108 times as she strolled around New York City - even though she was wearing a plain T-shirt, jeans and sneakers. Shoshana Roberts, a graduate of Kutztown University in Pennsylvania, was captured on a hidden camera by her friend, Rob Bliss, as she walked through the city's streets. Over a ten-hour period, she was pelted with dozens of unsolicited comments, including: 'What's up beautiful?', 'Hey baby', 'Smile' and 'Have a nice evening darling'. Roberts along with many other women feel as though their boundaries are being disrespected and no matter what they're wearing feel as though they don't deserve it. Heng said that she was interested in the ageism of street harassment pointing out that girls under the age of 18 receive 'the worst harassment just because they left school still wearing their school uniforms.' Tourist trap: Gabrielle said that when she visited New York she got catcalled by a number of greasy guys . Not OK: Katy Heng said that she was walking down the street after a concert and a man insulted her because she didn't say thank you when he catcalled her . Small town big words: Joslynn Roth says that guys yell at her from car windows often in her small town .

"At least five people have died in an overnight attack on Kenya's coast just days after twin massacres killed 60 nearby. A group of attackers raided a village near the town of Witu, 25 miles from the tourist island of Lamu. 'I am aware that a gang that is unknown attacked Taa village in Witu division yesterday night and killed five people,' Lamu County commissioner, Stephen Ikua, said on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Uproar: Residents of Mpeketoni, Kenya, and nearby Witu call for peace after the third attack in seven days . 'There is another attack where five people were killed,' a police officer in Lamu said on condition on anonymity. Somali militant group Al Shabaab, linked to Al Qaeda, claimed responsibility for last week's attacks on the Mpeketoni area - although Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said local politicians were behind it. In a statement, President Kenyatta branded the massacres 'well-planned, orchestrated and politically motivated ethnic violence' carried out by 'local political networks'. The accusations have stoked already tense political rivalry between Kenyatta and opposition parties. Somalia's Shabaab have carried out a string of revenge attacks for Kenya's military role in southern Somalia, including last year's siege of the Westgate shopping mall that left 67 people dead. Kenyan fighter jets and attack helicopters launched renewed air strikes on Sunday in southern Somalia targeting Shebab bases. Horrific: The twin attacks last week, claimed by Al Shabaab, left at least 60 dead. Five were killed last night . The raid formed part of an offensive by the UN-backed African Union (AU) mission in Somalia, which launched in March in a bid to reclaim remaining towns from the Islamists. Kenya army spokesman Major Emmanuel Chirchir boasted the strikes had 'left more than 80 Al-Shebab terrorists killed.' But Shebab spokesman Abdulaziz Abu Musab, who said Kenyan troops with the AU were also fighting the Islamists on the ground Monday, dismissed claims over 80 of his fighters had been killed as propaganda. In separate attacks, at least 20 people were killed over the weekend in northeastern Kenya in ethnic clashes. It is the latest in a series of revenge attacks between rival Somali clans that has killed over 80 people and forced over 75,000 people from their homes since May.","Unknown gang raided village near Witu, 25 miles inland, killing 5 .

"Leading liberal Senator Bernie Sanders has admitted he is considering running for U.S. president in 2016 in a move that could complicate Hilary Clinton's long-expected run at the White House. Mr Sanders, an independent from Vermont, could pose a challenge from the left to Clinton - widely seen as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, despite not yet declaring her candidacy. Speaking to NBC's 'Meet the Press' show on Sunday, Mr Sanders said he will be using the key battleground state of Iowa to help him test whether there is an appetite for a liberal but independent candidate. If running as a Democrat gave him a better chance of success however, he would challenge Mrs Clinton. Scroll down for video . Liberal Senator Bernie Sanders (right) has confirmed he is considering running for U.S. president in 2016 in a move that could complicate Hilary Clinton's (left) long-expected run at the White House. Mr Sanders, 73, is currently serving his second six-year term in the Senate. He has cultivated a following among some American liberals, . especially on economic issues like the growing income disparity . between rich and poor and corporate greed. He is a . self-described socialist who caucuses with Democrats in the . Senate. 'I am thinking about running for president,' Mr Sanders said. 'I think anybody who speaks to the needs of the working class and the middle class of this country and shows the courage to take on the billionaire class, I think that candidate will do pretty well,' he added. Socialist: Bernie Sanders has cultivated a following among some American liberals - especially on economic issues like the growing income disparity between rich and poor and corporate greed . Mr Sanders denied he was considering standing in order to hamper Mrs Clinton's campaign, saying he has 'a lot of respect' for her, adding 'the issue is not Hillary.' Mr Sanders is testing the waters in Iowa, a state that holds an . important early contest in the nomination process. 'One of the reasons I'm going to Iowa is to get a sense of . how people feel about it,' he said of his candidacy. 'Look, the . truth is [there is] profound anger at both political parties, . more and more people are becoming independent. The negative is: . how do you set up a 50-state infrastructure as an independent?' Relaxed: Hillary Clinton (pictured alongside her husband former U.S. President Bill Clinton) is widely seen as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, despite not yet formally declaring her candidacy . With Mrs Clinton mindful of the need to appeal to moderates in . any general election battle against a Republican in 2016, a . Sanders candidacy could force her to the left in the Democratic . primaries to head off his challenge. Conversely, if he runs in the general election as an . independent, he could siphon away from her votes from liberals . that she could need to beat any Republican nominee. American liberals have expressed disappointment with . President Barack Obama on a range of issues, most recently on . his decision to postpone any executive action on immigration. This comes even as Republican leaders in the House of Representatives block . action on a bipartisan Senate-passed plan. Mr Sanders said that he has 'a lot of disagreements' with . Obama, adding: 'I think he has not tapped the anger and the . frustration that the American people feel on many, many issues.' Bernie Sanders, 73, is the longest serving independent in U.S. Congressional history, having been elected to Vermont's at-large congressional district in 1990. Born into a family of Polish Jewish immigrants in New York in 1941, he was involved in student activism before entering politics with the anti-Vietnam War Liberty Union Party in Vermont. In 1981, at the suggestion of his friend Richard Sugarman, a professor of religion at the University of Vermont, Sanders ran for Mayor of Burlington and defeated six-term Democratic incumbent Gordon Paquette by 14 votes in a four-way contest. Sanders won three more terms, defeating both Democratic and Republican candidates. In his final run for Mayor in 1987, Sanders defeated a candidate endorsed by both major parties. Veteran: 73-year-old Bernie Sanders is the longest serving independent in U.S. Congressional history, having been elected to Vermont's at-large congressional district in 1990 . He temporarily retired from politics in 1989, teaching political science at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government in 1989  while making an unsuccessful run at Vermont's at-large congressional district. Sanders was elected at his second attempt, defeating Republican incumbent Lieutenant Governor Peter Smith to become the first independent in Congress for 40 years. In 1991, Sanders co-founded the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and chaired the grouping of mostly liberal Democrats. He continues to caucus with the Democratic Party and is counted as a Democrat for purposes of committee assignments. During his time in Congress, Sanders built a reputation for progressive Liberalism proposing a number of radical socialist policies, voting against the use of force in both Iraq wars, and becoming an outspoken critic of the administration of George W Bush in the 2000s. Republicans have attacked Sanders as 'an ineffective extremist' for successfully sponsoring only one law and 15 amendments in his eight terms in the House. Sanders responded by saying that he had passed 'the most floor amendments of any member of the House since 1996'. In 2006 Sanders was elected to the U.S. Senate in the most expensive political campaign in Vermont's history. He was reelected in 2012 with 71 per cent of the vote. Sanders is a self-described democratic socialist, and has repeatedly praised Scandinavian-style social democracy.","Sanders could pose a challenge from the left to Clinton's White House run .

"These bizarre forms look as if they were delicately sculpted by hand - but in fact, they are the work of blustery winds across the Midwest. 'Snow rollers' have started sweeping into yards and fields throughout Ohio, Illinois and Pennsylvania thanks to the right balance of light snow, firm winds and cold temperatures. The strange sculptures have since become a hit on Twitter and Facebook as residents across the country have shared photographs of the wispy forms and the fields where they've found them.

The funny forms have also been seen in Ohio and Illinois . According to the National Weather Service, they are formed during the right combination of sticky snow, fairly strong winds and cold temperatures. The wind will blow a small chunk of ice along the ground, leaving it to collect more snow, layer by layer. While wind helps to form some of the rollers, others are formed by rolling down hill. Pictures shared on social media reveal tracks left behind the snow rollers after the came to a stop. 'We had temps near freezing when the snow began - perhaps even a little ice formed on the top at the surface to not allow for the snow to stick and to allow it to roll,' meteorologist Jason Nicholas told NewsNet5 in Cleveland. 'Then the winds picked up basically rolling the snow like a snow ball.' Janice Ford, from Lexington, Ohio, said there were snow rollers in her back yard and in a neighboring field.

"The Queen of the Netherlands announced last night that she was abdicating in favour of her son and heir after 33 years on the throne. In a broadcast on Dutch state television three days before her 75th birthday, Queen Beatrix said she was stepping down because she believed ‘the responsibility should now lie in the hands of a new generation’. The new king, Willem-Alexander, the 45-year-old Prince of Orange, will take over as monarch on April 30. He will be the first male to accede to the Dutch throne since 1890. His mother has ruled the Netherlands since April 30, 1980. Scroll down for video . Abdication: Dutch Queen Beatrix (pictured) announced she will abdicate in favour of her son on 30 April . Queen Beatrix of Holland said the 'responsibility for this country should lie in the hands of a new generation' The change will be interesting to royal watchers in this country, given that our Queen is 86 and last year celebrated her 60th anniversary on the throne. In April 2011, Prince Charles became the longest-serving heir apparent in British history. The previous record, of 59 years, two months and 13 days, was set by his great-great-grandfather, King Edward VII. Charles, now 64, became heir apparent at the age of three when his mother acceded to the throne on February 6, 1952. She is the second longest reigning British monarch behind Queen Victoria, who ruled for 63 years. But the Queen has always made clear that she takes very seriously her coronation vow to devote ‘her whole life’ to her country and it has long been accepted that it is unlikely she will ever abdicate. Future king: Prince Willelm of the Netherlands (pictured with Princess Maxima) is due to take over the throne . Heir to the throne: Prince Willem-Alexander (pictured centre) is married to Princess Maxima Zorrigueta (left) and has three young children . Queen Beatrix has close ties to our Queen and to Prince Charles. In her televised address, Queen Beatrix said she had been thinking about abdicating for several years but now was the ‘moment to lay down my crown’. She said: ‘I do not step down because the office is too heavy, but with the conviction that the responsibility should now lie in the hands of a new generation. I am grateful for the many years that I have been allowed to be your queen.’ She added that Crown Prince Willem-Alexander, her oldest son, would ‘serve our country with dedication, faithful to the constitution’. No laughing matter: Queen Beatrix (pictured with her son Prince Willem Alexander) said she was 'grateful' for the years she was queen . Queen Beatrix, who wore a plain blue dress as she addressed her people, said that she is still in good health and that her role has given her ‘great satisfaction as I shared the sorrows and joys of you all’. But there was speculation in the European media that the accident suffered by Prince Friso, 42, was the reason for her departure from the throne. Germany’s biggest newspaper, Bild, asked: ‘Has her son’s ski accident broken her heart?’ In March last year Prince Friso was buried in an avalanche in Austria. His brain was starved of oxygen and he has been in a coma ever since. He is being treated at a London hospital. Willem-Alexander, who will be King William IV, is married to Maxima Zorreguieta, who was born a commoner in Argentina. Princess Maxima is the daughter of minister who served in the military junta in the late 1970s. They have three daughters, Amalia, nine, Alexia, seven, and Ariane, five. Royal meeting: Queen Beatrix, who had close ties to the British royal family, is greeted by Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle in Berkshire . New arrival: Beatrix and her husband Claus admire their newborn son, Prince Alexander, at their residence Castle Drakensteyn in Baarn, Netherlands . Queen Beatrix became the Dutch monarch when her mother Queen Juliana, who reigned for 31 years, abdicated due to her age and deteriorating mental health. The style of Queen Beatrix’s reign is characterised as more detached and ‘business-like’ than that of her mother. But Beatrix has been praised for being a stable factor in volatile Dutch politics. She also had to undergo personal hardships. Her husband Claus died in 2002, her mother Juliana and father Bernhard died in 2004. In 2009, Beatrix and her family were the target of an apparent attempt on their lives when a man tried to crash a car into their open-top bus during a parade. He killed seven people watching the parade. Prince Charles admitted last November that he might be losing his chance to become ruler. In remarkably candid comments, the Prince of Wales said: ‘I’ll run out of time soon. I shall have snuffed it if I’m not careful.’ David Cameron last year rejected any suggestion that the Queen might abdicate, or that the crown might skip a generation and go straight to Prince William.

"More than 90 villagers are feared to have been snatched by Boko Haram Islamist militants from the same area where they seized nearly 300 schoolgirls at gunpoint two months ago. Nigerian security forces said they were investigating reports of the mass kidnapping as negotiations for the release of the schoolgirls appears to be making little progress despite US, British, French and Israeli specialists being involved. If confirmed, the latest abduction would fuel public and anger frustration over Abuja's inability to quell Boko Haram's five-year campaign to carve out an Islamist state in the mainly Muslim north.

"A pair of twin sisters, separated at birth, have found each other 70 years on - having grown up just around the corner from each other. Etta Stevens and Sandi Ikenn were born at the Evangelical Hospital, now Christ Hospital, in South Chicago on November 3. They were given up by their unmarried mother and adopted by two different families in Chicago - raised just a few miles from each other but never knowing they had a twin. Scroll down for video . Reunited: After 70 years Sandi Ikenn, left, and Etta Stevens, right, have been reunited, pictured. The non-identical twins never knew the other existed and grew up just a few miles apart . Catching up on lost time: The twins raised by separate families in Chicago now live apart but plan to regularly meet up and introduce their extended families . Both the girls were raised by Jewish families and for a time even attended the same temple. They had some mutual friends and Etta even visited Sandi's family record store where unbeknownst to her her twin sister worked. Etta Stevens, who used to have a radio show in Chicago and now lives in Hollywood, told the Today program: 'All my life I had this feeling something was missing, I didn't know it was somebody.' 'We used to walk to the store and she sometimes worked in the store. It was a wonderful place to be - maybe we saw each other' she added. Decades on Illinois released a swathe of never before released birth records and contacted the women to ask if they wanted to see them. They both said yes and received them in the post. It is there they saw the birth certificate with the box ticked twin. 'Tears were rolling down my face,' Etta, who now lives in Hollywood, told the Miami Herald. The papers had Sandi's address so Etta tracked down her telephone number and called. 'I . hadn’t opened the mail yet,' Sandi, a medical assistant who still lives . in Chicago, explained. 'It’s like someone dropped into my life from . heaven.' Shared interests: The twins have discovered they have a lot in common including a love of make up, food and singing . Separated at birth: The two sisters were adopted at babies and never knew they were twins. They grew up five minutes apart in Chicago . They soon met and found they had a mutual love for singing and make up. 'We talked; we cried; we talked; we cried,' said Etta. Having a twin was a hard thing to get used to but since then the sisters have been making up for lost time. 'My twin sister - it is still very strange to say it,' Sandi told the Today programme. 'I looked at it [the birth certificate] and didn't quite understand it. Twin? How could I be a twin and not know it? How could this be? The women had to explain it to their own families and tell their children they had a new aunt they never knew existed. 'Both of our families reacted the same way,' Sandi told the Herald. 'They said ‘I can’t believe there is another one of you out there.' The sisters won't reveal their age but they would admit Sandi is the slightly older of the two. 'I don't mind - I'm proud of it,' Sandi told Today.'I could have met my twin and maybe we didn't get along but we do'.

The article - which also called Gary Locke a plague - reflected Chinese nationalists' acute loathing toward the first Chinese-American to have been Washington's top envoy to Beijing. The editorial 'Farewell, Gary Locke' took direct aim at Locke's identity as a third-generation . Chinese-American, calling him a 'banana' - a racial term for Asians . identifying with Western values despite their skin color. Parting shot: U.S. Ambassador Gary Locke speaks during a farewell press conference which provoked an extraordinary backlash from China's state mouthpiece newsagency . 'But . when a banana sits out for long, its yellow peels will always rot, not . only revealing its white core but also turning into the stomach-churning . color of black,' read the editorial carried by China News Service. Locke provoked the anger of the state mouthpiece with comments in his final press conference on Thursday. In it, the former commerce secretary and two-term governor of Washington state, 63, urged Beijing to respect the rights of peaceful political activists. He said that China should value not just the economic welfare of its people, but also their freedom of speech, assembly and religion. Insult: The startling editorial compared ambassador Garry Locke with a rotten banana - an offensive racial slur . 'We believe that freedom of expression is a universal right and we very much are concerned about the arrest and detentions of people who are engaged in peaceful advocacy,' Locke, accompanied by his wife Mona, told journalists at the U.S. Embassy in eastern Beijing. Locke also stressed the importance of making it easier for Chinese tourists to get visas to visit the U.S. He said: 'Part of the reason for doing that is... to enable more Chinese people to experience America, to see first hand our freedoms, our democracy, our diversity... I hope that perhaps from their experiences in the U.S. they'll want some of those same things in China or understand what is possible in China.' But the comments seem to have struck a nerve with Chinese officials. The editorial, under the byline Wang Ping - likely a pseudonym - carried this morning, mocked Locke's portrayal as an . official judicious with public funds. It criticized him for being . hypocritical as he retreated into his multimillion-dollar official . residence and special-made, bullet-proof luxury vehicle. Farewell: Gary Locke's used his final press conference to call for more Chinese people to visit America and experience its 'democracy' and 'diversity' Wang . belittled Locke's inability to speak his ancestral language and accused . him of failing to understand China's law but fanning 'evil winds' in . the ethnically sensitive regions of Tibet and Xinjiang. 'Not . only did he run around by himself, he even served as a guide dog for . the blind when he took in the so-called blind rights lawyer Chen . Guangcheng and led him running,' the editorial said. Chen later was . allowed to leave China and now lives in the United States. The . editorial made a malicious Chinese curse at Locke, suggesting Locke's . Chinese ancestors would expel him from the family clan should they know . his behaviors. Wang also . made the innuendo that Locke should be blamed for the smog. 'When he . arrived, so did Beijing's smog,' Wang wrote. 'With his departure, . Beijing's sky suddenly turned blue.' 'Let's . bid goodbye to the smog, and let's bid goodbye to the plague. Farewell, . Gary Locke,' ended the article, which was clearly inspired by Mao . Zedong's 1949 piece, 'Farewell, Leighton Stuart,' that scoffed at the . last American ambassador under the collapsing Nationalist government in . Nanjing. Tensions: Relations between America and China reached a low following President Barack Obama's meeting with Tibet's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama in the White House in 2010 . The piece shocked members of the Chinese public, who denounced the editorial as distasteful and offensive. But whether it would draw diplomatic protests was unclear; attempts to contact officials at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing got no response Friday. Locke's ethnic background particularly interested the Chinese government and people. Locke won public applause when he was seen carrying his own bag and flying economy class but he drew criticism from Beijing as his demeanor was an unwelcome contrast to Chinese officials' privileges and entitlements. In his three years in Beijing, Locke oversaw the defusing of a number of delicate diplomatic episodes. Locke has been a critical player in . soothing tensions between America and China which reached as low after . President Barack Obama met Tibet's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama at . the White House. He also led diplomatic efforts to seek a resolution when a powerful police chief fled to a U.S. consulate and later when a persecuted blind activist sought shelter in the embassy. The Chinese public also credit him with making them realize the harm of the tiny pollutant PM2.5 and severity of China's foul air by posting the embassy's hourly readings of air quality. Meanwhile, the editorials in Chinese state media turned from initial reservation to unfriendliness to the insolence of the final piece. Danger: Gary Locke is credited with highlighting the serious health problems caused by the little-known air pollutant PM2.5 . 'I think it shows the unfriendliness and impoliteness by the Chinese government toward Gary Locke, and it is without the manners and dignity of a major power,' legal scholar Hao Jinsong said. 'It is unfitting of China's status as a diplomatic power. As a Chinese, I am very angry and feel ashamed of it.' 'This article by China News Service is the most shameless I have ever seen - not one of them but the most shameless,' the popular online commentator Yao Bo said. 'Without him, we probably still would not have known what PM2.5 is, and how did he bring the smog? You have played the snake in the Farmer and the Viper.' Another commentator Fastop Liu, known for his sharp tongue, said the piece is ungraceful. 'When you call him a plague, you become a national shame as you lack diplomatic etiquette, damage the manner of a great power, and lose the face of all Chinese,' Liu wrote. Locke's replacement, former Montana Sen. Max Baucus, was sworn in last week and is expected to arrive within weeks.","Outgoing U.S. ambassador Gary Locke criticised China's lack of freedom .

"A Robbie Williams impersonator has admitted claiming £8,500 in incapacity benefit while performing the singer's greatest hits in Tenerife. Benefits cheat James Crockett, 43, claimed he was too ill to work, but was able to travel to the Canary Islands to perform chart-topping hits by the former Take That singer and Michael Bublé. Crockett, whose stage name is Andy James, pleaded guilty to failing to tell the Department for Work and Pensions that he was no longer unable to work for most of 2012 and could be jailed. James Crockett, who performs under the stage name Andy James, claimed £8,500 in benefits while impersonating Robbie Williams in Tenerife . No regrets? Crockett (left) claimed he was too ill to work while he impersonated singer Robbie Williams (right) Somethin' Stupid: Crockett could face jail when he is sentenced at Bradford Crown Court on November 13 . Prosecutor Emma Downing told Bradford Crown Court that Crockett was working in the Canaries and the UK as a tribute act, impersonating Robbie Williams, Take That and Michael Bublé. Crockett, whose website claims he is the 'only choice' when it comes to Robbie Williams impersonators, illegally claimed £8,463. His separate Bublé tribute act webpage claims he 'delivers Bublés [sic] greatest hits with the same flamboyance and panache as the man himself'. The court was told that he had been voluntarily paying back £40 a month since the start of this year, but Judge Jonathan Durham Hall said the public are 'rightly outraged' by benefits cheats. Crockett’s barrister, Charlotte Worsley, said the tribute act, who claims to have 'thrilled audiences across Europe', was of previous good character and was no longer on benefits. She said he had suffered medical difficulties for a number of years, including a stroke, and was advised by his GP to move somewhere warm because of problems with his back, for which he had surgery in 2002 when he was nearly paralysed. Judge Jonathan Durham Hall said the public were 'rightly outraged' by benefits cheats such as Crockett . Taking the Mickey? Crockett also claims to do a good impression of suave singer Michael Bublé . Crockett, from Skipton, North Yorkshire, failed to tell the Department for Work and Pensions that he was no longer unable to work for most of 2012 . Miss Worsley said Crockett had made a remarkable recovery over the years and was managing to keep himself relatively fit with a strict diet, physiotherapy and exercises. However, he still suffered from significant disabilities, she said. Judge Durham Hall said he did not think Crockett, from Skipton, North Yorkshire, had any idea about the seriousness of his position and will sentence him on November 13. The judge said he was yet to decide on whether Crockett would face jail, telling him he would be 'looking at your case with great care'.","Tribute act James Crockett claimed £8,500 in incapacity benefit in 2012 .

"There's a word to describe moments such as this and I think it’s probably… eek! The waters of the Thames are rushing 138ft beneath me and a double decker bus on the road below resembles a scale model. The pedestrians milling about on the pavements look as if they have come to life from a Lowry painting and there is nothing between them and my boots but a sheet of glass. It sounds like a scene from Hitchcock’s Vertigo – but it’s the latest attraction at Tower Bridge. And yesterday I joined hundreds of pioneers to look down on London through a glass walkway on the upper part of the bridge. Scroll down for video . Walking on air: A visitor crosses Tower Bridge's new £1million glass walkway after it was unveiled on Monday . Do look down: The view of the River Thames, pedestrians and vehicles from high above is quite spectacular . The time-honoured advice when you’re this high off the ground is not to look down. Too late though. I already did. Scary? Only if you’re truly terrified of heights. But the unexpected shock of suddenly seeing what appears to be only fresh air between you and certain death did give a few the collywobbles. Especially when a chirpy Tower guide jumped vigorously up and down on the glass alongside us to demonstrate (what we hoped was) its resilience. One half of the £1million walkway opened to the public yesterday between the north and south towers of the bridge and will be joined on December 1 by a parallel walk alongside it. They have been designed to give tourists, sightseers and thrill-seekers a unique view from a bridge that bills itself as the most famous in the world, not forgetting a peek at the workings of a legendary feat of engineering when the bridge below opens. For the faint of heart or weak of knee, it may be reassuring to learn that each glass panel along the 36ft walkway is getting on for three inches thick and weighs nearly 1,200lb. Tower Bridge Exhibition executives insist the idea is to enthral rather that scare people – but this might not have been clear to some of those taking their first steps into the unknown yesterday. Bird's eye view: The glass walkway gives visitors a never-before-seen look at London life from one of the world’s most famous bridges . Long way down: The glass floor panels weigh over 1,000 pounds each and required a 20-strong team to install . Up high: The glass platform stretches across Tower Bridge Exhibition's high-level walkways – nearly 140ft above the River Thames . Nerves of steel: Tower Bridge Exhibition attracts 600,000 visitors a year and the glass walkway is expected to boost those numbers . Never-before-seen views: A boat passes under Tower Bridge's new glass floor after it was unveiled on Monday . ‘Everything in your brain is saying “don’t, don’t, don’t”,’ said Stan Cooper, a 71-year-old retired fireman from Corfe Mullen, Dorset. ‘I trained on 100ft turntable ladders but at least you’ve got something you can see beneath your feet. Here, your eyes tell you you’re walking on thin air.’ Kristy Jones, 36, from Leeds, used the experience to confront her fear of heights. She walked the entire length of glass, speeded up only towards the end – and yes, she did look down. ‘It was pretty frightening but I don’t like to let it beat me,’ she said. ‘I can’t take too much of it.’ Not so for Magdalena Sirola, nine, and sister Veronica, six, visiting Tower Bridge with their mother Andrea. They twirled, jumped, danced and slid fearlessly on the glass for more than 20 minutes, lying down at one stage to wave to the people below. Ah yes, the people below. Would they be able to use their vantage point for an up-skirt snapshot of unsuspecting women above? It is something the bridge’s architect Sir Horace Jones and civil engineer Sir John Wolfe Barry did not have to consider 120 years ago – but the walkway designers admitted that they did. A guide tells me: ‘At night it will be illuminated with so-called “modesty lighting”. In the day, the reflection, distance and angle mean the view upwards from beneath is nothing like as clear as the view downwards from above. We don’t expect to see crowds gathering on the pavements.’ Are you brave enough? While testing visitors’ nerves the glass floor offers a spectacular view of the bridge lifts . New attraction: The glass walkway is the most significant change to the Tower Bridge Exhibition since it opened in 1982 . Buzz of activity: The west walkway floor opened on Monday and the east walkway opening is set for December 1 .
