"By . Sam Webb . When Michelle Clark lost her fiance and her newborn twins there was only one ray of hope for her. Her fiance Karl Davis died of cancer and her infants both died - all within four months of each other. But Miss Clark refused to give up on her fiance’s dream of having children - and she has now given birth to baby son Max, thanks to IVF treatment using her dead husband’s sperm. Miss Clark, 32, an administration officer for Salford council who lives in Walkden, Greater Manchester, said: ‘It was so devastating for me to lose Karl and the twins, but now I have a little bit of Karl to keep forever.' From darkness, light: Miss Clark's fiance died of leukaemia in 200, but refused to give up on his dream of having children - and she has now given birth to baby son Max . Mr Davis had been battling leukaemia for nearly three years with chemotherapy and two bone marrow transplants when the couple went for their first course of IVF treatment . She added: ‘I will never forget either Karl or the babies - but now I can finally look forward to the future and having a wonderful life with Max.’ The couple first met 12 years ago in November 2001 after meeting through a family member. But then in 2007, Mr Davis, started vomiting regularly in the mornings. He went into hospital but was sent home after doctors told him he was suffering from heartburn. Miss Clark said: ‘I was so worried about him. But as we were on the way back to hospital later that same day, they rang with blood test results that they had taken on our first visit, and told us to get back to the hospital quickly.’ When the couple returned they were told that Mr Davis had leukaemia and he needed to start chemotherapy treatment straight away. Heartbreaking: Twin Ria before she died. her son Karl also lost his fight for life too, just six days later . Miss Clark said: ‘It was such a big shock. We had no idea that it was anything as serious as cancer. Karl was only 24, how could he possibly have cancer. It was too much to take in.’ Mr Davis started his treatment, but beforehand he froze some sperm samples as doctors told him it would affect his fertility. Miss Clark said: ‘We had wanted to start a family, and we knew that because of the chemotherapy treatment this would be the only way.’ Mr Davis had been battling leukaemia for nearly three years with chemotherapy and two bone marrow transplants when the couple went for their first course of IVF treatment in the summer of 2010. Amazingly Miss Clarke fell pregnant. She said: ‘It was the one bit of good news for us that we’d had in years. Karl was so incredibly happy at the thought of being a dad. It really gave him a boost.’ Happy and healthy: Max was born in June last year. Miss Clark said: 'It was such an emotional moment when he was born, I just wished Karl had been there to meet his son' But as Miss Clark’s bump grew bigger, Mr Davis was in increasing pain. At the hospital they were given the worst possible diagnosis. The cancer had spread and there was nothing else that could be done. Miss Clark said: ‘It was devastating. Karl had fought so hard, but he’d already had so much treatment and two bone marrow transplant too, yet still the cancer had spread. ‘We went to our first scan and saw our babies’ little heartbeats pumping away on the screen. 'Both the embryos had taken and I was pregnant with twins. ‘We should have been overjoyed, but it was so bittersweet as we didn’t even know if Karl would survive long enough to meet his babies.’ In September 2010 when Miss Clark was three months pregnant, Mr Davis tragically lost his fight for life at the age of 27. Miss Clark said: ‘I had these two lives growing inside me, and instead of buying baby clothes and decorating the nursery, I was burying their father. If it wasn’t for the babies I would have found it difficult to carry on.’ In January 2011, when Miss Clark was seven months pregnant she went into premature labour. Her twins Karl was born weighing just 1Ib13 and his twin sister Ria at 1Ib12. Miss Clark said: ‘They looked so fragile and for two weeks I never left their side, just praying that they would survive.’ But just four months after she had buried her fiance ,Miss Clark also lost her tiny newborn daughter, and then her son Karl also lost his fight for life too, just six days later. She said: ‘I had lost my fiance and my twins such a short time. My only consolation was that Karl would be there to look after our two angels in heaven. ‘I’d clung to that hope that I would have something of Karl left, now that had been taken away from me too.’ Miss Clark was so determined to fulfill her fiance’s wish of having a family, that she underwent a second course of IVF alone, in November 2011. She suffered an ectopic pregnancy and lost the baby, but a third course of IVF in September 2012 proved successful. Miss Clark said: ‘I was terrified all the way through the pregnancy that I was going to lose this baby too.’ Luckily her pregnancy went smoothly and baby Max was born in June last year at St Mary’s Hospital in Manchester, weighing a healthy 9Ib1oz. Miss Clark said: ‘It was such an emotional moment when he was born, I just wished Karl had been there to meet his son. He would have been so proud of him. ‘He’s doing really well now and he’s so like Karl - he’s the spitting image of him. And when he’s old enough I will tell him all about his daddy and what a special person he was.’","Michelle Clark, 32, dreamed of starting a family with Karl Davis .

"By . Joel Christie . Two Massachusetts high school athletes have been kicked off their lacrosse team right before championships after being photpgraphed smoking a cigar at graduation. Beverly High School students Nick Donovan and Dylan Jutras were both suspended from the sport for the rest of the season after the photo of the celebratory smoke appeared in the local paper The Beverly Citizen as part of their graduation coverage. Despite both being 18, making it legal for them to smoke tabacco, the students were told their decision goes against the strict policies of the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA).

'The spirit of the rule is, we don't want any student to be involved with drugs and alcohol, which I agree with 100 percent. 'However, the application of the ruling was not in line with the spirit of the rule itself.' Mr Donovan described the cigar-smoking as 'a celebratory thing that transcends generations and cultures'. 'What's the first thing people do when they have a baby? They hand out cigars,' he said. 'Look at the statue of Red Auerbach (smoking a victory cigar).

"By . Joel Christie . John Moylan had been a longtime member of the board of directors for the Golden Gate district when, in 2008, following years of campaigning, controversy and debate, they decided to install suicide barriers on the Golden Gate Bridge in an effort to stop the two dozen people that jump from the structure each year. But on Thursday the 85-year-old lost his grandson, Sean Moylan, 27, to the same San Francsico span he has tirelessly tried to make safer. It was said to be the second time the 'troubled' young man, from Novato, in the city's North Bay area, had tried to take his own life. Mr Moylan had previously lost a grandnephew to suicide, which added drive of his push for the barriers. Scroll down for video . Gone too soon: Sean Moylan, 27, of Novoto, jumped to his death from the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco on Thursday, despite his grandfather spending years trying to make the site more resistant to suicide attempts . Advocate: John Moylan is a longtime bridge district director who was board president in 2008 when directors made the historic decision to move forward with a suicide barrier after years of debate and controversy . More than 1,500 people have jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge - which has a 220 feet drop to the water from road-level - since it opened in 1937 . On Saturday Mr Moylan said that while the incident had been 'heartbreaking' for him and his family, he refused to blame the bridge or its barriers for the suicide. 'The poor kid was a very troubled young man,' he told local paper The Marin Independent Journal. 'He was generous and good natured, but he just had that demon in there. 'There is no blame in this at all. It's not the bridge's fault, it's not anybody's fault. 'It's just that he was a very troubled young man. He had a problem and that's it.' In February, Sean Moylan, while dealing with the breakdown of a relationship, stepped in front of a commercial truck on a highway in Oregon. At the time police said he was out walking his dog near the town of Eugene, but had let go of the dog's leash before walking into the path of the truck. Sean was critically injured after the driver was unable to stop. However his grandfather said he appeared to have fully recovered from the injuries when he had lunch with him last Sunday. 'My niece was here from Ireland and he was laughing and talking with the kids,' Mr Moylan told the paper. 'Everything was fine.' John Moylan, pictured here at a Golden Gate Bridge event in 2012, is a longtime member of the board of directors for the Golden Gate district . A body believed to be Sean's was pulled from the water by the Coast Guard about 4.22pm Thursday. Mr Moylan said there is a bridge board meeting slated for June 29 to discuss funding for a suicide net under the bridge - a $68 million project that has been under discussion for some time. Mr Moylan said Sean's death will very much be on his mind during the meeting. More than 1,500 people have jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge - which stands about 220 feet from the road to the water - since it opened in 1937. Another 80 or so contemplating suicide are pulled off the bridge every year. Mr Moylan said he has always been at the forefront of bringing in barriers and imposing other means that would safeguard the bridge from suicide attempts. 'But that's not going to stop suicide,' he said. 'Suicide is an epidemic in this country. 'Sean will be thought about at the next board meeting, that's for sure, and all the others. 'But we can't lay it on the bridge.' If you are struggling with suicidal thoughts, please call the Samaritans hotline on (877)-870-4673 .","Sean Moylan, 27, of Novato, jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge on Thursday afternoon .

The mother of the Somali teenager who stowed away on a plane from California to Hawaii has left a refugee camp in Ethiopia, saying that threats have been made against her life.

'She's quite unstable now.' Abdule has not seen her teenage son in eight years. She told The Associated Press that the boy longed to see her, but couldn't because his father told him she was dead and didn't allow contact. 'I know he was looking for me, and I am requesting the U.S. government to help me reunite with my kids,' she has said. Since her son's trip in April, Abdule says she has received threats from callers she believes are relatives of her former husband.

As with past requests, Yusuf has not responded. He had previously said in a statement that his son was simply 'struggling adjusting to life' in America. 'Our situation was aggravated by our displacement in Africa for many years after fleeing our home country of Somalia because of war conditions,' the statement said.

"By . Joel Christie . He was essentially the most unpopular person in New York's East Village during the drastic renovations of his home. But Friends star David Schwimmer seems to be slowly winning back his neighbors after helping police investigate a crime on Monday. A brawl broke out in a first-floor apartment around 5.40am in a building that adjoins the actor's home on East Sixth Street. The fight spilled into the hallway before the trio smashed through a glass lobby, according to The New York Post. Cooperative: Actor David Schwimmer turned over video footage taken on the security cameras of his East Village home to the New York Police Department . Controversial: David Schwimmer paid $3.7 million for his East Village apartment, which sits at 331 E. Sixth St, in 2008, causing drama in the neighborhood when he knocked the existing building down . A 26-year-old man was taken to Bellevue Hospital with stab wounds to the face. His transvestite prostitute ran away and the third man was arrested. Robert Rainey, 21, of Newark, was charged with assault, criminal possession of a weapon and robbery. Following the incident, police noticed a security camera on Schwimmer's property. Investigators asked the 47-year-old if the cameras recorded any footage of the fight. Schwimmer surrendered the tape, which may now be used in court. The star, who played Ross Geller on Friends for 10 years, paid $4 million for his 331 E. Sixth St. home in 2010. He outraged locals in 2012 when he knocked down the existing building, which was 160-years-old. Classic: From 1994 to 2004, David Schwimmer played Ross Geller opposite Jennifer Aniston on Friends . 'Four years ago, I would say David Schwimmer was the least popular guy on the block with the construction and all,' said resident Jayson Fillermutter, 31. 'But he has turned out to be a decent neighbor, and I am glad to hear he helped the cops with that stabbing.' The structure Schwimmer bought was built in 1852. He paid $3.7 million for it in 2008. A demolition permit filed in 2011 listed 'demolition of front and rear facades, demolition of all floors roof structure, side masonry walls to remain'. The cream-colored building was torn down and replaced with a brick building.","Crime occurred outside the actor's $4 million East Village home .

"By . Associated Press . and Alexandra Klausner . A man twice convicted of killing a woman and eight children at a birthday sleepover in the city's deadliest house fire was sentenced Friday to 35 years in federal prison. Antun Lewis, 30, had asked the judge in U.S. District Court in Cleveland for mercy and expressed condolences to the families of the victims, some of whom he knew. He said someone committed the crime 'but it's a lie that person was me.' Lewis, a convicted drug dealer, was deemed ineligible for the death penalty because of a mental disability. His attorneys presented evidence he has an IQ of 70 or less. Antun Lewis, 30, of Cleveland, twice convicted of killing nine people in Cleveland's deadliest arson fire was sentenced to 35 years behind bars . A memorial back in 2012 was made on the steps of the burned-out house where 9 people were burned to death by Antun Lewis . Under federal sentencing guidelines, he could have been sentenced to life for his arson conviction.The . fire killed 33-year-old Medeia Carter, four of her children and four . other youngsters attending a birthday sleepover on May 21, 2005. Killed in the fire were four of Carter's children: 15-year-old Davonte Carter, 13-year-old Moses Williams, 12-year-old Maleeya Williams and 7-year-old Fakih Jones. Also killed were Media Carter's 34-year-old sister, Sheria Carter, and Sheria's son Antwone Jackson, 14. Collins identified the other victims as Jackson's cousin Ernest Tate, 13, and a friend, 13-year-old Miles Cockfield. Carter's mother, Evelyn Martin, also spoke at the hearing, recounting the horrific events of that late night and early morning. Six of the eight children who died were Martin's grandchildren. She said she rushed to the house when she learned of the fire, pushed through a crowd and screamed one question over and over: 'Where are my babies?' 'I had to stand there and watch them bring them out one by one,' Martin said.

Judge Solomon Oliver said he had trouble believing Lewis set the fire over a drug debt and called the case the toughest he has heard in 20 years on the federal bench. He said he had to weigh various factors, including the public's safety and Lewis' disabilities, in deciding on an appropriate sentence. 'This will keep him off the streets for a very long time,' he said. Lewis has long maintained he was at home, several blocks away, when the fire started. His attorneys have said that there was no drug debt and that he passed two polygraph tests. But after the sentencing, U.S. Attorney Steven Dettelbach called Lewis a 'coward in the night.' 'Nothing can ever erase the pain this defendant caused,' he said. Cleveland fire Battalion Chief Patrick Mangan stood in the middle of the courtroom and gave a victim's statement, graphically describing what confronted him and his colleagues when they rushed into the home hoping to save lives. The images, he said, still haunt him. Shuantavia Mitchell (left) and Earnest Tate (right) died in the horrific Ohio fire while they were having a sleepover . 'There's no answer on this Earth for what happened that night,' he said. Rosalind Golden, whose 13-year-old grandson, Miles Cockfield, was killed in the fire, looked at Lewis and told him he had deprived the world of a wonderful person. 'I don't mean to cry every day,' she said, fighting back tears. 'I pray to God just not to cry today.' The judge presided over Lewis' first trial, in early 2011. While a jury convicted Lewis of a count of arson, the judge overturned the verdict because of concerns about the reliability of jailhouse informants who testified against him. The defense portrayed the jailhouse snitches as witnesses willing to say anything in return for lighter sentences. The 6th U.S. District Court of Appeals upheld the judge's ruling in February 2012 and ordered that Lewis be given a new trial. The appellate judges pointed out that one witness had a 30-year criminal record and a sixth-grade education, bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder and had spent half his life between state hospitals and prisons. That witness also gave numerous inconsistent and contradictory statements about the night of the fire to investigators and at trial, and phone records showed some of them were inaccurate, the judges said. Prosecutors used some of the witnesses during the second trial, in December 2013, and a jury returned another guilty verdict. Lewis testified in his own defense at the second trial.","Antun Lewis, 30 was not eligible for the death penalty because he had a mental disability and an IQ of 70 or less .

"By . Amanda Williams . Sgt Charles Pilbeam, 30, is accused of forcing Somalian Abdi Ali-Ahmed to the ground to pick up pieces of paper from an interview room floor while on all fours . A police sergeant stamped on a mentally ill prisoner’s foot during a strip search and told him 'Welcome to Hackney’, a court heard today. Sgt Charles Pilbeam, 30, is accused of forcing Somalian Abdi Ali-Ahmed to the ground to pick up pieces of paper from an interview room floor while on all fours. At . the time of the events, the man - who is in his 20s - was prevented . getting dressed after a full strip-search by Pilbeam, it is claimed. The . alleged victim had ‘a difficult childhood’ in . war-torn Somalia and suffers from multiple mental health issues. He had not been arrested but was being served with a dispersal notice, having voluntarily given up a small bag of cannabis, Westminster Magistrates Court heard. The court heard Pilbeam tried to cover-up the alleged incident at Shoreditch Police Station, east London. He is aslo accused of telling trainee constable Cordelle Sailsman not to report the incident - which was witnessed by wo fully-qualified PCs. Brian Sharkey and Rob Baker, saw the events and were interviewed under caution for alleged misconduct. The men were never charged with any offence, but their accounts have already been branded ‘silent or very vague...on what actually happened’. Prosecutor Dickon Reid said: ‘There are two allegations of assault on the same complainant, Mr Abdi Ali-Ahmed. ‘By way of background, he [Mr Ali-Ahmed] had been brought to the police station having been searched...he was strip-searched. ‘Towards the end of this search, the . prosecution say Mr Pilbeam first of all deliberately stamped on the . victim’s toes and also pulled him by the ear, twisted it and pulled him . to the ground and demanded he pick up paper [the notice] he had ripped . up.’ The dispersal notice, . handed over in the presence of Pilbeam, PC Sailsman, PC Sharkey and PC . Baker, required him leave the East London borough. After Mr Ali-Ahmed, who had been drinking, told the officers to ‘f***’ off’, Pilbeam moved forward with ‘a purposeful march’. The officer then crushed his alleged victim’s foot with his own, for ‘approximately one minute’, Mr Reid said. ‘Mr Baker tried to give him the dispersal form again. He ripped it up.’ Pilbeam then ‘stepped on the waistband’ of Mr Ali-Ahmed’s to prevent him from putting his trousers back on, Mr Reid added. ‘You . are going to f*****g pick that up. This is my police station and you . are going to pick it up’, Pilbeam allegedly ranted, adding: 'This is my . clean police station, f*****g  pick it up.’ Prosecutor Dickon Reid told Westminster Magistrates' Court: 'Towards the end of this search, the prosecution say Mr Pilbeam first of all deliberately stamped on the victim's toes and also pulled him by the ear, twisted it and pulled him to the ground and demanded he pick up paper [the notice] he had ripped up' It is claimed that Pilbeam then grabbed his homeless victim by the ear, forced him to the ground and forced him to pick up individual shreds. When Mr Ali-Ahmed asked why he deserved this abuse, Pilbeam allegedly replied ‘Welcome to Hackney’. PC Sailsman, who was training at the time but now fully qualified, said he was ‘very certain’ the assaults took place on March 2 last year. He claimed PC Baker ‘turned and looked at me and raised his eyebrows’ while their superior attacked the prisoner. PC Sailsman said Pilbeam later told him not to report the incident and said: ‘I’m sorry to have put you in that situation. Don’t make notes, I will write it up.’ The court heard Pilbeam tried to cover-up the alleged incident at Shoreditch Police Station, east London (pictured) The softly-spoken officer added: ‘I felt quite intimidated at the time.’ PC Sailsman immediately reported the events to a superior at Stoke Newington police station. He recounted Pilbeam was ‘breathing heavily, almost panting’, before the alleged assaults. PC Sailsman added that Pilbeam also stamped on Mr Ali-Ahmed’s shin. He said when Mr Ali-Ahmed asked what the dispersal notice was, PC Baker replied ‘We don’t want you in Hackney’. PC Sailsman said later he heard Pilbeam on the phone to an inspector, calling Mr Ali-Ahmed a ‘local sl*g’ and reassuring him he would write up the incident. Defence counsel Guy Ladenburg suggested Mr Ali-Ahmed was potentially violent, but PC Sailsman maintained he was ‘very compliant’ and seated at all times. ‘In my opinion, he was scared’, PC Sailsman commented. Pilbeam, of Stevenage, Hertfordshire, denies two offences of common assault. The trial continues.

"By . Amanda Williams . and Eoin Murphy . and Sandra Mallon . A model who has been linked to golf ace Rory McIlory has walked away from a motorway crash with barely more than a sore head after flipping her car eight times. Nadia Forde, who was spotted on a night out with the Northern Irish sportsman earlier this month, has told friends she is ‘lucky to be alive’ after the horror smash on the M40 motorway, headed towards Birmingham from London. The singer was taken to hospital with ‘bumps and bruises’ on Sunday when her car – a Fiat 500 – hit the central reservation during a heavy downpour. Emergency services were called to the M40 London to Birmingham motorway just outside the capital, but the 25-year-old surprised medics by walking away from the crash virtually unscathed. Scroll down for video . Nadia Forde, a model who has been linked with golf ace Rory McIlory has walked away from a terrifying motorway crash with just a bump on her head . Miss Forde, who is launching a pop career, is believed to have been introduced to McIlory at a Dubai bar. Both have downplayed rumours of a romance . Miss Forde, who is launching a pop career, is believed to have been introduced to McIlory at a Dubai bar. McIlroy and Danish tennis star Caroline Wozniacki ended their relationship in May. The Northern Irish golfer and his 23-year-old former fiancée were due to wed in November. But McIlroy, 25, is said to have ended their three-year relationship in a 180 second phone call because he was not prepared for 'all that marriage entails'. Miss Forde was discharged yesterday morning and was resting when contacted by the Irish Daily Mail. According to her spokesman, Joanne Byrne: ‘She was so lucky. The car flipped seven or eight times. It is completely written off and the fact that she was able to walk away without any broken bones or serious injuries is nothing short of a miracle. ‘When she climbed out of the wreckage, the woman in the car behind her couldn’t believe that she had escaped. She was shaken up by the whole ordeal. She has a bump on the head and was taken to hospital to have it checked out but apart from that she seems okay. ‘She is thanking her guardian angel because she knows she is lucky to be alive.’ Miss Forde is in the UK to promote her debut pop single, BPM, in cities such as Cardiff and Newcastle, before she flies to Ibiza for a performance. A British spokesman for the singer said: ‘Apart from a few minor bumps and bruises, Nadia is fine. She feels very lucky to be alive and to have escaped with such minor injuries and relieved that no one else was injured.’ Miss Forde, who was spotted out on the town with the Irish sportsman earlier this month, has told friends she is 'lucky to be alive' after her car flipped eight times on the M40 motorway towards Birmingham . In 2009, Miss Forde was had another lucky escape just a few months after her then boyfriend, FM104 DJ Mark Noble was involved in a serious smash. She was left shaken but uninjured after her Peugeot skidded on a wet road near Dublin’s East Link toll bridge and smashed into the car in front of her. Miss Forde has poured cold water on suggestions of a relationship, claiming she was ‘young, free and happily single’ despite being spotted leaving a Dublin nightclub with the Co.Down sportsman at 3am last month. The FHM model admitted last week that she had met the golfer but insisted: ‘He doesn’t  even have my phone number and I don’t have his.’ She said: ‘I met Rory last year through friends. He’s a lovely guy. We have mutual friends who introduced us and we’ve been in each other’s company. Emergency services were called to the M40 London to Birmingham motorway just outside the capital (stock picture), but the 25-year-old surprised medics by walking away from the crash virtually unscathed . Asked if Rory was her type, she replied: ‘I don’t really have a type, to be honest. For me it’s not about looks. It’s about the person. I think whoever I end up with, I will be friends with first. ‘The important thing is having somebody with ambition and drive who is hard-working. That for me is a massive turn-on.’ Miss Forde said she was enjoying her promotional tour of Britain. Speaking at the Irish premiere of Transformers: Age Of Extinction earlier this month, she said: ‘I’ve loved music for years and I was kind of afraid that there would be no reaction so any kind of reaction is great for me and I’m so happy. ‘And I have dancers. I’m picking the dancers – I want them to be hot for the girls and hot for the boys. I’m loving the whole process.’ Asked if she would date a dancer, she said: ‘They’re not into females so no.’","Model Nadia Forde was spotted out with Irish sportsman earlier this month .

"By . Amanda Williams . Ex Cleveland chief constable Sean Price received £336,000 after being dismissed . Two former senior police officers have received £467,000 in pension payments - despite being sacked for gross misconduct. Ex-Cleveland chief constable Sean Price and his deputy Derek Bonnard received £336,000 and £131,000 respectively after being dismissed. Both . officers were arrested in 2011 as part of Operation Sacristy, the £4.6m . investigation into allegations of corruption at the force and the . now-defunct police authority which resulted in no criminal charges. Mr Price was fired in 2012 after a hearing which found he had lied about his role in the recruitment of the former police authority chairman Dave McLuckie's daughter. In March, Mr Bonnard was dismissed in March after six counts of gross misconduct were upheld, including the misuse of a corporate credit card. Both men had denied any wrongdoing. The officers were entitled to the payments under the terms of their contracts. A police spokeswoman said the strict rules that determine when a pension can be forfeited are set out in law. 'To be considered, a person has to be convicted in court of specific criminal offences. These are: treason, offences under the Official Secrets Act with a sentence of at least ten years, or a criminal offence connected to service which is liable to lead to serious loss of public confidence, or is gravely injurious to the interests of the Secretary of State. Forfeiture proceedings have to be approved by the Home Secretary. 'Revocation or reduction of pensionable pay can therefore only occur if an officer is convicted in court of one of these criminal offences. 'It cannot be applied to police officers who are dismissed for misconduct or who choose to resign facing a misconduct hearing.' Details of their pension payments were revealed following a Freedom of Information request. The force said chief constable Jacqui Cheer and police and crime commissioner Barry Coppinger had both raised the matter but there was no indication the government planned to change the regulations. Derek Bonnard received £131,000 after being dismissed after six counts of gross misconduct against him were upheld, including the misuse of a corporate credit card . Mr Price said: 'I was in the police service for nearly 33 years rising from the rank of constable to chief constable. 'During that time paid up to 11 per cent of my salary into my pension fund, as do all other police officers.' The former chief constable said he was still looking forward to clearing his name. 'A number of witnesses have now approached me who could not help at the time, due to restrictions placed upon them by the Operation Sacristy criminal investigation, which cost £5m of taxpayers money and was ultimately completely ill founded and unsuccessful. Both officers were arrested in 2011 as part of Operation Sacristy, the £4.6m investigation into allegations of corruption at the Cleveland Police and the now-defunct police authority which resulted in no criminal charges . 'Statements are in the process of being obtained from these witnesses. The legal advice I have received is that is that this new evidence ""was not or could not have been considered by the misconduct panel at the time"" and provides grounds to appeal against my dismissal, even after the time that has passed.' Mr Bonnard said: 'As is the case for all police officers I made payments into the pension scheme throughout my career. The pension I receive is set by national police pension regulations'. Stockton . South MP James Wharton said: 'It is clear that Operation Sacristy has . been an expensive and disruptive failure which appears to have started . with the right intentions, but then got badly out of hand. 'Cleveland Police needs to demonstrate it has learned lessons but I fear a lot still needs to be done.'","Ex-Cleveland chief constable Sean Price and deputy Derek Bonnard received £336,000 and £131,000 respectively .

Amateur historian Kirsty Olley made the grim discovery as she was trying to find out more about her family history at St Margaret’s Church at Old Catton, Norwich. It is believed the remains were from an ancient grave which was accidentally disturbed by workmen while they were building a new toilet and kitchenette on the 15th century site. The area of excavation has not been used for burials since 1899. A woman has discovered a human skull, jawbone and teeth from a disturbed grave scattered around a churchyard in Norwich after workmen dug up the ground during work . Mrs Olley, of Thorpe Marriott, said: 'It was quite obvious by the state of the churchyard that they had recently had some ground works. 'But to find human remains of these poor people who were laid to rest many years ago was both very disturbing and very upsetting.' The parochial church council (PCC) of St Margaret’s Church has now apologised. A PCC spokeswoman said contractors have been building a new toilet and kitchenette. She admitted it was 'regrettable' procedures had not been followed and said the contractor was 'extremely apologetic'. She said: 'While most of the work was carried out within the church building, there was some excavation, mainly in front of the church entrance. Kirsty Olley was trying to find out more about her family history at St Margaret's Church at Old Catton, Norwich, when she discovered the bones strewn around the grounds . 'Under Church of England regulations, excavated soil from a consecrated churchyard cannot be removed and has to remain in the churchyard. 'Some may be re-used for backfilling, but the remainder has to be stockpiled and then spread and levelled within the churchyard.' She said that during the spreading and levelling of excavated material some bone fragments had been found. 'The procedure for dealing with bone fragments is that they should be collected by the contractor, bagged, labelled and carefully stored for subsequent re-interment,' she said. 'In this instance, the fragments were collected, but not bagged and stored. 'This is regretted by the contractor, as well as the PCC.' She said the bone fragments were collected, bagged and removed from the churchyard within two hours and were now securely stored.","Kirsty Olley found bones at St Margaret’s Church at Old Catton, Norwich .

A fugitive prisoner who has fathered five children and has come to the attention of the authorities three times during 15 years on the run is finally back behind bars. Michael Sheridan walked out of HMP Standford Hill in Kent on October 17 1999. Since his escape he has come to the attention of authorities in Ireland three times - but he remained a wanted fugitive until May this year when police were called to his home in Washington, Wearside, and checks revealed he was a prisoner on the run. The now 39-year-old had been serving an 18 month sentence for attempted burglary imposed at Blackfriars Crown Court on July 1 1999. Prison staff then realised he was missing when he failed to return from day release at the open prison. Prosecutor Michael Bunch told Newcastle Crown Court today: 'He was marked down as wanted by the police for the absconding in 1999 and as a  result was arrested. 'He confirmed he had walked out of the open prison in October 1999, had returned to Ireland and accepted he had been unlawfully at large for the whole of the intervening period.' The court heard in 2007, 2010 and 2013 Sheridan was stopped by the Gardaí in Ireland for driving matters but the authorities there were not aware of his wanted status in the English jurisdiction. Sheridan, of Barmston, Washington, pleaded guilty to escape. Recorder Mr Murray jailed him for eight months. The judge told him: 'You were sent to HMP Standford Hill, a category D prison, and trust was placed in you not to escape. Since his opportunistic escape from Standford Hill open prison (pictured) he has come to the attention of authorities in Ireland three times - but  he remained a wanted fugitive until May this year when police were called to his home in Washington, Wearside, and checks revealed he was a prisoner on the run . 'You breached that trust and succumbed to temptation. I accept this was no great, planned escape, it was opportunistic. You then kept clear of the authorities for nearly 15 years. 'The aggravating features are the breach of trust and the fact you left the jurisdiction and that you did so for nearly 15 years. 'These offences have to be marked with imprisonment, firstly to punish the absconder but also to send a message to those who might be thinking about it.' The court heard Sheridan had been remanded in custody while awaiting sentence in 1999 after being caught at Holyhead making a first attempt to flee to Ireland. Newcastle Crown Court heard in 2007, 2010 and 2013 Sheridan was stopped by the Gardaí in Ireland for driving matters but the authorities there were not aware of his wanted status in the English jurisdiction . After he received the 18 month prison term he served a few months behind bars before simply walking out of jail. Jamie Adams, defending, said Sheridan was grieving the sudden death of his brother at the time and wanted to get back to his family in Ireland. Mr Adams said: 'It was not an elaborate escape, it was really quite sad  when you look at all the circumstances. 'It is the best part of 15 years on now he’s having to answer for something that he did way back when he was 24. 'One can perhaps understand why he might put everything to the back of his mind when he’s leading what seems to be a crime free life in southern Ireland, having brought up a family of five children.'","Michael Sheridan walked out of HMP Standford Hill in Kent in 1999 .

"By . Amanda Williams . A mother broke down in tears as she was cleared of causing or allowing the death of her four-month-old baby daughter today. Kelly-Marie Rayner, 26, was accused of contributing to the death of baby Kiera Conlin, on May 6 last year. But Mr Justice Royce directed the jury at Winchester Crown Court to deliver a not guilty verdict against banking advisor Ms Rayner, three weeks into the trial. Kelly-Marie Rayner, 26, was accused of contributing to the death of baby Kiera Conlin, on May 6 last year, but was today cleared by a jury . The child's father, Ross Conlin, 29, is alleged to have shaken Kiera in anger so hard that she had a heart attack and stopped . breathing, while he was looking after her alone. The charges against him remain. The . crown allege he caused her fatal injuries, including eight rib . fractures, three skull fractures and bleeding in her eye sockets. Ms Rayner was met by her family outside court where she was embraced by her stepfather Paul Rayner and mother Dawn. Mr Justice Royce told the jury of three women and nine men: 'Ladies and gentlemen, I’m sorry you have been delayed in the resumption of this trial. 'The position at the end of the prosecution case was that certain legal matters required discussion. 'The result of that is I have determined the case against Kelly Rayner should go no further. 'It’s my responsibility even though she is in your charge. Ms Rayner was met by her family outside court where she was embraced by her stepfather Paul Rayner and mother Dawn . A jury at  Winchester Crown Court delivered a not guilty verdict against banking advisor Ms Rayner, three weeks into the trial. The child's father, Ross Conlin, 29, is alleged to have shaken Kiera in anger so hard that she had a heart attack and stopped breathing, while he was looking after her alone. The charges against him remain . 'In effect, you are all agreed in your verdict you find her not guilty. I take responsibility on that. 'Mr Conlin remains charged on the counts he faces.' Ms Rayner then stood, thanked the judge and the jury and left the court. Debt collector Conlin, said to be stressed out at work, denies murder and three charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent in her tragic last months. On May 6 last year, Kiera was rushed to hospital from her grandparents’ home in Farnborough, Hampshire. At the time, Conlin was alone with her while Rayner, a banking advisor, was out for a nail appointment and grandfather Paul Rayner was at B&Q. Conlin dialled 999, saying his daughter was ‘limp’ having not been breathing for four minutes. Paramedics revived the youngster and took her to Frimley Park Hospital, but she was later transferred to Southampton General Hospital, for expert treatment. Despite this, she was pronounced brain dead and a life support machine was turned off at 6.30pm the next day. She died in her mother’s arms at 7pm. The trial continues.

"By . Amanda Williams . An unemployed family claim documentary makers made them look like 'racist morons' after they appeared on controversial TV show ‘Benefits Britain: Life On The Dole’. Gordon Higinbotham - who has a foot long tattoo of Adolf Hitler on his back - and his daughter and son-in-law, Roseanne and Mark Snowden, claim they are now too scared to leave their home after receiving death threats following the Channel 5 programme. More than 2.5 million people tuned into the hour-long show which followed three families claiming benefits in Hull, East Yorkshire. During the programme on Monday Mr Higinbotham's 15 tattoos were on display - including a ‘White Power’ slogan, the foot-long image of Adolf Hitler, which dominates his back, and an intricate picture of the Ku Klux Klan, which runs across the length of his stomach. Scroll down for video . Gordon Higinbotham - who has a foot long tattoo of Adolf Hitler on his back - claims documentary makers made him look like a 'racist moron' after he appeared on controversial TV show 'Benefits Britain: Life On The Dole' Mr Higinbotham  and his daughter and son-in-law, Roseanne and Mark Snowden (pictured), claim they are now too scared to leave their home after receiving death threats following the Channel 5 programme . During the programme, father-of-four Mr Higinbotham said he had never had had a full-time job due to having a disabled son, and a lack of help by the Government. But he drew criticism from many members of the public, after he offered to pay daugher and son in law money to vote UKIP in the EU elections. He was filmed saying, ‘You tell me you’ve voted UKIP and I’ll give you some money’, before walking around Hull’s largest council estate in a jacket with ‘Skinheads Forever’ across the back. He claims he was portrayed as racist in the footage, after being filmed saying: 'I like anyone as long as they’re English'. The family have since issued an apology to the entire city of Hull in a bid to stave off trouble after fearing reprisals for their appearance. Mr Higinbotham's strong political views angered many members of the public, after he offered to pay his daugher and son-in-law money to vote UKIP in the EU elections . He was filmed saying: 'You tell me you've voted UKIP and I'll give you some money', before walking around Hull's largest council estate in a jacket with 'Skinheads Forever' across the back . He said: 'I can’t even leave the house without people telling me they want to kill me. 'We have been completely screwed over by Channel 5. 'I only went on the show to stick up for poor people and they have twisted what we said to make us look like morons.' 'I like everybody,' he said. 'I have got Indian friends and I know people from all over the world. I like all these people. 'I went through a really bad patch when my dad and my brother’s girlfriend died, and I turned to drink. I got in a fight with some foreign people and I was in a bad place so I had the tattoos done. 'I really regret them now, and I want to get them removed.' When the programme-makers announced in March that filming had begun, politicians expressed fears it would show Hull in a bad light. Mr Higinbotham said: 'I wish I had listened to the advice now. 'I am getting so much abuse from people in the street, calling me a fat so-and-so and a fat Hitler. 'I am no racist and I am definitely not fat. The programme made me look so podgy, I watched in horror.' Roseanne Snowden, who is now four months pregnant with her first child, is married to husband Mark, and receives £114-a-week as well as a flat funded by the state . The family agreed to take part after they received a flyer asking people on benefits to contribute to the documentary. Roseanne Snowden, who is now four months pregnant with her first child, is married to husband Mark, and receives £114-a-week as well as a flat funded by the state. They have both been job hunting for years, but say they are unable to find any work, so took part in the Channel 5 show to try and secure full time employment. She said: 'Mark has been unemployed for three years and he was doing a job search on a computer in the job centre. 'There was some leaflets next to him, which asked if you wanted to get into full time work. 'We thought it was an opportunity for him to find a job, and they were really nice and professional. 'But they have humiliated us, we are devastated.' The family have apologised for the way the programme made Hull look, but say they were completely set-up by Channel 5. Mrs Snowden, 23, said: 'They filmed me in interviews for college, both Mark and I applying for 25 jobs each, but did you see any of that? 'Mark got teaching qualifications while they were filming, but they didn’t put any of it in. On the show, Mr Higinbotham's 15 tattoos were also shown - including a 'White Power' slogan, a foot-long image of Adolf Hitler, which dominates his back, and an intricate picture of the Ku Klux Klan, which runs across the length of his stomach . 'We’re so sorry but we feel really stupid. The only reason we wanted to do it was to get enough publicity to get full time work. 'They made us look really bad, and we have been really badly abused for being on the show.' Mr Higinbotham, whose son suffers from curvature of the spine, is paid £200 a week in benefits. He said: 'They said that I haven’t worked in decades but they didn’t explain the reasons why. ''They have ruined my life. People are now telling me I should be killed. ' They have since contacted Channel 5 to raise their concerns over the programme, but their complaints have fallen on deaf ears. Mr Snowden, a 29-year-old history graduate, said: 'We rang them up to ask them why they edited it to make us look so bad but they don’t care. 'They even offered us a chance to take part in a follow-up, but they must be joking. 'They have made us look like clowns in a freak show. 'We can’t leave the house because we’re being hassled. Even little kids are knocking on the door asking for selfies.' The family believe Channel 5 is trying to mimics Channel 4’s success with Benefits Street. Mr Higinbotham added: 'I think because Benefits Street was so successful they think that if they do a show that’s just as bad, they’ll get loads of money. 'They promised us everything and they haven’t done anything to help us.' A spokesman from Channel 5 told Mail Online: 'Benefits Britain: Life on the Dole is a documentary series from Channel 5 exploring the issues and challenges created by unemployment and debt nationwide. The programme is an observational one which shows accurately the lives and feelings of various residents around the UK, including Gordon Higinbotham. 'The programme faithfully reported his views, and fulfilled its obligation to portray Mr Higinbotham fairly throughout filming, with his story straight from his own mouth. 'He was very positive about wanting to be in the show throughout, and keen to have his views heard. There was no interference or manipulation from the production team at any point.

"By . Amanda Williams . Whitney Berridge took an overdose after trolls texted her taunts about the death of her mother who hanged herself at their family home nearly two years earlier, an inquest has heard . A teenage girl took an overdose after a troll texted her taunts about the death of her mother who hanged herself at their family home nearly two years earlier, an inquest has heard. Whitney Berridge, 15, was still mourning the death of her mother Shanie and had told relatives that she wanted to be with her again, the inquest at Alton heard. The hearing was told that Whitney’s . mother was found hanged at the then family home in the Popley . area of Basingstoke on May 6, 2012. Leigh-Ann O’Leary, Whitney’s aunt who . she lived with, told the coroner that her mother’s death had affected . the schoolgirl deeply. She . said: 'She has said she wanted to be with her mum when she first came . to live with me and she told me the story of what really happened the . day her mum died. 'Whitney . did find it difficult, she burst out crying when she told me she found . her mother hanging. She told me she saw her mum hanging there and went . upstairs and put earphones on and stayed in bed for four-and-a-half . hours.' Ms O’Leary said that . Whitney was sensitive about any comments about her mother and had . recently received a text message from a boy taunting her about her . mother's death, which told her to go and kill herself, 'like your mother did'. She added that Whitney had left a video message saying she intended to kill herself on the day she died. The hearing was told that the schoolgirl took an overdose of medication that he had for a condition she suffered from. She died later that evening of April 19 at the North Hampshire Hospital in Basingstoke. Hundreds of people gathered in Basingstoke's War Memorial Park on Monday April 28 to remember the teenager on what would have been her 16th birthday. They let off pink balloons, as it was her favourite colour. Ms O¿Leary said that Whitney was sensitive about any comments about her mother and had recently received a text message from a boy taunting her about her mother's death . North Hampshire coroner Andrew Bradley . recorded an open verdict saying that because of Whitney’s age she could . not have had a 'settled intention' to commit suicide. He . said: 'It’s a sad matter. The sadness of this case is that I . adjudicated the case of Shanie Berridge who is Whitney’s mother in . circumstances which were equally sad. 'The effect that had on Whitney I think none of us can estimate because she is the one who found her. 'How much that played on Whitney’s mind we shall never know, it’s clear she missed her mum, she loved her mum very much. 'The sensitivities she felt at any criticism of her or her mum were deeply felt, she had very low self-esteem, she had previously self-harmed and had previously taken an overdose.' Flowers laid at a tree in memory of the teenager. North Hampshire coroner Andrew Bradley recorded an open verdict saying that because of Whitney's age she could not have had a 'settled intention' to commit suicide . He added: 'In order to find a verdict of suicide I have to be satisfied that she had a settled intention to die, that she no longer wanted to be with us. 'The view I take is that at 15 she couldn’t take that settled decision.' Prior to the inquest, Ms O’Leary told the Basingstoke Gazette: 'Whitney and her mum were very close. 'When Shanie died, Whitney died with her. 'Something absolutely changed her when her mum died.' Whitney had been studying for her GCSE exams at the Everest Community Academy. Julie Rose, principal, said: 'She was a lively, interesting young lady who had her life ahead of her and unfortunately has been taken away and it has hit our students very hard and we are having to work quite hard to support them.'

"By . Amanda Williams . Leanne Nicholson swindled nearly £300,000 from two of her elderly clients . A financial adviser who befriended pensioners and cheated them out of nearly £300,000 has been jailed for two years. Leanne Nicholson appeared to live an affluent lifestyle, running her business from her £600,000 five-bed luxury home in an upmarket neighbourhood. But the 47-year-old ran into financial problems when her business failed - and she took £290,000 off her clients, knowing she would be unable to pay it back, to fund a lavish lifestyle saw her drive a top of the range Lexus SUV and rent a grand piano for her home. Derby Crown Court was told the men, one in his 90s who had just lost his wife, the other in his 80s, were both 'flattered by her attentions'. The younger victim said the fraud left him feeling 'like he wanted to die'. Nicholson became a trusted friend to the men, who were clients of hers. She met regularly with them in their homes and would send them Christmas cards. One remembered when she turned up with a flask of coffee and an egg sandwich. But prosecutor David Allan said Nicholson 'subverted the trust' of the vulnerable men. He said: 'She persuaded two of her elderly clients to loan her £290,000 in several tranches over two years. 'By 2010, at the latest, her finances were such that she must have known there was a serious risk she could not repay the loans and therefore her actions were dishonest. 'She has now been declared bankrupt and it appears that her old clients will never recover the vast majority of what they lent her.'.' Derby Crown Court was told the men, one in his 90s who had just lost his wife, the other in his 80s, were both 'flattered by her attentions'. The younger victim said the fraud left him feeling 'like he wanted to die' The court heard the older victim gave her money that had been left by his late wife, and was intended for his children. The victim, who was frail, was defrauded of £80,000. He . told police he felt 'a fool' and his daughter said: 'My father feels he . was the custodian of my mother’s estate... and feels he has failed his . children.' Mr Allan said the other victim lost £210,000. The prosecutor said he now feared he would have to sell his house to pay off a £61,000 tax bill incurred by cashing in an investment bond in order to give Nicholson the money. Police launched an investigation after family members of one of the victims contacted trading standards. Nicholson became a trusted friend to the men, who were clients of hers . The court heard that Nicholson formerly of Derbyshire had used the money to pay off personal and business debts . Nicholson, who claimed she had intended to pay back all the money, pleaded guilty to six counts of fraud by abuse of position committed in 2010 and 2011. Before she was sentenced, she described the affair as a 'very distressing episode' in her life and there had been a 'pernicious and relentless pursuit' to prove her dishonesty. She said: 'The sooner this phase is concluded, the sooner I can work towards putting things right and reimbursing the individuals affected.' But Recorder Andrew Smith QC said she had been told in 2011 her business had been poorly administered and, in effect, insolvent. Sentencing her to two years and four months in jail, he said: 'You substantially abused your position as an independent financial adviser. 'The effect of your offending is not to be underestimated, you have caused them (the victims) stress and anxiety and introduced uncertainty into their lives and that of their families. 'One of the victims told police your actions had made him want to die and these events had ruined his life.' Philip Bown, in mitigation, said Nicholson had abused her position, but it was not her intention to permanently deprive them. 'There isn’t any indication that Leanne Nicholson in any way wanted to cover up the financial arrangements that had been arrived at between her and the two unfortunately elderly clients,' he said. 'She is deeply sorry, her remorse is palpable,' he added. A compensation hearing will take place at a later date to see if bankrupt Nicholson now of Duffield, Derbyshire, is in a position to pay any money back to her victims.","Leanne Nicholson befriended two men - a widower in his 90s and one in 80s .

Rush hour commuters poured out of Chancery Lane station in central London while others were in tears following the bomb scare at 9.30am. Those nearby reported hearing the man's bag 'pop' and then start to smoke, before he threw it down on the platform, sparking chaos at the station. Rush hour commuters poured out of Chancery Lane station in central London while others were in tears after smoke started pouring out of a man's bag . The man who owned the device immediately got off the Tube and spoke to staff after he realised his device was smoking, British Transport Police said. A spokesman said no one was hurt in the incident, and it is not being treated as suspicious. It is not yet known what the device or manufacturer was involved. 'It looks like a battery in a . passenger’s device which he had in his bag has overheated, and that is . what caused the sparks and smoke to come from his bag. 'We don’t know what the device is, if it is a laptop or a computer. 'He . then approached staff and explained what happened.

Commuters tweeted about the panic sweeping the underground this morning . Another witness, Natasha James, wrote: 'Stuck at Chancery lane, smoke everywhere something went off in a mans bag on the tube. Everyone screaming and running. Horrible experience.' Alex Townley tweeted: 'Unpleasant start to the morning at Chancery Lane station this morning as everyone ran off the train screaming about smoke leaking from a bag.' Mr Townley wrote: “I heard it turned into a full on bomb scare - the owner of the bag threw it down the platform I heard?! Madness.” A number of electronics companies have had to recall computers after devices overheated and caught fire. The incident triggered a bomb scare among passengers who fled the scene screaming . Last month Panasonic recalled more than 43,000 laptop battery packs after three of them caught fire in Japan and Thailand. The batteries were sold to customers in Asia with a Panasonic CF-S10 and CF-N10 series laptop between April and October 2011. The firm issued a separate recall in Europe as a safety precaution involving an unspecified number of battery packs sold with its Toughbook CF-H2 tablets between June 2011 and May 2012. In April, Sony announced a recall of its Vaio Fit 11A laptops because their non-removable battery packs posed a fire risk. There is no suggestion that Panasonic or Sony manufactured the device which caused panic at Chancery Lane station.","Rush hour commuters poured out of Chancery Lane station in London .

"By . Amanda Williams . Shoppers have been using foreign coins instead of £2 coins in some self-service tills in Morrisons . Co-operative stores are considering joining Morrisons in banning £2 coins at self-service tills after discovering that people were paying with similar-sized foreign coins. Morrisons recently reported a steep rise in the numbers of shoppers paying with coins from overseas meant they have had to refuse to accept £2 coins at automated check-outs at some of their stores. Now Co-op has said it will also 'assess the situation' across their own self service tills, after the issue was brought to light. The most common offenders are Iranian 250 rial coins, and Thai ten bath pieces. A spokesman for the Morrisons chain said: 'A number of stores have had foreign currency passed off as £2 coins at self-checkouts. 'While we fix the issue, we have temporarily stopped them accepting any £2 coins, although customers are still free to use them at all manned checkouts. 'We apologise for any inconvenience it is causing, but don’t expect the fix to take long.' A spokesman for coin experts, Jewellery Quarter Bullion, said: 'The key with these machines is weight and diameter. A £2 coin weighs 12 grammes. 'It may well be that shoppers are not looking to rip anyone off - in some cases, there is very little difference in currency value. Co-operative stores are considering joining Morrisons in banning £2 coins at self-service tills after discovering that people were paying with similar-sized foreign coins . 'They may simply be trying to use change they gathered while holidaying abroad.' Tesco said that it was not planning to . ban the use of any coins, as did Marks & Spencer. But the third largest supermarket, . Sainsbury's, declined to comment. It was long believed £2 coins would be too expensive to copy because they are made from two different metal alloys. But last June police found a counterfeit press, producing fake £1 and £2 coins, in an East End warehouse. The lead coins, dubbed crude copies, looked legitimate as they had been sprayed silver and gold, but would not be accepted in vending machines because they were magnetic. A Morrisons spokesman wouldn't be more specific but said a 'number of stores in the West Midlands' were affected . Offenders: The Iranian 250 rial coin, left, and the Thai ten baht coin, right, are commonly used, Morrisons say . The supermarket is now looking to refine its tills' technology so that only the right coins will be accepted . A spokesman for online coin dealer, 24carat.co.uk said: 'We don’t yet fully understand why counterfeiters would be turning to forging £2 coins when we would have thought it would be easier and more worthwhile to focus on £1 coins. 'The only reason we can think of is that it is becoming more widely known that many fake pound coins are in circulation, making them subject to greater scrutiny.'","Shoppers are using Iranian rial coins and Thai baht instead at automated tills .

"By . Amanda Williams . Billy Carter, 14 , died in hospital after he was misdiagnosed with a urinary tract infection . A schoolboy died on Boxing Day after twice being misdiagnosed by out-of-hours stand-in doctors, an inquest has heard. Billy Carter, 14 , died in hospital after he collapsed at home the day after he spent Christmas with his family. Medics working at an out-of-hours GP service wrongly put his symptoms down to a urinary infection, an inquest in Bedfordshire was told. But the young boy was actually suffering from deadly peritonitis, an inflamation of the abdominal lining which was brought about by appendicitis, a coroner heard. His mother, Melanie Lovett, had taken her son to M-Doc, an out-of-hours GP service based at Biggleswade Hospital, Bedfordshire, on December 22, last year, the court heard. The teenager had severe learning difficulties, was unable to speak and had the mental age of a two-year-old. He indicated that he had pain in his penis, and medics performed a urine test and concluded he had a urinary tract infection. He was then sent home with a course of antibiotics. On two occasions his mother then tried to take him to accident and emergency, but the boy refused to go. Three days later - on Christmas Day - Billy was taken back into the M-Doc service because he was still unwell. Ms Lovett told Dr Rihan Bashir that her son had a temperature, was not eating and was still complaining of pain. He had also been sick. The doctor told the hearing in Ampthill, Bedfordshire, that Billy was alert and walked normally into the treatment room. He said that during an examination of Billy’s abdomen it felt soft and appeared non-tender. The inquest heard that the schoolboy had also improved somewhat on the antibiotics he had been prescribed on the earlier visit. The appearance of the child’s urine and a dipstick test led Dr Bashir to also believe he still had a urine infection. He prescribed stronger antibiotics and told Ms Lovett to take her son to see her GP on December 27 and bring him back if he didn’t improve. Senior Coroner for Bedfordshire and Luton, Thomas Osborne, asked the GP if the symptoms did not hint at something more serious. 'Urine tract infections can cause people to feel very unwell and can be more serious. They can be really nasty,' he said. But the young boy was actually suffering from deadly peritonitis, an inflamation of the abdominal lining which was brought about by appendicitis, a coroner heard, and he later died at Biggleswade Hospital . The doctor explained that diagnosing appendicitis in a child with severe learning difficulties and who could not speak, would be difficult. The hearing was also told that Billy had an extremely high threshhold to pain. Dr Bashir said that he had no facilities to do blood tests but did not think Billy’s condition warranted being admitted so one could take place. Senior Coroner Mr Osborne recorded a narrative verdict into Billy's death at Bedfordshire Coroner's Court. He said: 'The serious nature of the condition was not recognised which resulted in a lost opportunity to treat the condition' The schoolboy was also not sent for a . scan because the medic believed surgeons would have declined it because . of Billy’s presentation. On Boxing Day Billy went into his mother’s room and was playing on a phone while she had a shower when he collapsed. He was rushed to the Lister Hospital in Stevenage, where he died. Billy, from Sandy, Bedfordshire was described as a happy child who was always smiling and loved school. Peritonitis is inflammation of the peritoneum, the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the abdomen, and it is caused by an infection, which can rapidly spread around the body. Peritonitis is regarded a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment. It is often the result of infection or injury to another part of the body, such as a split stomach ulcer, a burst appendix, or digestive disorders, such as Crohn's disease or diverticulitis. Symptoms include sudden abdominal pain that becomes more severe, nausea, a lack of appetite, and trouble passing urine. A post mortem examination concluded that he died as a result of peritonitis and appendicitis. The . pathologist told the coroner that Billy’s ability to explain his . symptoms would have been compromised by his learning difficulties. No evidence of a urine tract infection was found in the post mortem examination. Dr Peter Gledhill, a director at M-Doc, carried out an internal review into Billy’s death. He said the red herring which threw the two doctors off was the urine test. 'The post mortem offered no clear explanation of the horrible red herring that threw the doctor’s off the true diagnosis and I fear it may remain something of a mystery.' He said that the batch of urine tests was checked and nothing was found wrong with them. Senior Coroner Mr Osborne recorded a narrative verdict into Billy’s death. 'The serious nature of the condition was not recognised which resulted in a lost opportunity to treat the condition,' he said. 'In 2014 somebody does not die of peritonitis and I looked at this matter in great detail. Yet it seems due to the red herrings - his high pain thresh-hold and the urine tract infection - simply misled those caring for him. 'I do question whether people with severe learning difficulties should be accessed in hospital rather than in a walk-in out-of-hours services.' Speaking to Ms Lovett and Billy’s father, Ian Carter, Mr Osborne added: 'He was a very courageous young man and the memory of Billy Carter will last a very long time.' Speaking after the hearing Billy’s cousin, Daniel Johnson, said he felt like the misdiagnosis was being 'swept under the carpet.' 'I’m not sure who is to blame, but somebody should be held accountable,' he said. 'I think he should have been admitted to hospital for further tests. 'If he had been seen by somebody who knows about his condition in a hospital, then maybe he would still be here.'","Billy Carter, 14 , died in hospital after collapsing at home the day after Christmas .

The 40-year-old was reportedly annoying crew and passengers aboard the Emirates flight, and had tried to barge his way into first class on the flight, before he 'hit' the woman on the bottom. Terry Harrison, of Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, knocked back six shots of vodka on the Emirates flight from Bangkok, staff said, before he groped the stewardess . Those aboard the overnight flight said the engineer was irritating women passengers by massaging their shoulders  - and allegedly spat at a fellow traveller. He was found guilty by a court in Dubai of touching a stewardess's back and 'kissing her hand', the Sun reports. The 28-year-old woman told the court: 'He was drunk and kind of hit me on my bottom. 'He'd done a few things throughout the flight and I think they just mounted up. 'It was the final straw. His behaviour throughout the flight was not acceptable. He spat at a passenger.'

The father-of-one was arrested when the plane landed in Dubai. He was also charged with breaching Islamic laws on alcohol  - despite the fact that he was served drinks by airline staff. The court ruled that as the plane was registered in Dubai, Harrison should have had a special licence, allowing him special dispensation to drink alcohol. He denied molesting a flight attendant but admitted drinking alcohol without a licence - but he was convicted of both and jailed for three months and fined £320 by Judge Izzat Mansour. An Emirates Spokesman said: 'We cannot comment on court judgments that we have not seen. However, many countries have laws prohibiting offensive behaviour on board aircraft and regularly prosecute unruly and disruptive passengers for such incidents. 'The international community is also currently taking steps to update the Tokyo Convention regarding disruptive passengers, due to the concerns of many governments about the escalation of the severity and frequency of unruly behaviour on board aircraft.

A gannet dives towards the sea off the coast of Liverpool from heights of 90 metres in this shot by photographer Steve Ward, 34 . The gannet is pictured just milliseconds before it hits the water. Photographer Steve Ward, 34, from Crosby on Merseyside, said it was 'lottery' shot . He said: 'A friend organised a boat trip 25 miles from Liverpool Bay and we were lucky enough to see these birds fishing. 'These birds are fast. They fall out of the sky at up to 60 miles per hour. 'The light was tricky so getting this shot just before the point of impact is a difficult one to nail especially when they dive all of a sudden from about 30 metres in the air.'

Mr Ward said: 'They really are amazing to watch fishing. I just managed to catch it before it hit the water which is the best shot and the reflection was a bonus. 'Even though my camera shoots 10 frames per second this shot is still a lottery to nail and on most attempts I ended up with just a splash shot, so I was delighted with this image.'

"By . Amanda Williams . Christopher Parry, 49, is accused of loading a shotgun and waiting for bank worker Caroline (pictured) to leave her new lover's home for work at 8.30am, and waving for her to pull over in her car . A jealous husband shot his wife dead after laying wait for her in the street outside her new lover's hom, a court heard. Christopher Parry, 49, is accused of loading a shotgun and waiting for bank worker Caroline to leave her new lover’s home in Newport, Wales, and waving for her to pull over in her car. Prosecutor Michael Mather-Lees said: 'When she stopped to speak to her husband he went to the boot of his car for the shotgun. 'He shot her twice in the back - it was carefully planned by a man who was in full control of himself when he murdered his wife.' Parry then turned the gun on himself. But Newport Crown Court heard he survived 'substantial head injuries' despite shooting himself at point-blank range with the semi-automatic shotgun. The jury was told that Parry had been a 'controlling and dominant individual' during his 27 year marriage to  Mrs Parry . Mr Mather-Lees said: 'Such was the state of the marriage she left and went to live with her mother, telling her husband she would never go back to him. 'But he could not accept the fact that his wife had left him after years of unhappiness. 'She later went to live with a man called Gary Bidmead who she had met before she left the marital home. 'In the months before the murder he watched her, followed her, phoned her and texted her persistently. 'Her husband kept her under surveillance - this was a man not prepared to let go. 'He told a friend of his wife’s that he had hired a private detective to follow her.' The court heard Parry had a shotgun licence and kept three firearms at his home in Cwmbran, South Wales. Mr Mather-Lees said Parry had selected the semi-automatic Remington to be used in the killing along with 'Triple A' heavy gauge metal pellets in August last year. Parry then turned the gun on himself. But Newport Crown Court heard he survived 'substantial head injuries' despite shooting himself at point-blank range with the semi-automatic shotgun . Mr Mather-Lees said: 'On the morning in question the defendent loaded the semi automatic and put a bandelier of 14 other cartridges in his black Ford Focus, along with his shotgun certificate. 'He drove to Newport and pulled his wife over. 'For some reason Mrs Parry opened the boot of her car and that’s when her husband shot her. 'Parry later claimed it was his intention to kill himself infront of his wife - not shoot her. 'If that was the case why did he have a semi-automatic with three cartridges? 'The answer is he was planning to kill her and kill her he did.' The court heard CCTV film of the street surrounding the alleged murder showed that Parry had been there two days earlier. Mr Mather-Lees said: 'If you add all the activities together, he was a man who was not prepared to let go, someone who kept his wife under surveillance and found out where she was living and armed himself for the task he was about to carry out. 'It was a carefully planned scheme.' Parry has admitted manslaughter but denies murder. The trial continues.

During . the two-month trial, the jury heard that football coach Mr Akpom had . been stabbed in the back in a confrontation involving two 19-year-olds . on September 12. Richard Latham QC, prosecuting, said . the defendants were friends of Mr Akpom and that hours later they . mistakenly targeted the Taufiqs’ house believing it to be the home of . one of the 19-year-olds.

The . judge Mr Justice John Griffith Williams lifted restrictions on naming . Parker and said he would hear mitigation tomorrow afternoon before . sentencing the defendants on Wednesday morning. An emotional Dr Taufiq said they were an 'extraordinary' and 'charitable' family who dedicated their lives to 'the needy and less privileged'. He said: 'My beloved wife and three beautiful children I can say they were really extraordinary people. 'They were very charitable. 'They had a strong concern for the welfare of others even before their own comfort. They had devoted their lives to a dream to give to others, the needy, the less privileged and the misguided. 'Four amazing human beings.' Dr Taufiq added: 'The ultimate goal of these four amazing people was to live and work together with a primary aim to serve community and humanity.' Leicestershire . Police said the family died as a result of the gang attacking the wrong . house to avenge the fatal stabbing of their friend Antoin Akpom hours . earlier. Temporary Detective . Superintendent Kate Meynell, senior investigating officer, . said:'Emotions were running high, their actions on that night, in my . opinion, were both misguided and impulsive and obviously had tragic . consequences. She added: 'It's the prosecution case that these men sought to avenge the death of their friend Antoin Akpom. 'They . went to the address to try and avenge the attack and tragically they . got the wrong address and it resulted in the death of the Taufiq . family.' She said the investigation had been difficult due to the stabbing of Mr Akpom taking place just hours before the fire. Ms Meynell said: 'I think in the first instance the fact that four people have been killed is significant. 'Just trying to deal with the impact that has on the community and the individuals involved is a challenge. Kemo Porter, 19, and Tristan Richards, 22, have been found guilty of their murders at Nottingham Crown Court. The fire was started in 'retribution' for a fatal stabbing. But in a tragic mistake, the killers attacked the wrong house and instead set fire to the Taufiq's family home instead of their target . 'But what this even more difficult was that some seven hours before there had been another murder. 'When we started the investigation we kept both incidents separate because we didn't want to lose any lines of inquiry but after a while it became apparent to us that the two were linked.' She said CCTV evidence was an important part of their inquiries along with forensic evidence, witness accounts and house to house evidence. However their main inquiries were around identifying the vehicles used by the defendants on the night of the fire. She said: 'With the investigation into the fire it was clear to us quite early on that two vehicles were involved in the offence. 'Our main inquiries were around identifying those vehicles, in turn then identifying the movements of those vehicles on the night of Thursday September 12 through to the early hours of Friday September 13, and also after the incident. 'Then we linked into that the people we believed were linked to those cars and who we believed were present at the scene of Wood Hill at the time of the fire.' Ms Meynell said: 'I think as part of the investigation team we're always aware of the impact that these incidents have on the community and on the families. 'I think it's a great credit to the communities in Leicester that everyone came together. I can only begin to imagine the impact that it has had on people that knew the Taufiq family or knew Antoin but everyone did come together.'

"By . Amanda Williams . A businessman has been jailed for faking his own death in India in a bid to pocket a £1.1m life insurance payout. Sanjay Kumar, 45, claimed to have died of ‘brain fever’ in a desperate bid to clear his family’s mounting debts. But . Kumar was actually in Delhi obtaining a fake death certificate and a receipt . confirming he had been 'cremated', at an imaginary crematorium. Sanjay Kumar (front) and his wife Anju Kumar (back) appeared at Southwark Crown Court today after being found guilty of a £1.5 million insurance scam . Kumar- born in India but a British citizen with dual nationality - flew to Delhi on business trip on 3 November, 2011. He later emailed his wife Anju Kumar, 46,  telling her he had fallen seriously ill and had been taken to hospital. By 26 November, mother-of-three Mrs Kumar received an email, informing her that Sanjay had been killed by a ‘brain fever’ and cremated. He then tried to claim a £250,000 policy from Scottish Provident and a term assurance policy with Aviva worth £450,000. There were also claims for a second term assurance policy with Aviva valued at £450,000 and finally a Legal and General assurance pension death claim policy to the value of £5,789.38. The couple tried to pocket £1,155,789.38 but were only paid £10,615.49 by the time of their arrest. Southwark Crown Court Aviva heard Scottish Provident became suspicious about the circumstances of Kumar’s ‘death’  and launched an investigation. Detectives then established that Mrs Kumar had wired £1,522 to her husband via Western Union - two days after the couple claimed he had died. The City of London Police’s Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department (IFED) later discovered Sanjay was in serious debt. The failed businessman had been director of nine companies since the 1990s, and complained of ‘threats’ from his creditors. The couple had also re-mortgaged their home in Watford, Hertfordshire, twice, leaving ‘little or no equity’ in it. After realising his fraud had largely failed, Kumar returned to the UK under a false name to reunite with his wife, but was quickly arrested. The couple, now separated, did not look at each other as Sanjay was jailed for 30 months and his wife was handed a suspended prison sentence. Prosecutor Peter Walsh said: ‘This was a fraud carried out by the two defendants who both faked the death of Mr Sanjay Kumar in order to make false claims on various life insurance and pension policies. ‘They attempted to obtain a total of £1,155,789.38 from Aviva, Scottish Provident and Legal and General. ‘They married in 1991 and they now have three teenage children. ‘Mr Kumar became director of some nine companies from 1992 and she - Mrs Kumar - was registered director of four companies since 1998.’ By 2011, the couple were in ‘serious financial straits’. Kumar was actually in Delhi obtaining a fake death certificate and a receipt confirming he had been 'cremated', at an imaginary crematorium . ‘They had re-mortgaged their home twice due to financial difficulties and by then there was little or no equity in it.’ The couple had suffered a series of county court reverses in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, demanding they pay creditors thousands. ‘Mr Kumar flew to Delhi on 3 November 2011 and he remained there until August 2012. ‘Various fake documents, purporting to be issued by a hospital and crematorium, were obtained, certifying Mr Kumar’s death and these documents were submitted to Aviva and Scottish Provident and the claims were therefore started under these policies.’ The companies grew suspicious and dispatched investigators to india, Mr Walsh said. He added: ‘Although Mr Kumar had been in hospital, it was only for one day, as a result of a minor illness. ‘He had nothing more serious than diarrhoea and a viral infection, and he was issued simply with a certificate saying he was unable to travel because of the discomfort on the plane.’ When the insurance companies balked, Anju Kumar even ‘instructed lawyers to fight the refusal of the claims’. Mr Kumar was jailed for two-and-a-half years. He pleaded guilty to six counts of fraud by false representationMrs Kumar received a five month jail term, suspended for two years and a five month tagged curfew . ‘Mrs Kumar was arrested on 30 August 2012 and when interviewed, she denied being responsible or having planned any part in the life insurance frauds.’ The court heard how Kumar cynically attempted to blame his wife, writing a letter to his son, 20-year-old Vishal. ‘The father clearly admits there had been fraud, but seeks to blame her for it.’ The note said, ‘This news [of the fraud] shocked me and I was extremely angry’. ‘I had no involvement in this false claim for insurance.’ Mr Walsh went on to say ‘a number of typed entries’ on Sanjay’s Blackberry referred to ‘killing himself and getting insurance claims sorted’. He also wrote of ‘the shock of my life’ when the claims were turned down. Abi Johnson, defending Mrs Kumar, begged the judge for ‘mercy’ as she had a dependant daughter who suffered from asthma. ‘The prospect of having a criminal record has caused her to suffer.’ Counsel for Sanjay Kumar, Avi Chaudhuri, said the case was ‘a personal tragedy’. ‘It has unquestionably fractured his relationship with his children and no matter how hard they try in the future, that relationship will undoubtedly never be the same again.’ Kumar flew to Delhi (pictured) on 3 November 2011 and he remained there until August 2012. During that time various fake documents, purporting to be issued by a hospital and crematorium, the court heard . Sentencing, Judge David Higgins branded the couple ‘thieves’ and said the fraud was ‘sustained, relatively sophisticated and very serious’. ‘If you stoop to crime in this way, then you must accept the consequences, and the courts have long made clear they are likely to be severe. ‘Your behaviour was quite routinely deplorable and deeply anti-social. Mr Kumar was jailed for two-and-a-half years. He pleaded guilty to six counts of fraud by false representation, with a potential value of £1,155,789.38. Mrs Kumar received a five month jail term, suspended for two years and a five month tagged curfew. She pleaded guilty to two counts of the same offence, in respect of a falsely claimed sum of £10,615.49 only, which the authorities will now try to claw back. Four more allegations of fraud against Anju were left to lie on file. DC Tom Hill, who led City of London Police’s Insurance Fraud Department investigation said: ‘Sanjay Kumar’s answer to building up substantial debt was to fake his own death in India and let his wife cash in their investments. ‘Unfortunately for the couple their tale of supposed tragedy quickly fell apart under scrutiny by insurers and IFED, with the uncovering of one lie exposing several more from the Kumars as they attempted get their hands on a massive payout. ‘Now that he is behind bars they will have time to reflect on whether making fraudulent claims is the right way to go when faced with financial troubles.’","Sanjay Kumar, 45, claimed he had died and had been cremated in Delhi, India .

Not even a far-flung beach is a refuge from the office, with 60 per cent of workers admitting to checking their  emails on holiday . Sergio Galindo, general manager of the Infrastructure Business Unit at GFI Software, said checking emails outside of working hours could compromise business security. He said: ‘This kind of approach can all . too easily breed an 'out-of-sight, out-of-mind' attitude towards email . safety, security and backup, which is dangerous ground for any company . to be on given the value of the data tied up in an organisation's . mailbox.’ 60% check emails on holiday2.6% have had a glance at a funeral1.5% checked when their partner was in labour6.4% sneaked a peek at a wedding4.1% looked during a school function41% check work emails at least once a day in their personal time . 31.4% resist the temptation to read work emails outside of the working day18% use a smartphone or tablet as their primary device for checking emails32% turn off their smartphone while on holiday . The results showed that 23 per cent have risked company email security by connecting their device to public Wi-Fi hotspots while on holiday. Differences in results per region were highlighted by the survey. Workers in the North East are the fastest to respond to an email with 36.4 per cent doing so within 15 minutes of receiving an email during office hours. They are also the most impatient, with 18.2 per cent expecting a reply inside the same time period. In the capital, 55 per cent of workers admit to regularly checking work emails after 11pm. Meanwhile workers in the East of the country are the most successful at balancing work and play, with just 30 per cent checking emails after 11pm.","Five hundred UK workers were surveyed for GFI Software .

Student Shannon Harris, 18, was dive-bombed after she went to help the young bird which had wandered onto a busy road. The adult gull swooped on Ms Harris and pecked the art student with its powerful beak in a scene straight out of Alfred Hitchcock's horror movie The Birds. Scroll down for video . Brutal: Animal lover Shannon Harris was pecked on the head by seagulls after she tried to help a chick that had wandered into the road in Aberystwyth, Wales . Locals say it is the latest in a series of seagull attacks in the seaside town of Aberystwyth, Wales. She said: 'The baby gull was in the road and a car was approaching so I tried to shoo it out of the way. 'But it started screeching and the next thing I knew I was being dive-bombed by three or four adult birds. 'One of them swooped down and pecked me on the head, while another got tangled in my hair.' Bloody: When Ms Harris was safely inside her house she realised the seagulls had drawn blood . Terrified: Ms Harris said she was shaken by the attack and would think twice before going near a bird in the future . Ms Harris, who is from Birmingham but is studying at Aberystwyth University, ran home with the ferocious gulls in pursuit. She said: 'They were swooping down on me and clipping their beaks. 'I was terrified - my hands were shaking so much I couldn’t unlock my front door.' When Ms Harris was safely inside her house she realised the extent of her injuries. She said: 'I didn’t realise at first that my head was bleeding - it was just pounding. 'But when I went up into my room and looked in the mirror I could see blood mangled in my hair. 'It is a nasty puncture wound but it was more the terror of being attacked by such a big bird that upset me. 'I should have gone to hospital but I have treated the wound with some antiseptic cream. 'I love animals and wildlife but it will teach me to keep away in future.'

"By . Harriet Hernando . Council bureaucrats put a dampener on a summer fete when they banned children’s donkey rides over health and safety fears. Just two days before an annual fete in Beighton, Sheffield, the council stepped in and halted the rides. Sheffield City Council insisted that children had to wear helmets and that the animals’ owner must hold a riding school licence. Fete organiser Tracy Higginbottom stands by a blackboard announcing that the donkey rides at the event in Beighton, Sheffield, have been cancelled . Steve . Edmonds, one of the fete’s organisers, said: ‘Our donkey ride provider . has been in  business for 30 years and has never heard of it. ‘It's just crazy, it's bureaucracy gone mad. ‘We were told this was needed to ensure the children had the right riding  helmets, but I can't remember ever seeing a child wearing a helmet while riding a donkey on the beach. ‘I'm frustrated the council left it until the last minute to tell us.’ Children enjoy a donkey ride at last year's fete. This year however, the donkey rides were cancelled when council officials said youngsters needed to wear helmets . Fellow organiser Tracey Higginbottom added: ‘It was a bombshell. There were a lot of disappointed faces. Donkey owner George Smith, from Doncaster, was told he would need three licences to run the rides. He already has public liability insurance and a beach licence for the animals and has now applied for the £125 riding establishment licence. He said: ‘I've been doing events in Sheffield for more than nine years and I have never heard of it before. Riding school licences are not required in similar events across Britain. But Sheffield City Council said the Riding Establishments Act 1964 states people providing horse and donkey rides must have 'appropriate licences' whether at events or in riding schools.","Council officials contacted fete organisers just two days before the event .

"By . Harriet Hernando . Nick Hancock must be the only man on the planet who didn’t know Germany had won the World Cup until this morning. The chartered surveyor has spent the past 43 days on the most remote outpost in the UK – Rockall – beating the previous record set by a solo man by three days. Just 20 metres high and the size of two tennis courts, the tiny granite chunk 286 miles off Scotland’s west coast is almost uninhabitable. Scroll down for video . Rockall: It is the most remote outpost in the UK and is located 286 miles off Scotland's west coast . Save for a satellite phone, Mr Hancock was completely cut off from civilization. But the 39-year-old wasn’t too bothered about being left out of the football mania that’s gripped the world over these past few months. Mr Hancock, who is married to Pamela with whom he has a two-year-old son called Freddie, said:  ‘I’m not a football fan so I feel quite fortunate that I missed out on the television being dominated by the World Cup. ‘My wife, on the other hand, is a fan and joked that she was glad I was away so she could watch all the games without me complaining.’ But rather than fleeing civilization in a bid to avoid the World Cup, Mr Hancock spent 43 lonely days on the island to raise £10,000 for Help the Heroes charity. Speaking about his achievement, Mr Hancock said: ‘I reminded myself this morning as soon as I woke up, that today was a new record.’ Lonely: Mr Hancock celebrates by himself after beating the world record for the longest solo stay on the remote island Rockall. There are no inhabitants on the island apart from a few birds. He spent 43 days living inside the 'house pod' pictured . But Mr Hancock has had to postpone the celebrations until he gets home to Ratho, near Edinburgh, because he has no-one to toast with on the remote island. The only other inhabitants include a few birds that he befriended earlier in his stay. He said: ‘It’s strange really, as it’s just another day on the rock. ‘I had a little smile to myself, but there’s been no euphoria as such. ‘I had no one to celebrate with.’ Mr Hancock told how he began talking to some homing pigeons and guillemot birds to alleviate his boredom, but the wildlife had all since disappeared by the time he broke the world record. He said: ‘It’s been relatively quiet on the wildlife front since there was a storm. ‘There’ve been no new oddities like the racing pigeons, and I haven’t seen much of the minke whales.’ Mr Hancock landed on the rock on June 5, a week before the first World Cup match kicked off, and set up his tiny yellow ‘house pod’. He had originally planned to stay for 60 days but was forced to curtail his quest after losing four barrels of supplies in a storm at the beginning of the month. The pod, which was secured to the rock with bolts, was just 15 metres above the lapping waves. Mr Hancock had thought the pod was watertight but it sprung a leak in the hinge of the top hatch during the storm. To stop more water from coming in, Mr Hancock had to close his ventilation hatches causing the temperature in the pod to soar. After enduring the elements for more than a month, Mr Hancock is glad to be coming home. And having eaten nothing but army ration packs, he has a few food items in mind for his arrival home. He said: ‘I’m looking forward to a glass of wine and a pint of good ale when I get back. I think a pizza is in order too.’ Mr Hancock will no doubt be looking forward to the prospect of walking to his local Italian when he gets home, as Rockall offers little opportunity for exploring. Much of the land is too steep and rocky to be accessible. When Mr Hancock did stray from his pod, he wore a harness attached to the rock with a strong lifeline so he wouldn’t be blown into the sea. The little area that his pod rests on is just 3.3 x 1.2 m (11 x 4 ft). There are no bushes or trees — just seaweed, algae and a single black lichen. Occupation: In 1997, three Greenpeace members set the group record of 42 days.  In 1985 the former SAS soldier Tom McClean set the 40-day solo occupancy record, which Mr Hancock has just beaten . Back to civilisation: Tom McClean, who set the original 40-day solo record in 1985 for time spent on the island, does a hand stand when he gets back to the mainland. Mr Hancock plans to order a pint and a pizza . Twenty species of bird and six species of animal have been recorded on or near the island, but human beings have never been in abundance. The first recorded landing was in 1811 by a Royal Navy officer called Basil Hall, who gave the name Hall’s Ledge to the flat area where Nick has anchored his pod. In 1955, Rockall was claimed by a group of Royal Marines who hoisted the Union Flag there — worried that foreign forces might invade the island and use it as observation post. Then the 1972 Island of Rockall Act was passed by Parliament, formally declaring it to be part of Inverness-shire, even though the nearest permanently inhabited settlement is 228 miles away on North Uist in the Outer Hebrides. Over the years, Ireland, Iceland and Denmark (on behalf of the Faroe Islands) have each lodged competing claims. In 1974 the Navy landed again, then in 1985 the former SAS soldier Tom McClean set the 40-day solo occupancy record, living in a wooden shelter. In 1997, three Greenpeace members set the group record of 42 days.","Nick Hancock has been living on Rockall- the most remote outpost in the UK .

"By . Harriet Hernando . One of only three surviving 'Lord Kitchener Wants You' First World War recruitment posters has gone under the hammer for a world record £30,000. The incredibly rare poster was responsible for the enlistment of millions of men and has since become one of the most iconic images of the war. But despite its success and popularity, it was not produced on the same scale as other recruitment posters - and only three originals survived. Patrick Bogue of Onslow Auctions sold the incredibly rare piece of history, which is only one of three left in the world, for a record £30,000 . The other two are in the Imperial War Museum in London and the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia, meaning this poster was the only one in the world that was available for sale. The poster started off life as the front cover of a 1914 edition of magazine London Opinion which had commissioned renowned artist Alfred Leete. The Parliamentary Recruiting Committee, which commissioned all the recruitment posters, spotted the artwork and turned it into a poster. Lord Kitchener, the Secretary of State for War, was a well-respected military leader and the poster became one of the enduring images of the war effort . It was then plastered on billboards around the country - but only 10,000 were made. Lord Kitchener, the Secretary of State for War, was a well-respected military leader and the poster became one of the enduring images of the war effort. The poster was so successful it was copied by the Americans who replaced Kitchener with Uncle Sam. Kitchener was killed in 1916 when the warship taking him to negotiations in Russia was sunk by a German mine. The poster for sale was bought at auction in 1983 for £100 and has remained in a private collection ever since. Experts had tipped it to fetch £15,000 but were shocked when it went for almost double that, setting a new record for the sale of a war poster. It was snapped up by a London-based collector for £27,540 in an online sale by Dorset-based auction house Onslows. Patrick Bogue, auctioneer, said: 'When war broke out in 1914 the British army had a real problem on their hands because they only had about 150,000 soldiers. 'Lord Kitchener was a respected leader and strategist who had found fame in the Boer War and during the last days of the British Empire. 'He was too old to serve as a general and so he was hired to take on the mammoth role of recruiting more soldiers.' Thousands of poster were reproduced and distributed around the British Empire. The Lord Kitchener poster however, was only displayed in Britain, but it was an instant hit. Mr Bogue said: 'It was so popular that the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee sought permission to use the front page as a recruitment poster. 'The only thing different was that they changed the wording from 'needs you' to 'wants you'. 'It was a hugely successful poster and was responsible for tens of thousands of men enlisting in the army. 'Only two other original copies exist and they are both in museums. 'The Lord Kitchener poster is the holy grail of historic recruitment posters and this copy is the only one in the world that you could actually buy. 'We had hoped it would sell for a decent amount but we were delighted when it sold for so much. 'It just goes to show how much value is put on such a rare, historic poster as this.' At the outbreak of war in 1914, many young men were quick to enlist into the Army - spurred on by a desire to serve their country, or simply to avoid unemployment. By the end of September 1914 more than 750,000 men had joined up.However, within a year of Great Britain's declaration of war in August 1914, it became obvious that the country would not be able to continue fighting with just voluntary recruits.Although the famous 'Your Country Needs You' poster helped encourage more than one million men to enlist by January 1915 this was not enough to cover the rising number of casualties and the government decided there was no choice but to bring in conscription - compulsory active service.The Military Service Act became law in March 1916 and imposed conscription on all single men aged between 18 and 41, other than the medically unfit, teachers, clergymen and certain industrial workers.Conscientious objectors who opposed fighting on moral ground were also spared the draft, as were those living in Ireland, and men called up could appeal against the call up at a local Military Service Tribunal.Throughout the war around 2.5 million men joined the Armed Forces through conscription, with 1.1 million of them joining during the first year.","Poster was purchased by an anonymous London-based collector .

"By . Harriet Hernando . If you’re baring your legs this summer, spare a thought for bin men who have been banned from wearing shorts. Despite temperatures reaching 20C, Stoke-on-Trent City council chiefs say staff can’t wear the shorts which were issued last year. They claim ditching trousers would create a health and safety risk and say the NHS would need to declare a health warning - with temperatures averaging 30C - for shorts to be worn. Hot: Bin men have been banned from wearing shorts by Stoke-on-Trent City Council, despite the mercury hitting 20C . Council staff and union representatives dismissed the ruling as ‘ridiculous’. One council worker said: ‘Last year we were given the option of having one pair of shorts as part of our uniform. ‘A lot of people took this up but now we have been refused permission to wear shorts because it's not hot enough. Former bin man and GMB union rep Alan Joynson said: ‘It is ridiculous, I have never heard anything like it. When it is warm, as long as they are wearing the right foot-ware in case they drop bins, I don't see a problem.’ A letter was sent by the council stating that staff, which include bin men, gardeners and street cleaners, can only wear shorts if they have authorisation and the weather is ‘extreme.’ Risk: Council gardeners have also been stopped from baring their legs because council chiefs reckon they present a health and safety threat . Councillor Duncan Walker, who is a member of the GMB union, said: ‘I don't have any problem with them wearing shorts; they are out in all weathers and they need to be comfortable.’ But his fellow Councillor Andy Platt said it was up to council bosses to decided when staff can wear shorts. He said: ‘The shorts are only worn during spells of extremely hot weather and our managers will decide when it is appropriate to wear them.’ Protection: The council said workers had to cover up to protect themselves from injury . ‘Our staff turn out in all kinds of weather to carry out hard physical work around the city. Making sure they feel comfortable and valued at work is good for the council and good for the city too.’ A council spokesperson said workers’ legs needed to be covered up to protect them. ‘The trousers are designed to protect them from sharp objects, flying glass, thorns and other hazards they may encounter during their day-to-day work, such as discarded needles. ‘Our main priority is protecting our workers from harm, because it would be unforgiveable if we put them in danger, but unfortunately the shorts offer little protection against injury. ‘The only reason we would let staff wear shorts is if we received warnings from other agencies, such as the Met Office or the NHS, that the weather was hot enough to pose a health risk. There is no trigger temperature involved - we just use common sense and listen to expert advice. ‘We have to weigh up the risks and decide whether the heatwave danger outweighs the need for workers to protect their lower legs from injury. ‘We're one of the few councils that allow staff to wear shorts at work, and it was very popular with the staff when we tried it out during last summer's spell of extreme hot weather.’","Staff can't wear shorts issued last year, despite temperatures reaching 20C .

Mr Storey, 82, regularly vacuum cleans his carpets with the Hoover 825, which rolled off production lines in 1936, the same year as the Summer Olympics in Berlin . Apart from a few patches on the dust bag, Mr Storey believes the machine has never been repaired . He rediscovered the ancient machine when he was cleaning out his workshop and was stunned to discover it still worked. He said: 'My mother was given this Hoover by the lady she used to clean for,' said Mr Storey, from Holbeach, Lincolnshire. 'She got a newer model and gave my mother this one. She always used it up until she had a stroke and went into hospital; she never had another. 'My brother threw it out when she died, and I rescued it.' Apart from a few patches on the dust bag, Mr Storey believes the machine has never been repaired. The upright silver and grey model was quite advanced for its day and boasts an adjustable handle with three positions, two speeds - with a lower setting for cleaning flexible, small lightweight rugs - as well as a light and a hose with attachments. The machine would have cost around £25 when it was new - the equivalent of around £1,200 to £1,500 in today's money. It previously belonged to Mr Storey's mother Emma (pictured in the 1930s), who was given it by the lady she used to clean for . But despite the Hoover's dedicated service over the years, Mr Storey, who does all the cleaning at the home he shares with wife Beryl, 80, admits he still prefers his Dyson DC24i for most of the cleaning as the 825 is very heavy . It also has an Aromador, which, with the twist of a valve knob, releases a 'pleasing smell' to mask cooking and stale odours.

"By . Harriet Hernando . A remarkable letter written by the future Edward VIII that exposes him as an ungrateful, sexist and racist prince has come to light. The Prince of Wales, who later abdicated to marry an American divorcee, told of the ‘miserable and loathsome’ time he was having on a Caribbean cruise. He visited Barbados in 1920 in what was supposed to be a diplomatic trip of the British Empire but he described the tropical paradise as a ‘bum place’. The future Edward VIII visited Barbados in 1920 on what was supposed to be a diplomatic trip however he revealed he found it 'deadly dull' in a letter to his mistress . The Royal reported the local scenery as being ‘ugly’ and he found the ‘coloured population’ to be ‘revolting’. He also wrote of begrudgingly dancing with various women on the trip, all of whom he insisted had to be young and vetted by his friend, Louis Mountbatten. Edward, whose name before he was King was David, even described one young lady he danced with as an ‘American bit’. Edward VIII wrote this sickeningly-sweet love letter to his then mistress, Freda Dudley Ward, while he was on a diplomatic trip to Barbados in 1920 . The diatribe on the trip was included in a sickeningly-sweet love letter to his then mistress, Freda Dudley Ward, in which he bleated about how much he was missing her. The married socialite was the future King’s lover between 1918 to 1923. Edward VIII (left) with then mistress Freda Dudley-Ward to whom he wrote whilst in Barbados, and her husband liberal MP William Dudley-Ward . They remained close until 1936 when he met American divorcee Wallis Simpson, who he gave up the throne for later that year. Over 22 pages, Edward wrote of his travels on HMS Renown from March 21 to March 29, 1920. 'How I loathe being separated from  you like this and it all seems so unnatural sweetie mine; how I want you tonight to tell you how madly I love you. Oh! My darling darling precious beloved little Fredie life is absolute hell for your little David. Without you I'm oh so miserable. I just don't feel I can live these seven months of this sordid lonely existence without my Fredie.' 'I can't or shan't be able to raise the least enthusiasm about anything [on] this trip; it all seems to me so terribly artificial and organised somehow tho [sic].' 'We are all depressed tonight as we lost a man overboard this afternoon. 'He was apparently leaning against the rails on the side of the ship [...] and fell overboard [...] we never saw him again. Of course one man's death means nothing sweetheart only it's a depressing effect on everybody!!' 'I only danced three dances towards the end and never loathed anything so much beloved one; but I just had to tho [sic]. I've appointed Dickie my 'procurer' of partners and only take on a 'young woman' that he has vetted as being possible!! But Christ! They were the absolute limit tonight as I can't remember what the three women I danced with look like as I hardly looked at them.' 'There are over 170,000 of them the white population is very small and they aren't much to look at all too deadly dull and of course depressingly primitive.' In the gushing letter, he wrote of how much he missed his mistress, telling her ‘how I want you tonight to tell you and show you how madly I love you.’ He added: 'Oh! My darling darling precious beloved little Freddie, life is absolute hell & torture for your little David without YOU.' The Prince of Wales then went on to document his hatred of the trip each day which came at a time when Britain was heading into an economic depression after the First World War. Prince Wales later abdicated to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson . He moaned: 'I can’t and shan’t be able to raise the least enthusiasm about anything on this trip.'It looks a proper bum island this Barbados. It’s a unique sort of scenery very ugly and I don’t take much to the coloured population who are revolting. 'I’m sorry for the colonial office people who have to live there tho (sic).' The 25-year-old Prince then bleated about have to dance with different women at formal functions. Edward VIII describes in a letter to his mistress Freda Dudley Ward how he 'vetted' the women he danced with in Barbados . He said: 'Never have I felt less like all that or setting eyes on any woman but you darling angel; the idea absolutely revolts me. 'We gave an official dinner to 20 notables of the island including the governor and his wife which was followed by a reception. 'I’ve appointed Dickie [Mountbatten] my 'procurer' of partners and only take on a 'young woman' that he has vetted as being possible!! Edward VIII explains in a letter from a trip to Barbados in 1920 how losing a man overboard had a 'depressing effect on everybody' 'But Christ! They were the absolute limit tonight and I can’t remember what the three women I danced with look like as I hardly looked at them!! 'I danced quite a lot sweetheart: Dickie found me a little American bit who wasn’t such a bad mover but the rest of the women were impossible.' The letter is now being sold by a private collector at auction with a pre-sale estimate of £1,200.Richard Davie, of International Autograph Auctions, said: 'This is a letter of quite remarkable content that reflects Edward VIII’s character. 'He was one of the most colourful members of the Royal family who showed his emotions. Edward VIII described the locals as 'deadly dull and of course depressingly primitive' on what was supposed to be a diplomatic trip to Barbados in 1920 . 'I’m sure in March 1920 many British people would have gladly swapped places with him in Barbados and the Caribbean.

"By . Harriet Hernando . The MP Hazel Blears has recalled how the harsh way her mother Dorothy was diagnosed with Alzheimer's devastated the family. She spoke about the pain and heartache caused for the first time since her mother Dorothy’s death three weeks ago. Mrs Blears passed away aged 79 at Salford Royal in Manchester, eight years after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's - the most common form of dementia, which is believed to be caused by changes in the brain. Labour MP for Salford and Eccles Hazel Blears (right) with her mother Dorothy who died aged 79 after battling Alzheimer's for eight years. Ms Blears told how the 'brutal' diagnosis devastated the family . She was unable to recognise her daughter or walk on her own and was looked after her husband Arthur. Making a keynote speech at the Alzheimer's show in Manchester, Ms Blears chose to speak out to help improve services for those with dementia. She told how a locum psychiatrist was sent to her parents’ house to break the tragic news. Ms Blears said: 'She asked my mum ten questions, like what day it was and who the Prime Minister was. 'My mum struggled with these questions for about 30 minutes as the psychiatrist did ticks and crosses on her form. 'She then turned to my dad and said ‘it’s very clear Dorothy has Alzheimer’s. 'It was the kind of brutal diagnosis that used to happen with cancer 30 years ago without any recognition of what it meant in human terms to the person and their family. 'I know this has now improved but there is still quite a way to go and we want to see a more caring way of breaking one of the worst bits of news anyone could ever receive. 'Every four seconds someone in the world finds out they have dementia and if we don’t normalise this situation and treat dementia as something you have to go into hospital for our health service will be broken under the strain.' Hazel Blears spoke for the first time since her mother's death at a keynote speech at the Alzheimer's show in Manchester and revealed the harrowing effects of the disease . Ms Blears told previously how she first became aware something was wrong with her mother when she could not remember what day of the week it was. She said: 'The first signs were her not knowing which day it was and asking the same questions. 'There was a slight lack of self awareness - for example, her appearance when she had always been so finely turned out. She would look to my dad for safety before doing things, when she had always been a very independent woman.' Alzheimer's changed everything for Mrs Blears, who worked as a personal secretary to the finance director of Cussons soap factory in Salford after leaving school aged 14. Not long after her diagnosis, she went missing from home in a snowstorm and her family feared the worst. Ms Blears said: 'We searched for her for hours and hours and she was eventually picked up by the police.' Speaking of the part new technology can play, Ms Blears added: 'If we had had a GPS device of the kind you can get now to keep track of a loved one with dementia, we would not have been there worrying that mum might have died from hypothermia.' Ms Blears’ parents played a key role in encouraging their daughter’s rise from local councillor to Westminster. She announced in February her plan to stand down at the next general election in order to spend more time with her mother. Ms Blears told Manchester Evening News last year: 'You can give people a good quality of life even when most of their senses have disappeared. 'My mum no longer knows who I am, but she knows I am nice to her.' Since her mother's death, Ms Blears continues to campaign for an improved services for dementia sufferers.","Ms Blears, 58, revealed how a psychiatrist broke the news after filling in a form and completing tick boxes .

"By . Harriet Hernando . A serial burglar killed a 'defenceless' elderly widow - just 12 days after a court let him back out on the streets. Peter Harris, 33, who was on bail following a stint in prison for burglary, barged into the home of Elsie Mowbray, 87, on New Year’s Day after pretending he was looking for a rabbit in her garden. But the stealing spree was interrupted when Mrs Mowbray’s son Richard turned up with her daily newspaper at her home in York. Shameless: Drug addict Peter Harris, 33, burgled widow Elsie Mowbray, 87, less than a fortnight after a court freed him on bail . As he tried to flee Harris pushed Mrs Mowbray over with such force that she hit her head on the wall causing an indentation in the plaster. Brave Mr Mowbray tried to stop Harris from escaping on a bicycle by shoving a stick in the wheel spokes -  but he managed to get away – and went on to rob £40 from a baby girl. Mrs Mowbray was taken to hospital but discharged the same day because she didn’t display any symptoms of injury. Leeds Crown Court heard how Harris, who was drunk and high on cocaine, fled to the flat of an acquaintance and begged for money. When he was refused, Harris barged in and stole £40 from a baby girl’s money box, a watch, and even more cash from a wallet. Later that day police raided Harris’s home in York where they found him hiding under the bed and wearing the stolen watch. The next day Mrs Mowbray, whose husband died in 1991, was found slumped on the kitchen floor by her son – having apparently lain there all night. She was rushed to hospital with internal head bleeding but tragically died six days later. Harris was jailed for 12 years after he admitted manslaughter, burglary and robbery after committing what the judge described as a ‘brutal, violent and ugly nightmare’ for the elderly lady. In a statement Mrs Mowbray’s family said: ‘The crime committed by Peter Harris caused the death of a gentle old lady and nothing can bring her back, but we hope today’s proceedings can draw a line and our family can start to look ahead to the future and find some peace.’ 'Defenceless': Widow Elsie Mowbray, 87, was killed in her own home by drug addict Peter Harris, 33, after he forced his way in looking for things to steal . The court heard how Harris, who had been jailed previously for burglary, was granted bail for an undisclosed offence - just 15 days before the twin raids – when he began cruising the streets in a drink and drug fuelled haze looking for homes to loot. He claimed his crimes were driven by his ‘long term deep addiction to drugs and alcohol’ and blamed his troubles on a ‘difficult upbringing’. Passing sentence, Judge Keith Lindblom said: ‘Mrs Mowbray’s family had hoped her death when it came would be peaceful, not the brutal, violent ugly nightmare it turned out to be. If you had not chosen to burgle her home you would not have been there. If you had not been there and tried to escape she would not have sustained a serious injury to her head which proved to be fatal.’ After the case Det Supt Heather Pearson, Head of North Yorkshire Police’s Protecting Vulnerable Persons Unit, said: ‘Peter Harris knew his victim was an elderly, defenceless woman when she answered the door to him. ‘He showed no regard for her when he entered her property and has subsequently shown no remorse. ‘As a result of his actions, an otherwise fit and healthy lady has had her life cut short and a family has lost a loved one in tragic circumstances. Throughout the ordeal, subsequent criminal investigation and court processes, Elsie’s family have shown great dignity and composure. ‘I would like to thank the witnesses who supported the police investigation and the criminal investigation team for their hard work and dedication in gathering the evidence that has led to today’s conviction.’","Peter Harris was on bail following a stint in prison for burglary at the time .

"By . Damien Gayle . Fat-fingered phone users rejoice! A new kind of touchscreen text-entry software promises to improve typing accuracy while at the same time shrinking your keyboard. Minuum condenses all the letters in the alphabet down to one line on your device's screen to eliminate visual clutter, while using complex maths to increase accuracy. The team behind the app are seeking to fund the project through Indiegogo, but its appeal has proved so great it has already nearly doubled its $10,000 goal - with 30 days left to go. Compact: Minuum condenses all the keys on a traditional keyboard down to one line at the bottom of your touchscreen device, leaving acres of precious space left to view apps . Described as 'the little keyboard for big fingers', Minuum shrinks the usual three column layout of QWERTY keyboards down to one compact line at the bottom of the screen. Existing mobile device keyboard software often takes up much of the screen, meaning that users can barely see the software they are typing on. The Canadian team behind Minuum say their software recovers more than half the usable touchscreen space taken up by traditional touchscreen keyboards. Further, they say their special . algorithm allows for faster test entry, even when your typing is sloppy, . while still providing easy access to special keys like numbers, . punctuation and backspace. Innovative design: Minuum earned its name from the way its keys are laid out in a row in what the developers call a 'continuum of letters' And if that was not enough the app is so flexible the keyboard can even be moved around the screen allowing users to leave visible the bits of the display they are working on. 'Your typing on mobile devices is inherently imprecise—and there’s nothing wrong with that. We work with that.' say the developers on their Indiegogo page. 'By reducing the keyboard to a single dimension, Minuum opens up your touchscreen space for a variety of interaction possibilities — which allows for precision-entry.' Minuum earned its name from the way its keys are laid out in a row in what the developers call a 'continuum of letters'. 'We call it 'one-dimensional' because it’s based on one row of keys,' they say. 'This frees up the keyboard to be anywhere you like on the screen, or even to curve for a more ergonomic keyboard shape.' The idea was inspired by a research project undertaken by some of the developers while studying at the University of Toronto which asked them to invent a better way of typing on touchscreen phones without looking. From this project, they came up with the app's novel alphabet layout and the disambiguation algorithm needed to ensure that it understood what users were trying to type in. But de-cluttering your touchscreen is only the short-term ambition of the Minuum team. They envisage its revolutionary design being adapted to a range of surfaces. You needn't even have to use your fingers since any motion in one-dimension can be used to input information via Minuum. Possibilities for the future: De-cluttering your touchscreen is only the short-term ambition of the Minuum team. They envisage its revolutionary design being adapted to a range of surfaces . That means that users with an accelerometer equipped game controller, like those on Nintendo's Wii console could swing it from side to side to input words; and users wearing head-mounted computers like Google Glass could even write by pivoting their heads from side to side. 'With only one dimension to measure, these kinds of typing systems are easy to make—and easy to use, even in noisy and constrained sensing environments,' the Minuum team say. The app is currently in development for Android, since Apple's iOS does not allow users to replace the operating system's built-in keyboard. The Minuum team say they will use their first $10,000 to turn their prototype software into a fully-fledged Android app ready to be distributed via Google's Play store.","Minuum condenses all the letters of the alphabet down to one line .

"By . Harriet Hernando . A woman who donated nearly £650,000 to a hospital in her son's memory is asking for the money back, after the health board failed to spend it in a decade. Chris Evans-Thomas lost her 35-year-old son Adam to leukemia in 2004. His last wish was to improve cancer services at Withybush General Hospital in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, Wales, but ten years later, his legacy has still not been invested. Chris Evans-Thomas with her son Adam who died of leukemia in 2004. His lasting wish was to improve cancer services in Withybush General Hospital where he was treated, however ten years on, the money has not been invested . Now Ms Evans-Thomas wants the money back in order to fund another charitable venture. As his illness progressed, Mr Evans-Thomas wanted to give something back to the hospitals that helped him and he began raising money through Adam's Bucketful of Hope appeal to refurbish the cancer ward at Withybush and build a new cancer day unit. When he died, his mother took on the legacy and through the high-profile nature of her son's campaign, she helped to raise £649,776 for cancer services in Pembrokeshire. She told the BBC she had repeatedly been given dates for when his wish would be fulfilled but it never has, and now she wants the money back. Chris Evans-Thomas raised £650,000 for Withybush Hospital in Wales in memory of her son Adam who died from leukemia . She added her son would be 'very, very saddened' by the length of time it was taking for anything to happen. Ms Evans-Thomas, who has received an MBE for her fundraising, said she would not give up until she had 'got something to show, to have some meaning why Adam had to go'. She worked in the hospital school in Withybush General Hospital just one ward away from where Adam was treated. Adam, who was a signals engineer on the railways, was a 25-year-old in the prime of life when he started to get unexplained headaches and put on weight. When he went to his GP he was first prescribed paracetamol, but as he got to the door of the doctor's office, he asked him to look at his distended stomach - and was promptly rushed into hospital. Adam underwent numerous courses of chemotherapy and what is known as an autologous transplant, where bone marrow is taken out of the body and cleaned before being put back in again. He also had countless blood transfusions in hospital and always praised doctors and hospital staff for their care of him during his time in hospital. Ms Evans-Thomas said that despite his fortnightly visits to the doctor, six-monthly checksand numerous drugs, Adam never let the leukemia take over his life. She said:'I've never once thought as his mother that I was going to lose him. Withybush General Hospital in Pembrokeshire, Wales, says it still plans to refurbish the cancer unit, ten years after the money was donated . Hywel Dda health board told BBC Wales that £550,000 had been committed to the refurbishment of the main cancer ward at Withybush and to build a cancer day unit. The health board said the new unit would 'realise the time, effort and investment that has been made by those fundraising in the county'. 'The capital build is only part of the challenge as all service/units that we provide require a review of staffing to ensure that they are sustainable in the long term,"" it said in a statement. 'We continue to work hard with colleagues, partner organisations and stakeholders, including our charitable fundraisers, to ensure we provide the best care possible for cancer patients and will continue to work closely with them on the development of the new chemotherapy day unit.'","Mother Chris Evans-Thomas lost her son Adam to leukemia in 2004 .

"By . Harriet Hernando . A teenager has been locked up for a second time for smacking women’s bottoms in public. Reece Budgeon followed girls and women into secluded spots in Ilkeston, Derbyshire, before pouncing, leaving them distressed and scared to go out alone. The 18-year-old targeted his first victim just one month after being released from custody for smacking two other women last year. Reece Budgeon, 18, was jailed for smacking six women's bottoms in public in Ilkeston, Derbyshire - just one month after being released from custody for assaulting two other women last year . His victims included two schoolgirls and a mother pushing her child in a pram. Derby Crown Court heard Budgeon followed the women before slapping them hard on the bottom and running off. One woman, who had been walking to work through an industrial estate to work at the time, told police that after the incident she felt nervous walking alone. The oldest victim, whom he struck in an alleyway, said she initially thought he was going to mug her and that it left her feeling vulnerable and shocked. But Budgeon, who admitted sexually assaulting six women in February and March, showed no remorse as he was sentenced to 25 months in a young offenders’ institution. Passing sentence Judge Jonathan Gosling said: ‘You were completely indiscriminate in your choice of women, who ranged in age from 15 to 60. Derby Crown Court, where Reece Budgeon, 18, was sentenced to 25 months in a young offenders' institution for smacking women's bottoms in public . ‘Unlike everyone around you, who sees it as disgusting and perverted, you don’t see anything wrong and you have showed no remorse.’ 'These crimes caused a lot of anxiety and distress to your victims. ‘It’s impossible to understand what is going on in your head. What motivates you to commit these serious crimes? ‘Only a month after your release you went on to follow and assault no less than six women in five weeks at a time where you are being intensively supervised.’ Jasmine Kumar, for Budgeon, said: ‘What we have from him is a lack of acceptance and responsibility and no justification of committing these offences.’","Reece Budgeon assaulted women in secluded spots in Ilkeston, Derbyshire .

"By . Harriet Hernando . A council has been slammed after a single bus lane camera made more than £250,000 in just ten months. Between March and December last year, a staggering 6,259 tickets were handed to motorists who were filmed straying into the lane - an average of around 20 per day. The camera, on Kirkstall Road in Leeds, West Yorkshire, generated £250,850 in fines, dwarfing the average income of £38,000 from the city's other bus lane cameras. This bus lane camera (top left) in Leeds raked in more than £250,000 in ten months. Locals are accusing the council of running a 'money-making racket' This has attracted claims the camera is being used as a cash cow to boost council coffers. Earnest Carter, an attendant at a nearby petrol station, said: 'It's just a money-making racket. People know they should not go in the lane and they don't go in it unless they have to.' Motorists face a £30 fine for using the bus lane, rising to £60 if they fail to pay within 14 days. Figures show the camera generated £12,514 in its first month. Fines peaked at £52,060 in April before declining steadily to £6,270 in November. The figure  rose again to £11,910 in December. The camera, positioned to the left of the bus lane, catches out motorists on Kirkstall Road in Leeds, West Yorkshire. Motorists say the camera is 'unfairly positioned' A spokesman for the Automobile Association said: 'It looks like the council  gave lots of Christmas shoppers a nice little memento of their journey into Leeds.' He said fines were acceptable for inconsiderate drivers but there needed to be 'discretion' shown towards motorists who strayed into the lane, especially to allow emergency vehicles past. Local businessman Ian Kerry, who uncovered the figures following a Freedom of Information request, said the camera was unfairly positioned. 'It's situated too close to the end of the bus lane and films those who drift into the lane to make a permitted left turn,' he said. 'The focus is set directly in front of the camera itself so it captures people cutting the last few yards of the bus lane to make the turn.' The 41-year-old property consultant was given a penalty charge notice after straying into the lane on August 6 last year. Mr Kerry was set to argue he should not be forced to pay because he was in the lane for less than 20 metres - a distance he said was permissible under the rules set out by other councils. He wrote to the council asking for more information - but was told his appeal had been rejected before he had even made his case. However, after taking the matter to a traffic penalty tribunal, his ticket was overturned. The adjudicator in the case slammed the council for rejecting Mr Kerry's appeal. A written judgement said the council had 'paid no regard at all to the possibility that he might wish to raise mitigation' in his defence. It added: 'The council are obliged, of course, to consider not only if there was a contravention but, if and only if there was, what other information might mitigate it. 'Rejection only because there was a contravention is the wrong approach to their duty under the regulations.' Figures show 136 of the 6,259 tickets issued in relation to the same camera last year were cancelled as the result of appeals. Mr Kerry said: 'There's clearly a rush on the part of the council to get their hands on the money as soon as possible. I'm virtually certain that there are many other people who would have legitimate grounds to appeal.' A Leeds City Council spokesman said: 'The bus lanes throughout Leeds are part of the city's commitment to reduce congestion and improve public transport links. 'We closely monitor the impact of bus lane enforcement in different locations to make sure the measures we have taken are delivering the best possible outcomes for road users.' He added that the decline in fines being issued showed drivers were getting the message.","Other bus lane cameras in the area make £38,000 on average .

"By . Damien Gayle . The destruction of a small Russian satellite shows the growing threat space junk poses to activities in low-Earth orbit, experts have warned. Russia's Ball Lens In The Space nanosatellite is thought to have been obliterated by a collision with a piece of debris left spinning around the planet by a Chinese anti-satellite weapon test in 2007. The Earth is surrounded by an ever-growing cloud of space junk, which Nasa has estimated contains 500,000 objects bigger than a marble, and 22,000 bigger than a cricket ball. Rubbish: Nasa has estimated the ever-growing cloud of space junk surrounding our planet contains 500,000 objects bigger than a marble, and 22,000 bigger than a softball. (Artist's impression) With the debris in low-Earth orbit spinning around the planet at speeds of about 17,500mph, even tiny pieces can cause serious damage to satellites and pose a deadly hazard to astronauts. Some 70 per cent of catalogued space junk objects are in low-Earth orbit, which extends to 1,250 miles about the surface of our planet. To be able to observe the Earth, spacecraft must orbit at such a low altitude - any further and their instruments are unable to pick out details. The latest collision happened six weeks ago, on January 22, and is just the latest case of space junk destroying human technology in space. Brian Weeden, a technical adviser with the Secure World Foundation, which is campaigns for the peaceful use of space technology, told Space.com: 'It's not the wake-up call — we've had too many of those already. 'Many satellites in LEO [low-Earth orbit] are having to maneuver on a regular basis to avoid threatening close approaches with debris. 'This is just one more data point that shatters the myth of the ""big sky"" theory regarding space activities and shows that debris is one of the most pressing threats satellite operators in LEO have to contend with.' Danger: With the debris in low-Earth orbit spinning around the planet at speeds of about 17,500mph, even tiny pieces can cause serious damage to satellites and pose a deadly hazard to astronauts . Mr Weeden cited a 2009 article by David Wright of the Union of Concerned Scientists which documents three previous suspected cases of collisions between active satellites and space junk in 1996, 2007 and 2009. Since the first object, Sputnik One, was launched into space 53 years ago, mankind has created a swarm of perhaps tens of millions of items of debris. The rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets, abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel. It is estimated that there are 500,000 pieces of space junk floating in Earth's orbit. The picture above shows a ball of twisted metal, thought to be fallen space junk, on a farm in Queensland, Australia, in 2008. Dr Wright, co-director of the union's Global Security Programme, wrote: 'Because of the large number of active satellites in space (more than 900) and the very large amount of debris, we estimate that a collision between a piece of debris larger than 1cm (0.4in) with some active satellite in a near-Earth orbit would occur on average every two to three years over the next decade (prior to several debris-producing events in 2007, our estimate was a collision every five to six years). 'The observed collisions in 1996, 2007, and 2009 seem to roughly agree with this estimate.' One such 'debris-producing event' referred to by Dr Wright in his article was, of course the testing of an anti-satellite missile by China in 2007. The country used a missile to destroy a weather satellite more than 500 miles above the Earth in a show of military might that is thought to have added about 3,000 pieces of debris to the space junk cloud surrounding our planet. Diplomatic documents leaked by Wikileaks later revealed that the U.S. warned China it could take military action in response to Beijing’s use of space missiles. And it emerged that the U.S. even shot down one of its own satellites to demonstrate its ballistic power after China's missile test. Don Kessler, the former head of NASA's Orbital Debris Office, told Space.com the space junk problem is still manageable, since satellite operators can take precautions to safeguard their spacecraft. However, he added, the danger is increasing and, if no agreement can be made to limit the amount of rubbish left in orbit such minor precautions will no longer be enough.","Russian nanosatellite thought to have been destroyed in collision with debris left over from 2007 Chinese space weapon test .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A police officer who fired a Taser at a man covered in petrol who then burst into flames could face criminal charges over the death. Andrew Pimlott, 32, was confronted by two officers in his back garden in Plymouth last year after they were called to reports of a domestic disturbance. During the confrontation Mr Pimlott, who had doused himself in petrol, burst into flames after being hit the with the stun gun. He died five days later from his burns. The Independent Police Complaints Commission launched an investigation into Andrew’s death on April 18 last year and today announced that a file had been passed to the Crown Prosecution Service to consider charges. Andrew Pimlott, 32, died from burns after a police officer shot him with a Taser while he was doused in petrol . The confrontation happened in the back garden of Pimlott's house in Plymouth (pictured) last year. The CPS is now considering charges against the officer who fired the stun gun after and investigation . A spokesman said: ‘Two police officers were called to an address in the Honicknowle area on 18 April 2013 following an emergency call from an occupant. ‘The caller advised that Mr Pimlott, 32, was in the garden with a can of flammable liquid. ‘Shortly after the police arrived, Mr Pimlott sustained serious burn injuries and an ambulance and fire brigade were called. ‘An officer deployed a Taser during the incident. Mr Pimlott was taken to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth and subsequently transferred to the burns unit at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol. ‘He died in hospital on 23 April from his injuries.’ The spokesman said Devon and Cornwall Police had referred Andrew’s death to the IPCC themselves, in line with force protocol. He added: ‘The IPCC interviewed both officers who attended along with other witnesses. The investigation has also gathered views from expert witnesses. ‘The IPCC has now concluded its investigation and sent a file to the Crown Prosecution Service regarding the actions of the one officer who deployed the Taser. ‘It will now be for the CPS to determine whether any criminal charges are merited.’ Police guidance on the use of Tasers advises officers there is a risk of fire where a person is doused with petrol, suggesting that officers factor this in when deciding whether to use the stun gun . According to a 2008 document by the Association of Chief Police Officers on the deployment of Tasers, the Home Office Scientific Development Branch ‘demonstrated that there is a risk of flammability if someone has already been sprayed with an incapacitant containing a flammable solvent.’ The guidance says: ‘Clearly, there is also a risk of flammability where the subjects’ clothing is doused with other flammable liquids. ‘These might include, but are not limited to, lighter fuel, petrol and strong alcoholic spirits. ‘This heightened risk must be factored in when assessing the “appropriateness” and “necessity” of using a Taser. ‘It is however recognised that there are circumstances where the only alternative may be a more injurious level of force, or where activation of the Taser, irrespective of the additional risk, is absolutely necessary to protect life.’ A Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman said: ‘We have cooperated fully with the investigation and we await the decision of the CPS.’","Andrew Pimlott, 32, died after being shot with Taser in garden last year .

"By . Damien Gayle . Skull pieces from an early human who lived 100,000 years ago in northern China suggest that inbreeding might have been common among our ancestors, a new study claims. The remains found at Xujiayao, in the Nihewan Basin, have a now-rare congenital deformation usually only found in incestuously conceived offspring. It adds to a growing body of archaeological evidence that human ancestors regularly inbred at least until the end of the Palaeolithic era. Incest: A view of the Xujiayao site and internal and external view of the Xujiayao 11 skull piece with its position indicated on the drawing of a complete skull . Examination of the skull, known as Xujiayao 11, revealed an unusual perforation through the top of the brain case - an enlarged parietal foramen (EPF) or 'hole in the skull'. The symptom is consistent with modern humans diagnosed with a rare genetic mutation in the homeobox genes ALX4 on chromosome 11 and MSX2 on chromosome 5. These specific genetic mutations interfere with bone formation and prevent the closure of small holes in the back of the prenatal braincase, a process that is normally completed within the first five months of fetal development. It occurs in about one out of every 25,000 modern human births and is associated with inbreeding. Abnormality: Examination of the skull, known as Xujiayao 11, . revealed an unusual perforation through the top of the brain case - an . enlarged parietal foramen (EPF) or 'hole in the skull' Although this genetic abnormality is . sometimes associated with cognitive deficits, the older adult age of . Xujiayao 11 suggests that any such deficits in this individual were . minor. Traces of genetic . abnormalities, such as EPF, are seen unusually often in the skulls of . Pleistocene humans, from early Homo erectus to the end of the . Palaeolithic. Study author . Erik Trinkaus, professor of anthropology at Washington University, said: . 'The probability of finding one of these abnormalities in the small . available sample of human fossils is very low, and the cumulative . probability of finding so many is exceedingly small. 'The . presence of the Xujiayao and other Pleistocene human abnormalities . therefore suggests unusual population dynamics, most likely from high . levels of inbreeding and local population instability.' It . therefore provides a background for understanding populational and . cultural dynamics through much of human evolution, he added. Genetic: The symptom is consistent with modern humans . diagnosed with a rare genetic mutation in the homeobox genes ALX4 on . chromosome 11 and MSX2 on chromosome 5 . Speaking to LiveScience, Dr Trinkaus said: 'These populations were probably relatively isolated, very small and, as a consequence, fairly inbred.' The apparently common occurrence of such genetic abnormalities 'reinforces the idea that during much of this period of human evolution, human populations were very small', he added. The findings of the study, co-authored by Xiu-Jie Wu and Song Xing of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Beijing, were published yesterday in the open-access journal PLOS ONE.","Remains were found in northern China's Nihewan Basin .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A gun and bomb attack on a prison bus near Baghdad today has killed at least 60 people including 52 prisoners and eight police officers. The bus was transporting prisoners from a military base in the town of Taji to Baghdad when it was hit by roadside bombs before gunmen opened fire, according to Ministry of Justice sources. The attack happened after militants fired mortar shells at an army base where suspects facing terrorism charges were being held in Taji, about 12 miles north of Baghdad. Scroll down for video . At least 60 people, including 52 prisoners and eight police officers, have been killed after a bus transporting them was hit by roadside bombs before gunmen opened fire . No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, and the motivation remains unclear. Gun attacks have become common in Iraq after militant group Islamic State seized territory in the north east . Fearing a jailbreak, prison officers filed detainees on to buses and evacuated. But as the prisoners were being taken through an area nearby, militants attacked again. Roadside bombs were set off, leading to a gun battle that left 52 prisoners and eight soldiers dead, the officials said, adding that another eight soldiers and seven prisoners were wounded. It was not immediately clear if the prisoners were killed by soldiers or militants, or if the Islamic State group, who have seized large areas of land in Iraq's north west, was involved. So far, no one has claimed responsibility for the bus attack, which left the vehicle as a burned-out shell on the side of the road. The motive for today's killings is not immediately clear. Much of Iraq's recent bloodshed is linked to sectarian divisions that have deepened since Sunni militants  seized large swathes of northern Iraq last month and declared an Islamic empire. Sunni militants have been carrying out attacks around the southern edge of Baghdad. In response Shiite militias have been abducting Sunnis they suspect of militancy in rural districts of Baghdad, with many later turning up dead. At the time of the attack, inmates were being evacuated from a prison complex after it was hit with mortars . It was not immediately clear if the prisoners were killed by soldiers or militants, or if the Islamic State group was involved in the attack . The tit-for-tat attacks have escalated dramatically since the Sunni militants advance towards Baghdad, the most serious challenge to the Shiite-led government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki since the withdrawal of U.S. forces in 2011. Mass killings  have become a regular occurrence in Iraq for the first time since the worst days of sectarian and ethnic cleansing in 2006-2007. Elsewhere in Iraq today, lawmakers elected a veteran Kurdish politician as the nation's new president. Fouad Massoum, 76, one of the founders of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan party led by Iraq's previous President Jalal Talabani, accepted the mostly ceremonial position after winning two-thirds of the votes in parliament. The vote for president marks an important milestone towards reaching consensus between the country's main political parties, seen as key to stemming the crisis in the country. Massoum is considered a soft-spoken moderate, known for keeping good relations with Sunni and Shiite Arab politicians. But in a sign that the country itself remains deeply divided,  Kurdish peshmerga fighters seized yet more land in their fight against Islamic State militants. Much of Iraq's recent bloodshed is linked to sectarian divisions that have deepened since Sunni militants seized large swathes of northern Iraq last month and declared an Islamic empire . The Kurds have spent weeks battling militants in Jalawla, 115 km (70 miles) northeast of Baghdad, and took complete control of the town today after overnight clashes. Jalawla lies in disputed territory, and is one of several towns where Iraqi troops and Kurdish regional guards have previously faced off against each other. In June, Kurdish forces took control of the northern oil city of Kirkuk after government troops abandoned their posts in the face of the Sunni Islamist rebel march towards Baghdad. Kurds have long dreamed of taking Kirkuk and its huge oil reserves. They regard the city, just outside their autonomous region, as their historical capital. Thursday's violence underscored the urgent need for Iraqi leaders to form a power-sharing government to hold Iraq together as its future as its unified state is increasingly under threat from the advance of Sunni Islamist militants. Iraq's million-strong army, trained and equipped by the United States, has largely collapsed, especially in the north, after Islamists overran the city of Mosul last month. Iraq's politicians have been in deadlock over forming a new government since an election in April.","At least 52 prisoners and eight prison guards injured in attack on bus .

"By . Chris Pleasance . John David Martinez, 68, was caught by police in just five hours after robbing a bank without a mask, wearing a T-shirt with his first name on it, and driving his own car to the crime scene . When robbing a bank, most thieves opt for a balaclava or at least a pair of tights over their heads to protect their identity. But one clueless criminal in Denver was caught by police after holding up a branch of Wells Fargo without a mask - while he was also wearing a t-shirt with his first name written on the front. As an added help for detectives, 68-year-old John David Martinez even drove a car registered in his name to the stick-up. The poorly-planned raid happened on Tuesday at 9am when Martinez drove his silver Honda sedan to a branch of Wells Fargo bank in Denver, Colorado, at around 9am before walking inside and speaking to a female teller. After she greeted him, Martinez said: 'This is a robbery, give me the money.' According to ABC 7News Denver, Martinez handed her a dark zip-up bag and asked her to fill it with notes, before asking her to pass it to another teller who did the same. It is claimed Martinez then took the bag back, walked out of the bank, and drove away in his Honda. He was arrested just five hours later by police who ran his number plate through a computer, got his driving licence photo and matched it to CCTV from the bank. Investigators also showed the pictures to the bank tellers, who confirmed it was the robber, before tracking Martinez' car to a Ramada Inn less than two miles away on the other side of town. After being arrested, Martinez told officers that he and his wife had been kicked out of their house three weeks prior and had moved into the hotel at the start of this week. He told detectives that he had woken up before his wife, left the room without waking her, and then used his car to drive to the bank and rob it. Martinez said he had been kicked out of his home three weeks before robbing this branch of Wells Fargo and was living in a hotel with his wife. He didn't tell her about the crime, and insisted he had borrowed the cash . When he arrived back at the hotel he said his wife was awake. Deciding not to mention the robbery, he instead told her that he had borrowed the money. Martinez was booked into Denver jail on investigation of felony robbery involving $20,000 or more, according to the Denver jail website. Martinez has prior arrests for assault with a deadly weapon, forgery, criminal impersonation, DUI hit and run and resisting arrest, according to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation.","John David Martinez, 68, arrested after robbing a bank in Denver .

"By . Chris Pleasance . The discovery of King Richard III’s remains in a car park may have been out of this world, but a new exhibition has been accused of making him look as if he comes from another planet. Experts are outraged that organisers at the Richard III Visitor Centre in Leicester have painted a copy of the King’s armour white, saying it makes him look like a Star Wars stormtrooper. Members of the team who helped trace the skeleton have also branded an image of Richard lying in his grave as ‘grotesque’, saying it shows a lack of respect for the dead. Scroll down for video . Experts are furious that organisers of a new exhibition of Richard III's remains have painted a copy of his armour white, saying it makes him look like a Star Wars stormtrooper (right) Annette Carson said she and the Looking for Richard Project team were ‘saddened and profoundly disappointed by the exhibition’ at the £4m Richard III Visitor Centre in Leicester, which opened at the weekend. Ms Carson, author of ‘Richard III: The Maligned King’, wrote: ‘Other grotesque exhibits include the white-painted depiction of the king’s armour resembling a stormtrooper from Star Wars, despite representatives of the council and university having attended the presentation by Dr Tobias Capwell in March 2013 where he described his armour and illustrated its actual probable appearance. ‘As an example of the organisers’ taste in these matters, it was only by strenuous insistence that we removed the planned visual which was to greet visitors: the central throne was to be drenched in a sickening pool of blood which dropped down to form words written in blood on the floor below.’ Academics say that staff at the new Richard III Visitor Centre were given a presentation on how the armour would probably have looked, but chose to ignore that advice . Annette Carson, who is part of the team who helped track down the remains, says that alongside the armour there were plans for a blood-soaked throne in the exhibit, but it was removed after her team insisted . She said about the imagery of the dead body: ‘We know this will be devastating not only to those who had trusted that the discovery of Richard’s remains would be conducted with dignity, but indeed to all civilised visitors who believe in the concept of respect for the dead.’ Ms Carson said the exhibition sidelined the efforts of the team which found the remains ‘despite years of research and ground-breaking discoveries’. It also ‘misses out crucial details about original commissioning, funding and work’. The attraction allows visitors to see below their feet to the spot where the king was found by archaeologists in 2012. Miss Carson has also objected to a projection of Richard's body as it would have appeared in his grave, branding it 'grotesque' and saying it shows a lack of respect for the dead . The exhibit also features a 3D printed model of Richard III's skeleton which shows his infamous curved spine and evidence of the wound that killed him at the Battle of Bosworth . Since Richard's body was discovered buried underneath a car park in September 2012, his remains and legacy have proved highly controversial. Arguments immediately broke out over where he would be reburied, with his descendants claiming his body should be laid to rest in York Minster, in accordance with his own wishes. However High Court judges have now ruled that his skeleton should remain in Leicester, where it was taken by soldiers loyal to victorious Henry VII. The skeleton is due to be sealed in a locked tomb at Leicester Cathedral next year. In 2012, an archaeological excavation was undertaken in a city council car park using ground-penetrating radar on the site once occupied by Greyfriars church. The University of Leicester confirmed in February 2013 that all the evidence pointed to the skeleton that had been found in the excavation being that of Richard III. The skeleton of the last of the Plantagenet kings was identified by DNA analysis after researchers traced his living descendants. Richard III was discovered in 2012 beneath a car park . Richard was born in 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire. During the War of the Roses, Richard's father, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York was killed and in 1470, Richard and his brother Edward were exiled when Henry VI, from the rival house of Lancaster, took back the throne. Henry's reign was short lived and during a battle the following year, Edward became king. In 1483, Edward died and Richard was named as protector of the realm for Edward's son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V. Edward V and his brother Richard were placed in the Tower of London and after a campaign to condemn the deceased king's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, the princes were declared illegitimate. Richard III took to the throne the following day. He was crowned in July and in August that year, the two princes disappeared. Rumours spread the king had killed them to remove any threat they may have posed to his reign. In 1485, Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond launched an attack on Richard III on Bosworth Field in Leicestershire. Many of Richard III's key lieutenants defected and he was killed in battle. Henry Tudor took the throne as Henry VII. Supporters of the new king took Richard's body to Leicester where it was buried without pomp or ceremony in the churchyard of Greyfriars. The exact location of the skeleton was lost to the ages until a team from Leicester University, using ground-penetrating radar, discovered it beneath a council car park. The remains were dug out in September 2012, and in February the following year were confirmed to be Richard after DNA analysis. Next year the skeleton will be taken to Leicester Cathedral where it will be locked away in a sealed tomb.","Richard III Visitor Centre opens in Leicester where body was discovered .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Balancing on thin canvas lines tied over canyons up to 450 feet deep, these pictures from America capture the hair-raising sport of highlining. Photographer Cameron Gardner, 24, followed the daredevil athletes to Moab, in Utah and Yosemite, in California to capture these amazing shots of their breathtaking stunts. His pictures show Canadian Julien Desforges and Ray Diaz edging along their slacklines - thin strips of canvas held in place by a winch - taking up to ten minutes to cross from one side to the other. Don't look down: Photographer Cameron Gardner, 24, captures amazing pictures of his friends balancing on highlines up to 450 feet in the air . Balancing act: The pictures were taken as Cameron's friends walked above canyons in Moab, Utah, and Yosemite National Park in California . Focus: Cameron compares highlining to meditation, saying it is less about physical ability and more about relaxing and enjoying the experience . Monkey business: Highliner Ray Diaz dangles above a canyon using just his feet as Cameron Gardner captures the moment in Moab, Utah . Cameron said: 'Walking across a rope so high feels different for everyone it's a balance of fear and joy. Once you are able to calm down and settle in it's a really meditative experience. 'Highlining is definitely not about getting all pumped up on energy and adrenaline. It's about everything all coming together at once and enjoying being in that moment with the natural world. 'Really, highlining is a lot like life: you take it one step at a time until you overcome the obstacle you are facing and are back on solid ground again.' Despite the death-defying appearance of . these pictures, all the highliners are actually tied on to their lines by safety . ropes, which are double knotted and ensure that any fall only lasts for a . couple of feet. Natural beauty: Cameron says highlinging is about relaxing and enjoying a moment of peace out in the natural world, and his photography reflects that . Are you sure that's safe? Cameron says the highliners use two safety ropes to ensure that if they fall, they only drop a few feet before they're left hanging . Adventurous: Cameron's photography focuses on extreme sports and the outdoors, with most of his pictures taken in Southern California . Exhausted: A highliner picks and odd spot to relax while midway across a huge canyon in Moab, Utah . The key to successful highlining is to control your breathing and focus on the other end of the line where it attaches to an object and walk towards that, using outstretched arms for balance. Cameron says he got into photography by shooting still of him and his friends while he was in high school, before continuing the hobby at college. Most of his pictures are taken outside in Southern California and capture his athletic friends performing a number of climbing and highlining stunts. Seeing double: The key to slacklining is to control your breathing, and focus on the point at the other end of the line where it attaches to an object and walk towards that . Watch where you're going: A brave highliner makes his way between two boulders just before the sun sets and it gets too dark to see . Easy does it: The highliners can take up to ten minutes to complete just a short walk as they attempt to focus and use their sense of balance to stop the line from moving .","Cameron Gardner, 24, captured these amazing images of highliners crossing canyons in Utah and California .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Duran Duran are suing their own fan club for $40,000 (£23,500) over claims the club failed to pay them fees. The band, best known for their 80s hits Hungry Like The Wolf and Girls On Film, have filed a lawsuit against a club based in Glenview, Illinois. The suit, filed at Cook County Circuit Court, says that Worldwide Fan Clubs Inc entered into a contract with the band in 2010 agreeing to set up and run a fan club. Duran Duran are suing their own fan club based in Glenview, Illinois, over lack of payments and poor accounting according to court documents . According to the Chicago Sun-Times, the contract stated that the club would sell merchandise and collect membership fees, handing 75 per cent of profits over to the band. Worldwide Fan Clubs Inc were also supposed to keep accurate accounting records and maintain fan club records. The band's lawyers are claiming that the club failed to keep accounts properly and failed to hand over the agreed fees, and are now suing. Duran Duran released their first single, Planet Earth, in 1981 and it went on to reach number 12 in the UK charts. The same year they also released Girls On Film, one of their best-known records, which ended up reaching number five in the top 40 chart. They reached Number One in the UK in 1983 with 'Is There Something I should know' - the song also reach number Four in the U.S. The 80s pop-rock group are best known for songs such as Girls On Film and Hungry Like The Wolf. They are thought to be working on a new album with John Frusciante, of Red Hot Chili Peppers fame . The group, which originally consisted of Roger Taylor, Simon le Bon, John Taylor, Andy Taylor and Nick Rhodes, have topped the chart on two occasions, once in 1983 with Is There Something I Should Know, and again in 1984 with The Reflex. Their last album, All You Need Is Now, released on 21 March 2011 was well received critically but failed to live up to the chart-topping sales power of their previous efforts. In a blog post on their official site, the band have confirmed that they are working on a new album which will include guitar work by John Frusciante, of Red Hot Chili Peppers fame.","Duran Duran are suing their own fan club in Illinois for $40,000 (£23,500)

A Lone Ranger outfit worn by actor Clayton Moore for celebrity appearances after the show finished has sold for $195,000 (£114,000) The auction house says that after retiring from television, Moore made appearances in character at events including fairs. His outfit included a powder-blue shirt and pants, red kerchief, Stetson hat, boots, gun belt and Colt pistols. The outfit spent more than a decade in the collection of a late Texas businessman whose family offered it at auction. Earl Davis, the son of Robert Davis who owned the outfit, said his father was a collector of historic memorabilia, among them a receipt for beef signed by Colonel William B. Travis as he gathered food before the siege of the Alamo in 1836. The outfit was not the one used by Moore during the filming of the show, but the one he wore to celebrity appearances after the series finished . Davis told the Waco Tribune that his father bought the outfit 15 years ago at an auction in San Fransisco. The outfit was part of a Western auction, featuring more than 450 lots including 100 firearms, Navajo rugs, Wild West show artifacts and other antiques.

"By . Chris Pleasance . Mark Lakinski, a paramedic of 30 years, dropped a sick patient off at an ambulance station instead of at hospital because he was due to finish his shift . An experienced paramedic abandoned a sick patient who later died because he was due to finish his shift. Mark Lakinski, from Teesside, Middlesbrough, was sent to pick up the male patient eight minutes before his shift ended. But instead of driving the man all the way to the hospital, Lakinski instead dropped him off at an ambulance station and handed him over to co-workers. As rescue workers tried to take the man to University of North Tees Hospital he stopped breathing, had a heart attack on arrival and later died. Lakinski, of Billingham, Teesside had been due to finish his shift at 4pm but received an emergency call at 3.52pm. The Health Care Professionals Council (HCPC) heard that Lakinski 'admitted the facts, in that he failed to transport a patient directly to hospital, stopping en route at an ambulance station and handing the patient over so he couldbe relieved from duty'. The panel found that Lakinski's actions amounted to misconduct and he has now voluntarily removed himself from the professional register. Lakinski had an unblemished career of 30 years before he took the decision to drive the patient to the Stockton Ambulance station instead of to the hospital. The incident happened on May 18 2009 and at the time Lakinski was suspended from the register for a year. When the ban was lifted he attempted to rebuild his career in the private sector, but since then fresh allegations against him have emerged. Lakinski was not present at the latest hearing this week in London, but has been banned from working as a paramedic unless he applies to be restored to the register.

"By . Chris Pleasance . While most bank robbers might have chosen a balaclava or a more traditional pair of tights to keep their faces hidden during a raid, this thief had other ideas. Instead he strolled into a branch of Barclays with blue masking tape over his face before demanding money from shocked cashiers. Staff handed over bags of notes before the criminal jumped into a metallic green Peugeot estate parked in a service road behind the bank. It's a sticky-tape up: Police are hunting this man who raided a branch of Barclays while wearing blue masking tape around his face as a disguise . Officers say the man escaped with a quantity of bank notes before jumping into a metallic green Peugeot estate car parked at the back of the building . However, a pouch of red dye is then believed to have exploded inside the car, covering the interior and the crook, showing that forward planning is perhaps not his strongest suit. The raid took place at Barclays Bank in Wallisdown in Poole, Dorset, at around 10am on Thursday. Detective Sergeant Dave Colomb, of Dorset Police, said: 'Following enquiries I am now able to release CCTV images of the suspect. 'Even though his faced is disguised it is hoped that someone may recognise him by his clothing and stature. 'It is believed that a security pack containing red dye discharged over the suspect shortly after the robbery. If anyone has seen this man with red dye on his clothing they are urged to contact the police urgently. The raid happened on Thursday at around 10am at this branch of Barclays in Wallisdown, Dorset . 'All calls are treated with the strictest confidence.' The man is described as white, approximately 5ft 10in tall, wearing a light blue Kappa tracksuit top, black Nike tracksuit bottoms and white Nike Air trainers. He was also wearing a baseball cap, which had a fawn coloured peak and white writing on it.

"By . Chris Pleasance . Staying up all night and jumping over bonfires is probably not the best way to cleanse your body, but the ancient ritual of Ivan Kupala is supposed to purify the soul. The pagan ritual is celebrated across Russia, Ukraine and Belarus and originally marked the day of the summer solstice, but was moved to take place on the birthday of John the Baptist after Christianity became the dominant religion. Today festivities include the traditional fire jumping, which is supposed to rid the soul of evil, with the highest jumper brought good luck for the rest of the year. Girls also make wreaths of flowers and candles and the float them out across a lake to bring luck in love. The celebrations last all night and are supposed to ward off evil spirits and beings - including werewolves, witches and mermaids - who supposedly come out to prey on the souls of the wicked. Ivan Kupala is a pagan ritual celebrated across Russia, Ukraine and Belarus which used to mark the day of the summer solstice but was moved to John the Baptist's birthday after Christianity became the dominant religion . The ritual involves jumping over bonfires to purify the soul, as it is believed witches, werewolves and mermaids come out at night to prey on the souls of the wicked . Unmarried women traditionally wear garlands of summer flowers in their hair during the day of festivities. Tradition holds that whoever jumps highest over the flames will have good luck for the rest of the year . After wearing flowers and herbs in their hair, girls float the wreaths out on to a lake with a candle. Pictured right is a burning loop used to stoke the bonfires which represents the sun . The girl whose candle burns the longest is supposed to outlive the others, while the girl whose wreath floats the longest is supposed to be lucky in love. Boys often try to grab a wreath from the water, to attract the attention of the girl who floated it . Another tradition on Ivan Kupala is trying to find the fern flower. It was rumoured that on this night only ferns could produce a bloom, and if somebody saw it, any wish they made would come true . During the day women pick flowers which are woven into headbands or made into rings which are then floated across lakes. Other traditions include playing pranks on one another, and swimming in rivers to cleanse the body . Kupala used to be a pagan tradition, but like . many other ancient ceremonies such as Christmas festivities, it was . assimilated by the Christian faith . Kupala also marks an opportunity for couples to put their relationship to the test. Partners leap over the flames holding hands, and if they fail to make the jump then their relationship is supposedly doomed . Romance was supposed to blossom around the time of Kupala too. Men and women would head into the woods to look for the fern flower, with unmarried women going first, followed by single men . Girls wearing traditional dresses from Belarus jump over a bonfire near the town of Turov during ritual celebrations for Ivan Kupala . Magic and mysticism still play a heavy part in Kupala, despite its links with Christianity. Festivities last all night as it is believed witches take their holiday at the same time, trying to cause as much harm to people as possible . Kupala used to mark the summer solstice on June 20-22, but was changed to John the Baptist's birthday, which used to be the June 23 on the old calendar. By the modern calendar, his birthday is on the 6th July, therefore breaking the link between festivities and the solstice . The Kupala festival is the opposite of the Koliada festival, now held on Christmas Eve which involves walking house to house singing and collecting money - much like in Western Europe . Bonfire jumping forms part of the cleansing rituals held on Kupala, with others including swimming in rivers and lakes, with the most purifying water believed to be had just as the sun comes up . Fire jumping can represent a test of couple's love for one another, or a test of trust and courage for friends who decide to make the leap together . Ivan Kupala is a day-long celebration of fertility, fun, mischief and cleansing that is supposed to bring good luck and fortune to those who take part . Ivan Kupala is an ancient pagan ritual, which used to be known as just Kupala - meaning to bathe. Ivan - meaning John, as in John the Baptist - was added after Christianity came to the region and assimilated the festivities. The ritual was originally held on the summer solstice between June 20 and 22, but was moved to the birthday of St John the Baptist, which was on June 23 by the old Julian calendar. The new Gregorian calendar moved the date to July 6, so the link with the solstice was lost. Despite its associations with Christianity, the festival still draws heavily on mysticism and folk-law. It is believed that witches also take a holiday on this day and come to do harm to people, and that werewolves and mermaids also emerge to roam around and attack the souls of the wicked. The day-long ritual is therefore designed around purity, supposedly cleansing the body and soul and providing protection, fertility and luck to those who take part. The main focus is fire-jumping, with the flames supposedly cleansing the souls of those who pass over it. Couples who can complete the jump holding hands will have a strong relationship, while friends may also jump together to prove their loyalty to one-another. Unmarried women also wear garlands of flowers and herbs in their hair during the day, and at night float the wreaths out on to a lake with a candle. The woman whose flowers float the longest will be lucky in love, while the longest burning candle denotes long life. It is also said that, on this one night, ferns are able to produce flowers, with whoever sights one of the blooms able to make a wish come true. Villagers often take off into the woods in search of the blossoms, with unmarried women allowed to go first with single men following, in the hope that relationships might also blossom in the hunt. During the day, people play pranks on each other, bathe in rivers to cleanse their bodies, and pour water over each other. Towards the evening fires are lit with poles with a flaming loop attached to the end, which represents the sun. These fires are then kept burning all night until morning to ward off any evil which comes near.","Ivan Kupala is a pagan ritual celebrated in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus which originally marked the summer solstice .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Thavisha Peiris, 25, was stabbed to death as he was making the last stop of his final shift as a delivery boy before quitting to work as an IT consultant . A teenager has admitted murdering a Domino's Pizza delivery driver who was just about to quit to work in his dream job as an IT consultant. Kasim Ahmed, 18, pleaded guilty to murdering Thavisha Peiris, 25, along with two counts of robbery at Sheffield Crown Court today. Co-defendant Shamraze Khan, 26, also admitted two counts of robbery but denies murder and will stand trail at the same court starting tomorrow. On the night he died, Mr Peiris had been delivering his last pizza on his final shift as a Domino’s driver in Sheffield, a part-time job that had helped fund his studies. Colleagues, who went to look for Mr Peiris when he failed to deliver his order, found his body slumped in his silver Toyota Yaris at around 10.30pm. Mr Peiris came to the UK to finish an IT degree and graduated from Sheffield Hallam University in 2011 and had secured a job as an IT consultant in the city just before he was killed. His colleagues and police said he had been feeling unwell during his last shift and was going to go home early but agreed to deliver one last order. Mr Peiris came from a hard-working family. His father, who worked for a petrochemical plant before his retirement and his mother, a housewife, saved hard for their children’s education and sent him to a well-regarded school in the Sri Lankan capital. At Sheffield Crown Court (pictured) today, Kasim Ahmed, 18, pleaded guilty to his murder along with two counts of robbery who co-defendant Shamraze Khan, 26, admitted robbery but denied murder . Peiris (far right, pictured with his family) studied IT in Sri Lanka before moving to the UK in 2011 to do a 'top-up' course after winning a place at Sheffield Hallam University . After studying IT, Mr Peiris moved to Britain in 2011 to do a ‘top-up’ course required to bring his qualifications up to degree level. He won a place at Sheffield Hallam University, graduating that year with a degree in information technology. Shortly before his death, he had landed a job as an IT consultant and had been ‘excited’ about starting a career. On the evening he died, he had told his bosses that he was feeling ill and asked to finish work early. However, he agreed to deliver one last pizza before going home and set off at 9.50pm. When he failed to deliver the order, his colleagues became concerned and set off to find him. Peiris used the part-time delivery job to fund his degree studies. On the night he died he complained about feeling ill and was due to go home early, but agreed to stay and do extra work . Peiris was found slumped in his silver Toyota Yaris by colleagues after failing to make a delivery in October last year . They spotted the company’s Toyota Yaris parked in a residents’ bay near the delivery address at 10.30pm, with Mr Peiris ‘slumped in his vehicle’. In a previous statement paying tribute to their son, father Sarath Mahinda Peiris and mother Vajira Peiris Narangoda said: 'We sent our son to the UK to study so he can have a better life. Now we are left with only a broken heart. 'We were devastated and shocked to hear of our son's tragic end and we are still unable to comprehend that he is actually gone. 'Thavisha was one of the most caring and loving sons a parent could have. He was full of life and always had a smile on his face. Anyone who met him immediately liked him.'

"By . Chris Pleasance . Wearing a hat and gown and graduating with three degrees, you could be mistaken for thinking Maadhav Shah is walking out of one of the country's top universities. In fact, 16-year-old Shah isn't even out of high school yet, where he has just managed to get a perfect score on his SAT tests. Shah graduated from American River College (ARC), Sacramento, on Wednesday with associates degrees in maths, physical science and social science while still studying at nearby Granite Bay High School. Graduating from American River College, California, Maadhav Shah (left) already has three degrees and a perfect SAT score on his CV despite being just 16 years old and still in high school . According to Fox 40, Shah has been studying at ARC since he was ten. Usually students have to be at least 16 to start, but in Shah's case instructors made an exception. The experience was far from typical for Shah, who had to take his mother to class with him because of his young age, but he says he managed to make friends and enjoyed his time at the college. Alongside his three degrees, Shah also managed to pass his SAT tests with a perfect score of 2,400. Last year less than 500 students who took the tests, or just 0.03 per cent, achieved that score. Shah completed courses at college while still studying at Granite Bay High School, where he will be a senior next year. He says he will now apply to study engineering at Stanford and Cal Tech . He told Fox: 'When I saw it (the score), I checked to make sure it was my name and my email, and then I was really happy.' Shah is now preparing for his senior year in high school, and is planning to apply to the likes of Stanford and Cal Tech to study a four-year course in engineering.","Maadhav Shah, 16, graduated from American River College on Wednesday .

Army veteran Tessa Snodgrass, 38, told FoxNews.com that Superior HealthPlan contacted her family on Thursday and said her daughter Savannah's Friday surgery is covered. Savannah, who is just seven months old, suffers from seizures and a brain tumor. Covered: An insurance company has said it will cover a surgery for Savannah Snodgrass, pictured, who has a brain tumor . 'We got a call from the neurosurgeon saying they got approval,' Snodgrass told the news channel. 'They had a cancellation today so it worked out.' Though Savannah was being treated by Texas Children's Hospital, Superior HealthPlan said a Tuesday surgery would not be covered and that the hospital was 'out-of-network,' Fox News said. Tessa Snodgrass also told the channel that Superior HealthPlan covered her daughter's medical expenses before that. 'I was shocked,' she earlier told Fox News. 'You don’t expect something like this to ever happen. I was absolutely stunned because they had been sending us to Texas Children's all this time.' As part of her claims to the channel, Snodgrass said she was directed to a different hospital. Fight: Savannah's mother Tessa Snodgrass earlier said Superior HealthPlan said in June a surgery at Texas Children's Hospital would not be covered . Superior HealthPlan cited 'continuity reasons' in a statement to Fox News saying why it would pay.

"By . Associated Press . and Zoe Szathmary . The widow of a National Guard soldier who was allegedly shot by a 15-year-old boy at a Tennessee armory has spoken out about her husband's death. Jennifer Braden, wife of slain Sgt. 1st Class Michael W. Braden, told the Tennessean 'We're still trying to make sense of it. I keep asking why.' 'He always went out of his way to help. I've seen him reach in his wallet and pull out his last $10 and give it to somebody,' she also told the paper. Speaking about suspect Christopher Farrar's age, Braden said 'He's just a child. I don't know why.' Police found 'several' firearms Thursday at Farrar's family's home in Lobelville. Farrar didn't work at the armory - which is . usually locked - but somehow gained access and fired . several shots, authorities said. One struck Braden, 45, who had been with the guard for more than 20 years and . served two tours in Kuwait, law enforcement and Guard officials said. He . died later at a hospital. Victim: Sgt. 1st Class Michael W. Braden, pictured, was allegedly shot by Farrar at the National Guard armory . 'Several' weapons were uncovered in the search, said Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokesman Josh DeVine, and ballistic experts examined whether any were involved in Wednesday's shooting in the rural community of Lobelville, about 50 miles southwest of Nashville. DeVine said agents were looking into 'all leads' - but the analyses of the weapons found at the suspect's house suggested he did not use a gun seized at the armory. A motive has not yet been established. Farrar, who was expelled from high school . for drug offenses, was being held without bond at a juvenile detention . facility, DeVine said. He could, however, be tried as an adult if the . case is shifted from the juvenile system. Farrar was arrested without . incident at his family's home in Lobelville, set amid rolling hills and . woodlands. Maj. Gen. Terry 'Max' Haston, who oversees the state's National Guard, said no extra security protocols at the armory were planned because he believes 'security policies are pretty good as they are.' 'I put out a memorandum this morning to all of our armories to ensure that we continue to do the policies that we already have in place,' he said. However, he acknowledged the loss of a comrade is tough. 'It's always a tragedy when we lose a soldier under any conditions, but to lose one like this is heart wrenching,' said Haston. Suspect: Christopher Farrar, pictured, has been charged with criminal homicide . The shooting took place at the armory for the Tennessee Army National Guard, pictured . It was unclear whether Farrar and Braden knew each other. But Braden, a father of three children, had wide contacts in the area because of outreach with local inmates assigned to help clean the armory as part of a program led by the Perry County Sheriff's Department. A sheriff's department K-9 officer, Rodd Staid, said Braden often supervised the prisoners on the cleaning detail and would try to find them jobs or encourage them to consider military service after their release from custody. 'Excellent guy who would do anything to help anybody,' said Staid. 'It's a tragedy. We lost a good man.' DeVine said the building doesn't have surveillance cameras, but at least one other person in addition to the shooter and the victim was at the armory at the time of the shooting. But DeVine said it was unclear whether there were any eyewitnesses. Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam issued a statement Thursday lamenting Braden's death. 'It's a tragic day when we lose a decorated hero who has served his country so well,' Haslam said. Willodean Kilpatrick, a neighbor of Farrar, said the boy lived with his aunt and arrived about a year ago from Louisiana. She said she would sometimes exchange pleasantries with the boy as he passed and described him as 'quiet.' Remembered: Both Braden's wife and son have spoken publicly about his death . In his footsteps: Sgt. Braden's son Wyatt, pictured, said he plans to continue with his plans to enlist in the Army . Farrar's alleged Facebook account lists him as a 'Satanist,' the New York Daily News points out. Farrar appear to be a member of several groups, including 'Hail Satan,' 'SATANIST ARMY!!!! ALL HAIL SATAN!,' and 'Hail satan (Brutal).' On the latter's Facebook page, Farrar apparently wrote 'Me and My home Boy just made a closed group called ""satanist"" add me and send me a message saying u wanna join and ill add u Its just basically made for satanist to post evil s*** and Hate god Lmao 666 b****.' Braden's son Wyatt, 17, told WREG he plans to go through with enlisting in the Army, despite his father's death. 'It's definitely going to be something I think about as I put on that uniform,' he said. 'When it comes time - if that ever does - come to that point in my military career, I hope I go out the same way,' he also said. Wyatt's account to the affiliate station indicated that his father saved another man. 'He died a hero,' Wyatt said. 'That kid walked in and my dad told the other soldier that was there, you know, ""Stay in the bathroom."" He fought the kid to the best of his abilities.'","Christopher Farrar, 15, allegedly got inside a National Guard armory and shot Sgt. 1st Class Michael W. Braden, 45 .

"By . Sarah Dean . Surrogacy lawyer Stephen Page has slammed Australia's strict regulations as he told how his clients turn to Thai surrogates in desperation . The babies of desperate Australians who are using surrogate mothers in Thailand could end up being put into orphanages after Thai surrogacy laws changed this week, a lawyer has warned. Australians using surrogates in Thailand could also be prosecuted for human trafficking under the new laws that ban surrogacy if the prospective parents aren't blood relatives. Lawyer Stephen Page called the changes 'appalling' and said his clients have been left with no way to contact the pregnant woman carrying their babies, after the Thai military allegedly confiscated medical records from IVF clinics. 'I've been contacted by parents who can't contact the surrogate parents midway through pregnancy. They can't find out whether their baby or the mother is OK,' Mr Page told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's a disaster how the Thai government have announced it. 'These children didn't ask to born in this mess,' he explained. Mr Page spoke out on the same day that it was revealed a Thai surrogate mother revealed she was forced to care for her six-month-old baby after an Australian couple refused to take him home once they found out he had Down syndrome. The Australians had paid 21-year-old Pattharamon Janbua $11,700 to give them a baby but when she gave birth to twins - a boy and a girl - they only took the girl home to Australia. Baby boy Gammy has a congenital heart condition and is critically unwell. The Thai surrogate mother has received more than $182,000 in donations to care for Gammy after he was abandoned . Mr Page said all the Australian couples he'd met only seek overseas surrogacy as a last resort because Australian laws are so restrictive. 'The laws here makes it almost impossible. You can't advertise, you can't get an egg donor. Some people have waited seven years.' He explained that parents who were unable to conceive naturally, cancer patients and gay couples came to him after all other avenues had been exhausted. They usually manage to have a child through a Thai surrogate within 18 months or two years. 'Australians are the highest per-capita users of overseas commercial surrogacy, even though in three states it's a criminal offence,' he said. Over 400 Australian children were born in Thailand between 2012-2013 and 600 were born in India. 'On a global scale that's a huge number. Now the Thai Government have said there won't be any overseas surrogacy allowed at all,' Mr Page explained. Baby boy Gammy has a congenital heart condition and is critically unwell . He said this will cause more pressure on the Australian surrogacy system, plus parents will end up spending over $100,000 to get treatment in the United States or Canada. It is cheaper to have a surrogate child in Thailand and India at around $80,000. Mr Page said the changes in Thai law came after a story in the Bangkok Post about Chinese families using Thai clinics to chose the gender of their surrogate child, which outraged the world. 'Suddenly the Thai Government had a crackdown. They are fearing a loss of face because of that story and they want to be seen as tough,' Mr Page said. The lawyer, who is based in Brisbane but works with Australians who are trying to have children from every state, said he wants the Australian government to take active steps with Thai authorities to make sure people who have signed contracts with pregnant surrogates can get their children back to Australia. 'What I would hate to see is these babies stuck in a Thai orphanage or people prosecuted for child trafficking offences for something that has been legal for years,' he added. The Australian couple who have abandoned Gammy remain anonymous but they reportedly told Ms Janbua to have an abortion when they found out four-months into the pregnancy that one of the babies had Down syndrome. The Australian couple, who have remained anonymous, reportedly told Ms Chanbua to have an abortion . 'I would like to tell Thai women – don't get into this business as a surrogate. Don't just think only for money ... if something goes wrong no one will help us and the baby will be abandoned from society, then we have to take responsibility for that,' Ms Janbua said, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The couple paid an extra $1673 when they first realised - three-months into the pregnancy - that Ms Janbua was having twins for them. Ms Janbua is a Buddhist and thinks abortion is a 'sin'. She originally agreed to become a surrogate mother because of her family's financial problems and the arrangement was set-up through an agency. The Australian man and his ethnic-Asian wife could not conceive a baby themselves. Ms Jambua, from a village in Chonburi province in northern Thailand, gave birth to Gammy and his twin sister in Bangok hospital. However, when the babies were born the agent took the girl away and delivered her to the Australian couple who Ms Jambua has never met. She never received the remaining $2341 that she was owed by the agent and is now struggling to keep her baby alive. A Hope For Gammy campaign has been set up on Go Fund Me and has now smashed its $25,000 target after receiving more than $50,000. The page pleads: '6 month old baby Gammy was born in Bangkok with down syndrome and a congenital heart condition. He was abandoned by his family and is being cared for by a young Thai woman who does not have the funds for his desperately needed medical treatment. 'Please make a donation so that he can have these operations and improve his quality of life. All monies raised will be kept in trust and will only be used for the care and wellbeing of Gammy.' Ms Chanbua, 21, agreed to become a surrogate mother because of her family's financial problems . One doctor has donated $3,000 to the cause. An administrator for the page wrote: 'Dr Pisit of ALL IVF has made a very generous donation after hearing about the Gammy Story. No ALL IVF Center staff have ever been involved in the Gammy case, but are touched by his situation and wanted to help. Thank you very much.' Gammy's tragic story has caused outrage on Twitter. Richard Long wrote: 'Takes a bit to make me angry but this story does. what greedy, selfish people.' Another user, @ChickkinOz, said 'these people need to be financially responsible for this child and woman for life. Unbelievable, how are they parents.' While @BCmanutddesi called it 'OUTRAGEOUS!! 'This story just makes my blood boil!!,' @parentingfiles said. Australians aren't the only people that travel to Thailand for surrogacy reasons. Earlier his year, there were 65 babies stuck in Thailand that were conceived by gay Israeli couples and birthed by surrogate Thai women, the Times of Israel said. The claims were made by the Facebook group 'Help Us Bring the Babies Home.' The babies were allegedly unable to be brought to Israel because the Interior Ministry Gideon Sa'ar has not granted Israeli citizenship to the infants. Commercial surrogacy is banned in Australia and it is illegal for people living in Queensland, NSW and the ACT to undertake commercial surrogacy in Thailand. It's also illegal for Australians to select a baby's sex. Current Australian Medicare policy forbids Medicare rebates for IVF use for surrogacy and to receive surrogacy as a treatment option in Australia the following conditions must be fulfilled: . Many Australians have flocked to Thailand over the years because the rules were far less strict. However, the rules have changed this week.

"By . Sarah Dean . An Australian jihadist has sent sickening threats against his former country after a warrant was issued for his arrest by the Australian Federal Police. Mohamed Elomar and Khaled Sharrouf, from Sydney, are fighting with al-Qaeda off-shoot Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, in Syria, and will be arrested on terrorism-related charges if they ever return to Australia. 'Did you think I would leave your country without leaving a surprise. Fireworks coming up soon keep a close eye,' Elomar wrote on Twitter, The Australian claims. Scroll down for video . Disgusting: Mohamed Elomar, who is believed to have left Australia last year to fight in Syria, is shown holding up the decapitated heads of two men . After one Twitter user told him not to come back to Australia, he replied: 'No u idiot injured, dnt worry wouldn't want to go bk u should be more worried about wats coming to australia! [sic]' This comes after Daily Mail Australia revealed a disturbing photo of Elomar holding up two decapitated heads for the camera in Syria. The picture was uploaded on Friday by his friend, convicted terrorist Sharrouf, on Twitter. In the sickening image, Elomar is seen smiling - with a pair of sunglasses tucked into his shirt - as he holds up two decapitated heads by the victims' hair. Elomar wrote threats to ASIO on Twitter claiming he had been injured but would soon be fighting again . Despite being from Sydney originally, Elomar claimed that Australians should be worried about what is coming to the country . Eloma, also sent tweets aimed directly at ASIO on Tuesday, claiming he had been injured but would soon be fighting again. 'ASIO dnt worry I'll be Bak in direct conflict very soon, just need abit time for my knee injury suffered against Jash Al hoor,' he wrote. He added: 'Don't worry ASIO there is plenty of work for you guys coming up.' Criticisng his former country he said: 'He wrote Australian zionist Jews killing men and woman and children in Gaza is okay. Thumbs up Australia.' The 29-year-old's fighting name uses the world Australia and he used Australia's koala bear in one Tweet about his terrorist group ISIS . On Tuesday he compared the terrorist activity in Syria to the war on Gaza . He claimed people 'need to be stopped' and said there is a war on Islam . Another disturbing image, uploaded on Friday by Sharrouf, shows the heads of alleged Syrian solders being impaled on metal railings. Like something out of the 18th century, the heads were left on show in a sickening display that aims to cause terror and fear. The photos were shown alongside disgusting tweets such as 'bucket full of heads any1 in aus want some organs please dont be shy to ask I would love to assist u with body parts [sic]'. His disturbing rant continued 'few more heads how lovely bludy amazing stuff abuhafs u keep cutting those infidel throats but the last 1 is mine! [sic]' Sharrouf previously spent time in jail for his part in a foiled plot to blow up targets in Sydney and Melbourne. He is thought to have flown to Syria with Elomar late last year on his brother Mustafa's passport. Disturbing: Sharrouf also posted a photo of two men placing severed heads on a metal railing . Elomar's wife Fatima, 29, is still in Sydney with their four children. She appeared in court in Sydney on July 8 charged with 'preparing for incursions into a foreign state with the intention of engaging in hostile activities'. Fatima's lawyer, Zali Burrows, said on Tuesday that Elomar's arrest warrants for terrorism was not a surprise. However, she told the Sydney Morning Herald that she doubts the veracity of the Twitter posts, saying Elomar did not use the social network. She also claimed the photo of Elomar with severed heads may have been photoshopped. Elomar is also the brother of Ahmed Elomar, who was arrested in Lebanon for alleged terrorist links in 2007 and then sentenced to jail in Sydney in June for brutally bashing a police officer in the Hyde Park riots . Fatima Elomar hides under a burqa as she emerges from the Downing Centre court complex with her lawyer Zali Burrows (right) and four children after appearing on terrorism related charges . Mohomed Elomar (right) used to be a champion boxer. Here he is seen fighting Pises Buachai at the Entertainment Centre in Sydney, Wednesday, March 7, 2007. Elomar won the fight. Ahmed Elomar (right) punches Denchai Tiabkoon of Thailand in 2005 during a boxing match. Ahmed Elomar won the match to win the IBO Asia Pacific Featherweight Championship Title . Rioter Ahmed Elomar was sentenced to at least two and a half years in jail for the attack that happenned on September 15, 2012. The former champion boxer hit an officer with a pole during a confrontation in Sydney’s angry Islamic march as part of a global protest against the anti-Islamic YouTube clip The Innocence of Muslims. Judge Donna Woodburne said he had had 'agitated the crowd' as part of a group of 'aggressive men'. Ahmed Elomar's barrister Greg James QC told the Sydney District Court that his client was suffering an 'impaired intellectual state'. The two brothers, Ahmed and Mohamed, used to be champion boxers, Ahmed has competed in more than 20 professional bouts. The convicted terrorist said he wanted to cut 'infidel throats' He directed his tweets to people in Australia and joked about organ donation . Convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf has threatened the Australian Federal Police and his countrymen on his Twitter account . In 2007, their father Mamdouh Elomar slammed the clerics who he believes radicalised his sons in Sydney. Mr Elomar told The Sun-Herald that he urged his children to stay away from Sheik Mohammed at the Global Islamic Youth Centre. 'Sheiks like Feiz ruin people,' Mr Elomar said. 'He is not a sheik; he is brainwashing all these children. I know my religion, so I can tell him when he is wrong, but these kids believe everything he says and think it's their religion. Someone needs to stop him. 'Today our kids are either at one extreme, partying or using drugs, or at another extreme with their religion. I don't teach my children to hate non-Muslims. I have taught them to love everyone.' Sydney's angry Islamic marched in September 2012 as part of a global protest against the anti-Islamic YouTube clip The Innocence of Muslims . Supporters of Ahmed Elomar leaving the Central Local Court in Sydney, on September 18, 2012 . On Thursday night Attorney General George Brandis's spokesman said that 'if real, these photos are evidence of serious crimes against Australian law and possible war crimes.' Daily Mail Australia has contacted AFP for further comment. Sharrouf has also taunted Australian police via his social media account two weeks ago, boasting that he would 'slaughter' Australians. Those tweets came as the nation's Director General of Security David Irvine revealed 'tens of people' had already returned to Australian shores from fighting alongside suspected terrorist organisations. Speaking to media earlier this month, Attorney-General George Brandis said engagement with the Islamic community was an important strategy 'to keep Australia free from terrorism'. 'The imams who are faith leaders, who are influential and respected opinion members in their communities, are integral to our goal to saving young men - it is almost always young men - in their communities from being radicalised,' he said. Mr Irvine added a majority of the 60 Australians they were aware of fighting with Islamic radicals were siding against the government with Al-Qaeda off-shoots. 'We have some tens of people that have already returned [from the Middle East], we have probably another 150 we're looking at here in Australia who have inclinations to support those two extremist movements,' he said. When asked if the ones who had returned to Australia were being actively monitored, Mr Irvine said 'I'm not saying anything further'. On July 14, Sharrouf fired off a tweet to the AFP and Australians, saying: 'you cowards I am running to my death I want martyrdom thats [sic] why I am blessed u rock spiders'. Just half an hour earlier, he claimed 'Australia belongs to the muslims not infidels like you' as well as boasting of his evasion of police. 'u can't stop and trust me if I wanted to attack aus I could have easily,' Sharrouf said. He also added: 'I love to slaughter [Australians] & ALLAH LOVEs when u dogs r slaughtered'. These threatening tweets are part of a more disturbing picture of Sharrouf painted by his Twitter account. Some of the content is so graphic that Daily Mail Australia has chosen not to publish the posts. On July 14, Sharrouf tweeted he loved to slaughter Australians to the AFP . He said it would have been easy for him to attack Australia if he wanted . Sharrouf's account is littered with photos of him posing with weapons and military trucks as well as a young child brandishing a rifle .","Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar have warrants out for their arrests .

"By . Sarah Dean . A Russian athlete who married Australian Olympic champion Steve Hooker after meeting him at the Beijing Olympics has been banned for two years for drug use. Ekaterina Kostetskaya, who gave birth to the couples' first child last year, received the doping ban after a world championship race on August 30, 2011. The decision against the middle-distance runner was made by the World Anti-Doping Agency. When Hooker retired from pole vaulting in April he said: 'I can now spend time supporting Katya in achieving what she wants in her career.' Australian pole vaulter Steve Hooker's wife Ekaterina Kostetskaya has been found guilty of using drugs and banned from athletics for two years . Records from the 28-year-old's athlete biological passport, which is an electronic record for professional athletes, show she has been found guilty of 'use/attempted use of a prohibited substance/method' The biological passport allows for doping violations to be detected by noting variances from an athlete’s established levels outside the allowed limits, rather than testing for and identifying illegal substances. Kostetskaya came fifth in the 800m race in Daegu, South Korea, in 2011, where she is alleged to have used drugs. She has been handed a two-year ban from the sport and won't be able to race again until January 20, 2015. The runner's offence was listed as on August 30, 2011 - coinciding with her fifth placing in the 800m final at the world championships in Daegu . Kostetskaya has been handed a two-year ban from the sport and won't be able to race again until January 20, 2015 . Kostetskaya and the now-retired Hooker, an Olympic and world pole vault champion, met at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and married in 2012. The 32-year-old is the third highest pole vaulter in history, behind Sergey Bubka and Renaud Lavillenie. He became the first Australian male track and field gold medallist in 40 years when he won gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics with a vault of 5.96 metres. He retired from athletics in April 2014, choosing to focus on his family. Kostetskaya gave birth to their first son, Maxim, in 2013. 'After some serious thought I've decided to move onto the next phase of my life and focus on new things that bring me as much joy as athletics has for the past 15 or so years,' reflected Hooker in an interview with the IAAF. 'Family is my biggest priority now. Being a husband and a father is amazing, and I love the change from being an individual athlete with just me to worry about,' he added. 'I can now spend time supporting Katya in achieving what she wants in her career. She has done so much already but she has results that suggest she is more than capable of doing more and I want to be able to assist as much as I can in making that happen.'","Middle-distance runner Ekaterina Kostetskaya banned for two years .

"By . Sarah Dean . A relieved mother has described how a parent’s group on Facebook helped save her toddler's life after her serious illness was undetected by doctors and resulted in emergency surgery. First-time mother Kerry , 37, turned to her local Inner West Mum’s support group in Sydney on the social media site after her 21-month-old daughter Gracie’s ear began drastically swelling. She posted a photo of a red lump on her daughter’s head on the Facebook group and was immediately inundated by advice and support from fellow mums. Just in time: 21-month-old Gracie received surgery to release the pressure that had built up in her skull just in time . They urged Kerry to rush to the hospital straight away and one even correctly diagnosed Gracie with mastoiditis, an infection that extends to the air cells of the skull behind the ear. If left untreated it can spread to the brain, causing serious complications. 'The main one that stuck in my head was from a lady called Emily. She put a picture up of her daughter with the exact same condition,' Kerry told Daily Mail Australia. The woman also told Kerry her daughter was in hospital for ten days. Doctors have now confirmed what Gracie had was a severe case of mastoiditis. Her daughter had an abbess and during emergency surgery they drilled into her skull to release the pressure before it spread. 'You can't imagine it was horrendous,' Kerry said of her terrifying night in hospital. Worrying: The swelling behind Gracie's ear concerned her mother Kerry so she posted this photo on Facebook . Terrified: The first-time mum said she trusted her mother's instinct and rushed her daughter straight to hospital after receiving warnings on Facebook . Kerry had been concerned for her daughter's health for about eight weeks, since Gracie started day care and suffered a chest infection which she didn’t seem to get over. She returned to the doctors about two or three times a week with her sick child but began to feel neurotic after she was told it was usual for children to get sick after joining day care. When Gracie's temperature rocked to above 40 degrees on Saturday 19 July she first rushed her to hospital. Doctors told Kerry it was a mid-ear infection and prescribed her antibiotics which helped calm the temperature for a short while. Gracie returned to day care but staff told Kerry she still seemed 'grumpy'. The next day, while Kerry was bathing her daughter, she noticed a red bump sticking out behind Gracie’s head and took a picture and sent it to her mother. Inundated: Kerry's update on Facebook received over 600 likes from mothers in the support group . 'Giggling again': Kerry said Gracie, seen here after surgery, is back to her normal happy self again now . Hesitant: Kerry's husband Paul (left) wasn't as sure about listening to advice from Facebook . She then posted it on Facebook and had received 60-70 replies within an hour, with many telling her to get her daughter to hospital immediately. It was 9.30pm by that point and her daughter was in bed when she received the warning. Kerry's husband Paul was concerned about taking advice from the internet and waking Gracie up when she was unwell. But Kerry said she listened to her mother’s instinct and rushed her daughter there as soon she received the advice. The family waited inside the hospital until 4am and were about to go home when a doctor came to see them. 'Because we’d been in there for five hours, it got to four in the morning and I thought ""maybe you are right"". We were putting our coats on and were about to leave. We were falling asleep. But luckily we didn’t as I can’t imagine what would have happened if we left,' Kerry said. Restless: Kerry waited anxiously for three hours while her daughter was in surgery . Long night: The family waited inside the hospital until 4am and were about to go home when a doctor finally came to see them about Gracie . The doctor apologised and said Gracie needed surgery immediately to relieve the swelling before it reached her brain. A CT scan followed and they were in theatre within hours, where doctors drilled into Gracie’s skull to receive pressure from the swelling. Kerry waited anxiously for three hours while her daughter was in surgery. 'We hadn’t slept and seeing this vulnerable little person - she is your life – and you see her wheeled off on a trolley. 'You are frantic basically,' Kerry said. 'At one point during the CT scan they rang me to say it was mastoiditis and when they operate it may affect her facial nerves and her hearing. They have to tell you that but it’s so scary,’ Kerry added.Doctors have now told Kerry she did the right thing and was just in time. Support: Worried mothers were relieved to hear Gracie is OK . 'She is my life': Kerry said the couldn't sleep after seeing their daughter 'wheeled off on a trolley' Relieved: Kerry said she didn't realise how important Facebook was at the time . After getting out of surgery on Wednesday, Kerry thanked all the ‘wonderful mummies’ on Facebook who advised her. 'Just wanted to give a great big shout out to all you wonderful mummies that advised me/encourage me last night. It’s been an horrendous 24 hours, but my daughter had surgery today and thank The Lord I went in when I did, as the surgeon said any longer about would have been much more serious. She is doing well and I can’t wait I get her well again! You are such a wonderful group!,' she wrote. Kerry received over 600 likes from relieved mothers and was also sent gifts by two mums who had heard about the story, including one woman who was on her hospital ward. Kerry and Gracie are now back at home and the toddler is already 'giggling again'. 'She's fine, we came home yesterday she’s got a lovely scar but luckily it will be hidden by her hair. 'She's giggling again and happy and I guess now on reflection I know now she hasn't been herself lately. 'She's back to normal. At the time I didn't realise how important it was I to put it on Facebook.'","First-time mother turned to support group on Facebook after her daughter Gracie's ear began drastically swelling .

"By . Sarah Dean . and Aap . A man who plunged seven floors from a Cairns high-rise casino hotel, smashing through a glass awning, may have been murdered, police say. The 51-year-old man from Tully, in Queensland's far north, died after falling from a balcony in a guest room early on Saturday morning. Queensland police are trying to track down a woman who spoke to him before he fell from an upper floor of the Pullman Reef Hotel Casino, on Wharf Street, about 6.20am. A 51-year-old man, seen here on the right, fell from an upper floor of the hotel about 6.20am on Saturday . They have released grainy CCTV footage of a woman wearing a striped top who'd spoken to him about two hours earlier at 4.15am. The man was wearing a white shirt as they spoke. 'We are very keen to try and work out who she is,' a police spokesman told ABC radio. They also want to talk to three people in a car the man, who reportedly worked in the sugarcane industry, also spoke to before he fell. Police hope this woman can shed light on the suspicious death of a man who fell from a high-rise building in Cairns . The man was a guest at the Reef Hotel in Cairns . 'At the moment (we) are treating it as if it is homicide, but we're remaining open as to whether or not it actually is,' Cairns Crime Investigations Branch Detective Sergeant Adrian Worth has told The Cairns Post. He said a male associate of the man had been helping police but he's been released without charge. Police have also interviewed a number of other witnesses. 'We would also like to hear anything that might help our investigation from anyone who was in adjoining or nearby hotel rooms at the time of the incident,' he said. The Pullman Reef Hotel Casino is a large complex with four restaurants, four bars, a casino nightclub, and a roof-top Rainforest Dome. The hotel's director Wayne Reynolds told Daily Mail Australia: 'We give our deepest condolences to the family and are assisting police with their investigations.' Staff at the hotel in Cairns became aware of the incident at 6.20am .","51-year-old man died after falling around 6.20am on Saturday .

"By . Sarah Dean . Infected: Dr Kent Brantly, from Texas, with his wife Amber . Australian's have been warned against travelling to areas affected by Ebola in West Africa after an infected plane passenger introduced the deadly virus to Nigeria. There are fears an outbreak could spread worldwide and scientists in Geelong, Victoria, are currently working with live samples of the disease to find a cure. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade urged travellers on Tuesday that the disease is of 'significant concern'. 'Australians in West Africa are advised to maintain strict standards of hygiene and avoid direct contact with patients with Ebola or unknown illnesses,' a statement said. 'Avoid contact with any objects that could have been contaminated with bodily fluids. Travellers should avoid contact with wild animals and should not eat or handle raw or undercooked animal products, such as blood and meat,' it stated. Scientists in a high-security laboratory at CSIRO's Australian Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong, Victoria, are working on ways to tame the highly infectious Ebola virus. The first live sample of Ebola arrived in Australia last September for the scientists to test. Dr Glenn Marsh said they are working with pigs and ferrets to find a cure. 'No one has ever put Ebola into a ferret, so we don’t know what will happen,' he told the Border Mail this month. Protective gear: Dr Brantly, right, became infected by the disease while trying to stop it . 'But we will be looking for similar symptoms in the ferret to what you would see in humans.' Previous outbreaks of Ebola were confined to forests and rural areas, but this one has already spread across four countries in West Africa, killing 672 – the disease’s biggest death toll. The news came as it emerged that an American doctor working for a charity in Liberia had become infected. Dr Kent Brantly, 33, from Texas, had moved to the country for the Samaritan’s Purse organisation with his children and wife, Amber, to help contain the disease. More than 1,000 others have been infected by the virus, which can go unnoticed for three weeks and kills 90 per cent of victims. The outbreak started in Guinea in February and spread to neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone in weeks. After an air traveller brought it to Nigeria, health experts now fear infected air passengers who do not realise they have the virus could spread it around the world. With 170million people, Nigeria is Africa’s most populous nation and airlines fly from there to Britain, other European countries and North America. Civil servant Patrick Sawyer collapsed at Lagos airport in Nigeria on July 20 after flying in from Liberia, where he had attended the funeral of his sister, who had also succumbed to the disease. His plane also landed in Togo on its way to Nigeria, prompting fears that the virus may have also reached a fifth country. Professor Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriology at the University of Aberdeen, said: ‘If the disease gets going in Nigeria it would be cause for concern. ‘Nigeria has close links with the UK and many other countries.’ Nigeria, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are now screening air passengers – but doctors say this may not be effective because Ebola has an incubation period of two to 21 days and cannot be diagnosed on the spot. Symptoms include high fever, bleeding and damage to the nervous system. There is no vaccine or cure. It is spread by contact with infected blood or other bodily fluids. All outbreaks since 1976 when Ebola was first identified have been in Africa, with the previous highest death toll being 280.","Health experts fear passengers could now be carrying the virus .

"By . Sarah Dean . An Australian company may have found the solution to one of the nation's most annoying summer-time problems - the thong blow-out. Thongs, also known as flip-flops and jandals, have existed in various guises since the ancient Egyptians in 1,500 B.C. But only now has a proper fix for the all-too-common blow-out - when the Y-shaped strap slips through the sole of the shoe - reportedly been found. And the public seem pretty certain that the solution will work as they've already coughed up over $13,000 to help a start-up fund the shoe's production. With $10,000 of Willi Footwear's $30,000 goal being raised in just one hour. Scroll down for video . Blow-out: A man falls on the floor after a classic thong disaster as the Y-shaped strap slips through the sole of the shoe . An Australian company may have found the solution to the summer-time problem . Taking on global king of thongs Brazilian company Havaianas, the Gold Coast based company have developed 'patented boomerang plugs' that they promise won't pull through the sole, unless you want them to. If you want to change the colour of your thongs, the straps and bases are interchangeable allowing for a number of different colour combinations. Willi Footwear's crowdfunding page on IndieGoGo.com says it is raising money to get its product on the shelves of Australia's leading retailers 'with a goal to have them available in the US Market and other countries around the world'. So far the five guys behind the company have designed, developed, tested and patented the product. Now they are asking for help to raise $30,000 to use for the production run, molds, patent fee's, shipping and logistics. Willi Footwear found Brad Munro is the man behind the 'boomerang' strap idea . Willis Footwear have tested the boomerang straps and now want the money to bring the thongs to shops across Australia and eventually the world . A donation of $25 will give you one pair of thongs and a pair of straps, plus free delivery in Australia, USA and Canada. The donation packages range in cost - right up to $4,999 for the most serious of thong lovers. For this amount, donators will get to spend a weekend away with the owners of Willi Footwear in the Gold Coast, including a limousine ride, hotel on the beach, dinner and a helicopter ride. Plus 20 pairs of thongs. Brad Munro and Aaron Jennings, who wear thongs to work, appear in a promotional video for the revolutionary product . The thong straps and thong base can reportedly be changed to mix and match colour combinations in less than 30 seconds . The thongs have been plugged on social media and Willi Footwear raised $10,000 in just one hour of crowdfunding . Crowdfunding - funding a project or venture by raising money from a large number of people - has existed for centuries. In 1783, Mozart used it to raise money to perform three concertos in a Viennese concert hall. In exchange for backing this effort, he offered manuscripts of the concertos. However, since the boom of crowdfunding websites it has become an especially common way for entrepreneurs and start-ups to financially back their projects. There are two different types: equity based crowdfunding, where investors receive a share in the company, and reward based crowdfunding where investors receive a product or service. A May 2014 report, released by The Crowdfunding Centre in the UK showed that during March 2014, more than $60,000 US was raised on an hourly basis via crowdfunding websites. The most successful crowdfunded project to date is Star Citizen, an online space trading and combat video game. By July 2014 funding surpassed $48 million, according to developer Chris Roberts. A donation of $25 on the crowdfunding page includes one pair of thongs and a pair of straps plus free delivery in Australia, USA and Canada .","Gold Coast based company Willi Footwear has developed the new thongs .

However, Australia's biggest banks are determined not to let that stop people buying and have rolled out their best ever mortgage rates. Commonwealth Bank dropped its five-year fixed rate to below 5 per cent on Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Soaring: Sydney's median house price is now a staggering $811,837 . This means the monthly repayments on a $400,000 mortgage have been lowered by $166 a month.

But Melbourne recorded 10 per cent growth to $608,000, according to the latest report from Australian Property Monitors (APM). June quarter prices showed capital city housing markets are showing no signs of slowing down, APM senior economist Dr Andrew Wilson said. 'Most capital cities are maintaining or exceeding the solid to strong prices growth levels recorded during the previous quarter,' he told AAP. 'Other leading indicators of housing market activity such as home loan activity and auction clearance rates point to continued solid buyer activity through 2014.' Canberra was the only capital city not to have an increase in house prices in 2013/14, dropping by 0.5 per cent to a median price of $576,000. Despite strong growth in median house prices, unit prices were more varied. Sydney's 13.3 per cent growth did pull the national average up to 8.3 per cent, but Brisbane, Canberra and Hobart all fell.

"By . Sarah Dean . Father-of-three Michael Calder was diagnosed with the virus by a doctor . A healthy 33-year-old real estate agent with three young children has died of viral meningitis after complaining of a headache for three days. Top realtor Michael Calder, who has been described as an active adventure lover, was diagnosed with the virus by a doctor and died in hospital on July 11. The Brisbane man's partner, Andrea Young, 42, has paid tribute to the 'amazing family man' who she fell in love with at a work function in 2004. Mr Calder was a principal of Belle Property Ascot and had worked in the industry for 10 years. 'The situation is just dreadful but I have to be strong,' Ms Young told the Courier-Mail. 'We've got three boys aged four, six, and eight and I have to be strong for them.' A testimonial on the Belle Property website described Mr Calder as a 'friendly professional' with an 'unparalleled record for consistently achieving outstanding results in his local market'. 'Michael's absolute passion for people and property makes him an enthusiastic agent, with highly developed negotiation skills to obtain the best result for his clients,' the website said. Family man Mr Calder posted this photo of his partner's car on Facebook, writing: 'Congrats to my beautiful Andrea Young your new toy has arrived safe & sound...enjoy babe!' As well as property, Mr Calder had a passion for camping, fishing and four-wheel drive adventures. Most cases of viral meningitis are usually mild and most people usually recover in a week or two. It is very rare for the virus to be fatal. Symptoms can be similar to those of the common flu and can develop quickly, over a matter of hours. The main symptoms usually include fever, vomiting, headache, stiff neck, sensitivity to light, and drowsiness or altered consciousness. Although the signs and symptoms do not appear in a definite order and some may not appear at all.

"By . Sarah Dean . Australians eat more than any other nation when they set sail on fancy cruise holidays, it has been claimed. Sydney-based travel writer Amanda Woods learned some ships actually stock up on more food when they know a large bunch of Aussies are coming on board. Woods made the discovery in December 2013 while holidaying in the South Pacific on MS Oosterdam, a Holland America ship. Amanda Woods (left) was told Australians eat more than any other nation when they come on board cruise ships . Speaking with a tour guide on board, she was told they always had to 'order more' food when Australians come on board. 'The cruise I was on had more Australians on than ever before. We were going out of Sydney,' Woods told Daily Mail Australia. It was the first time the experienced traveller had cruised out of an Australian port and travelled with a group of Aussies. 'It's all inclusive. You pay for alcohol prices but they are often better than on land and it's so easy the food is there all the time.' Ms Woods was allowed into the kitchens of MS Oosterdam to see the fine food being prepared . 'I enjoyed the omelette and club sandwich so much that I ended up having them both in my cabin twice, and didn’t get around the rest of In Room Dining menu,' Ms Woods said . She explained 'cocktail happy hours' were her weakness, with low cost prices meaning she was only spending $6 or $7 for a cocktail. 'It was cheaper than a beer in Sydney,' she laughed. Ms Woods said she develops 'cruise curves', while another passenger told her they take scales on board to monitor any weight gain. 'We were all laughing about how much we were overeating,' she added. Writing on her blog Ms Woods explained: 'There's something about stepping on board a cruise ship that makes normal eating – and drinking – patterns just fly out the stateroom window. Sure, there are those who nibble on salads and actually go to the gym, but for the rest of us it's a case of ""I'm on holiday, I should enjoy my food"" to the power of a curvy 10.' Woods travelled the South Pacific in December 2013 on MS Oosterdam, a Holland America ship . 'Second or third helpings at breakfast followed by a three-course lunch, an afternoon tea or ice cream (or both) and then a four-course dinner with a cheese chaser are perfectly acceptable. In fact, it feels like it would be a waste not to take advantage of such a bounty of food. Especially when so many of your fellow cruisers (or should that be enablers?) are doing the same,' she added. Amused by the idea that her fellow countrymen were making a name for themselves as the greediest guests, the travel writer did some further research and found that coffee, salmon and gin and tonic are some of the particular items that ships stock up on when they know Aussies are travelling. Cruise ship company Carnival claimed in 2013 that 'when they have Australians on board coffee orders are up 500 per cent compared to Americans,' Ms Woods remarked. The chefs preparing one of the many dishes on offer to hungry Australians . 'There’s something about stepping on board a cruise ship that makes normal eating – and drinking – patterns just fly out the stateroom window,' Ms Woods explained . 'They make lots of flat whites,' she laughed. 'When they are coming out of Australia the Carnival Spirit also has to put 10 kg of salmon a day on extra. 'And the number of gin and tonics drunk also goes up 200 per cent over the Americans,' she said. Ms Woods documented her trip on Holland America's Ms Oosterdam on her blog Adventures All Around, where she posted examples of the food she devoured on board. 'There was this insane desert, this crème brulee, it was super fancy,' she said. One of the many courses being prepared for the cruise ships guests enjoying their all inclusive feasts . 'Everything on there was insane, you pay 10 dollars for lunch and 25 dollars for dinner,' she explained. Ms Woods' South Pacific cruise visited exotic places such as Fiji and New Caledonia and she then had 'the joy of coming into Sydney harbour'. 'Everyone gets up at 5.30am in the morning as you come in to the harbour when the sun is rising through the heads,' she said. A spokesperson for Holland America told Daily Mail Australia: 'The comment that was made on the galley tour was very anecdotal and wasn't based on any official fact.'","Amanda Woods made the discovery while on a South Pacific cruise .

"By . Sarah Dean . He may have lost out on being the first man to step foot on the moon... but Buzz Aldrin was the first to take a selfie in space. Two days before the 45th anniversary of his and Neil Armstrong's groundbreaking foray onto the moon's dusty lunar surface on July 20, 1969, Aldrin tweeted perhaps one of the best selfies ever. 'Did you know I took the first space selfie during Gemini 12 mission in 1966? BEST SELFIE EVER,' he wrote alongside the unique photo. Scroll down for video . Best selfie ever? Buzz Aldrin took the first ever space selfie in 1966 . The snap shows Aldrin's young face - partly obscured by his space helmet - lit up, as he tilts to fit into the photo. There is a stunning glimpse of planet earth viewed from space in the background. Talking about the 1966 photo, the 84-year-old said in an interview with CNN: 'I didn't realise I was pioneering the selfie.' Aldrin began his career as an astronaut in 1963 after serving in the United States Air Force. Two days before the 45th anniversary of Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong first walking on the moon, Aldrin tweeted the unique photo . The retired astronaut, pictured here in January, claims he pioneered the space selfie . On his 1966 mission to space on Gemini 12, Aldrin was proving methods of extra-vehicular activity (EVA) and set a record for demonstrating that astronauts could work outside spacecraft. 'We were docked to the other spacecraft... there was an experimenter from North West University and he wanted pictures taken of ultraviolet stars, so we could only take pictures at night,' he explained of the mission. During the daytime, Aldrin said he was looking down at earth and the lakes around Houston, Texas, when he thought: 'What am I going to do during the daytime?' It was then that he decided he would 'look at the camera and hit the button'. 'What for? I don't know. I wondered what I looked like,' he said.

He began his career as an astronaut in 1963 after serving in the United States Air Force . Aldrin posing for a photograph beside the deployed United States flag during an Apollo 11 Extravehicular Activity (EVA) on the lunar surface . 'Another claim to fame for Buzz,' he laughed in the CNN interview. Aldrin's first claim to fame was, of course, walking on the moon behind Armstrong. Armstrong famously stepped out of Apollo 11 and said 'that's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind'. While Aldrin's first words on the moon were 'Beautiful view. Magnificent desolation.' He was reportedly second out of Apollo 11 because it was easier for Armstrong to exit the spacecraft first because of their positions inside the compact lunar landing module. Armstrong died on August 25, 2012, in Cincinnati, Ohio, after complications resulting from heart surgery. On Sunday, Aldrin tweeted of his old friend and colleague: 'On this 45th anniversary of our moon landing I am heading to KSC to meet up with Michael Collins. Neil will be missed but with us in spirit.' Collins was the command module pilot for Apollo 11. He orbited the Moon while Armstrong and Aldrin walked on the surface.

"By . Australian Associated Press . and Sarah Dean . Schoolchildren have led thousands of protesters through Sydney's CBD, demanding an end to Israel's military offensive in Gaza. Stunned shoppers watched on as a crowd of more than 2000 marched down George Street, waving flags and chanting, 'In our thousands, in our millions, we are all Palestinian.' It is Sydney's second major pro-Palestine rally in a fortnight. Parramatta woman Buthania Saeed took her children to Sunday's protest, which came days after four youngsters were killed in an air strike as they played on a beach in Gaza City. Schoolchildren led a march through Sydney's centre on Sunday. They held plastic dolls to signify the loss of innocent babies' lives in Gaza . 'I'm here as a mum to raise awareness of what's happening in Gaza,' Ms Saeed, 41, told AAP. 'All we're seeing is women and children being murdered, houses are being burnt down and families are being vanished.' One demonstrator held up a baby doll swaddled in fake blood-drenched sheets, and stretcher bearers carried child-like figures wrapped in white. More than 350 Palestinians and seven Israelis have been killed in the 13-day conflict. Rally master of ceremonies Ophelia Haragli called on Australian leaders to 'stand up'. Over 2000 people marched along George Street with banners and flags that showed their support for Gaza . A young boy held a sign saying 'no one is free when others are oppressed' while his friend took photos of the march on his iPhone. In the background, a toddler in a pushchair was also brought to the march . Pro-Palestinian protestors painted their faces and wore t-shirts that said 'free Gaza' as they gathered to march the streets of Sydney . 'You don't have to look far, you only have to look at the pictures on the screens, and touch your heart to know that what's going on in Israel is a massacre,' Ms Haragli said. NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge, who addressed the crowd, wants the federal government to use Australia's position on the UN Security Council to push for a ceasefire. Elsewhere in Sydney, deputy federal opposition leader Tanya Plibersek said an end to the conflict was urgently needed, though she did not outline the role Australia might play in reaching any detente. 'Of course the rockets must stop,' Ms Plibersek told reporters on Sunday. 'Hamas must agree to a ceasefire, and I also urge Israel to ensure that any response to that rocket fire is proportionate and spares the lives of civilians.' Pro-Palestinian protestors called for 'freedom for Palestine' and held signs saying 'pray for Gaza' and 'occupation is a crime' as they chanted in the city centre .

"By . Australian Associated Press . and Sarah Dean . Professor David Cooper carried out the ground-breaking research at Sydney's St Vincent's Hospital . Two men who were HIV-positive appear to be virus-free after bone marrow transplants, marking the first successful cases of HIV being cleared in Australia. Both men now register undetectable levels of the virus after treatment in Sydney, according to the University of NSW's Kirby Institute director, Professor David Cooper. In a significant breakthrough for researchers, one of the patients cleared the virus without donor marrow containing a rare gene mutation that protects against HIV. The human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, became undetectable in both patients about three years after their transplants, Prof Cooper said. The men, who were treated at Sydney's St Vincent's Hospital, in partnership with the Kirby Institute, remain on antiretroviral therapy. 'We're so pleased that both patients are doing reasonably well years after the treatment for their cancers and remain free of both the original cancer and the HIV virus,' he said. The work was presented on Saturday at the Towards an HIV Cure Symposium, which is part of the 20th International AIDS Conference in Melbourne, which opens on Sunday. The patients' success echoes that of American man Timothy Ray Brown, the famous Berlin patient, who has shown no signs of virus resurgence since he received a bone marrow transplant from a donor with a rare gene mutation conferring resistance to HIV. The 20th International AIDS Conference is set to begin in Melbourne on Sunday . This rare gene mutation, called CCR5 delta32, makes stem cells naturally resistant to the virus. It is found in less than one per cent of Caucasians, mostly northern Europeans. In Boston, two other patients underwent similar bone marrow transplants in 2012 but the transplanted cells did not contain the rare gene mutation. In both cases, the virus returned after antiretroviral treatment was stopped. The first Sydney patient underwent a bone marrow transplant in 2010 for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. His donor had the mutation. However, the second man who underwent a procedure in 2011 for acute myeloid leukaemia was matched with a donor that did not have it. Both men no longer showed any trace of the virus after a series of tests, Prof Cooper said. 'This is another example of where the transplant can drive the amount of virus to levels that we simply cannot detect,' he said. Timothy Ray Brown, known as the 'Berlin Patient', is currently the only person to have been cured of AIDS . 'But if we stopped the antiretroviral therapy, there would be a very strong chance that it would come back. 'We're trying to understand this strong anti-HIV effect and understand where the virus might be hiding.' The Sydney cases could lead to new approaches to treating, and ultimately eradicating HIV, he said. 'Cure research is looking for a way to move forward and my view is that this is a very important clue, that an immune response produced by bone marrow transplantation has such a strong anti-HIV effect,' Prof Cooper said. 'We're going to use this as a model for cure research and see if we can develop some therapies that mimic what were doing with bone marrow transplantation.' The stem cell transplant procedure, however, is not a practical strategy for the majority of HIV patients, and the risk of mortality is up to 10 per cent, Prof Cooper says. 'For someone with HIV, you certainly would not transplant them when they've got an almost normal lifespan with antiretroviral therapy.' The men, who were treated at Sydney's St Vincent's Hospital, in partnership with the Kirby Institute, remain on antiretroviral therapy . Between two and five HIV positive patients required bone marrow transplants for cancer each year in Australia, he said. 'It is very difficult to find a match for bone marrow donors.' And when a donor and recipient match was found, the chances of then having the one per cent of donors who had the protective gene was going to be very small, he said. Prof Cooper said there was a movement in the HIV cure community to try to identify these donors with the mutation and ask them to volunteer for bone marrow transplants for HIV-positive people. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Two HIV-positive men were treated at Sydney's St Vincent Hospital .

"By . Sarah Dean . Wife killer Gerard Baden-Clay's former mistress,Toni McHugh, has revealed how terrified she now is of the man she thought she was going to marry and once loved 'unconditionally'. Ms McHugh was having an affair with real estate agent Baden-Clay when he killed his wife Allison on 19th April 2012. She appeared on Channel Nine's 60 Minutes on Sunday night to make it clear that Baden-Clay didn’t kill his wife Allison for her. ‘I loved him already he didn’t need to, he already had me – he killed for himself,’ she said. In an emotional interview with 60 Minutes reporter Tara Brown, Ms McHugh broke down as she explained: ‘I want this man to never, ever, ever enter my life ever again.’ Scroll down for video . Gerard Baden-Clay's mistress, Toni McHugh, has revealed how terrified she is of the man she once loved 'unconditionally' Ms McHugh broke down as she spoke about her relationship with the wife killer. She said the pair had planned to get married once he left his wife Allison . She added that she is ‘genuinely fearful’ that she was involved with a man who was not who he said he was. ‘That worries me and that terrifies me,’ she said. Ms McHugh appeared on the Channel Nine documentary, which detailed the tragic murder of mother-of-three Allison, to tell her side of the story after she was a key prosecution witness at Baden-Clay’s trial. 'I believed I was in a loving, caring relationship that did have a future,' she told the show. 'He had told me that he would marry me one day.' Gerard Baden-Clay took his wife Allison's body and dumped it at a nearby creek after murdering her . Ms McHugh appeared on the Channel Nine documentary, which detailed the tragic murder of mother-of-three Allison, to tell her side of the story after she was a key prosecution witness at Baden-Clay's trial . Ms McHugh said she loved the convicted murderer 'very much' and wanted to be Mrs Baden-Clay. Allison Baden-Clay was the mother of three young daughters . 'I don't like to use that word ""unconditional"" anymore but I did love him unconditionally. 'And I was very forgiving, too forgiving.' The three-and-a-half year affair between Baden-Clay, 43, and Ms McHugh commenced in August 2008. When asked if she thought the real estate agent killed his wife, Ms McHugh said: ‘I don’t think he’s innocent’. Ms McHugh said she was devastated when she first heard Alison was missing. 'I never ever wanted harm to her… I didn’t intentionally go out to hurt Allison or her family. I honestly believed it [their affair] was going to be handled properly,' she said. The 60 Minutes programme also gave an insight into the incredible police investigation that helped secure Baden-Clay’s conviction. Detective Superintendent Mark Ainsworth, who led the investigation, said Baden-Clay is ‘a guy I wouldn’t trust to take my dog for a walk’. The morning after he killed his wife and dumped her body by Kholo Creek, about 13k from their Brisbane home, a calm Baden-Clay called 000 at 7.15am to report his wife as missing. 'My wife isn’t home, um and um, I don’t know where she is,’ he said on the phone. Allison's friends said they immediately suspected him of harming her when they heard she was missing, and claimed they never liked him. He told police that the two scratches on his face were from shaving and that the scratches on his body came from a caterpillar, while the cut on his hand came from changing a light-bulb. The program obtained 'chilling' footage of Baden-Clay laughing and saying 'everything is going to be alright', to the person behind the camera . The 60 Minutes programme gave an insight into the incredible police investigation that helped secure Baden-Clay's conviction . Baden-Clay attended corporate functions and night time events connected with his real estate business in the company of mistress Ms McHugh (left) rather than his wife Allison . Sergeant Andrew Jackson was called over to the house after Baden-Clay reported Allison missing. He told 60 Minutes: ‘I knew that they weren’t shaving scratches… they were definitely fingernail scratches.’ He added: ‘It looked like someone had cleaned the house before we arrived.’ The police were immediately suspicious of Baden-Clay and the way he was behaving, so called in 80 officers to search the local area. Acting inspector Ewan Taylor was in charge of forensics and found no blood on Baden-Clay's razor to back up his claim that he'd scratched himself shaving - but they did find blood in Allison’s car. As police hunted for Allison for 11 days, Baden-Clay continued to call his mistress Ms McHugh. Allison’s badly decomposed body was eventually found by a canoeist. Allison's best friends Helen Wilson and Nicole Morrison described how they never liked Baden-Clay and immediately suspected he had harmed Allison when they found out she was missing . Helen Wilson (left) and Nicole Morrison (right) spoke fondly about their best friend Allison and said that she would never consider leaving Baden-Clay as she still loved him despite his affairs . A female witness who did not appear before the court claims Gerard called her looking for someone to kill his wife . ‘Baden-Clay lived a life of deception and it was all about Gerard,’ Detective Superintendent Ainsworth said. He added that Allison appeared to have fought for her life as he most likely smothered her. ‘You’ve only got to look at the scratches on the side of his face,’ he said. Police found leaves knotted in her hair, and all six types of leaves were from the Baden-Clay back yard - not the creek where she was found. Police believe he dragged her body across their patio before lifting her into the car. During the 60 Minutes show, Allison's heartbroken best friends Helen Wilson and Nicole Morrison said Allison 'lived to be a mother, she adored her girls.’ Allison's mother said her family had been sentenced to a lifetime of grief . Allison's body was found dumped near a creek in Brisbane's west on April 30, 2012 . Ms Morrison added: 'She had the best laugh, when I stop to think about her I can still hear her laugh.’ They said Baden-Clay was very emotionally cruel and once told her he didn’t love her. They said he picked at the dinners she made and how she cleaned the house. But despite this, they explained Allison never considered leaving him and always wanted to fix it and make it better. Allison's diaries were used as evidence in the trial and they detailed how she continued to love her husband despite his cruelty. During the murder trial, the court heard evidence that Baden-Clay attended corporate functions and night time events connected with his real estate business in the company of mistress Ms McHugh rather than his wife Allison. The 60 Minutes piece included testimony from a witness the jury never heard from, who claimed Baden-Clay called her and asked 'I'm looking for someone to kill my wife.' The program also obtained 'chilling' footage of Baden-Clay laughing and saying 'everything is going to be alright', to the person behind the camera. Justice John Byrne said Baden-Clay had shamelessly pretended to search for his wife, and had used a razor blade to disguise what were really the marks of Allison's finger nails on his face . In court, Justice John Byrne said Baden-Clay had shamelessly pretended to search for his wife, and had used a razor blade to disguise what were really the marks of Allison's finger nails on his face. He said Baden-Clay took his wife's body and dumped it at a nearby creek, and then put in place, and persisted in, a deception plan. Baden-Clay had also invented the idea of a drug overdose as a ruse about what had really happened to Allison, and he'd shown a profound absence of remorse for his crime, Justice Byrne said. He'd gone on to besmirch Allison's memory during the trial. 'You have no criminal history but you are definitely not of good character,' Justice Byrne told Baden-Clay. You took a devoted loving mother from her three girls, blighting their lives. We finally have justice for Allison. The evidence presented at this trial has proven that Gerard Baden-Clay is responsible for the murder of his wife Allison. It has been a long wait over the last two years. And this result today marks the beginning of our long journey towards healing and finally allowing us to mourn and grieve this beautiful woman. Today is not a win for our family, for it will not bring our beautiful Allison back. However it is the closure in another chapter of our journey for this family. We have lost Allison and nothing that has happened here today will bring her back. We as a family will grieve her tragic death forever. Her memory is tarnished by the fact that she was taken from us in such horrific circumstances. We would like to sincerely thank the Queensland Police Service and the officers involved in the investigation, the SES volunteers who searched night and day in all weather, the scientific experts and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions who have all worked tirelessly to ensure that we have justice for Allison. We would also like to thank them for their compassion and support over what has been the darkest of days. We have appreciated your efforts to protect the privacy of Allison's daughters. Our primary concern has always been and remains the physical and emotional wellbeing of Allison's three beautiful girls. We will help them to rebuild their lives and ask for your support, co-operation and privacy in order to do this. We have a long way to go to ensure that they will cope with a future without their mother. Allison was a kind-hearted, generous woman, a loving wife and devoted mother whose legacy will continue if we all remember that life is precious, and to take the time to be kind, smile at those who pass you by and live for today. We, her family and friends, didn't get a chance to say goodbye but Allison will always remain forever in our hearts.

"By . Sarah Dean . Police in Queensland are being given three years to get their fitness up to scratch plus free doctors trips in a bid to combat the rise of overweight officers. Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart has promised to help his staff get into shape so that they can pass the new Fit For Duty tests every two years from 2017. In a bid to battle the bulge amongst the ranks, any officer that is found to be unfit after the fitness test will be sent to see dieticians, sport psychologists and health counsellors – for free. Fit for duty: Every Queensland police officer will have to undergo a new fitness test, seen here, from 2017 . Fighting fit: Shayne Maxwell has already completed the fitness test after trying it out. In the photo on the right he is shown testing the 'Remove the Problem station' which measures officers' ability to carry evidence . 'By paying for them to go to the doctor, it perhaps helps identify issues that they need to take responsibility about themselves,' Commissioner Stewart told the Courier Mail. But the Queensland Police Union says free doctors' trips are not enough – they also want tax deductions on gym memberships and rostered exercise time for their staff. Previously, Queensland officers have only had to pass a fitness test while training at police academy. However, in three-years' time 'everyone from the most junior constable to the Commissioner of Police’, will have to prove their health, Commissioner Stewart said. Fighting the flab: Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart has promised to improve the fitness in his force . Under control: The Control the Problem station simulates a physical take down and subsequent cuffing procedure . The tests will involve all the normal things you would imagine police should already be able to do, including tasks such as climbing over and crawling under fences. Plus, a 200m foot chase and cuffing a 'violent offender'. The Queensland Police Union has raised concerns about 'what processes will be put in place to assist police to get to and maintain the required fitness level'. They want to know whether police will be given rostered time to achieve the fitness goals and if there will be any 'financial incentives for members to pass the test'. In an article in the June Police Journal they explained that they want to know 'what officers may be able to claim as a tax deduction (such as gym membership and sporting equipment), and the specifics of the exemption policy and how it will be handled'. On top of it: Participants bring the takedown dummy to the ground twice on each side of the body, then safely cuff the Cuffman ensuring the handcuffs are double locked. Timing stops once the Cuffman is rolled into the recovery position . Get to the problem: This test station simulates a 200m foot chase. It includes changing direction, jumping a 1.5 metre ditch, negotiating a doorway, climbing and descending stairs, negotiating knee high (50 centimetre) hurdles, clearing a fence, and crawling through a narrow space. Participants complete four laps of the course in a 'figure 8' pattern. On the first two laps, participants climb over a 1.5 metre fence, and on laps three and four crawl through a crawl space . They said these issues have not been addressed yet so no policy has been implemented. The article goes on to explain how Victoria was the first state to bring in a fitness test. 'Their test includes a beep test, push ups, a swim, and a speed and agility test... and a lot of people were failing it,' they wrote. Queensland Police will introduce a test that is specific to their duties. 'We obviously don’t expect our police to chase people for kilometre after kilometre; I suppose having that level of endurance and fitness is just not reflective of the genuine occupational requirements of the job,' the journal said. The challenge: Any officer that is found to be unfit after the fitness test will be sent to see dieticians, sport psychologists and health counsellors - for free . But they highlighted the need for upper body strength and being nimble enough to crawl and climb. The first fitness tests will begin from 31 December 2017. Commissioner Stewart was unavailable for comment when contacted by MailOnline on Monday. The proposed 'deployment readiness test' is completed in three distinct stations: . Anyone with police powers will have to pass the test.","Commissioner Ian Stewart is introducing Fit For Duty tests from 2017 .

"By . Sarah Dean . A 26-year-old self-taught photographer, who dropped out of university to pursue his passion, has captured his hometown of Melbourne on camera as it’s never been seen before. Tom Blachford took around 1,200 shots of the Victorian city in 70 minutes after his girlfriend bought him a ride on a doorless helicopter for his birthday last year. And the finished result of around 100 aerial photos depicting Melbourne’s beaches, coast, ports, docklands, freeways and homes is stunning. Summertime: Tom Blachford took this photo of Brighton beach, Melbourne, from 500ft above the water in February . Mr Blachford took off over the city at around 11am on February 18 2014. It was the first time he had shot from such heights – about 500ft above water and 1000ft above land. 'I'd never done it before. My girlfriend bought me the helicopter with the door off for my birthday. It was scary as we only had a car seat belt to hold us in,’ Mr Blachford told MailOnline. The couple had 'planned it for over a year to get the perfect day'. Docklands: An aerial shot of Coode Island at the convergence of the Yarra and Maribyrnong Rivers, 4 km west of central Melbourne . Sweltering: Two paddle surfers enjoy the cool water in Melbourne as temperatures reached 46 degrees . Aerial industry: The 26-year-old captured the rows and rows of parked cars in the city . Homes: Mr Blachford shot these houses at The Cove, Beacon Cove, in Port Melbourne, 5 km south-west from Melbourne's CBD . Mr Blachford said he wanted it to be 'hot enough for people to be at the beach'. And it certainly was, with temperatures reaching a sweltering 46 degrees that day. Thankfully the helicopter with its door off meant they got a cool breeze while shooting. 'She bought me an hour with a pilot who was a friend of ours, we had to wait for a time that suited him too,' Mr Blachford added. Cooling off: Surfers paddled in the turquoise sea as Mr Blachford flew 500ft above with his girlfriend and pilot friend . Perspective: The site of Swanson and Appleton Docks and their container storage yards is beautiful from above. Tiny: The four colourful planes at Moorabin airport from 500ft look like toy planes on the patchy grass . Lone boat: Mr Blachford said he wanted it to be 'hot enough for people to be at the beach' Special day: Mr Blachford took around 1200 shots of the Victorian city in 70 minutes after his girlfriend bought him a ride on a doorless helicopter for his birthday last year . The photographer has lived in Melbourne all his life, apart from a nine-month stint in London in 2009, and said what shocked him the most about his photos of the city was the 'perspective'. 'I've never seen anything like it,' he said. When the couple and their pilot friend took off above Melbourne, Mr Blachford had intended to focus on capturing the dockland's containers, however they took off near the beach and instead he got ‘really obsessed’ with the coast line and snapping the surfers. Different look: The Melbourne Arts Centre spire on approach to Southbank from the sky . Idyllic: St Kilda Marina looks peaceful from above as the sailing boats float on the dark glistening water . Ready for take off: The light aircraft lined-up on the runway look fragile from above . Ocean fun: A lone paddle surfer glides along the spotless sea in a wetsuit . 'The frame was about 20 metres so I could hone in on what people were doing,' he said. 'I saw how so much goes on in summertime in Melbourne… people were swimming, running, paddle surfing.' 'I would have liked the beach to be a little more packed,' he added. Mr Blachford, who has been a professional photographer for six years, hopes to get back up in the air over Melbourne to take more photos in the hope of creating a book packed with his images. Despite one hour's ride in the doorless helicopter costing around $600 an hour he said it's 'worth it'.","Tom Blachford took the photos on February 18 after waiting for 'the perfect day' to capture his hometown .

"By . Sarah Dean . A disturbing video of a man being dragged through a David Jones store in Sydney begging for someone to 'help' him has shocked and disgusted a top lawyer who witnessed the incident. Chris Murphy told Daily Mail Australia the 'excessive and frightening force used on a fragile person and skinny looking guy' being man-handled by two security guards gave him visions of a 'concentration camp'. Mr Murphy filmed the worrying shoplifting incident at the David Jones store in Bondi Junction, in Sydney's east, on Saturday at around 2pm. 'It was screamingly sad  - and I do this for a living,' he said. Scroll down for video . Shocked: Chris Murphy spotted the man cornered by David Jones staff and began filming . 'He's a vulnerable and powerless person under the brute force of corporate Australia. Those heavy grasps at the wrists - it was like a violent bully dragging him,' he added. Mr Murphy posted the footage of a distressed man being pulled by his arms and wrists through the store on YouTube and Twitter and comments from concerned members of the public soon poured in. In the 3.28 minute long clip, a man in skinny jeans, thongs, a t-shirt, long hair and a cap is seen cornered by a plain clothed security officer in a grey hoody and another David Jones staff member in a black suit. 'Tell him to let go of me. You're hurting me mate, let go of me,' the man who was suspected of shoplifting said. Dragged: The man was pulled back into the Bondi Junction store as he shouted that they were 'hurting' him . Shocked: Chris Murphy (left) filmed the footage in the David Jones store (right) in Bondi Junction, in Sydney's east, on Saturday afternoon at around 2pm . The man in the grey hoody replied: 'I'm not putting any pressure on you.' 'I didn’t take anything,' the victim said and the security officer replied 'you've stolen, did you not?' as he moved close. This causes the shopper to shout 'don’t touch me'. The two David Jones staff members try to speak quietly to the man but he continues to shout loudly, perhaps so the camera being held by Mr Murphy can hear him. 'Don’t touch me, he is gripping my wrists, you are gripping my wrists mate, you are gripping my wrists,' he yelled. The two men then begin to drag the man through the store past the cosmetic counters. They both have a grip on his arms and he tries to sit down by the entrance to stop them pulling him along. They then slide him along the floor as he shouts: 'Let go of me you're hurting me.' The man in grey hoody says 'you can walk with me or I’ll drag you along', to which the man being dragged shouts 'f**k off'. Resisting: The confused man sat on the floor as they dragged him along past the cosmetics counters . Next they pick him up from under his arms and he turns to desperately look at the camera. 'Somebody help me this guy is hurting me,' he pleads. The struggle continues past shocked shoppers as he says 'my bag is back there'. 'Get off me,' he cries as his hat falls off and the pair take him onto the escalator downstairs. 'Leave me alone, somebody help me, mate my bags are back there,' he says. The man in a grey hoody says: 'Yeah we got it don’t worry. Well talk to you then let you go'. The man's arm is seen twisted behind his back as he yells 'where are you taking me' and 'you're hurting my wrists'. The security guards explains 'you are not co-operating with me are you not?… you stole you come with me and that's it.' As they get downstairs and walk through a café the man shouts 'where's my mum? You're hurting me.' A security man then comes along and warns Mr Murphy that he is not allowed to film in the store. To which Mr Murphy replies: 'Watch it on YouTube later.' 'Don't touch me': The man yelled 'he is gripping my wrists, you are gripping my wrists mate' 'Get off me': He cries out as his hat falls off and the pair take him onto the escalator downstairs . The man is taken into a 'staff only' area and three more dark suited security guards follow him in as the doors swing close, one is carrying the man's two shopping bags from Woolworths. The man is last heard shouting 'get away from me' as he is taken out of shot. Another woman comes and warns Mr Murphy he's not allowed to film in the store. A NSW police spokesperson said police attended an incident at the store at 2.30pm involving a 39-year-old male. The Bondi local was ‘banned from entering all David Jones stores for 12 months,’ a NSW police spokesperson said. 'He was issued a criminal infringement notice for shoplifting,' they added. 'Consistent with company policy the gentleman in question was identified as a shop lifter and apprehended while police were called,' a David Jones spokeswoman said. 'Police attended the store following which the gentleman was given a Criminal Infringement Notice and fined for shoplifting.' Talking to MailOnline on Sunday, Mr Murphy said he noticed the incident while shopping for a suit. 'As I was walking out of the store at 2pm I saw this emaciated man totally confused. They were dragging him into the store,' he said. 'He called out for his mum, he’s obviously stressed, he’s emaciated, he’s almost in tears and they were man-handling and dragging him inside.' Mr Murphy said he has been a lawyer for 42 years and whatever the man may or may not have done would he would not have been 'going to jail for it'. No questions: The security guard explains 'you are not co-operating with me are you not?… you stole you come with me and that’s it' as he is pulled past shoppers in the store . The man is last heard shouting 'get away from me' as he is taken out of shot into a 'staff only' area. Another woman comes and warns Mr Murphy he's not allowed to film in the store . 'I just had a vision of a concentration camp, this skinny guy being pulled and dragged around. He only had two plastic bags with drinks in them from Woolies,' he explained. The lawyer has offered to represent the man pro-bono after he was so horrified by what he saw. 'We have a lot of fragile and borderline people who shouldn't be mistreated. This was a full abuse of power,' he said. The 'squad of nine people' who eventually ended up on the scene with the man downstairs in David Jones was 'force beyond any concept of what was appropriate' he said. 'It is the middle of winter, it is bloody cold and he’s this guy in a pair of thongs and a narrow shirt,' he said. 'This excessive violence and form of violence would never be inflicted by a court,' he added. Mr Murphy expressed how he has no agenda and doesn’t need work. 'I refuse work,' he said. 'This was a pathetic incident I was ensnared in,' he added. A David Jones spokesperson said: 'Consistent with company policy the gentleman in question was identified as a shop lifter and apprehended while police were called. Police attended the store following which the gentleman was given a Criminal Infringement Notice and fined for shoplifting.' All States have a legal basis to make a citizen's arrest. In NSW it's under Section 100 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002. It reads:A person (other than a police officer) may, without a warrant, arrest a person if: . A person who arrests another person under this section must, as soon as is reasonably practicable, take the person, and any property found on the person, before an authorised officer to be dealt with according to law. You can use only 'reasonable force' to detain them – force that is 'reasonable' to the situation. And you can't detain someone too violently as you have a 'duty of care' to the person you detain.","Lawyer Chris Murphy witnessed the incident on Saturday at David Jones in Bondi Junction, in Sydney's east .

"By . Sarah Dean . He's photographed Prime Ministers and global A-listers but Australia's premier celebrity photographer has revealed how it was TV presenter Rachael Finch who blew him away with her 'fearlessness'. The 26-year-old posed on a huge rearing Australian stock horse for her iconic Channel 7 photoshoot in 2010 photographed by Peter Brew-Bevan, despite only having been on a horse once in her life. Brew-Bevan, who has worked with Australia’s most famous including Keith Urban, Naomi Watts, Cate Blanchett and Julia Gillard, said his day on set with the former Miss Universe Australia did not go as he expected. Fearless: Rachael Finch on a huge rearing Australian stock horse for her iconic Channel 7 photoshoot in 2010 . 'I expected it not to work. The client gave me a brief with an obscure reference to a 1960s shoot and I thought ""oh my god"". 'But we were told through research that Rachael had ridden horses before and so I thought she was comfortable on them,' Brew-Bevan told MailOnline. It wasn’t until the star turned up on set that Brew-Bevan realised he would be making her do a dangerous stunt on a horse when she’d only ridden once before. Star quality: Peter Brew-Bevan said the most natural talent in front of the camera he has discovered so far is actress Jessica Marais . 'Amazing': Brew-Bevan sung the praises of Jessica Marais and said she has the 'X Factor' The horse in question was intimidating in stature but highly-trained. Ammo, who died last year, was one of Australia’s most famous stunt horses and so the photographer and Finch quickly committed to making it work. Ammo’s trainer Steve Jefferys, who famously galloped into the stadium at the Sydney Olympics Opening Ceremony on Ammo, gave Finch a 45 minute training session on the horse. Next they had to get Ammo comfortable with the elaborate black ball gown Finch was wearing on the promotional shoot for her role as a Channel 7 reporter at the Spring Racing Carnival. Smouldering: Rachel Griffiths poses on a sofa for WHO magazine . Striking: Peter Brew-Bevan captured Kate Richie's blue eyes in this poolside photo . Tricky location: Keith Urban was shot in Kununurra, a town in far northern Western Australia. 'I had to fly three planes in from Sydney and Perth for a four hour shoot,' Brew-Bevan said . 'Steve spent an hour rubbing the tulle skirt on the horse’s back so he would get used to the sensation and then we did a few test shots,' Brew-Bevan explained . And then, astonishingly, he was able to capture the perfect shot as Ammo reared up with Finch gracefully on his back and looking straight at the camera. 'Within one go she did it. She was phenomenal, I never saw anyone be so fearless and this is not a small horse either,' Brew-Bevan said. Favourite: 'Julia Gillard is great. I had the fortune of shooting her several times through her career and she's just the most down to earth with a wicked sense of humour and insanely intelligent,' Brew-Bevan said . Pop star: X Factor Australia 2013 winner Dami Im captured on camera . Beautiful: Miranda Otto up close and personal for Brew-Bevan . His memorable encounter with Finch is just one of many special moments with Australia's rich and famous over the past 18 years. But the 45-year-old never intended to become a celebrity portrait photographer, he studied fine art and was originally a landscape painter. 'I discovered photography in my second year of uni. I got into fashion shoots but didn’t really get the craft of it I suppose. And then I started doing portraits for magazines of chefs and everyday people,' he said. The man with the camera: The 45-year-old never intended to become a celebrity portrait photographer, he studied fine art and was originally a landscape painter . Sultry: Jessica Gomes in a stunning photo for Women's Weekly shot by Brew-Bevan . In the spotlight: Eurovision champion Jessica Mauboy is one of Brew-Bevan's recent stars . Solemn: Singer Paul Kelly appears glum in this portrait photo . It was around 1994 with the rise of celebrities being used in women’s magazines that he began to be asked to take portraits of stars. Describing what he loves about his work he said it is not the chance to meet the famous people necessarily but 'the challenge of trying to create something or bringing a certain aspect of that person out on film that hasn’t been seen before.' 'The bigger the celeb the harder it is to capture something new. I recently shot Cate Blanchett, this woman has been shot thousands of times so it’s challenging to get something new.' Since he began snapping, Brew-Bevan has photographed Prime Minister Tony Abbott, radio Queen Jackie O, TV’s Samantha Armytage, Rachel Griffiths, Teresa Palmer, Bob Hawke, Jessica Marais, Miranda Otto and many more. Intimate: Michael Dorman appears deep in thought in this lounge room photo . Street artist: X Factor star Jonny Ruffo was photographed in an alley. Brew-Bevan says the doors have opened to him over the years and he now approaches people he wants to work with . Red room: Missy Higgins cuts a stylish figure in this photo . Ruffled: Teresa Palmer poses in a white t-shirt. Brew-Bevan got into photographing celebs in 1994 . But despite the hundreds of thousands of photos he has taken there are some images that remain firmly lodged in his mind, particularly that of actress Naomi Watts who he shot in Melbourne in 2003. The National Portrait Gallery called the Victorian style painting portrait their very own 'Mona Lisa'. 'I captured not only her innate beauty but her fragility. My first thought upon seeing Naomi was... you look like a little child. She is very petite - almost childlike,' Brew-Bevan previously said of the star. Cover guy: Ricky Martin was photographed in his signature leather jacket . Smart: Author and model Tara Moss tips her hat for the camera . Natural: The Weaving Sisters in a beatiful floral scene . He also can't forget the photo he took of actress Rose Byrne in his Balmain house 'before hair and make-up artists existed' in 1998. 'I would go in and pick the clothing,' he explained. For Brew-Bevan, the bigger the star the easier they are to work with. 'All the A-listers I work with are a breeze because we're all there with the common cause. We all know it’s our jobs they know it's there jobs to give something,' he said. He spends time getting to know his subject before photographing them and often forms friendships with the stars that he repeatedly captures. 'It takes a couple of shoots to get that sort of connection,’ he said. Legend: Swimming champion Ian Thorpe looks relaxed and at home in this beach shot . Suave: Actor Harrison Gilbertson cuts a sharp figure in this photo . Teen favourite: Actor Xavier Samuel struck an array of expressions in his stylish shoot . From his experience, Brew-Bevan has learned that some people either have that ‘star quality’ or they don’t.  He said the most natural talent in front of the camera he has discovered so far is actress Jessica Marais. 'Jess was amazing. I found over the years there’s that X Factor that people just have. I don’t know what it is, it’s an energy that they bring and that’s an energy I have to tap into ,’ he explained. Of all of his logistical nightmares over the years, there is one shoot that stands out as the most difficult and it involves musician Keith Urban in Kununurra, a town in far northern Western Australia. 'It was a cover shoot for a magazine to celebrate a 10 year birthday and he was very agreed to do it but he was in middle of touring the States. Cheerful: Hamish and Andy in a comical pose for Brew-Bevan . On the couch: David Whenem shot for Women's Weekly magazine . 'He was flying in and Nicole Kidman was filming the movie Australia up there.  So we got the OK to do it but the deal was had to shoot it in Kununurra. 'Getting my crew and equipment to the location meant I had to fly three planes in from Sydney and Perth for a four hour shoot. 'It took five days to get there and back. That was the most extreme and I’ve shot all around the world it. But it was worth it, he is a legend, a great cool guy.' Moving: This photo of Damien Tomlinson was taken in Bondi, Sydney, but Brew-Bevan chose the spot to look like Afghanistan. 'He was an SAS solider who lost his legs in a landmine he drove over... he is one of the most positive amazing men you will ever meet, he is an absolute hero' Smoking: Bob Hawke with a cigar. Brew-Bevan spends time getting to know his subject before photographing them . Contemplative: Barry Otto is captured in this striking black and white image by Brew-Bevan .

"By . Louise Cheer . Hundreds of whale watchers gathered at Sydney's northern beaches to catch a glimpse of a southern right whale who is thought to be pregnant. Just 50 metres off the shore of Warriewood Beach, the 16-metre mammal treated spectators to a rare, upclose look as it swam up and down the southern end of the coastline as well as lifting its barnacle-covered head to taste the sea breeze. But hopes of a marine birth off Sydney's shoreline might be premature - experts have not confirmed the southern right is a female and won't know until a calf is spotted. Scroll down for video . The Southern Right whale was spotted just off Warriewood Beach on Thursday at 7am . Experts believe the whale is pregnant but cannot confirm this until it gives birth, which could be Friday . However the mammal's behaviour has got watchers excited as he or she displays typical actions of an expectant mother. 'She's vocalising a lot, we can hear her trumpeting sound from the shore. There's also a lot of tail-lifting,' said Ronny Ling, President of the Marine Mammal Rescue and Research organisation. Organisation for the Rescue and Research of Cetaceans in Australia's (ORRCA) Shona Lorigan added: 'If she is to go into labour, I expect it to happen overnight and in more sheltered waters.' 'It is the season for whales to be birthing, and we had a similar situation on Monday with a mother and calf discovered off the Central Coast.' But people were warned to stay away for their own safety after some morning surfers got a bit too close. It is advised people should stay at least 100 metres from the whale, and if she does have a calf then at least 300 metres is best. After morning surfers got a little too close to it, whale experts have warned people to keep their distance . The 16-metre mammal attracted hundreds of locals and whale watchers throughout the day . 'It's exciting, it's beautiful but they can be unpredictable,' NSW National Parks' Natasha Funke told Nine News. 'They are wild animals, they're very big and we don't want anyone getting hurt.' The whale was spotted at 7am on Thursday and excited spectators throughout the day with its frequent calls and frisky tail activity. Whales usually birth in calm bays, and southern right whales in particular are known for coming in close to the shoreline. There are only about 5,000 southern rights left in the southern hemisphere.","The 16-metre long whale was spotted early on Thursday about 7am .

"By . Louise Cheer . Attorney-General George Brandis has called on Muslim leaders to save their young boys from turning into Islamic radicals. Almost 60 Australians are currently in the Middle East fighting for extremists. Most of them are fighting for Jabhat al-Nusra or Islamic State - breakaway groups of Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda. Mr Brandis' call comes just weeks after Sydney teenager Abdullah Elmir went missing from his Bankstown home - in the city's west - believed to be travelling to Iraq to link up with an Islamic terror group to fight in the troubled war zone. Scroll down for video . Convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf is one of 60 Australians fighting overseas for Islamic extremists . It is thought the 17-year-old was brainwashed by jihadist recruitment videos posted online. Speaking to media on Thursday, Attorney-General George Brandis said engagement with the Islamic community was an important strategy 'to keep Australia free from terrorism'. Attorney-General George Brandis says young men, like Abdullah Elmir (pictured), are the majority who make up Australians fighting in the Middle East . 'The imams who are faith leaders, who are influential and respected opinion members in their communities, are integral to our goal to saving young men - it is almost always young men - in their communities from being radicalised,' he said. It came directly after Director General of Security David Irvine said a majority of the 60 Australians they were aware of fighting with Islamic radicals were siding against the government with Al-Qaeda off-shoots. 'We have some tens of people that have already returned [from the Middle East], we have probably another 150 we're looking at here in Australia who have inclinations to support those two extremist movements,' he said. When asked if the ones who had returned to Australia were being actively monitored, Mr Irvine said 'I'm not saying anything further'. Last month, Abdullah Elmir was the third Australian teenager to walk out on his family bound for Iraq in June. The family said they hold grave concerns for his safety and fear he may 'never be seen again'. They have heard from him once since his disappearance, contacting his mother to say he had arrived in Turkey. Director General of Security David Irvine (left) and Attorney-General George Brandis (right) say the main groups Australians were fighting for were Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra . Another Australian abroad is notorious convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf who has an active social media account, which he uses to urge his other Islamic countrymen to join the fight in the Middle East. On his Twitter account, Sharrouf has sent out a call-to-arms as well as posting disturbing photos, including a picture of a young child brandishing a rifle. Ten Australians have died in Syria and Iraq - the latest a 22-year-old Sydney man named Zakaria Raad who appeared in a recruitment video for Islamic State shortly before being ambushed in Syria.","Most Australians in the Middle East are part of two al-Qaeda off-shoots .

"By . Aap . and Louise Cheer . A painting of a scruffy-looking Sir Les Patterson, with a cheeky grin and a food-stained shirt, has taken out this year's Archibald Packing Room Prize. The portrait, titled Sir Les, is by 2012 Archibald Prize winner Tim Storrier. Dr Sir Leslie Colin Patterson KCB AO is one of comedian Barry Humphries' favourite characters - and his most politically incorrect. Head storeman Steve Peters, who has the final say with 51 per cent of the vote, delivered his verdict on Thursday at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Never has the Packing Room Prize coincided with the Archibald judges' decision. 'Kiss of death! That's me,' Peters told AAP. 'But I hope not for Tim's sake. It's one of the great mysteries of the world, I'm dumbfounded why they never win.' Peters said the decision came down to Storrier's Sir Les and Rodney Pople's portrait of Humphries. They will hang side by side in the gallery. In a statement, Sir Les Patterson said he was proud to be in the show. 'Thanks to that clever bastard Tim Storrier and his brushwork, generations of young australian art lovers, in particular the nubile members of the opposite sex in the community, will look up to what I have to offer,' he said. 'And with any luck, like the eyes of the Mona Lisa, it will follow them around the room.' Born in Sydney, Storrier now lives in Bowral with his wife of 24 years, Jane. He started painting from a young age, starting formal art studies under Australian artist Ross Doig at Sydney Church of England Grammar School in his teenage years. The 65-year-old was awarded an Order of Australia AM for his services to art in 1994. He also has a Doctor of Arts with honours from Charles Sturt University in New South Wales and is a trustee of the Art Gallery of NSW. There were almost 900 entries this year and Peters reckons the calibre of art is higher than last year. 'I think it's a better show overall. There's more finalists, and a lot of small ones this year, so the artists took the hint.' Finalists for the 93rd Archibald Prize were also announced on Thursday. Leading contenders include Tim Maguire's portrait of actress Cate Blanchett, Alan Jones' painting of AFL footballer Adam Goodes, Zoe Young's portrait of snowboarder Torah Bright and Fiona Lowry's portrait of architect Penelope Seidler. This year is a particularly good one for female artists, with nearly half of the 54 paintings hung in the exhibition by women. The winner will be announced on July 18 with the exhibition of finalists to go on display from July 19 to September 28 at the Art Gallery of NSW.

"By . Aap . and Louise Cheer . A patient felt 'sick in the stomach' when she learnt she had potentially been exposed to HIV during a medical procedure in a Victorian town. Almost 400 people in a Gippsland town - in the state's east - have been asked to undergo precautionary HIV testing after a local healthcare worker was found to have contracted the virus. The Age reported the Victorian health department had written to patients who had been in contact with the worker who was believed to be a dentist. Scroll down for video . Patients in a Gippsland town may have contracted HIV from a dentist who has the disease at an eastern Victoria hospital . A patient at the hospital, identified only as 'Liz', said the letter asked her to get a blood test for the disease. '(I felt) pretty sick actually, very sick in the stomach,' she told Fairfax radio on Tuesday. 'You wake up in the morning and then go to bed at night thinking you might be infected.' Liz said her test results were not back yet. 'I don't know where I (may have) got it because it's all very secret at the moment,' she said. Health Minister David Davis said the tests were precautionary, as the possibility of contracting HIV was very low. 'As I understand it the latest numbers are, of the 399, contact has been made with 248, 88 have had tests and all of those tests have been negative,' Mr Davis told reporters. Health Minister David Davis (left) said 399 people had been contacted by the department, while chief health officer Rosemary Lester (right) said the dentist was fully co-operating with them . Mr Davis would not say which town was involved, saying only it was in the state's east. 'What I can say is a health professional was detected with HIV, they have ceased practising,' Mr Davis said. 'I can indicate that in this town there are 399 people who are (involved) in a careful look-back process by the chief health officer. 'They have been sent individual letters, phone calls are following.' Victoria's chief health officer Dr Rosemary Lester said the health care worker, who stopped undertaking procedures after being diagnosed, was co-operating fully with the department. 'While the news may be a surprise to the patients we have contacted, I would like to reassure them there is no need for undue concern,' Dr Lester said in a statement. 'A team of specialist public health staff is on hand to provide advice to each of the patients.' The identity of the health care worker involved or any details around which procedure led to potential exposure cannot be revealed for legal reasons. But the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency said no further action would be taken against the healthcare worker. 'The practitioner has advised their national board of their blood borne status,' the agency's website said. 'The board has reviewed this matter and determined that the practitioner has complied and will comply with the CDNA [Communicable Diseases Network Australia] guidance, and therefore poses no risk to the public that needed to be managed.' HIV is a blood-borne virus spread through unsafe sex with an infected person, and less frequently through blood-to-blood incidents such as needle stick injuries. By law, all HIV cases must be reported to the Department of Health. Mr Davis said counselling was being offered to those affected, and the testing is free.","Patients came in contact with a HIV positive worker in a Gippsland town .

"By . Louise Cheer . and Aap . Within hours of the Philippines arrest of an Australian convert to Islam who used the internet to urge people to join 'jihad', a Facebook page calling for his release hit the social media site. Robert Edward Cerantonio, 29, who also goes by the name Musa Cerantonio, was detained on Friday in the central Filipino city of Cebu where he is believed to have been hiding from Australian authorities, despite claiming he had arrived in the Middle East just days before. The region's deputy police chief, Superintendent Conrado Capa, said Cerantonio would be deported to Australia. Scroll down for video . A Facebook page calling for Australian jihadist Musa Cerantonio's release has emerged . It has more than 1,500 likes so far since it was created on Friday and contains messages of support . Followers of the Melbourne-born jihadist, who is one of extremist group Islamic State's most prolific members urging people to join them in Iraq and Syria, have used the page to post messages of support for Cerantonio. The Abbott Government earlier this week listed Islamic State as a terrorist organisation when it pushed through amendments to the criminal code. Created on the same day as the jihadist's arrest, the Release Brother Musa Cerantonio page has attracted more than 1,500 likes and calls for Filipino authorities to free 'the man who opened our mind and dig the very root of jihad in the Philippines and All of the Muslim Lands'. One supporter wrote: 'I love him so much, may Allah help and protect him always, he was chosen by Allah...stay strong bro'. 'May he be protected by ALLAH in all matters. He has the knowledge and courage given by ALLAH to tell the truth about ISLAM...,' another wrote on the page. Musa Cerantonio was arrested by local police in the Philippines on Friday, days after he claimed on Twitter he was on the way to the Middle East . Cerantonio was arrested on Friday in Lapu-Lapu City in the Philippines . In a telephone interview on Friday, Supt Capa told AAP that Cerantonio had 'been in Cebu since February... For the most part, he keeps to himself in his rooms, in hotels or apartments'. 'In one broadcast on his website, he called on brother Muslims to join the war in Iraq and Syria.' Supt Capa said Cerantonio was arrested and would be deported because the Australian government cancelled his passport, making him an illegal alien. However, Mr Banas said there is 'no evidence linking him to any terror act'. His arrest comes more than a week after he tweeted on social media he had arrived in the Middle East to join his brothers of the Islamic State - which is also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. 'Al-Hamdulillah I have arrived in the land of Khilafah in Ash-Sham! May Allah honor all Muslims during this blessed time with His obedience,' he posted on Twitter. Two days before that he tweeted: 'Insha'Allah I will be arriving in Ash-Sham very shortly, keep us in your du'a, getting ready to travel.' Al-Hamdulillah means 'Thanks and Praise to God' in Arabic, Insha'Allah translates to 'God-willing', Ash-Sham refers to the Levant and the term du'a is used for the word 'prayers'. The Australian Federal Police have confirmed the arrest of the 29-year-old but will neither confirm nor deny whether they are conducting their own investigation. 'The AFP is aware that Philippine authorities have taken action in relation to Musa Cerantonio, which may result in his return to Australia,' the AFP said in a statement. A federal government spokeswoman said she was aware Cerantonio had been detained but would not comment further. Head bowed, the Islamic State member was found in the southern region of Mindanao - a hotbed for a decades-old Muslim insurgency . Just over a week ago, Cerantonio tweeted he was in the Middle East . He is one of Islamic State's most prolific extremists with more than 6,000 followers on Twitter . The Philippines has a large Muslim minority in the southern region of Mindanao, a hotbed for a decades-old Muslim insurgency and where Islamic militants linked to al-Qaeda also operate. Police said they had been monitoring Cerantonio's activities since February when he arrived in Cebu, the country's largest metropolis outside Manila. 'We cannot say with certainty that he had any contact with local Muslim groups,' Supt Capa said, adding the Australian had been living with a Filipino woman and moving periodically around Cebu until his arrest at a one-room apartment near the airport. The 32-year-old woman -  who bought food and other supplies for Cerantonio - was wanted by police over an unrelated fraud case and was also arrested on Friday, he added. A police intelligence officer involved in the operation said Cerantonio had been in Mindanao, though there was no indication he had tried to recruit Filipinos or been in contact with Islamic militants in the area. 'This person... has a website and he propagates extreme teachings and advocates jihad and calling on Muslim brothers to go to Syria and Iraq to fight together with the ISIS,' the official said, referring to the Islamic State militants who have seized large swathes of territory in eastern Syria and in neighbouring Iraq. Cerantonio is expected to be deported back to Australia . Cerantonio, a Melbourne native, 'is a convert from Christianity', the intelligence officer said. 'Sometimes he mentions the Philippine government (on his website), but does not call for violence' against it, the officer added, adding that the Australian has 'no overt following' in the Philippines. Television footage aired by the ABS-CBN network showed a bearded Caucasian man in a white robe being ushered out of an apartment by officers wearing helmets and flak jackets. A report in The Australian newspaper in June described Cerantonio as a preacher and 'one of (the Islamic State's) most influential propagandists', and that Australian police were planning to move against him. The newspaper said Cerantonio called for the assassination of Western leaders in a Facebook post in December, and that a study had found one in four foreign fighters in Syria followed his Twitter account. Recently, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop commented that the government will do everything it can to ensure Australians don't become radicalised overseas and bring their extremist views back home. Ms Bishop refused to comment specifically about Cerantonio to avoid jeopardising the work of Philippine authorities, but she said reports of Australian citizens getting involved with radicals and fighting overseas were disturbing. 'We are determined to ensure that Australians do not leave this country to take up fighting in another country, become radicalised and then return to Australia with these new skills and extremist outlooks,' she told reporters in Brisbane. 'We are taking every step we can to ensure that Australians are kept safe.'","Cerantonio was born in Melbourne and was arrested on Friday .

"By . Louise Cheer . A bottle of red wine is usually associated with a splitting headache the next day, but this time it caused a different kind of headache for a man who attempted to rob a Canberra supermarket. About 6.40pm on Thursday, a man brandishing a bladed weapon made threats to staff at a supermarket in Cook – north-west of Canberra – when a bold customer struck the offender on the back of the head with an unopened bottle of red wine. In CCTV footage, a customer is seen standing by a shop display when they take up a bottle and walk up behind the offender, and comes to the rescue by knocking him with the makeshift weapon. Scroll down for video . CCTV captured the moment when a brave customer helped stop a robbery by hitting the thief with a bottle of red wine on Thursday . The glass bottle shatters and sends red wine all over the offender and on the floor. In shock, the offender is seen stumbling forward before running off without taking any cash or property. Police have described the offender as 174cm tall and wearing a dark-coloured hoodie jacket. But the Cook crime was one of three incidents that happened on Thursday night. The offender was threatening staff with a knife, demanding money at a Cook supermarket in Canberra's north-west . The thief appears to be in shock as he stumbles forward during the incident, which happened about 6.40pm . About 20 minutes after the first incident, a Caucasian man of normal build in his 20s who was between 165cm and 170cm entered another supermarket in Scullin – also in Canberra’s north-west – with a knife and made threats to staff. He fled from the scene when a car pulled up in the parking lot outside. The same knife-wielding offender struck again about 10 minutes later at a business in Higgins – almost 2km from Scullin – again he demanded money and threatened staff. When staff refused to meet the demand, the offender ran off. Police are urging anyone with information about the trio of incidents and have not yet spoken to them to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or report via the website at www.act.crimestoppers.com.au. The offender, who has been described as 174cm by police, turns around to look at his attacker . He then runs away without any money or property - the first of three attempts that night to rob Canberra supermarkets .","The incident happened about 6.40pm on Thursday in Canberra's north-west .

"By . Louise Cheer . Looking more like a stealth aircraft because of its black paint job, Boeing's highly anticipated first Dreamliner 787-9 has been handed over to Air New Zealand at a glitzy ceremony in the United States. New Zealand's national carrier became the first airline to receive the Rolls-Royce powered, fuel-efficient passenger plane when it was unveiled in front of hundreds of aviation enthusiasts at the Future of Flight museum near Seattle on Thursday. In line with the country's all-conquering All Blacks rugby union side, the aircraft was decked out in the dark hue with the iconic silver fern breaking up the uniformity on its tail. Scroll down for video . The new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner delivered to Air New Zealand was the first of its kind . Boeing delivered its first 787-9 to Air New Zealand in front of a crowd of thousands of media and guests . It was painted in New Zealand's signature colour of black with the iconic silver fern on its tail . It took 12 painters five days and about 350 litres of paint to complete the sleek look. Inside the 63m-long plane, the theme continues with its passenger seats covered in black upholstery contrasted with a violet colour for the backs of the chairs and television screens installed in the head rests. When full, the Dreamliner's two economy cabins will fly a total of 263 passengers along with 18 business class ticket holders and 21 in premium economy, with a range of 15,372km. The difference between the 787-9 and its sister Dreamliner model is mostly cosmetic. Its body is more than 6m longer than the 787-8 and will fly up to 40 more passengers an additional 830km using 20 per cent less fuel and 20 per cent lower emissions than similar-sized airplanes. Like the earlier model, it will also continue to offer passengers features such as large windows, roomy stow bins, modern LED lighting, higher humidity, a lower cabin altitude, cleaner air and a smoother ride. The plane is 63m-long with a wingspan of 60m, with a cruise speed of more than 900km and range of 15,000km . It was unveiled at the Future of Flight museum near Seattle in Washington in the United States . The new aircraft boasts a capacity of 302 passengers, with 18 business class and 21 premium economy seats .

The Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner will makes its maiden flight in October, flying from Auckland to Perth - one of three international routes including Auckland to Tokyo and Auckland to Shanghai. Air New Zealand CEO Christopher Luxon said the delivery of the 787-9 was the start of an exciting new era for the airline. 'It's a privilege to be the global launch customer for this aircraft and our team is looking forward to flying it home to New Zealand,' he said.

"By . Louise Cheer . Women should be feminine, greet their husbands with a smile at the door after work and ask them what they want for dinner, a social commentator has claimed - sparking a bemused reaction from two female Today show hosts. US author Susan Patton - also known as The Princeton Mom - dished out her tips for a happy marriage to women across Australia on Thursday, also prompting an angry response on social media. 'Men have been so trained… in ways to be sensitive to women's needs,' she told Today hosts Karl Stefanovic, Alicia Loxley and Sylvia Jeffreys. Scroll down for video . Today's female co-hosts could not believe what they were hearing when Susan Patton (pictured) was a guest on the show . 'There doesn’t seem to be anybody suggesting that men have any needs in this.' 'I’m just suggesting that it’s wise for the marriage that – for the sake of the family – for women to be sensitive to their husbands as well.' 'There’s nothing wrong with a woman saying to husband: ""Honey, would you like a drink, what would you like for dinner, what can I do for you now?""' The comments sparked hilarious reactions from Loxley and Jeffreys - who is dating co-host Karl's brother Peter - who both grimaced and shook their heads. 'I feel like you’re suggesting that we should be waiting on them,' Loxley said after Patton added that women should 'be nice' to their husbands and 'greet them with a smile' at the door when they come home from work. Sylvia Jeffreys looked bemused by what Today show guest Susan Patton was saying . Karl Stefanovic cheekily agreed with his guest's advice - not so Alicia Loxley, who said it was 'archaic' Patton says women should conform to traditional gender roles - a view clearly not shared by Jeffreys . 'Most men who are the primary bread winners in their household, I think they’re entitled to respect when they walk in the door, I think they’re entitled to courtesy, appreciation,' Patton continued. 'I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. It’s a very politically incorrect thing to say. That necessarily doesn’t make it incorrect.' Sparkie_Gal was one of the people who hit out at Susan Patton's comments . @scouse_roar agreed with @Sparkie_Gal who tweeted it was 'horribly offensive' But some defended Patton's comments like @FitterChick31 . But Australia's lovable larrikin, Stefanovic, was eating up the preachings of Patton - getting a kick out of his female counterparts' reactions and saying he was a fan of her work. 'I concur with a lot of your research,' he said. 'I think you’re one of the wisest women in the world but convincing young women - or women of any age for that matter - that this is the right way of going is not an easy task because… I can hear them around Australia right now choking on their Weetbixs, throwing things at the TV.' Co-host Alicia Loxley was equally unimpressed by Patton, saying: 'I feel like you're suggesting that we should be waiting on them' But her co-host Stefanovic says he is a fan of Patton and she is 'one of the wisest women in the world' Patton's comments also attracted strong opposition on social media. @Sparkie_Gal tweeted: 'Pardon me but F**K [sic] off. I’m an electrician and extremely proud of it. Nothing feminine or traditional…'. And @scouse_roar agreed: 'What a horribly offensive thing to say.' But like all issues, people were divided. 'I do this everyday for my husband, just showing an interest in his day, its not archaic!!' @FitterChick31 wrote.","US social commentator Susan Patton appeared on the show on Thursday .

The Adelaide father charged with allegedly stabbing his three-year-old son to death has been captured on video being handcuffed by police as paramedics tried to revive the boy nearby. David Janzow is now recovering from surgery in at the Royal Adelaide Hospital after stabbing himself in the neck following the alleged attack on his son Tuesday. Police said there was nothing in the 34-year-old's past that would have pointed towards him being charged with allegedly murdering his son, with no obvious history of domestic violence. Scroll down for video . David Janzow was arrested on Tuesday after allegedly stabbing his three-year-old son to death in Adelaide . On his landscaping business website, Neighbour Labour and New Landscapes, the director and landscape planner is described as 'pretty awesome boss to work for'. The business' website said he completed a Bachelor of Environmental Management at Flinders University in 2001, and later Project Management, Irrigation and Garden Design. 'At 6 foot 6 [he] is a sensational basketballer and was a DJ in a past life,' it said. 'The company's longevity is testament to his talent and hard work.

Police were at an unrelated crash scene on Gorge Road when they were approached by man stating he had injured his son . But Tuesday's events paint a very different story of Janzow. He has been charged with the murder of his son after he went missing from the family home in Stepney, in Adelaide's eastern suburbs, and will face a bedside court hearing today, The Advertiser reported. Janzow, who is the director of Neighbour Labour and New Landscapes, is described as an 'awesome boss' Janzow is recovering from surgery in at the Royal Adelaide Hospital after stabbing himself in the neck following the alleged attack on his son Tuesday. The boy's mother rang police at 8.25am on Tuesday morning saying her husband had taken their son from their Stepney home and she had concerns for their welfare. About 9am, South Australia police were at an unrelated crash scene at the intersection of Hockley Terrace and Gorge Road in Athelstone, in Adelaide's northeast, when they were  approached by a man claiming he had injured his son. Police allegedly then found the boy suffering multiple stab wounds in Janzow's four-wheel-drive ute and he was rushed to the Women's and Children's Hospital. The boy died at the hospital as a result of his injuries. Superintendent Graeme Adcock said the man's black Volkswagen Amarok has been impounded by police. 'We're fairly confident the actual vehicle was the actual crime scene,' he said. A SA police officer called it a 'tragic set of circumstances' while briefing the media earlier on Tuesday . He said it was too early to say whether mental health issues were involved in the tragedy. 'It is an absolute tragedy that a little boy has lost his life in these circumstances,' Superintendent Graeme Adcock said. 'We are in the very early stages of the investigation, so I am limited in what I can say. 'However, I can confirm that an autopsy will be carried out tomorrow to determine the exact cause of death.' The Eastern Adelaide Local Service Area officer-in-charge said the boy's wounds were consistent with being stabbed. Superintendent Adcock said the 36-year-old - who was charged on Tuesday afternoon - remained in hospital and would undergo surgery for serious but non-life-threatening injuries to the neck. 'Police are unable to interview him until 24 hours after surgery,' he said. 'Understandably, the boy's mother is overcome by grief and police have not yet been able to take a statement from her.' Superintendent Adcock added the mother would receive every possible support available from police. 'At this stage of the investigation, there is no indication of any history of domestic violence. However, we will continue to examine that as the investigation progresses,' he said. Police say the boy was attacked at a home in Stepney before being driven 8km away to Althelstone . The boy was taken to the Women's and Children's Hospital in Adelaide . Police have said everyone who was involved in the incident were deeply affected by it. 'It's a tragic set of circumstances and our sympathies go out to the family,' a SA police spokesman said earlier on Tuesday. 'It was also a difficult incident for the police and the ambulance officers.' Police said they did not know the man's final destination and the family was not known to them. Anyone who may have seen the man's black Volkswagen ute heading from Stepney to Athelstone on Tuesday morning is urged to contact police. Earlier on Tuesday, Gorge Road between Ryan Avenue and Coulls Road was closed to traffic due to the incident. A Gorge Road business owner - who did not wish to be identified - said the area had been 'crawling' with police officers all morning. 'No one really knows what happened,' he said. 'It's just been one of those days that happens anywhere in the world and today it's happening in Athelstone.' Eastern Adelaide police and Major Crimes are investigating the incident.

"By . Louise Cheer . Radio station Triple M Melbourne has come under fire for its lack of diversity in its announcers. The station tweeted '@TripleMMelb is back at #1' yesterday with a photo of its presenters after The Hot Breakfast was named most popular in the latest radio ratings. At first, the picture which included Eddie McGuire, Mick Molloy and Luke Darcy seemed harmless - until Melbourne journalist Angela Pippos hit out at the picture, pointing out the lack of females at the station. The tweet was fired off by Triple M Melbourne when its breakfast show was named most popular in ratings . 'A gorgeous gathering but I can't quite put my finger on what's missing. #oestrogen,' she wrote, retweeting the photo. Prominent media commentator and feminist Jane Caro has backed Pippos' comments and said the station wasn't catering for the biggest radio market. 'I am so grateful to Triple M for making it so clear that people like me (aka women) are not catered for on their station and I will therefore certainly never make the mistake of listening to them,' the Gruen Transfer wrote in an email to Daily Mail Australia. 'I would heartily encourage other people like me (aka women who still make 80% of purchases) and advertisers interested in talking to us to take similar action and avoid Triple M (aka Triple Men & no Women).' Pippos' retweet has sparked a strong reaction from the online community. 'Dear Lord. That’s the bro-iest bro-fest I’ve ever seen,' @saskystewart said. @steventalevski echoed her thoughts: 'Lack of diversity is a poor reflection of Melbourne.' Journalist Angela Pippos wasn't the only one to notice, with Sasky Stewart tweeting 'That's the bro-iest bro-fest I've ever seen' Steven Talevski tweeted: 'Lack of diversity is a poor reflection of Melbourne' in relation to the Triple M tweet . The photo starred all white males who are part of the Triple M team, including Collingwood president Eddie McGuire . Triple M Melbourne has since removed the photo from Twitter but it remains on its Facebook page . Since the lack of diversity was pointed out, Triple M Melbourne has removed the tweet but the offending picture still remains on Facebook where it has also taken a beating. 'This photo appears to have a filter on it that turns everyone into a white male,' Jarryd Strafford wrote. Some people have even asked why 'Rosie' - a female presenter at the station - did not appear in the picture. 'Rosie not good enough to get her mug in the pic ed?' Michael Drew wrote. According to the Triple M website, Rosie is on air during the breakfast slot when its three male hosts are on holidays. 'You'll know Rosie's laugh from The Hot Breakfast as she controls the studio that keeps Eddie McGuire, Luke Darcy and Mick Molloy on the air,' it read.

"By . Louise Cheer . The father of Australian tennis player Bernard Tomic will have to pay almost around £250,000 to his son's former hitting partner - Thomas Drouet - after assaulting him. News Corp reported that John Tomic will be ordered to fork out the money in compensation to Drouet next week for the incident which occurred in Spain during the 2013 Madrid Masters. In September last year, the tennis coach was sentenced to eight months jail for the attack. Patched up: Thomas Drouet is pictured shortly after being headbutted by Bernard Tomic's dad, John . Tomic - who is his son's coach - said he acted in self-defence when he head-butted Drouet in the face, breaking his nose. Drouet said he was happy to finally put the incident behind him. 'Today was an important day for me… I’m just glad it’s over, I have really always just wanted it to finish. I feel good you know,' he told News.com.au. Tomic got into a fight with Drouet on Madrid's main street - Paseo de la Castellana - which led to the former Bosnian-born taxi driver being suspended from ATP events. The Bosnian-born coach said he acted in self-defence during the incident in Madrid . Poor form: It has not has been a good year so far for Tomic, who was knocked out in the second round at Wimbledon . It has not been a good year for the Tomic clan with Bernard, 21, being knocked out in the second round of Wimbledon - while Canberra's Nick Kyrgios usurped him as the next big thing in Australian tennis. Bernard went down to sixth seed Tomas Berdych, from the Czech Republic, in the men's single at the Grand Slam last month. Before that he was booed off court by crowds at the Australian Open earlier this year when he retired with a groin injury against world No1 Rafael Nadal in the first round. More recently, Bernard caused controversy in May when he was linked to a Gold Coast party that reportedly supplied cocaine and alcohol to guests - including two underage girls brought to the penthouse by the Australian tennis star.","John Tomic will pay compensation to his son's former hitting partner .

Police found the injured boy in the Stepney father's car and he was taken to the Women's and Children's Hospital. The boy died at the hospital as a result of his injuries. Scroll down for video . South Australia police at the scene of where a four-year-old boy was fatally stabbed in Adelaide . Police were at an unrelated crash scene on Gorge Road when they were approached by man stating he had injured his son . 'It is an absolute tragedy that a little boy has lost his life in these circumstances,' Superintendent Graeme Adcock said. 'We are in the very early stages of the investigation, so I am limited in what I can say. 'However, I can confirm that an autopsy will be carried out tomorrow to determine the exact cause of death.' A SA police officer called it a 'tragic set of circumstances' while briefing the media earlier on Tuesday . The Eastern Adelaide Local Service Area officer-in-charge said the boy's wounds were consistent with being stabbed. Superintendent Adcock said the 36-year-old - who was charged on Tuesday afternoon - remained in hospital and would undergo surgery for serious but non-life-threatening injuries to the neck. 'Police are unable to interview him until 24 hours after surgery,' he said. 'Understandably, the boy's mother is overcome by grief and police have not yet been able to take a statement from her.' Superintendent Adcock added the mother would receive every possible support available from police. 'At this stage of the investigation, there is no indication of any history of domestic violence. However, we will continue to examine that as the investigation progresses,' he said. Only half an hour before the father flagged down the police, the boy's mother had reported her son missing, saying she had grave concerns for his safety. Police have told of the moment they found a three-year-old boy dying from stab wounds in the back of his father's car. Adelaide Advertiser reported the boy was stabbed multiple times by his father, 36, at their home in Stepney - about eight kilometres away - before he was put in a car and driven away. 'It's a tragic set of circumstances and our sympathies go out to the family,' a SA police spokesman said earlier on Tuesday. 'It was also a difficult incident for the police and the ambulance officers.' Police say the boy was attacked at a home in Stepney before being driven 8km away to Althelstone . The boy was taken to the Women's and Children's Hospital in Adelaide . Police said they did not know the man's final destination and the family was not known to them. Anyone who may have seen the man's black Volkswagen ute heading from Stepney to Athelstone on Tuesday morning is urged to contact police. Earlier in the day, Gorge Road between Ryan Avenue and Coulls Road was closed to traffic due to the incident. A Gorge Road business owner - who did not wish to be identified - said the area had been 'crawling' with police officers all morning. 'No one really knows what happened,' he said. 'It's just been one of those days that happens anywhere in the world and today it's happening in Athelstone.' Eastern Adelaide police and Major Crimes are investigating the incident. The three-year-old died of his injuries at the Women's and Children's Hospital in Adelaide .

"By . Louise Cheer . and Aap . The Cronulla Sharks have pulled of one of the greatest comebacks in the club's 47-year history after a hellish week that claimed one of their star players. The embattled club ended their week with a win against the premiers coming from 24-0 with only half an hour on the clock to triumph over the Sydney Roosters 30-28 in the boilover of the season at Sydney's Allianz Stadium on Saturday. It came a week after State of Origin player Todd Carney was sensationally sacked from the club when a photo of him engaged in lewd behaviour in a bathroom at Northies nightclub in Cronulla emerged on social media on June 28. Scroll down for video . The Cronulla Sharks have pulled off one of the greatest comebacks in rugby league at Sydney's Allianz Stadium . Just after half-time, they came from 24 points down to win 30-28 against premiers, the Sydney Roosters . The next day Sharks chief executive officer Steve Noyce announced they had ripped up Carney's $3-million contract with the club. The photo of Todd Carney engaged in a lewd act in the bathroom of a Cronulla nightspot that started a horror week for the club . Closely following Carney's departure was Sharks coach Peter Sharp who resigned two days later. But what makes the win even more miraculous is that it comes nine days after they also beat out the Broncos coming from 22 points down just after half-time to triumph 24-22 in 33 minutes. Two days after the scandal broke, Carney spoke out about the shocking photo, explaining he did not know it was 'out there' and hoped it did not end his football career. 'It’s just disappointing for something that I didn't know was out there, something that’s surfaced like this,' he told Nine News. The disgraced NRL star explained he 'felt sick' when he found out the photo, which he said was just a 'prank', was being shared across the internet. 'To receive the message on Saturday night, it’s just gut-wrenching, it made me feel sick straight away,' he said on the Monday following the photo's appearance. Carney revealed he felt 'betrayed' by his club after he asked for the chance to talk to his teammates and the board, but was sacked before being given the opportunity to explain. As a result of the Carney scandal, the Sharks were also left without coach Peter Sharp . Roosters' Mitchell Pearce (left) and Sonny Bill Williams (right) were shell-shocked after the premiers lost to the Sharks . Despite a tough week, Cronulla fans were proudly flying the team colours . It looked bad for the Sharks at half time, not scoring any points in the first half . After these heavy blows to the club, it seemed unlikely things would look up for the bottom-placed Sharks. During Saturday's game, Sportsbet was paying $101 at half-time for a Cronulla win. But even coachless and without their star player, halfback Jeff Robson was able to pull off some match-winning magic in the last three minutes before full-time, scoring a try, and with a conversion from fullback Michael Gordon they left the Roosters shell-shocked. 'I saw some odds in the paper. What were we - 50 to one or something? It was ridiculous. No one gave us a hope,' stand-in Sharks captain Wade Graham said after the win. 'The funny thing about rugby league players is that most of them have a little bit of attitude and, if you write them off, they like to step up to the mark and say I told you so. 'It was just a super effort from the boys.' The odds were against Cronulla at half-time, with Sportsbet paying $101 for a Sharks win . Sharks' Sosaia Feki scored a try to help his team on the way to their 30-minute claw back . The Sharks played the Roosters without coach Peter Sharp and star player Todd Carney . The Sharks had plenty to celebrate (right) after tries from Sosaia Feki (left) and Jeff Robson . Graham said the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority saga that has plagued the club for a season and a half had steeled the Sharks. 'Over the last 18 months, we've gotten pretty good at putting distractions to the side and just focusing on footy and last week was no different,' he said. 'We got together on Monday, we had our say [about Carney's sacking] and by Tuesday morning it was over. We put it to bed.' ASADA has been investigating the Sharks over the banned use of injections, creams and tablets in issue in 2001 over an 11-week supplements program. Since the investigation, the Sharks have been left desperate to find major sponsors as a result of continual bad press over the drug probe. Cronulla are currently at the bottom of the NRL ladder, with a drug investigation also hanging over their heads .","Sharks came from 24-0 to win over the premiers - the Sydney Roosters .

"By . Louise Cheer . Disturbing images and recruitment messages posted on the social media accounts of two notorious Australian jihadists reveal a horrifying glimpse into Islamic extremist groups fighting in Iraq and Syria. Convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf - a member of breakaway al-Qaeda group Islamic State -  posted a photo of a child brandishing an assault rifle and issued a call-to-arms for other Australian Muslims to join their bloody war in the Middle East. Sharrouf, who left Australia last December to link up with the fundamentalist militia group, tweeted in the early hours of Saturday: 'come and be part of what we have dreamt...for decades'. It was accompanied by a picture of him decked out in army camouflage posing with a gun in front of a white BMW. It comes after it was revealed that Mohamed Elomar, one of almost 60 Australians fighting for extremist groups in the Middle East, took aim at diggers fighting in Iraq, tweeting: 'Look at the end of these Iraqi maliki dogs bunch of girls can't wait to see a Australia soldier cyring [sic] saying bakia.' Scroll down for video . One of the pictures Khaled Sharrouf posted of him with a gun when he tweeted a call-to-arms . An earlier picture on Sharrouf's Twitter page of a young child brandishing a gun with the caption: 'One of dawlas youngest members' The Sydney Morning Herald reported that 'bakia' meant 'he cries' in Arabic and 'maliki' was a term used to describes the Nouri al-Maliki government, which is led by Shiites. The regime is strongly opposed to Sunni extremists who have torn through Iraq's north in the past few weeks. Another tweet fired off from Sharrouf read: 'My (provisions) are beneath the shade of my sword. We live better than we lived in our country.' But these uploads barely scratch the surface of the disturbing content found on Sharrouf's Twitter page. Earlier posts contain pictures so graphic that Daily Mail Australia has chosen not to describe or publish them. But one that can be shared is of a young child brandishing a gun and smiling with the caption: 'One of dawlas [sic] youngest members' - which was posted late May. Dawlah is Arabic for country or state. Other photos show Sharrouf standing in front of military vehicles as well as fundamentalist propaganda memes. He told people to 'come and be part of what we have dreamt For for decades' and said: 'we live better than we lived in our country ' Sharrouf often posts propaganda memes including this one in which he mocks Abu Mariya, an officer of Syrian jihadist group Jabhat Al-Nusra Shari'i - which fights against Bashar al-Assad's regime . Khaled Sharrouf (pictured) is part of Islamic extremist group Islamic State - a breakaway group of al-Qaeda . On Thursday, Elomar - a former Sydney boxer and Islamic State jihadist - made his threat against Diggers on his Twitter account accompanied by a picture of a weeping Iraqi soldier who had been taken hostage before he was beaten and executed. In response to Elomar's outburst, Sharrouf tweeted: 'Allah...says ""kill them where ever you find them""....' These tweets come just days after the Australian Government said almost 60 Australians fight for Islamic radicals in Iraq and Syria, while about 150 Australians were being monitored for supporting terrorist organisations, recruiting fighters or preparing to travel overseas to fight. This information was revealed after Sydney teenager Abdullah Elmir became the third Australian teenager to walk out on his family in June bound for Iraq. It is believed Abdullah, 17, was recruited by an Islamic extremist group to fight in the troubled war zone. He went missing from his family's Bankstown home - in Western Sydney - almost two weeks ago, and has only been heard from once when he contacted his mother to say he was in Turkey. Ten Australians have died while fighting for extremists in Syria and Iraq. The latest is a 22-year-old Sydney man, Zakaria Raad, who appeared in a recruitment video for the terror group Islamic State - formerly known as the 'Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant' and 'Islamic State of Iraq and Syria' - shortly before he was ambushed in Syria. In one of the recruitment videos entitled There Is No Life Without Jihad, an Australian man who calls himself Abu Yahya ash Shami said he wanted to send 'a message...from a Muslim brother's heart to another brother's heart'. He appeals to Australian Muslims to come join him in the Middle East to restore 'honour' in the region, saying: 'Wake up, wake up and be part of this effort.' A second Australian, Abu Nour al Iraqi, also appears in the video in a balaclava. He said the 'inequities' in the west - including Australia - was one of the reasons to come and fight with him. 'There reasons for coming to jihad - the reasons are plenty,' the masked man said. The former Sydney resident fled from Australia in December - believed to be going to Syria - on his brother's passport . Sharrouf also tweeted a photo of one his Islamic State brothers called Abu Suhaib Tunasi Wallah who was 'one of the best brother I know...' An ISIS recruitment video titled There Is No Life Without Jihad showed five extremists, including this Australian on the left, urging people to 'respond to Allah' and 'wake up and be part of the effort'","Australian radical Khaled Sharrouf issued the call-to-arms on Twitter .

"By . Louise Cheer . A pregnant goat named Dora is the latest victim in a string of brutal attacks on animals after she was found shot by an arrow. This is the fourth incident of its kind in the past month to happen in the Western Sydney region. Recently, two goats were shot dead by arrows in the Blacktown area, a kangaroo suffered injuries when it was hit with an arrow at St Marys and a pelican was found with similar afflictions at Eastern Creek. Dora was found injured by an arrow about 6.30am on Tuesday on a rural property .

It is suspected that the incident occurred during the night. A RSPCA spokeswoman confirmed Dora was pregnant with twins when she was attacked. 'When we did an ultrasound we could hear at least one heartbeat and we could see wriggling around,' she said. The expectant mother had an arrow lodged in her shoulder when she was discovered at Wetherill Park, west of Sydney . Dora is expected to make a full recovery and her twins will be arriving any day now . 'So she should be delivering in the next couple of days – any time now.' The spokeswoman said Dora had to be sedated for transport and would have been in pain initially. She said the expectant mother had life-threatening injuries upon arrival, but was now in a stable condition and walking around. '[She's] expected to make a full recovery,' the spokeswoman said.

"By . Daniel Mills . Australian sprinter Sally Pearson said  suspended Athletics coach Eric Hollingsworth had a 'negative' impact on athletes . Australia's shining light on the athletics track Sally Pearson has let fire with a departing spray to suspended coach Eric Hollingsworth after winning Commonwealth Games gold. The 27-year-old track star put an end to her week of silence on the issue - and months of 'negativity' with Hollingsworth at the helm of the athletics camp - by declaring she 'was probably the last supporter he had on the Australian team.’ Pearson said from the very moment he was sent home for comments made about her no-show at a Glasgow pre-Games meet, the morale within the Commonwealth Games team lifted immediately. She repeatedly alluded to Hollingsworth as a 'negative' person during an interview with reporters after her 100m hurdles win. She called his personality and style of coaching negative, and said the only way she was going to win that race was to put him out of sight and out of mind. 'He was very negative, and he has been negative to every single person in the team,' she said. 'You need to get rid of negativity and we did, and now everyone one can lift and be happy.' Sally Pearson spoke to reporters following her Commonwealth Games gold medal where she said she was probably Hollingsworth's last supporter . Pearson's relationship with Hollingsworth went south following a comments he made at a track event at Poland this year . Sally Pearson and Hollingsworth, left, in happier times when shewon the 2011 Athletics Australia Athlete of the Year award . Pearson said her commitment to the sport was unwavering, and her preparation was not going to be hampered by the distraction of Hollingsworth's suspension. 'I don't run for anyone like that, I don't run for negativity.' 'I'm a competitor and I love to race and I love my sport so that's why I do it.' Pearson has described the breakdown of her relationship with Hollingsworth as 'sad' - hitting an all-time low following the world indoor championships in Sopot, Poland, earlier this year. She said she lost respect for the coach following 'harsh' comments he made about her performance. 'It is sad because I guess I was probably the last supporter that he had on the Australian team and he messed that up himself by really -  again, I am not sure of the word to use - but I felt really put down and he spoke down to me very harshly,' The Sydney Morning Herald reported. 'I am the sort of person that if you are going to treat me like that you’re not going to get much respect after it.' Pearson crossed the line of the 100m hurdles in first place, winning back-to-back Commonwealth Games' Golds on day nine . Pearson said it felt like a weight had been lifted off the shoulders of the Australian team when Hollingsworth was suspended . The issue was compounded by comments he made about her lack of support for the Australian team when she failed to show at the Glasgow pre-games meet due to other commitments. '[To say] that I was not supportive of them (Australian team) that was very disappointing, because more than anything that is not who I am and all of you ... who have been interviewing me for so many years now know how excited I am to run for Australia.' Pearson said she understood the need for her to be at the camp as team captain, but 'for a sport that is very individual, it is very important for that athlete to get the best out of themselves and their preparation.' Others have spoken out about Hollingsworth in the days since his departure, including former Commonwealth Games gold medallist Fabrice Lapierre a long jumping gold medalist from the Delhi Games. Lapierre said Hollingsworth was 'definitely' disliked by most athletes and laughed when he heard about his suspension. 'It's pretty funny I think. I guess a lot of athletes don't really like him. I don't really care,' he said.","Sally Pearson waited to win gold before blasting Eric Hollingsworth .

The mother of an Australian teenager who caused one of the biggest upsets in Wimbledon history when he knocked out world No.1 Rafael Nadal from the competition says her son can do it again. In the early hours of Wednesday morning, Canberra's Nick Kyrgios won the hearts of Australians everywhere when he became the first teenager to defeat a world No.1 since Nadal did it against Roger Federer at Roland Garros in 2005.

Ms Kyrgios - who watched the teenager's triumph from her Canberra home - said despite being believing in him since the 19-year-old first picked up the racket, she had her doubts about whether or not he could pull off the upset.

"By . Daniel Mills . The safety pin which was found lodged inside the 500g block of cheese . An Australian man bit off far more than he could chew recently when he sunk his teeth into a safety pin lodged inside a block of cheddar cheese. Patrick McMullen, 59, was casually cutting a slice of Woolworths-brand cheese on Wednesday night when to his 'horror' he felt a small pin-prick inside the roof of his mouth. Initially mistaking the pain for a self-inflicted cracked tooth, Mr McMullen soon realised something far more sinister was the reason why he opted to spit the half-eaten slice - and the safety pin inside - onto the kitchen table. 'It was Wednesday evening and I'd cut off a slice of the blocked cheese and found something unusual in my mouth,' he said. 'I thought I'd cracked a tooth, but when I spat out the cheese  I saw a safety pin inside.' The Orange Woolworths in NSW where the block of cheese was bought from . Although not cracking a tooth, Mr McMullen did say the pin aggravated a filling he had in one of his top teeth and that he would more than likely require a visit to the dentist to have it replaced. The Woolworths Homebrand 500g variety of cheese was bought from the Orange Woolworths in north west NSW where Mr McMullen, a retired school teacher, regularly shops. Obviously shaken he told Daily Mail Australia he was pleased with how his complaint was handled but spent a large majority of the next day talking with Woolworths.

"By . Daniel Mills . National Australia Bank advertising campaign which tells customers to ditch their 'sensible side'  and 'treat themselves a little' by spending on their credit card is under fire from customers. The bank has been sending customers handwritten, personally addressed letters from their 'sensible side' urging them to embrace their 'impulsive side' and get a new credit card to treat themselves to a little retail therapy. One letter addressed to a Queensland teenager explicitly encourages her to apply for a new credit card because its low-cost benefits means she will be able 'enjoy some retail therapy.' The handwritten letter addressed to 19-year-old Rebekah . Mari-Anna Reiljan-Dillon said she was 'insulted' when she received her personally letter from the NAB . The controversial 'hand-written' letter mailed to bank customers on the right and Mari-Anna Reiljan-Dillon's reply on the left . Ms Reiljan-Dillon's letter detailed the very reasons why she was not suitable for the bank's low-fee credit card and how she felt about the campaign . The letters have motivated angry customers to bombard the NAB's Facebook page and other websites in which they have labelled the campaign 'condescending and insulting'. One Toowoomba father wrote to The Chronicle criticising the bank for sending the letter to his 19-year-old daughter, Rebekah. Another customer, Mari-Anna Reiljan-Dillon, took the time to write her own handwritten reply back to the bank, claiming the campaign makes a mockery of individual customer choices. Ms Reiljan-Dillon wrote that as a prudent money-manager and savvy investor, it was an 'insult' to receive the letter from her bank. She said the letter made a mockery of her own intelligence. 'To imply that I do not know how to manage my own finances responsibly, and then even worse, to suggest that I would consider getting a credit card to be sensible. How little intelligence do you think I have?' she wrote. Many other customers, such as Mary O'Brien, feel let down about the bank's marketing strategy and the messages contained in it . There's been no shortage of negative reaction to the campaign on Facebook . One customer addressed her concern's to the general manager of the big Australian financial firm . A spokesman for the NAB said invitations to take up the credit card offer are 'only extended to customers that we expect can manage that credit.' 'The campaign letter is sent to existing NAB customers that have established a good banking history with NAB,' The spokesman said. He said the letter used in the campaign 'highlights the smart ways to reduce credit card interest - which is usually topical at end of financial year.' Another long-term NAB customer, Mary O'Brien, 52, who has experience in marketing, said while it might be a smart campaign it was also 'insulting, condescending and poorly targeted.' 'I don't have credit card debt and I don't have a problem with my impulsive side,' she said. She said it was 'rude' of the bank she had been trusting with her finances for more than 40 years to suggest she should rely on a new credit card. Ms O'Brien also said there was an underlying ethical problem to the pitch because it suggested that everybody has a problem with managing their finances, even if they are debt-free. It is not known how many complaints have been made, but there are several other social media posts directed to the bank's Facebook page of people detailing their dismay. According to creditcard.com.au the total balance held on Australian credit cards with an interest-free period as of February 2014 was $45 billion. The company said this was a slight increase from the same time last year and in her letter Mari-Anna Reiljan-Dillon pointed to Australia's escalating credit card debt. 'Do you know how many Australians are weighed down with credit card debts they are unsure of ever being able to repay? But of course you do, and that is why you are trying to milk me for all the interest you can.' She said she would happily ignore and decline every future credit card application the bank tried to entice her to make in the future.

"By . Daniel Mills . An Australian entrepreneur is revolutionising the cost of private education for parents by offering last-minute discounts for their child's education. In a world-first, 25-year-old Jeremy Wein has partnered with a number of Australia's leading independent schools to offer parents between 10 and 40 per cent off the price of their child's enrollment via School Places. The idea, similar to travel website Wotif.com, came to Wein who wanted to apply the ease of the travel website to the complexity and expense of private school placements. Scroll down for video . Xavier College, a boarding school in Melbourne, has signed up with the School Places website offering parents reduced costs for their child . Jeremy Wein, a 25-year-old entrepreneur modeled the system similar to how travel website Wotif.com runs . CEO Natalie Mactier said independent schools are inflating fees to cover their running costs . The website launched on Tuesday and nearly 500 people from NSW have already registered their son or daughter for a spot. The aim is to give parents flexibility and choice while helping them overcome the inflating costs of private education. It also eliminates the need to cue a child for a competitive private school placement from as early as birth. 'The high cost of running schools is growing faster than family incomes,' School Places CEO Natalie Mactier said. 'The kinds of fee increases we’ve seen in recent years just aren’t sustainable.' NSW and Victorian schools which have registered pay a commission to the site when a vacancy becomes available 'similar to what a travel agent might charge you for booking a holiday,' Ms Mactier said. Some of the Victorian-based independent schools where parents can send their child for a reduced price of between 10 and 40 per cent . It allows parents to enroll their student at the last-minute without having to 'lock them in' to the private education system at an early age. 'While many parents prefer to lock in their options well ahead of time, School Places caters to those who prefer to keep their options open or who need to find a new school in a hurry.' Among the schools with quoted reductions are Macquarie Grammar in Sydney's CBD, Masada College in in Sydney's north and several other Victorian colleges. Parents can 'claim' a vacancy for their year 11 child at Macquarie Grammar School in 2015 for an annual fee of $17,000 - a reduction of 15 per cent on the full fee. The same institution also offers a reduction of 15 per cent on year 7 entrants - the hardest year group to find a place - at a cost of $15,300. If the same year 7 student was to enroll for the rest of the 2014 year now, it would cost a parent $10,800. At Masada College in the city's north School Places has 30 per cent reductions on a year 11 spot, however its prices are not quoted. In some cases parents can make savings of up to $8,000 off a child's yearly fee. Other schools in the system are Scots Bathurst in NSW, and The New Generation College and Plenty Valley Christian College in Victoria.

"By . Daniel Mills . Anna Flanagan, according to FHM, is the hottest girl to look out for at the Games . Glaswegians are going ga ga over Australia's gold medal hopefuls with three of our athletes deemed the Commonwealth Games' hottest by men's mag FHM. Readers have been given the tough task of keeping an eye out for podium princesses Anna Flanagan, Melissa Breen and Genevieve LaCaze who were named in the gold, silver and bronze spots for the best looking female athletes. Two other home-grown Scottish athletes and a Canadian ranked in the minor placings, who according to to FHM are the 'sexiest Commonwealth Games ladies that you need to be paying attention to right now'. Hockeyroo and 22-year-old Flanagan, who turned heads when she posed for a Games' promotional shoot in a Scottish kilt, is a law student and journalism graduate back home. Her teammates, 23-year-old Breen and LaCaze, 24, are both representing their country at the track but all three are turning heads away from the sporting arena. The Glasgow glamours have all been active on social media during Scottish expedition and are earning adorning fans of the Games the world over. All three came in the top three ahead of Canadian, Wendy Dorr, and Scottish born stars Gemma Nicol and Rebecca Bee. The 24 year old Flanagan is in action for the Hockeyroos at Glasgow and has played more than 100 tests for her country . Anna Flanagan was named World Hockey player of the year in 2013 . Melissa Breen, a 100m sprinter, is into the semi finals of competition but has already won over many adoring fans for her good looks .

According to her online bio, 23-year-old Flanagan is better known as 'Flanno' - the Hockeyroo defender who has amassed more than 100 tests for her country and 15 goals. She was named Hockey’s 2013 World Young Player of the Year and became only the third Australian woman to receive the award. She is lining up with her Hockeyroos teammates to defend their Commonwealth Games gold. LaCaze, an Aussie steeplechase specialist, is coming back from a stress fracture injury in her right foot for these games. The Brisbane native now lives in the US and is dating Aussie middle distance runner Ryan Gregson. She told the Courier Mail about her chances at the Games: 'I know I am good enough to medal if I keep up my progress for the next few months.' Melissa Breen has already comfortably cruised into the semi-final of her pet event the 100m sprint. The national 100m record holder blew out the cobwebs by winning the second heat in 11.54sec in cool conditions at Hampden Park. She rates idol Melinda Gainsford-Taylor as her biggest inspiration and ranked the 2012 London Games as her most rewarding career goal to date.

"By . Daniel Mills . Golden girls of Australian swimming Cate and Bronte Campbell have led an inspiring one, two, three finish in the 100m women's freestyle at the Commonwealth Games. Less than .18 seconds separated Cate and sister Bronte in a nail-biting finish which almost saw Bronte pull-off one of the great 50m comebacks to haul in her much fancied rival. Cate was cruising at the 50m turn, almost half a second under the world record, but faded over the last 25m as Bronte stormed home to almost pull off an incredible last-gasp upset.

In a graceful display of sportsmanship Cate invited both her sister and and McKeown to the top podium to sing the national anthem just a day after Annette Edmondson did after defeating teammate Anna Meares in the cycling pursuit. It was the second Australian clean sweep in the pool overnight with Brett Larkin beating compatriots Josh Beaver and Matson Lawson in the men's 200m backstroke. The Campbell battle topped-off an incredible night for Australia which included another podium clean sweep, this time in the men’s 200m backstroke. Brisbane backstroker Mitch Larkin looks likely to finish as Australia’s most successful individual swimmer of the meet after winning the 200m backstroke in a time of 1:55.83. Larkin's gold was the first since 1974 that an Australian had won the Games' event, finishining ahead of Australian Josh Beaver (1:56.19) and Matson Lawson (1:56.63) in the bronze spot. Australia's other two gold medals came in shooting with Warren Potent taking out the 50m rifle prone competition and Laetisha Scanlan  winning the women's trap. Australia so far has 30 gold medals in total, three ahead of England. Cate, Bronte and Emma all celebrated on the top dais after the event .

"By . Daniel Mills . More Australian men will now have access to one of the world's most revolutionary drugs, Viagra, with its price per-pill plummeting to less than the cost of a cup of coffee. At full-cost, consumers were being slugged $85 for the Pfizer-owned product, but since the medical giant's patent expired in mid-May it has opened up a new market for generic brands to swoop. The gap in the market is proving a huge winner for consumers and now more men can pay to turn their troubled sex life around for just $3. Pfizer's patent for the drug Viagra ran out in June and now its cost has plummeted . The cheaper varieties are being stocked in chemists throughout the country - and according to the Sydney Morning Herald - Chemist Warehouse, Blooms and Terry White are passing on the reduced cost for $14 for four 100mg pills of the drug. The once discernible diamond-shaped blue pill is now being marketed in all different shapes and sizes but the active ingredient, Sildenafil, will remain. Erectile dysfunction expert Chris McMahon said the high price has been a major stumbling block for consumers in the past, and cheaper varieties such as APO-Sildenafil are now giving men greater access. ‘The high price has always been a stumbling block preventing many men from being able to afford to use the drug regularly,’ he said. It also means men who were previously healthy, but were left impotent as result of cancer or diabetes, can benefit too. Cialis is one of a number of new generic Viagra brands flooding the market in chemists across Australia . In cases where erection problems are associated with diseases most men in Australia received no financial compensation, with very few private health funds paying for such treatments. National Chairman of Prostate Cancer Foundation David Sandoe said women with breast cancer receive government support for reconstruction from mastectomies, but men do not receive the same luxury for impotency as a result of prostate cancer surgery. ‘It’s never made sense that male cancer victims are treated so differently from women,’’ he said. In Britain, Viagra was costing the National Health Service more than £40 million ($72 million) a year before Pfizer’s patent ran out in June last year. Many are hoping the new cheap Viagra will dissuade men from ordering potentially dangerous erection drugs online. It might also mean it cuts some of the embarrassment associated with buying the recogniseable blue pill many feel ashamed about doing over the counter because it will be marketed in different forms.","Pfizer's patent expired in May and generic brands now flooding chemists .

"By . Daniel Mills . Comedian Josh Richards wasn't joking around when he said he wanted to spend his 40th birthday  party in space. The Australian, who is now 28, is already planning the occasion with 23 strangers when he hopes to touch down on Mars in 2024. It is a long-shot, he said, but his chances are more than a pipe dream now with the West Australian pushing his claims for a place on the hotly-contested Mars One expedition which will see just 24 people travel to space and never return. Josh Richards is hoping to celebrate his 40th and first birthday on Mars as part of the Dutch-funded 2024 Mars One mission . Korum Ellis, Richards friend, is also in line for project which could see the pair endure a 10-year training regime . The West Australian, and friend Korum Ellis, are two of 705 people in the running for the mission  that will see space goers undergo a 10-year training regime in order to prepare for the rest of their lives in space. It will teach them all the necessary skills to start a new colony that will produce its own oxygen, water and food. Ellis said it will require up to nine years of unwavering dedication to prepare for the trip, while Richards said he is leaving no stone unturned in his quest to join the team of 24. More... Back to civilization: Six volunteer researchers return to the real world after four months on 'Mars' ... in Hawaii . Start your engines! Nasa set to fire rocket that will take man to Mars . The 28-year-old left his long-term partner, a budding career in comedy and a former life as a soldier all behind to fulfill his quest. He told Daily Mail Australia he has high-hopes of making his first birthday on Mars one to remember. 'I've already figured out the 40th Birthday Idea,' he said. 'I worked out that if I'm 28 now, ill be 29 by mid-August ... and if they are planning on launching September 24, 2013 I would have just had my 39th birthday.' If all goes well it will be his last on earth. He said the journey will take seven months, and by the time he touches down in April 2024, he'll have just five months to wait to pop the party streamers. Richards, 28, has left behind a long-term partner a budding career in comedy and a former life as a soldier to take part in the project . Richards served with British commandos as a combat engineer but most recently worked as a comedian in the UK . Comedian Josh Richards has had a life long dream to travel to space since he was seven . He and Mr Ellis were two of more than 200,000 people who applied for the Mars One project in 2012 - but that number has since decreased due to stringent medical tests and preliminary interviews. In the coming months more people will be rejected, and the hopes of those left on the list increased until six-teams of 24 people start their training. Just one team of 24 will travel - meaning those who gave up their careers to toil for a spot on the Mars One mission will be left high and dry back on earth. Training will start next year, and Richards' background as a soldier working in the British and Australian Army will hopefully help his bid. 'People aren't just being picked for existing skills and ability but also to see how everyone gets along with other people.' 'I will relocate where ever they need me, which will be both Europe and US requiring a fair bit of travel. The team will spend three months in isolation and once fully prepared will be trained to the 'same level as a paramedic.' 'In some cases the same level as surgeons,' Richards said. More than 200,000 people applied for project, hoping to be one of four chosen to make the first mission in 2024 .

"By . Daniel Mills . A Sydney mother-of-two has criticised a new design of Huggies nappy claiming it seeps fluid. Up until three weeks ago Janette Ishiuyama, 41, had entrusted her regular Huggies brand to keep Xavier, three, and Maya, one, well protected. However a recent design change has forced her to switch to Baby Love because of repeated and lengthy clean up jobs. Now other mothers are backing up the claims of leaking and seepage and questioned whether they will ever buy Huggies again. Janette Ishiyama had suddenly noticed her tried and true Huggies brand was failing to keep her two children, Maya (left) and Xavier, right, dry . Ms Ishiuyama attributes the problems to the new 'thinner look and feel' of the toddler protective wear. Before realising the nappy was at fault, she tried changing her childrens' feeding requirements and taking other fruitless measures to stop the seepage. But when she took her complaint to the company itself and wrote about her experience on a Sydney mother's Facebook group - the real reason for the leaks became more apparent. 'There were about 20 odd days or so where they were leaking all the time, I was having to wash sheets daily and and lay down mattress protectors.' She complained to Huggies directly about their new selling point for the Junior and Walker varieties which claim to be more 'soft and secure' than the original, offering a 'new layer designed to absorb wetness and spring back dry.' Huggies Walker and Junior varieties have recently undergone a design change . But the altered version, which Mrs Ishiuyama said is 'looser', appears to be causing more problems than solutions across Sydney with her complaint posted to Facebook receiving 41 comments from mums also dealing with the same dilemma of seepage. Mrs Ishiuyama said it became evident from reading a label on the packaging that it must have been the new design which was causing the problem. 'When I posted to the mother's Facebook group and found similar problems that's when I noticed they (Huggies) had changed the design.' 'I began to feel it (the nappy) when it was on and noticed that it was really loose so I tried a different size but that didn't work.' She phoned the Huggies hotline and the operator told her that they had various complaints of a similar nature of seepage regarding the Junior and Walker varieties. A company spokesperson told her to send back two nappies for testing in the hope of finding a resolution to the problem - and the issue is still being investigated. In the meantime, Mrs Ishiuyama has switched to Baby Love - a brand she could not speak more highly of. 'Other mums themselves have also switched over and posted bout how good they are.'","Janette Ishiuyama, 41, noticed more nappy seepage in her children .

"By . Daniel Mills . An 18-year-old Gold Coast girl has won her bid to have a $680,000-a-year drug subsidised so that she can receive ongoing medical treatments to keep her alive. Bianca Scott, who spent her recent 18th birthday wishing to stay alive, will finally have access to her first government-funded dose of Soliris, which will save her family more than $24,000 a fortnight and help her fight a very rare immune disease which attacks her internal organs. Ms Scott is suffering the life-threatening blood disease called atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome, or aHUS which can result in blood clots and can destroy internal organs. Bianca has had 11 doses of Soliris since February, costing her family about $250,000, but now she will be given the drug for less after a joint State and Federal Government-funding agreement was reached. Scroll down for video . Bianca Scott was diagnosed with a rare condition called aHUS when she was seven months old, it reappeared late last year . Since her diagnosis, Bianca has spent most of her time in hospital in Brisbane, where she undergoes dialysis and plasma transfusions . Bianca is one of 70 Australians living with aHUS and among 10 who need the treatment urgently. So far she is the only Australian with access to the subsidised drug but it is hoped her case will open the debate up further for Soliris to be accessible to everyone. It is a short-term solution, her mother Tammy Hamawi said, but one that she hopes receives long-term funding. “We have won but we haven’t secured Bianca absolutely to access this medicine long-term,” Ms Hamawi told The Courier Mail. Bianca's mother, who had given up her job running her own mentoring and business consultancy company to care for her daughter, thanked Senator Barry O’Sullivan and Gold Coast MP Karen ­Andrews who told her on Tuesday that Bianca would get the treatment. She had been spending all of the family's money, as well as money borrowed from friends, on the  life-saving treatment. She was forced to stop the treatment on June 5, given the ongoing financial demands. She said the government intervention in helping Bianca prolong her life is a big bonus - given Soliris 'is the only treatment' which helps manage her condition. 'Without a doubt Soliris is the most expensive drug in the world,' said Ms Hamawi. 'It is the only treatment in the whole world for aHUS.' Bianca was diagnosed with aHUS, which can strike at any age, when she was seven months old. She then found out then that her uncle had died of the disease as a child. Unusually, the illness lay dormant in Bianca before resurfacing late last year, just a few weeks after she finished high school. Bianca's mother Tammy Hamawi (left) discovered a drug that could treat aHUS, called Soliris, which costs $24,000 per fortnightly dose . Bianca was first diagnosed with the life-threatening illness when she was seven months old (pictured here after her initial diagnosis) So far Ms Hamawi has been able to pay for five courses of the treatment, with help from her family and from donations . Soliris is currently available at a subsidised rate for people suffering with another ultra-rare disease, called paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) through the Life Saving Drugs Program (LSDP). It was being considered by the LSDP as a treatment for aHUS when the LSDP was put under review by the federal government earlier this year. The drug was then moved for consideration to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC). The PBAC recommended that Soliris be subsidised under the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme for sufferers of aHUS, though there are still several bureaucratic steps to go through before any subsidy will come into effect. Kirsten Bruce, a representative of the aHUS Patient Support Group Australia said that the PBAC recommendation leaves many questions unanswered. Of particular concern, she says, is that under the proposed conditions, patients will only be eligible for the drug is they are currently experiencing a flare-up of the condition, and will only be allowed to take the drug for six months after they have recovered from the attack, even though it is recommended that sufferers remain on the drug for the duration of their lives. 'Sufferers want to know who will qualify for Soliris, whether they'll be able to stay on it long-term, there are so many question marks,' she said. 'The tragedy is there's a drug that's available, that works, and it sits on pharmacy shelves, the doctors want to be able to prescribe it but they can't.' A spokesperson for the Federal Department of Health confirmed that it was currently in negotiations with Alexion, who hold the patent for the drug. Alexion were contacted for comment. 'Mum noticed symptoms and she took me to hospital and they told me the aHUS had come back. Since then I was faced with this terrible battle,' she said. 'I couldn't keep any food down, I was always vomiting, I couldn't stand up, I'd feel very dizzy, I had fevers… sadly I have chronic kidney failure now.' She required an endless run of hospital visits – with Bianca requiring eight-hour stretches of dialysis three to four days a week, as well as plasma infusions – before Ms Hamawi heard of Soliris. 'Thank God for Google!' she said. Ms Hamawi was able to fund five doses of the drug, with the help of her family and friends, and two further doses were bought using donations, including a $19,000 donation from Bianca's school and an anonymous $10,000 donation. 'I am so grateful for that,' said Bianca. 'I thank everyone for that.' Since starting on Soliris on Valentine's Day, Bianca has turned a corner. She still requires dialysis, but the plasma infusions, which she describes as 'weird' and 'scary' have stopped, her hours in hospital have significantly decreased and she is feeling much better. Her blood tests are also showing vastly improved results, with the nephrologist telling Bianca on Monday that if her results continue in the direction they're going she might be able to come off dialysis. But with the cost of Soliris currently so high, it was cost $680,000 a year to keep her on the drug, Bianca and her mother do not have the money to buy their next dose, which Bianca is due to take on Thursday June 19. Without Soliris, Bianca will likely deteriorate, and if left too long, the damage to her kidney will be so severe that she will have to remain on dialysis for the rest of her life. 'She's 17, can you imagine a lifetime of chronic kidney failure? And when I say a lifetime, it's not going to be a long life,' said Ms Hamawi. Ms Hamawi is frustrated at Alexion, the U.S. company that produce Soliris and own the patent for the drug. 'On the one hand $680,000 a year to save your child's life is a big price, it's too high,' she said. However, most of her anger is directed at the Australian government, which she says is 'a system that we thought was there to protect and look after us [and] has in a way let us down'. 'It baffles me how could you justify fuelling aeroplanes to go and look for an aeroplane that’s who knows where. But when someone needs mediciine, and it is the only medicine that is available, you sit there and negotiate and it might take six months,' she said.

"By . Daniel Mills . The family of a Queensland woman who died during her work Christmas party will not receive a payout for her death because she was ruled to be off-duty when the accident happened. Jukes Campbell was celebrating the function with colleagues when she dove into a shallow section of the Noosa River, suffering neck and back injuries. Despite the party being sanctioned by her boss and organised by the Woolworths-owned store, her death won't be recognised as a workplace accident. Jonathon Campbell, the woman's husband, turned her life support off two days after the party. Jonathon Campbell lost his a bid for his wife's workers compensation after the Queensland IRC ruled she did not die from duties performed at work. The Courier Mail reported that the Industrial Relations Commission, who sided with a Woolworths bid to block the family's claim for compensation, ruled that her husband Mr Campbell was not entitled to a payout from his wife’s death because she had been 'on a frolic of her own'. In order to qualify for a workers compensation payout staff must prove their injury 'arose out of, or in the course of' their work. The IRC ruled that Mrs Campbell was not working, proving a cruel blow for her husband who had originally won a Queensland Government workers compensation claim after the deputy director-general for Fair and Safe Work Queensland approved it. Woolworths said its staff encouraged Ms Campbell to attend the party which was celebrated in March instead of December because of staff commitments, but denied they encouraged her to dive into the Noosa River. It is claimed Ms Campbell asked her manager to take photos of her just before the accident occurred. Mrs Campbell dove head first into the Noosa River, on Queensland's Sunshine Coast during a Christmas work party in March . The Noosaville Dan Murphy's Store where Mrs Campbell worked . Woolworths has refused to comment on the matter because Mr Campbell has lodged an appeal and the case is still ongoing. The maximum amount payable for a workers compensation payout in Queensland is $374,625. Woolworths is one of Australia's largest retailers employing more than 197,000 people nationwide. It has nearly 900 retail liquor outlets and 627 petrol stations. In a similar case in NSW, Woolworths refused to pay workers compensation to the three orphaned children of single mother Marie Scanlan, the manager of a petrol station in western Sydney. Ms Scanlan suffered a  heart attack while driving to a stressful management meeting in April four years ago. The Workers Compensation Commission ordered Woolworths to pay $433,650 to Ms Scanlan’s children because her stressful job, where she worked up to 70 hours a week, aggravated her deadly heart condition.","Jukes Campbell was at a Christmas party organised by her work when she dived into a shallow section of the Noosa River .

The parents of murdered Queensland teenager Daniel Morcombe have revealed their outrage at news a key police interview will be kept secret to protect the privacy of their son's killer. Bruce and Denise Morcombe claim details from an interview Northern Territory police conducted with Brett Peter Cowan could be the key to ensuring he never secures parole. The interview with Cowan is not in relation to Daniel Morcombe but an attack on a six-year-old boy in 1993, Channel Seven reports. But it will not be revealed after it was ruled that doing so would amount to an 'invasion of Mr Cowan's privacy'. Cowan was in March jailed for life for the 2003 murder of 13-year-old Daniel, who he abused and killed in an abandoned house after abducting the teen from a Sunshine Coast bus stop. Scroll down for video . Daniel Morcombe's killer Brett Peter Cowan had requests for the chocolate cereal Coco Pops in jail turned down but is still looking fit and healthy . How Brett Peter Cowan looked - a frail and gaunt figure - before he was locked away in Wolston Correctional Centre . Daniel Morcombe went missing from a Sunshine Coast bus stop back in 2003 . 'That intimate detail and certainly that vision has never been seen,' Bruce Morcombe told Seven about the secret interview. 'He's not entitled to rights, he should be exposed for the person he is.'Denise Morcombe claimed that the interview could provide key information that could ensure Cowan never leaves prison, adding: 'We don't want another child to be murdered or molested.' It comes after the TV network published the first picture of Cowan behind bars, showing a fitter and healthier looking man inside the maximum security Wolston Correctional Centre. It is the first time Bruce and Denise Morcombe had seen their son's killer since he was led away from Brisbane Supreme Court following his sentencing. When he was imprisoned, he had special food requests such as Coco Pops rejected, but in his cell he has his own TV, radio, toilet and shower. Himself a father, Cowan has three children but they won't be seeing their dad for at least 20 years when the 44-year-old is eligible for parole from his maximum security cell. Bruce and Denise Morcombe speak after the first photo of Brett Peter Cowan from behind bars emerges of him looking fit and healthy . When he was imprisoned, he had special food requests such as Coco Pops rejected, but in his cell he has his own TV, radio, toilet and shower. Himself a father, Cowan has three children but they won't be seeing their dad for at least 20 years when the 44-year-old is eligible for parole from his maximum security cell. He will be kept in solitary confinement during his time inside purely for his own protection from prison inmates. In some cases, according to prison staff, Cowan requires high level escorts when he leaves his cell to guard him down the halls during weekly visits to the doctor. He visits a gym, a concrete room with a single sun-drenched window, which is the only time he ever gets to see life life outside. Bruce Morcombe said he knows Cowan would be doing it tough, and quite frankly, didn't care much for his treatment behind bars. In a message to Cowan Mr Morcombe told the father of three neither he nor his wife 'feel sorry for sorry him' 'Suck it up,' he said.

Back in March Cowan was found guilty of murder, indecent treatment of a child and interfering with a corpse. The Morcombe family declined to be present for the sentencing, in which Supreme Court Judge Roslyn Atkinson spoke at length about Cowan's crimes. She described his crime as 'entirely abhorrent.' 'You didn't look like a monster, you didn't look like a peadophile, you looked like an ordinary person,' she said. 'You knew if he ran away, you'd be caught. So you killed him. You killed him because you didn't want to get caught. 'Everything you did to that boy is horrific and disgraceful. I've seen no evidence in the months you've been in this court that you ever felt any remorse for what you did.

"By . Daniel Mills . An Adelaide man has been accused of having sex with at least seven young children . An Australian man has been charged with 'horrific' sex crimes against at least seven, preschool-aged children at a government-run childcare centre where he worked. Police, who have labelled the crimes 'disturbing, abhorrent and horrifying,' allege the 32-year-old engaged in sexual intercourse with at lease seven children and operated a highly-sophisticated sex racket distributing and producing more than 100,000 still images and 600 video files of child exploitation material. The man, who cannot be identified, was a government employee at a residential facility when he allegedly committed the crimes during an 18-month period back in 2011-2012. He also cared for children outside of school hours, police said. Scroll down for video . South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill has ordered a State Government Royal Commission into the alleged sexual abuse of children at a government-run residential care facility . SA Police Assistant Commissioner Paul Dickson addresses the media to detail the horrific accusations leveled against an Adelaide man . Assistant Crime Commissioner Paul Dickson described the crimes as 'abhorrent' and said priority counselling is being given to affected families due to the disturbing nature of the case. 'As a police officer and as a father I am abhorred by these crimes,' he said. 'This investigation can best be described as horrific — horrific for the victims and their families and a terrible task for the police who have worked tirelessly to review these images.' He said the investigation will remain a priority for police, purely due to the complexity and enormity of the data yet to be analysed. 'It may take many months to complete.' Premier Jay Weatherill said the allegations point to 'unspeakable acts of evil' against children and could prompt a Royal Commission. 'This is unprecedented in possibly South Australia's or the nation's history,' he said. 'These were some of our most vulnerable children. We have to review everything.' Employed by Families SA, the crimes leveled against the man are alleged to have been committed during an 18-month period between mid-2011 and the end of 2012. Police searched the man's house in June, uncovering evidence of 'contact offending' and child exploitation material after receiving a tip-off that he was involved in the production and distribution of child pornography. Families SA deputy chief executive David Waterford said the accused man had undergone rigorous working with children assessment . Detectives have analysed more than 100,000 still images and 600 video files during their investigation which could take months to investigate .

"By . Daniel Mills . The management of a popular Melbourne live music venue have published a video of drunken vandals trashing the roof of their building in an effort to track them down. Video was taken of the three men, who seem to be under the influence of alcohol, climbing across the roof of the building and launching wooden planks, a large bucket and even a disused kitchen sink from the building housing The Old Bar, a music venue in Fitzroy, in Melbourne's inner north. Their destructive trail on Sunday morning as prompted a barrage of criticism on social media. The unknown cameraman has obviously spied the vandals from above the building and dutifully recorded their trail of wreckage. Scroll down for video . A drunken trespasser falls through the tin roof and gets stuck between the iron sheet and the beam supporting it . After struggling out, his friends leave him behind before they eventually escape off the roof only to return to help him down . The three men were filmed above the Old Bar roof as they stood on top  pulling apart items of the roof and throwing it on to the ground below . In one scene a man struggles and falls through a section of the tin roof where he finds himself wedged between it and the wall . The men are visibly struggling to keep their feet as they cross the stumble across the roof. One falls in a heap and is forced to call for a friend to help him up because he can't get off the roof. The footage of the men was handed to the pub's management and then posted on The Old Bar's Facebook page. The overwhelming majority of those who commented on the action were disgusted. In a fiery post, accompanied by the footage, The Old Bar management have asked the public to help identify the 'c*** pockets' seen clambering along the roof top and throwing items on to the lane way below. A post, accompanied with the photo of the three, also reads: 'Anyone know any of these 3 pr***s that just destroyed part of our roof? Please share it around because we would love to have a chat with them ASAP.' Friends of this man have already made their escape off their roof as he stands their waiting to throw a wooden beam off . Music media website, Tonedeaf, said the footage was filmed on Sunday afternoon. Facebook user Tristan Davies said the building was built in the early 19th century. 'It was built in 1902 according to the parapet on the matching corner next door,' he posted. He and other local supporters of the live music venue have already rallied behind their online search, which had reached more than 364 shares on Facebook. The Old Bar spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia while it is 'not that dramatic,' the pub's social media page has been an effective tool in helping track culprits down in the past. 'In the past when something has happened and we have used social media to try and resolve the issue it has generally worked.' 'As we haven't heard anything from these guys by now we doubt we will.' He said the priority now is fixing the roof, and if they find the culprits than that it is an added bonus. 'If only our posts for gigs received 200+ comments and the amount of media attention these d**** have,' the spokesperson said.","Three men scaled the roof of The Old Bar in Fitzroy throwing wooden beams and a kitchen sink off the top .

"By . Daniel Mills . An Australian man who ditched his day job and used his expertise as a patent lawyer to create the 'world's smallest washing machine' - won't be returning to work any time soon. Fed-up with having to pack large suitcases full of clothes when he travelled - Ashley Newland came up with an idea, over a few beers in an Adelaide pub, to invent a durable and lightweight washing machine that travellers the world over could use. It was a few weeks prior to his trip to Tanzania, back in 2012, that Mr Newland spawned the idea of the Scrubba - and now the product has gone global. 'I'm selling tens of thousands of units,' Mr Newland said. Scroll down for video . The Scrubba can be used in almost any location and is the perfect travel companion for travellers packing light . The scrubba has an internal washboard built in and can hold up to 30 litres of water . The Scrubba, he says, is so unique there is 'no equivalent anywhere like it' - and he would know. Employed as a patent lawyer, Mr Newland was working for clients who had big ideas and decided he wanted to create his own. He originally had plans to sell his idea to big manufacturers, but when noone picked it up because they thought it was too ridiculous, he went it alone. He created a three-month crowd funding page to prove The Scrubba could hold its own, and netted a whopping $25000. Mr Newland was convinced that his life as a lawyer was over and followed his entrepreneurial pursuits, so he went ahead with creating the 145-gram product which folds down in to roughly the size of a can of coke, without his partner. He said his friend pulled the pin when The Scrubba, which is just 52 centimetres but remarkably can hold up to 13 litres of water, got serious because he 'wasn't prepared to quit his job.' That man is now kicking himself. Mr Newland has sold the product, which sells for $64.95, to distributors and individuals in more than 50 countries . The invention, which Forbes magazine listed as one of its '10 greatest travel products' in 2012, has travelled with Mr Newland across three continents and has sold to distributors and individuals across 50 countries. He is confident the product, which sells for $64,95, is on the verge of being picked up by a major US camping retailer. Mr Newland said at the outset he wasn't looking for fame or fortune, he just happened to find a hole in the market and came up with the invention that he would use every time he went travelling. 'I was about to climb Mt Kilimanjaro and didn't want to pack all these bulky items,' he said. 'I knew I'd be washing almost every day, and in Africa there are no wash facilities, not even a sink.' He said he: 'wanted to create something that was as gentle on clothes as hand washing' so came up with an idea of an incredibly flexible thin washboard, welded inside a bag. Mr Newland has used his expertise in patent law to secure patents in Australia and New Zealand, and patents pending in another 52 countries. Brad Slater, general manager of Dometic, an international supplier of goods to the recreational vehicle and marine industries, says new innovations such as the Scrubba have dramatically changed the camping industry and will continue to do so. 'Portable showers, washing machines and refrigerators have all been game-changers,' he told The Sydney Morning Herald.","Sydney man Ashley Newland was working as a lawyer in Adelaide .

"By . Daniel Mills . Sydney ad man David Johns has pulled off one of the internet's greatest marketing stunts, designing a slick website to sell his beaten up old Holden Barina for double what it's worth. Despite the car having clocked 188,000 kilometres and having dings on every panel, he's attracted bids of more than $2000. The 15-year-old vehicle once had its exhaust around in its boot for weeks before being reattached. The boss of advertising boss Chimney Digital, the company behind the stunt, says the ad is real but the sleek and impressive approach is just a complete 'piss take' which parodies serious car commercials. Scroll down for video . 'Redefined:' The 1999 Holden Barina Excel is anything but, however, it's a very clever attempt to sell the 15-year-old car . The creative adman David Johns is the brainchild behind the video where he wears sunglasses and a suit emulating the look of James Bond - but driving a Barina . David Johns, an advertising guru, is selling his 1999 Holden Excel and he is asking bidders to tweet him and offer . The Scratched-up and disheveled looking Barina is a complete 'piss-take' of the generic forms of advertising commonly seen in car advertisements . Never mind the duco: There's no hidden faults to this car it, what you see is what you get . The advertisement is a real pitch for the owner to try and get rid of it since he upgraded to a newer one recently . Chimney Digital Asia Pacific CEO Lee Ritson said: 'It is his (David John's) car - the sale is real, and it was his idea,' Mr Ritson said. 'He has been trying to get rid of it, so he came in the other week telling me 'I've got this car I'm trying to sell.' 'It's just a piss take of all the other generic car ads out there.' That hasn't stopped people from entering bidding war though, where Mr Johns is asking people to tweet him offers. And that's where his silky selling skills have really come to the fore - with the car attracting offers of more than $2,000, roughly double the estimated value of the 1999 model Barina XL. But some of the more than 64,000 offers made for the vehicle have been every bit as creative as the ad itself. 'There's been some real trippers come in with offers', Mr Ritson said. 'Someone is offering 40 gallons of unicorn tears, another wants $7.31 for it,' he said. 'Apparently there's a man also willing to spend ""$20 as well as sing a song"". 'Like I said, It is really just a piss take.' Dented and out-dated: incredibly there has been offers of more than $2000 for the car which comes with only three hub caps . One owner? The car comes with fully-functional CD and Audio cassette player capabilities...it's even done only 188,000 kilometers, or there about . Write caption here . He alleges he is the sole-owner of the 1999 Barina, a two-door hatchback designed by the former king of Australian motoring Holden, which recently announced it is ending its production line in Australia. Mr Ritson gave his employee a $1000 budget to film the ad after he came to him with the idea, which is also part promotion for the company. The ad was filmed cruising across Sydney's Anzac Bridge and in the garage of the advertising office. The vehicle's description on the website says it all: 'FM/AM Radio, Auto-Stop Cassette Player, CD Input, and Front and Rear wiper technology'. The Barina's driving capabilities are limited, but it can still motor between '0-60km 'as well as drive in 'reverse'. It even has manual transmission and if that's not enough to motivate you to buy it, what about it's 'German design'? So confident is Mr Johns of selling it he put it on YouTube, and it has reached close to 10,000 views in just two days. 'I'm trying to sell my awesome little car,' Mr Johns writes. 'It's a 1999 Holden Barina. Its not in great condition, but its still a fun little car. Tweet me an offer using the hashtag #buymybarina. I've also set up a little site for it http://buymybarina.com.' There's a an accelerator, break and clutch function which the driver has complete access too and control of . Part of the buss words Mr Johns has used as the 'piss take' to sell his car . A very important part of every motor vehicle . It's hard to believe but apparently David Johns is the sole owner of the 15 year model Excel . The keys to the 15-year-old Holden Barina could be yours - if you successfully bid more than $2000 which is the current highest price .","David Johns created a web page and video to sell his 1999 used car .

"By . Daniel Mills . and Aap . More than 176 years after its first store opened in Sydney, David Jones is passing into foreign hands after shareholders overwhelmingly backed a $2.2 billion takeover. South African retailer Woolworths Holdings will take control of Australia's oldest department store in August, pending court approval, and hopes to significantly improve its performance after years of sliding sales and profits. A handful of shareholders spoke out against the sale at a meeting in Sydney on Monday, with some accusing the David Jones board of 'giving up' on the Australian icon. David Jones Chairman Gordon Cairns left, and CEO Paul Zahra following a shareholder meeting for the $2.2 billion takeover of the company by South African based Woolworths . South African retailer Woolworths Holdings will take control of Australia's oldest department store - which has been trading for more than 176 years,  in August . But most backed the move, with almost 97 per cent votes cast in favour of accepting the $4-a-share offer, though some, like retiree Reg Lobb, did so with heavy hearts. Mr Lobb has a long history with David Jones. His mother worked there in the early 1900s and he's owned shares since it was publicly floated in the mid-1990s. He says David Jones had been damaged by poor decisions by management and the board. 'It's tragic that it's come to this. At least we can get $4 per share and get out,' he told the meeting. Woolworths plans to overhaul David Jones by expanding its private label brands, improving in-store service and website. 'We look forward to implementing our plans to reinvigorate David Jones and enhance the shopping experience for its customers,' chief executive Ian Moir said in a statement. The $4 offer was a solid outcome for shareholders, being more than 80 cents higher from where David Jones was trading prior to the bid and $1.50 above where it was a year ago. Some shareholders have accused David Jones management of giving up on the Iconic Australian company . But the biggest winner is retail mogul Solomon Lew, who bought a 9.9 per cent stake in the retailer after the takeover was announced, apparently to use it as leverage in a battle with Woolworths Holdings over fashion chain Country Road. Almost all Country Road shares are held by either Woolworths, which owns nearly 88 per cent, or Mr Lew, who owns just under 12 per cent, and the billionaire has reportedly been agitating the South African company to buy him out for years. Woolworths has agreed to do that, offering more than $200 million for his Country Road shares on the condition he didn't block the David Jones takeover. He appeared to abstain from Monday's vote. Australian Shareholders Association spokesman Stephen Mayne said Mr Lew would not have had enough votes to block the takeover. 'I think they have potentially been far too generous to Mr Lew than they needed to be,' he said. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has expressed concern over the offer to Mr Lew and whether it constitutes a benefit not available to other David Jones shareholders. ASIC could raise objections at a Federal Court hearing on Thursday.","Shareholders have backed a $2.2 billion takeover by South African Woolworths Holdings .

"By . Sarah Dean . and Aap . and Daniel Mills . Police have recovered the body of second missing snowboarder, Martie Buckland, 33, a day after friend Daniel Kerr was found buried under 4.5 metres of snow at Mount Bogong in Victoria. Inspector Dave Ryan from Wangaratta police said Mr Buckland was found 60 metres up the same slope from where Mr Kerr's body was recovered on Monday, and it appears he was buried under the same dump of snow which claimed his friend. 'They unfortunately have both been caught up in the one avalanche,' he said. A Victoria Police spokeswoman said Mr Buckland was discovered at about 10.30am on Tuesday buried underneath snow 'quite close' to where Mr Kerr's body was located on Monday. The men, described as experienced skiers, had been missing three days before the body of Mr Kerr was found some 400 metres down a slope in the Eskdale Spur area of Mount Bogong. Buckland from Yarra Junction, Victoria, and Kerr from Hawthorn, in Melbourne's eastern suburbs, hadn't been seen since Thursday after failing to return from their snowboarding trip to Eskdale Spur. Scroll down for video . Martie Buckland (right), 33, from Yarra Junction, Victoria, and Daniel Kerr (left), 32, from Hawthorn, Melbourne, (seen here with two friends) hadn't been seen since Thursday after failing to return from their snowboarding trip to the Eskdale Spur area of Mount Bogong . Inspector Ryan said both families had been notified on Monday of the snowboarders' death, but spoke again to the family of Mr Buckland this morning. He said both the wife and father were distraught, but relieved that the 33-year-old had been found. 'That extra day of waiting would have added a lot of pressure,' he said. He said failing weather conditions will hamper the rescue effort to bring Mr Buckland more than three kilometres down the mountain, admitting that it could take up to five  six hours. 'We can't use a helicopter because of the snow which is falling at about 1640 metres.' Both bodies will now be sent to the coroner in Melbourne. Somber scene: A journalist tweeted a photo of the police chopper carrying down the body of one snowboarder from where it was found on Mount Bogong . Inspector Dave Ryan from Wangaratta police said the man's body was dug out of the snow about 400 metres down a slope on Eskdale Spur . 'They have been in the area on a number of occasions and they've been caught out,' a Victoria Police officer said. 'While you may be a good snowboarder or skier, there are so many other things you have to worry about.' The search for the experienced snowboarders resumed at first light on Monday morning. Mrs Buckland said in a joint statement with Mr Kerr's parents, Marg and Phil Kerr, on Sunday that her husband knew the mountain 'like the back of his hand,' The Age reports. 'We are absolutely devastated by the news of Martie and Daniel's disappearance and hope with every passing minute that we are told they have been found safe,'  the statement said. The snowboarders had been friends since Year 7 at school. 'Our families want to stress how experienced and prepared Martie and Daniel were for this trip, keenly aware of both the risks and the unpredictable nature the outdoors offer,' the statement continued. 'Their local knowledge of Mt Bogong and the surrounds, combined with their equipment and experience just adds to the frustration of dealing with their disappearance.' A local expert said the men were in 'some of the most exciting and extreme and potentially dangerous terrain' in Victoria. 'Devastated': Martie Buckland, left, is one of the two snowboarders who died. His wife Sally Buckland, right, released a statement saying he knew Mount Bogong like the 'back of his hand' Rescue teams searched the back country for the two snowboarders, who failed to return from a trip to Mount Bogong in Victoria on Saturday . Police said the men signed a trip intention book on Wednesday which indicated their plans to stay at Michell Hut and then camp on Eskdale spur, before returning on Saturday. After making contact with family members on Thursday via mobile phone, the men had not been heard from since. A group of walkers found their abandoned tent containing sleeping bags and other equipment. 'It appears that no-one has been at the campsite since the last snow fall which was approximately 18 hours ago,' Victorian police said in a statement on Sunday morning. After making contact with family members on Thursday via mobile phone, the men were never heard from again. The volunteers participating in the search were made up of members of the Birkebeiner Nordic Ski Club, Bush Search and Rescue, State Emergency Services as well as a number of off duty ski patrollers from Falls Creek. Their campsite at Mitchell hut was found abandoned by a group of walkers at around 6am on Sunday, causing police to be concerned that the men had not been at the campsite since the last snow fall, 18 hours earlier . It's not the first of such incidents occurring at Mount Bogong, where extreme weather conditions led to a bush-walker requiring rescuing on Wednesday after he became stranded on the mountain's summit. A Search and rescue team found the man in a disoriented state but were not able to descend the mountain due to the 100k/h winds and the -10deg wind-chill. Instead, they were forced to put up two tents and wait for a break in the weather conditions. Search and Rescue Sergeant Vic Velthuis said the area was subject to extreme weather and sudden condition changes. 'There are a number of factors that hikers should consider before setting off into the high country. Planning, knowing your limitations and appropriate clothing being at the forefront,' she said. 'If you do get disorientated, stay calm and stay where you are in a sheltered dry spot and remember that it could take some time for rescuers to get to you.'","Martie Buckland, 33, from Yarra Junction was found on Tuesday morning .

"By . Daniel Mills . A disgusted mother claims she found a dead lizard in a tin of baby formula she had bought from a Coles store in Sydney. Artilina Castanares, 30, posted a picture of her find on the supermarket chain's Facebook page. She described how she had opened the lid and immediately noticed a foul odour. She told Fairfax Media she then shuffled the powder around and found an 'absolutely disgusting and unacceptable' dead animal lying inside. The tin of powder contains would could be a foreign lizard from Singapore, the place where the product was originally packaged . The tin of s26 original progress formula was bought from a Rouse Hill Coles supermarket in western Sydney, but it was manufactured and packaged in Singapore. Ms Castanares has pleaded with Coles to recall all the formula after being told by the product manufacturer, Careline, that it would take between six and eight weeks to investigate because the product would need to be sent back to Singapore. Sydney mother Artilina Castanares posted details of her gruesome discovery on Facebook . She was told she would be sent a replacement tin, but insisted she didn't care much for that because she would never buy the product again. Instead, Ms Castanares has turned to regular milk for feeding her baby. 'I called Careline and they advised would send me a replacement tin which I don't care for!' she wrote. 'They advised will need to investigate which will take about 6-8 weeks as need to send product overseas.' She said a turnaround of this length was 'unacceptable.' She has also notified the NSW Food Authority who are investigating further. Ms Castanares said she wants to highlight the risk that something like this could potentially be putting babies at risk of contracting diseases. Ms Castanares told Fairfax Media that other mothers had contacted her in complete shock after making her discovery public on a Sydney mothers’ group Facebook page, and on the product’s Facebook page. 'Some parents are freaking out over it. I’m getting private messages, emails, from mothers with the same batch number,' she wrote. A flood of comments were also shared publicly on Coles' Facebook page, with most users either sharing their horror and agreeing that an investigation was warranted. Ms Castanares was directed by a spokesperson to contact Careline's parent organisation - Aspen Australia.","Artilina Castanares, 30, was mortified when she found the dead lizard in baby formula .

"By . Daniel Mills . Paula Orbea has launched a petition to rid of offensive and sexist slogans by Wicked Campervans . An Australian woman has claimed a company which operates a fleet of hire vans for tourists is fueling a 'rape culture' after her 11-year-old daughter complained to her about a sexist remark plastered on the rear of one its vehicles. High school teacher and Sydney mum Paula Orbea, 44, has launched an online petition with change.org addressed to the founder of Wicked Campervans, John Webb, which asks him to  'Eliminate misogynistic and degrading slogans and imagery,' advertised on the side and rear of vehicles. She is lobbying Mr Webb to remove the slogans after her daughter sighted a Wicked Campervan with the phrase 'In every princess, there's a little slut who wants to try it just once' while out with her grandmother. She said it was the first thing her daughter told her after the outing, and couldn't believe the words that came out of her mouth. 'She came up to me and said 'mummy I just saw the most horrible thing' alluding to the 'princess' slogan. She said the company was 'perpetuating' a culture of rape and wanted to highlight her disapproval of slogans, she alleges, are indirectly playing a role in the sexual assault of women. 'I can't prove that these slogans will cause a male to do that, but it's immoral and its hurting people.' 'These perspectives are dangerous and now it's hit my family.' Promoted as 'budget' travel for tourists looking to road trip through parts of Australia, the hire vans offer travellers fully-functional eat, sleep and drive capabilities. The slogan that the 11-year-old daughter of Paula Orbea told her about after a trip she went on with her grandmother . A litany of complaints have been leveled with the Advertising Standards Bureau against Wicked Campervans for its use of advertising slogans . This is perhaps one of the less controversial slogans posted on the rear of a the Wicked Campervan . There are packages, specials and different sizes and varieties of vans available. Some have slogans while some come without. The company was approached for comment about a litany of complaints leveled against it via the Advertising Standards Bureau, but so far has not returned calls.

Daily Mail Australia counted some 60 complaints - either dismissed or upheld - against the company's use of slogans - including one which was dismissed that read: 'To all virgins: Thanks for nothing.'

Mrs Orbea's petition, which references Rolf Harris and links his recent guilty verdict for sexual misconduct with the slogans, is now at 11,300 signatures. She said she has emailed the terms of the petition to Mr Webb for his comment. The petition reads: 'This particular phrase promotes paedophilia and resonates very badly with everyone who thinks it's abhorrent to sexually assault a girl, especially by groomed males who think 'she wants it'. 'Slogans such as this ring too familiar to real life atrocities, such as the recent discovery of Rolf Harris's sexual assaults; enacting on a girl as young as eight.' She wrote that it was 'inconceivable' that Wicked Campers choose to not only write the misogynistic 'joke' but also publicise it through their moving, billboard vans. She ends the petition, which she said hopes brings the company to shame, by saying: 'This is not good. I'm calling it out.  Join me.

"By . Daniel Mills . Friends of Philip Vassallo gathered at the crash scene where they left flowers and hand written notes . A Sydney teenager who was tragically killed when his car collided with a ute in Sydney's western suburbs had a passion for cars, but loved none more than the one he died in - his refurbished Nissan Datsun. Friends of Phillip Vassallo, 17, say they are in disbelief over the tragic crash which claimed the life of the popular teenager on Friday night and left his passenger, friend Justin Galea, with severe injuries. Police said the Penrith road where the teenager died is a popular street racing circuit, but friends - including one who said he saw the tragedy unfold - said Philip was not speeding or taking part in the illegal activity before he died. A police spokeswoman wouldn't comment on whether speeding or street racing was a factor, but an earlier police statement confirmed Philip was killed when his car collided with a HiLux utilitiy both travelling east along Andrews Road. It is understood he was performing a U-Turn outside the place he worked before crashing. Police are investigating whether the vehicle he spent his money, heart and soul on, was  modified with a high-performance engine that would would have made it illegal for him as a provisional licence holder to drive. But despite this his friend Andrew Xiberras, who said witnessed one of his 'best mates pass away,'  took to Facebook to dispel any suggestion that Philip was speeding. 'Take it from the person who saw one of his best mates pass away. There was no street racing or drinking while we were out,' Adrian Xiberras wrote on Facebook. Another told media at the scene that Philip wouldn't put his life in jeopardy because he 'didn't want anything to happen' to the beloved Datsun he was driving. 'I never knew him to be a silly driver because he loved that car so much and didn't want anything to happen to it,' Angus Erhl said. Philip Vassallo, 17, spent the money he earned as a Mechanic on his Blue Datsun ute . Philip's own personal profile, and many other comments relating to the news of his death, have been flooded with love hearts and messages of disbelief. 'You were only seventeen, taken way to soon buddy. We remember you as that bubbly, kind hearted, outgoing boy. You will be dearly missed,' Lauren Xerri wrote. Those close to the 17-year-old also gathered at the scene of the accident on Saturday laying flowers and writing messages of love and support. A group of school friends sat silently at the scene, coming to terms with the tragic circumstances which claimed the life of their young friend and lover of all things motor vehicles just hours earlier.

The Sun Herald reported that Philip was a second year apprentice who spent the money he earned on his Datsun.  His friends posted a photo on social media of them holding up car parts along a blue Datsun ute. Police Inspector Mark Cook said the crash was a clear reminder to young motorists, of which 35 between 17 and 25 have died on NSW roads this year, to take care. 'They need to take their time, be rested, not travel too close and don't use a mobile phone or text or even drink and drive,' he told The Sun Herald.

"By . Aap . and Sally Lee . Palmer United Party leader Clive Palmer speaks about the Carbon Tax Repeal bill in the House of Representatives at Parliament House in Canberra on Monday . There was muted celebration in the chamber from the coalition on Monday. Australia's Palmer United Party leader Clive Palmer has vowed to give his party's backing for the repeal in the Senate after demanding amendments that ensure cost-savings are passed on to consumers. Only gas and electricity firms and bulk suppliers of synthetic greenhouse gases face penalties of up to 250 per cent to any savings they fail to pass on. They have 30 days to inform the consumer watchdog of how prices will be cut. Smaller importers of items such as refrigerators, cars and air conditioners will not be affected. The government said the changes will clarify who is covered and how business can pass on the savings. The bills are expected in the Senate on Tuesday, Environmental Minister Greg Hunt later added on Twitter. Mr Palmer (far left) listens to Environment Minister Greg Hunt (far right) in the House of Representatives on Monday . The carbon tax repeal is expected to be passed in the Senate on Tuesday, Environmental Minister Greg Hunt wrote on Twitter . The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Mr Hunt said Australians were 'waiting on their members and senators to honour their commitment' to repeal the carbon tax when he spoke at the House of Representatives in Canberra. 'The Australian people voted in the most express, clear and absolute way to ensure that they did not have and would not have a carbon tax and they would have a government which would take real measures to reduce emissions without a carbon tax,' he said. Mr Palmer said his party would vote to abolish the tax in the Senate. 'It's not the Labor way or the Liberal way, it's the right way that's important for Australia and the world,' he said during the debate at the lower house,' he said. During a speech in the lower house, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be 'remembered as an environmental vandal'. 'He is sleepwalking his way into a major climate policy disaster, a disaster for the Australian economy and for our environment, a disaster that guarantees that forever Tony Abbott will be remembered as an environmental vandal,' Mr Shorten said.

"By . Sally Lee . Identifying forced marriage may soon be part of the Australian school curriculum. As part of its development phase, three schools across the nation will be chosen to trial the program which is set to be launched by 2015. If the program is successful it will be implemented nationally in government, Catholic and independent schools. A curriculum on child brides for Australian schools is being developed and will be launched by 2015. Three Australian schools will trial the program before it is implemented nationally . The Australian Catholic Religious Against Trafficking in Humans has been granted more than $60,000 to fund the pilot program and is working with the federal Attorney-General's Department to develop the curriculum. Justice Minister Michael Keenan told the Daily Telegraph that the Australian Federal Police have investigated more than 450 allegations of trafficking and slavery-related offences, with more than 230 victims identified. A spokeswoman for the Attorney-General's Department told Daily Mail Australia that ACRATH will engage with students and staff - including school councils, parents associations, teachers, counselling staff - at three pilot schools in at least three states. The initial stage of the project will involve 'workshops with pilot groups of teachers to develop materials pitched at junior secondary students, senior secondary students and parents'. 'In the longer-term, these materials are expected to be made available to secondary school students in government and independent schools nation-wide,' the spokeswoman said. 'ACRATH will also facilitate broader teacher training sessions on forced marriage.' The spokeswoman said the program aims to raise awareness about child brides being forced into matrimony in Australia. 'The purpose of the project is to improve the provision of education, awareness-raising and advice to people at risk of forced marriage, to support the prevention and detection of this crime and promote early intervention.' Funding of $350,000 has also been granted to Anti-Slavery Australia which is said to go towards creating website, providing legal advice and an assistance service for potential child brides. Earlier this year, the NSW father of 12-year-old girl was charged with procuring a child under 14 for unlawful sexual activities and being an accessory before the fact to sexual intercourse with a person under 14. Police said the young girl's father, 61, facilitated the sexual assault of his daughter by actively arranging the unlawful marriage in NSW in January 2014 by allowing the pair to swap phone numbers and meet three times in the family home before an Islamic ceremony took place in the living room. The father allegedly organised his daughter's marriage to the Lebanese immigrant because he wanted to stop her from 'committing a life of sin'. The 26-year-old Lebanese man, who has had his student visa cancelled and been placed in immigration detention, was charged with 25 counts of sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 14 years. The case is currently before the court.","A curriculum about child brides is being developed for Australian schools .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . John Mead, 76, a private school teacher who molested schoolboys during the 1970s, has been jailed for three years . A former grammar school teacher who organised school trips to youth hostels so he could abuse young boys in his care has been jailed for three years. John Mead, was a physics and maths master at fee-paying Queen Elizabeth Grammar School in Blackburn, Lancashire, when he attacked three boys, all aged under 13, during the 1970s. When the allegations came to light he claimed he was the victim of a 'post Jimmy Savile witchhunt' saying that the complaints were made up because historic sex abuse cases were in the news. But at Preston Crown Court Judge Christopher Cornwall dismissed his claims and jailed him for three years. The court heard that he had a ‘sinister motive’ for organising the excursions to places including the Lake District for young boys. Once there he played games like ‘monsters in the dark’ indecently assaulting youngsters by pulling them on to a bed and groping them. Mead, a 76-year-old father-of-three, of Sabden, Lancashire, was convicted of four counts of indecently assaulting three pupils at the Blackburn school during the 1970s after a trial. During one of the trips, the jury heard how he got into bed with a pupil who was sleeping in a single room before reaching over him and touching him inappropriately. Another was assaulted by Mead during a game of ‘monsters in the dark’ in which his teacher grabbed him, pulled him onto the bed and groped him. And a third complainant was indecently assaulted on multiple occasions when Mead got into the shower with him during the trips. At court Mead tried to argue that he should not be jailed because he suffers from myalgic encephalomyelitis, which is also known as chronic fatigue syndrome. Mead had maintained he was innocent throughout the entire five day trial, claiming the victims’ accusations were ‘fantasy’. Judge Cornwall said: 'You suggest that you have been cleverly set up by unscrupulous pupils. I utterly and reservedly reject what you say.' The court heard that one victim filed a complaint to police in 2000 but no action was taken. In 2006 another victim reported the abuse to police and even penned a letter to QEGS yet no action was taken by police. In 2013 the previous complaint of the boy was renewed and the matter was investigated by police. Officers went to the Lancashire school and discovered the separate allegation through the letter that had been written seven years prior. Mead organised excursions for young boys while teaching, before playing games such as 'monsters in the dark' with them, where he pulled them on to a bed before assaulting them . It was said to have helped provide 'compelling support' of the allegations being made. The third victim, who had since moved abroad saw a news report in 2013 that a former QEGS teacher had been arrested. Despite Mead not being named or charged, the victim knew 'instinctively' that it related to Mead and contacted the police. Judge Cornwall added: 'This is not the Jimmy Savile effect. Jimmy Savile died in October 2011, it was only after his death that allegations began to be made about the sexual misconduct in his lifetime.' He added that the victims of Mead had made complaints well before the Savile case came to light - adding that one had complained nine years prior to Savile’s death. Judge Cornwall added: 'You believed it had been buried without trace. It was and remains beyond comprehension to you. 'Your behaviour 40 years ago came back to haunt you after such an elapsing time. Justice comes limping along. The crime has been committed, the perpetrator appears to have got away with it. 'Time passes, seemingly the matter is forgotten but it hasn’t been forgotten. 'It hasn’t been forgotten for one powerful reason, the victims have to live on a day to day basis with the consequences of what you did.' He added that the victims had feared that they wouldn’t be believed and people would not be interested. Mead, was a physics and maths master at fee-paying Queen Elizabeth Grammar School in Blackburn, Lancashire (pictured) when he attacked three boys all aged under 13 . He said they had felt 'disempowered' that nothing had been said or done at the time but that it was common for victims to respond in that way. Judge Cornwall said: 'Three boys complained. That is three boys too many.' He added that he had admiration for the victims in coming forward but said that it would not diminish the 'enduring pain suffered by the three'. As well as being jailed he was also placed on the sex offenders register for life and was made the subject of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order. Andrew Nuttall, in mitigation, said that Mead had been of good character. He said: 'There is a serious breach of trust perpetrated by the defendant on young boys in his care. 'All the good work that he has ever done will be forgotten because of these offences. It is a fact he has made a positive and has had a positive effect on many people, not just in the school but in his life. 'He understands that will be forgotten, for the rest of his life, the 76 years will be as if they counted for nothing at all. He will now have to pay the price.' DS Julie Cross from East Division Public Protection Unit said: 'I am pleased with the custodial sentence handed down to Mead today and I hope it brings some closure to his victims so that they start to move on with their lives. 'We are committed to investigating all allegations of this nature thoroughly and sensitively. Anyone who has been the victim of similar offences can contact us and be confident that we will listen to them and investigate in a similarly measured way.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Dead: Sex offender Charles Mozdir, 32, had been on the run for two years prior to being shot dead following a dramatic shoot-out in New York City on Monday afternoon . A fugitive pedophile who was gunned down in New York City in daylight was turned in by his boss who recognised him from a television crime show. Charles Mozdir, 32, had been on the run since 2012, but thanks to the tip, authorities tracked him to a . Greenwich Village smoke shop, sources told the New York Daily News. Steve Zhik, who owns Smoking Culture on W. Fourth St., alerted cops that Mozdir was working as a salesman at his store after seeing an episode on CNN’s new series The Hunt about the wanted man last week, sources said. But when NYPD Det. Mario Muniz and two U.S. Marshals arrived on Monday afternoon, Mozdir opened fired, wounding the three lawmen. The sex offender who had been on the run for two years after skipping bail for molesting two boys under the age of seven in California was shot and killed in the dramatic shoot-out with federal marshals and police. Zhik, 33, could not be reached for comment. A woman Mozdir was seeing also saw the show and was so disgusted she decided to give him up. She called authorities, and gave them his cellphone number -police pinged it to confirm he was in the area. Mozdir had been the target of a nationwide manhunt after a family friend accused him of molesting her son while the child lay sick in bed in Coronado, California, in June 2012. It was the second child molestation case against him, investigators said. Child porn and bestiality videos were also allegedly found in his home. But instead of facing charges he fled. His car was found abandoned in Darien, Georgia, later that June. It turned out he had been hiding in Key West, Florida, and just months ago moved to Manhattan. An injured U.S. Marshall sits on the sidewalk outside a West Village, NYC smoke shop after being shot on Monday by pedophile Charles Mozdir . Mozdir is seen being carried out of the shop on a stretcher on Monday after he pulled a gun on officers. He died in hospital . Cops: Heavily armed police investigate the shooting, which left Charles Mozdir dead and one of the officers shot three times. That officer, Mario Muniz, was celebrated Tuesday by both his mother and the relieved mother of the then 7-year-old boy Mozdir molested . The shooting happened just after 1pm . in the West Village, not far from New York University, when a fugitive . apprehension task force tried to serve a warrant at a shop called . Smoking Culture NYC. The . store sells items including bongs, cigarettes and cigars and it is . believed that Mozdir was behind the counter and working when the . authorities showed up. Two . U.S. Marshals and an NYPD detective were wounded in the shooting. The . officers were part of the special task force investigating Mozdir. They . entered the shop to serve him with a warrant when he pulled a revolver . on them. He also had 20 spare rounds of ammunition in his pockets. Sources say one of the marshals was shot in the leg and the NYPD detective was shot three times. Emergency workers transported all four victims to Bellevue Hospital, where the suspect died. One of the marshals was shot in the leg and the NYPD detective - named as NYPD Detective Mario Muniz, 45, - was shot three times. The detective has 20 years service with the NYPD and had recently been promoted, Bratton said. Mayor Bill De Blasio said on Monday that the officers were recovering and 'in good spirits'. He added that the detective's life had been saved by his bullet-proof vest. Jerry DeWitt, who lives on the West Village street where the shooting took place, arrived minutes after the shoot-out and described the scene as 'pure chaos'.

Onlookers: People look on at the crime scene where two U.S. Marshals and one NYPD detective tried to apprehend a suspect who was shot and killed . 'You expect anything to happen here but not this,' he told MailOnline. Another . resident, Christine Rucci, who lives opposite the shop, told MailOnline . that at first she heard a loud noise and when she looked out her front . window she noticed the shop was surrounded by a number of unmarked cars . and there was a helicopter overhead. She . estimated that there are four elementary schools nearby. 'What is . really upsetting is that he was a sex offender and that he had a gun,' she told MailOnline. Ms Rucci, who has lived in the area for 25 years said it used to feel very safe - especially when Michael Bloomberg's daughter lived in the same building - but that there had also been a shooting on Mother's Day on the same street. A $1 million bench warrant was issued for Mozdir's arrest on June 15, 2012, after he skipped an arraignment in San Diego Superior Court on child sexual assault charges, according to Steve Walker, a spokesman for the San Diego County district attorney. He had posted $250,000 bail. Mozdir had been wanted on five counts of lewd acts upon a child younger than 14 and a charge of attempting to keep a witness from prosecuting a crime, according to the criminal complaint. It is believed that Mozdir (pictured left) was working behind the counter of Smoking Culture NYC (right) when the fugitive apprehension task force showed up and he pulled his gun on them . Media: The media set up at the scene of the shooting . The one-time wedding photographer has . been accused by a family friend of molesting her seven-year-old son . while babysitting him in Coronado, near . San Diego. After he . disappeared, investigators had found sickening images of child . pornography and bestiality on his cell phone and computers at his home. He was considered armed and dangerous . since a roommate told police that Mozdir, armed with two guns, . threatened to kill himself and a victim's father. Law enforcement had hunted him from California to Mexico to the deep south and finally to New York City. According to CNN, after the episode of The Hunt featuring Mozdir aired . authorities received a tip that he was working at a restaurant in . Manhattan, but the information didn't pan out. After CNN . re-aired Mozdir's episode on Sunday night, another tip came in that . resulted in an address for Mozdir, according to John Walsh. Mayor Bill de Blasio says the three are . stable and that, 'We pray everything we are hearing is true and that . these officers will be OK in the long run.' Smoke shop: The shooting happened just after 1 p.m. in the West Village not far from New York University when a fugitive apprehension task force tried to serve a warrant outside a smoke shop just north of a busy subway station . Scene: A cop and two US marshalls were shot Monday in the West Village . Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said the fugitive task force seeks absconders from other states. Coronado police said in a statement: . ‘Our thoughts and prayers go out to the brave officers assigned to the . U.S. Marshall’s fugitive task force who were wounded in a shootout with . suspected child molester Charles Mozdir in New York this morning. 'Mozdir . was wanted in a 2012 child molest case in Coronado. He failed to appear . in court on the charges and a $1 million warrant was issued.’ Mozdir allegedly molested a young boy . whose parents were friends of his while he served as a babysitter in . June 2012, reported CNN in The Hunt. He molested the boy while his mother slept in bed next to him, his father told CNN. Child pornography was recovered at Mozdir's home, U.S. Marshals Service deputy Brian Grimes told CNN. Mozdir was later arrested and made bail, he then skipped an arraignment and went on the run. Mozdir allegedly molested a second boy in a similar incident, the channel said. Mozdir's scent was found by a hound on a highway and his car was recovered in Georgia, but investigators were unable to find the alleged child molester, CNN said. In 2013 , authorities said ‘Mozdir made threats to take his own life and threats have been made to the victim’s family.’ The violence recalls a deadly shootout that left a gunman and two auxiliary New York City police officers dead on another Greenwich Village street in March 2007. That gunman, David Garvin, killed a bartender, according to police, and then turned crowded streets packed with storied taverns into a shooting gallery. Unarmed volunteer officers Eugene Marshalik and Nicholas Todd Pekearo were killed.

"By . Darren Boyle . A rare Spitfire that saw action in World War Two and then starred in two blockbuster war films is up for sale for £1.5 million. The 1943 Vickers Supermarine Spitfire IXb has been hidden away in a barn in Texas for the past 40 years and is being put up for sale by its current owner - Wilson 'Connie' Edwards, a stunt pilot from the film Battle of Britain. Mr Edwards has owned the plane when he received it as down payment for his role in the 1969 classic film. Wilson 'Connie' Edwards, right is selling his Spitfire which featured in the movies Battle of Britain and the The Longest Day while seeing action during World War Two before serving with the Belgian and Dutch air forces . Mr Edwards, right, was a stunt pilot during the filming of the two movies and kept the aircraft as payment . The aircraft last flew in the 1970s but is in remarkable condition for its age and could be returned to the air . The fighter also featured in the 1962 film The Longest Day about the D-day landings. Now in his 80s Mr Edwards has decided to sell the plane with Platinum Fighters, a worldwide company which specialises in the sale of 'war-birds.' Although it last took to the air in 1973, it had been stored in dry conditions and suffered little rust or corrosion. And once fully restored and made airworthy it could be worth over £4 million. John Rayner, co-owner of Platinum Fighters, said this barn find was very rare. He said: 'I think it is very rare. To find a Spitfire that has served in World War Two, served in the Dutch Air Force, the Belgian Air Force, and starred in two films - I don't think you will find an aeroplane with much more history than that. 'It is the original plane, and has not been refurbished or restored. It even has the same horse hair under the seats that the fighter pilots would have sat on in World War Two. 'This is unlike other planes that you may find these days that have been restored, or never seen action. I think it is worth much more as an historical artifact than something that has been cobbled together with spare parts.' Mr Edwards flew the Spitfire during many of the battle scenes in the Battle of Britain, pictured . The aircraft was built in 1943 and was deployed to 129 Squadron based in Hornchurch, Essex . Describing the plane's rich history, he added: 'It was built in 1943 by Vickers Armstrongs Ltd and went into action in the summer of 43. 'It served with 129, 229, and 622 squadrons with the RAF. It was then sold to the Dutch Air Force and ended up in the Dutch Indies conflict, before serving with the Belgian Air Force. 'After starring in two films, The Longest Day, and The Battle of Britain, it ended up in a barn in Texas in the 1960s. 'It was on the ranch of one of the stunt pilots from The Battle of Britain, who took it as down payment for his role in the film. 'He has a landing strip on his ranch and he flew the plane for a couple of years. But since then it's been in his barn, so for 40-odd years.' The plane was built in the summer of 1943 at the Castle Bromwich Aircraft Factory. The plane, which was called MH415, was delivered to No.129 Squadron at Hornchurch in August 1943, where it was issued with the squadron codes DV*G. The plane was sent into action from day one flown regularly by Squadron Leader Henri Gonay, a Belgian who fled when his country was overrun in the Nazi's Blitzkrieg. The aircraft's cockpit is in remarkable condition despite being 70 years old and not been used for 40 years . Two months later MH415 was transferred to No.222 Squadron where it continued to take part in the fighting, and was moved around the country several times, including being part of the fleet at No. 126 Squadron at Bradwell Bay, Essex. In August 1946 MH415, along with several other Spitfires, were sold to the Dutch Government where it was based in Java, Indonesia, before being sold on to the Belgian Air Force in April 1953. It was sold to Belgian company COGEA, who worked with NATO forces, in June 1956. In 1961 it was leased for film use in The Longest Day, which was filmed on location in France. The aircraft was painted in camouflage and flown with 340(Ile de France) squadron codes GW-B. MH415 had by this time been purchased from COGEA by Rousseau Aviation of Dinhard in France, where the aircraft was in open storage for some years. Between 1966 and 1968 the plane was used in filming for the Battle of Britain, filming scenes in Spain, France, and England. After the cameras stopped rolling it was shipped to Houston, Texas and last flew in 1973. The aircraft last flew in 1973 and has its Operational Record Book from the RAF detailing its exact history . Fully restored, and in flying condition the aircraft could be worth as much as £4 million to the right buyer . Mr Rayner said they know so much about the history of the plane because the current owner looked into it. He said: 'The owner of the plane, a gentleman in his 80s, hired an historian to look into the plane's history. 'We have the Operational Record Book (ORB) from the RAF which tells you all about the planes history, where it served and where it was based and what operations it was involved in. 'The historian went to London to look at the record books between 1943 and 1944 to find out more about the plane's history. So we now know what operations the plane went on, who was piloting it, where it flew, if it was shot at, among other things. 'It's amazing to think that these sort of records still exist. People also knew about the plane and spent their time researching, and there are a lot of plane enthusiasts out there who have written about it on the internet. 'So we have an overwhelming amount of information about it.' The plane was listed on Platinum Fighter's website and Facebook page on Wednesday and Mr Rayner said it has had an amazing response. He said: 'We put the listing on Facebook 48 hours ago and we've had thousands of likes or shares on Facebook since it went up. 'At one point we had 348 people visiting our website from 17 countries at the same time. It's amazing to think it's had so much attention already. I think this is the most interest we have ever had.' He added: 'It may have been in the barn for 40 years but it was in good dry conditions, so there is no rusting, or corrosion. But obviously, it was in the barn so when we looked at it, it had an inch thick of dust and cobwebs on it, but that was all. 'The plane is worth £1.5 million but I think if someone wanted to restore it, restore the propellors, the engine and things like that I think it would be worth £4 million. 'With the amount of history it has - serving with the RAF, being in the Battle of Britain film, and the amount of interest we have and the love people have for Spitfires - I could see it making its way back to the UK.'","World War Two fighter starred in two major movies in the 1960s .

"By . David Gardner . More has been spent on rebuilding Afghanistan than the entire cost of lifting Europe from the ruins of the Second World War, according to a US government report published yesterday. Corruption and waste have pushed the price of reconstructing Afghanistan to more than £62billion – and exceeding the amount the Allies provided under the Marshall Plan. Named after US Secretary of State George Marshall, the 1948 scheme provided $13billion – the equivalent of £61billion today – over four years and helped rebuild 16 European countries. Corruption and waste: Endemic corruption and waste have been blamed for the the country's international aid bill, which has exceeded £61.7billion ($104billion) in the 13 years since the Taliban were overthrown . Yet despite the money spent in . Afghanistan, it remains mired in a political crisis and is likely to . remain dependent on donors for years to come even as British and other . foreign troops prepare to withdraw at the end of the year. Development . projects meant to provide Afghans with a sound structural foundation . have cost American taxpayers £61.5billion and Britain a further . £890million. But in a report . presented to US Congress this week, John Sopko, the Special Inspector . General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, says most of the projects he . audited were hampered by ‘poor planning, shoddy construction, mechanical . failures and inadequate oversight’. Huge clean up: By contrast, the Marshall Plan - America's initiative to aid Europe following the end of the Second World War - amounted to about £60.5billion ($102billion) at today's prices . Out of time: In five months, the mission changes from a military operation to a relatively small 'advise and assist' initiative - and most of the remaining allied soldiers will leave . He . calculates that ‘by the end of 2014, the United States will have . committed more funds to reconstruct Afghanistan, in inflation-adjusted . terms, than it spent on 16 European countries after the Second World War . under the Marshall Plan’. The . 259-page report includes a photograph of a pile of school chairs in . Nangarbar province that have been stripped to the metal so the wood . could be burned for heat. Billions were spent on ill-fated agricultural . and infrastructure projects that failed to take into account . Afghanistan’s terrain and culture, said the report. expensive: Almost two-thirds of America's investment in Afghanistan's reconstruction has been funneled into building its military and police forces . Building: The Afghan government approved £4.5billion ($7.6billion) in spending this fiscal year, despite anticipated revenue of £1.6billion ($2.8billion) More . than £2billion was spent ‘improving’ the Afghan police yet tens of . thousands of ‘ghost’ officers collect their pay but never turn up.

"By . Associated Press . Jury selection has begun today in the corruption trial of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell and his wife in Richmond. Bob and Maureen McDonnell have pleaded not guilty to charges in a 14-count indictment with accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from the CEO of a dietary supplements company in exchange for helping promote his products. Their trial in federal court began at 10am on Monday and is expected to last at least five weeks. The McDonnells arrived separately at the courthouse this morning, the former governor flanked by his attorney Henry W. Asbill. His wife walked into court hand-in-hand with their daughters Rachel McDonnell and Cailin Young. Scroll down for video . Former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell, center, with his attorney Henry W.

Ex- Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell, center, is flanked by daughters Rachel McDonnell, left, and Cailin Young, right, at the courthouse today. She and her husband are charged with accepting $165,000 in gifts from the CEO of a dietary supplements company in exchange for helping promote his products . Amid a media scrum, the couple hugged each other in the courthouse hallway and greeted those who had turned out to support them. NBC reporter Julie Carey tweeted that when the ex-governor arrived at the courthouse he made a joke to her, asking: 'Is something going on here?' Before the trial’s opening, federal prosecutors filed a list of 61 potential witnesses, including Maureen McDonnell and the couple’s three children, Sean, Rachel and Bobby. During jury selection, Judge James R. Spencer read a list of possible defense witnesses, including Bob McDonnell, former Virginia Governor L. Douglas Wilder, former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, and Virginia House Speaker William J. Howell. Maureen McDonnell’s manicurist may even be called to give evidence, according to The Washington Post. This morning, jurors were asked to fill out a questionnaire and were asked if they knew either of the defendants or witnesses involved in the trial. One potential juror revealed to the judge that he had attended political events with the disgraced governor, according to NBC, but was allowed to remain when he said that this would not cloud his judgement. McDonnell was a rising national star in the Republican party and was considered a possible Mitt Romney running mate in 2012 before the federal investigation ruined his political future. Before being indicted 10 days after leaving office in January, McDonnell apologized for what he described as bad judgment and said he repaid about $120,000 in gifts and loans, but he denied breaking any laws. He and his lawyers have argued that prosecutors are trying to criminalize routine and long-accepted political courtesies, like hosting receptions and arranging meetings, that fall short of more tangible rewards historically associated with bribery. Prosecutors have countered that the McDonnells' willingness to help former Star Scientific Inc. CEO Jonnie Williams on 'an as-needed basis' and Williams' expectation of something in return, whether he received it or not, is enough to support a conviction. If the jury agrees, the McDonnells could face decades in prison. Williams is expected to testify under immunity as the prosecution's star witness. According to the indictment, Williams . lavished the McDonnells with designer clothes, golf outings, vacations . and large loans while seeking government help promoting his company's . products and securing grants for research studies. No government grants were awarded, but the indictment says the . McDonnells hosted or appeared at numerous events to further the . company's interests.

She was rushed to the vet by owner Kayleigh Thomas, from Newton Abbot, Devon . Gypsy is now back at home in Newton Abbot, Devon, with Ms Thomas, who believes the shot was so precise that her pet must have been blasted from close range.

She was quite poorly but she’s getting better now. 'The children were very upset. I just can’t believe anyone would do such a thing to a poor little creature. I was so disgusted that I was in tears.' Ms Thomas has reported the incident to the RSPCA and is desperate to see the yobs responsible caught. She added: 'It could even be someone who knows Gypsy because they must have beckoned her over to be able to grab her and hold her while the other one fired the air rifle.

"By . Nick Enoch . Seth 'the Bangor Hammer' Jones, Aaron 'The Knuckle Butcher' Gaughan, Jason 'The Machine Gun' Young, James 'Gypsy Boy' McCrory... The names say it all: these are not men you'd want to mess with - at least not when it comes to fighting (although one of them is also a solicitor - more of which later). They are all bare-knuckle boxers, who punch, swipe, sweat and grunt their way through this brutish British 'sport' in a makeshift hay bale ring - egged on by a crowd of (mostly) blokes swigging beer and recording the proceedings on their mobile phones. Victory is generally defined as seeing your opponent lying bloodied and unconscious on the ground. Seth 'the Bangor Hammer' Jones (right) and Aaron 'The Knuckle Butcher' Gaughan slug it out in a scene from Vice's new documentary Bare Knuckle . Seth Jones is a 46-year-old drug smuggler-turned-solicitor who fights men half his age in Colwyn Bay, North Wales . This legal but ungoverned sport has enjoyed a surge in popularity in recent years thanks to the work of promoter Andy Topliffe (left), whose B-Bad promotions outfit, based in Leicester, aims to bring legitimacy to this forgotten fisticuffs with a slew of crowd-pleasing bouts. Pictured right is the film's presenter Clive Martin . His dream is to orchestrate the first UK vs US bare knuckle fight for more than 150 years, between America's Jason 'The Machine Gun' Young (left) and James McCrory (right) from Britain . The bruisers all appear in a new documentary, Bare Knuckle, in which the film-makers were given unique access to . Britain’s bare-knuckle boxing scene and the men who have come to define . it. The film, the latest in Vice's award-winning Rule Britannia series, follows a community of white and blue collar . working men – from labourers to IT technicians – who are . all obsessed by the anarchic and archaic glory of bare-knuckle boxing.

James 'Gypsy Boy' McCrory is a charming Geordie traveller - and self-confessed 'softie' - whose match preparations consist almost solely of drinking up to 25 pints of Guinness a day to meet his required match weight . A punter films the Seth Jones - Aaron Gaughan fight on his phone. The makeshift combat arena seen here is bordered with hay bales . The violent combat was once confined to back-street drinking dens and gambled on by gangland villains. Fights could last for more than two hours - with rounds lasting as long as the opponents were able to stay on their feet. It was often a fight to the death, with no rules - and definitely no first aid. But the practice is enjoying something of a renaissance - and it's completely legal. Bare-knuckle boxing was never outlawed but with the emergence of the Queensberry Rules and gloved bouts in 1867 it shrank into the back streets to be taken over by villains. The combatants are different from the old days, with builders, property developers and spray-painters getting involved. Fans say bare-knuckle fighting is no different to any other martial art, although it comes under the same 'dangerous exhibition' statute as knife-throwing. His dream is to orchestrate the first UK vs US bare knuckle . fight for more than 150 years, between Young, from America, and McCrory.

Topliffe had hoped for the fight to take place this evening at Leicester Road Stadium in Hinckley, Leicestershire - but it was postponed at the last minute due to 'planning and licensing issues'. If the Young vs McCrory fight does eventually go ahead, it will be the biggest event . the scene has known since it went underground in the 19th century. Vice also explores the mental . strain of a life dedicated to fighting when Martin meets James Lambert, . an undefeated fighter turned life-coach and self-styled 'Mr Happy'. Lambert is now so disgusted by his violent past that he refuses even to ball his . fists anymore.

Around 1,000 punters had hoped to attend the groundbreaking UK v US bare-knuckle fight at Leicester Road stadium tonight. However, following a meeting between the organisers, venue owners, police and council, it has now been delayed. The stadium's owners cited 'planning and licensing issues', according to a Leicestershire Police spokesman, who added that bare-knuckle fighting was a 'grey area'. Chris Thompson, from the stadium, said the venue's licence only covered boxing and wrestling events, according to the BBC. He said there was a chance the fight may have been categorised under the rules of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) - involving hitting, kicking and grappling - and this would require a different licence. A spokesman for the British Boxing Board of Control told the BBC: 'This event is not licensed or regulated... and we do not approve such events.'

"By . Nick Enoch . Down in the depths, a diver swims among cages of netting that look like underwater Towers of Pisa. Sitting inside the many 'floors' of each one are giant Japanese scallops that are keeping the delicate ecosystem in balance. The molluscs form part of an experimental aquatic farm devised by Dr Stephen Cross from the University of Victoria in British Columbia, Canada. Aware of the pollution in the farmed fish industry, he has come up with a 'polyculture' system whereby only one species in the chain needs to be directly fed by him - as can be seen in this fascinating set of pictures from National Geographic magazine. Nature's own water filters, giant Japanese scallops thrive on fish waste at an experimental farm off Canada's Vancouver Island. The farm also uses sugar kelp to consume excretions from nearby pens of native sablefish . In the Gulf of California lie four shrimp cages owned by Gustavo Valdez. Each one can yield anything up to 13 tons of shrimp every four to six months . Off the coast of Vancouver Island, he only feeds sablefish (also known as black cod), which are native to the Pacific Ocean. Nearby hang the baskets containing scallops, along with oysters, mussels and cockles - which feed on the fish's organic excretions. Beyond them lie lines of sugar kelp - a brown algae used in sushi, and also as a component of bioethanol fuel. These plants mop up the rest of the waste by converting nitrates and phosphorus into plant tissue. Diamond-shaped fish cages rise from the water for cleaning at Open Blue, the world's largest open-ocean fish farm, eight miles off the Caribbean coast of Panama . Tilapia pens in Laguna de Bay, the largest lake in the Philippines, are choked by an algal bloom they helped create. The overstocked lake produces a large quantity of farmed fish, but excess nutrients trigger blooms that use up oxygen and kill fish . The whole system acts like a giant water filter - and most importantly, it is a commercially viable proposition, as it can make extra food for fish farms. It's self-sustainable and good for the environment. And for the fishing industry, that can only be a good thing. Whereas fisheries deal with catching, processing and selling fish, aquaculture concerns the cultivation of aquatic animals and aquatic plants - and is also known as 'fish farming'. There have been concerns over the years about fish in fisheries being treated with antibiotics, for example, as well as disease from farmed fish being passed on to wild fish. And then there is the threat of coastal pollution via waste and pesticides. From Mexico to the Philippines and Scotland, large-scale fish farms are an expanding global business. A diver nets a ten-pound cobia (also known as black salmon) for sampling before harvest in one of Open Blue's dozen offshore pens. Able to hold hundreds of thousands of fish, but less densely stocked and better flushed than nearshore salmon pens, they produce little pollution . World fisheries produced 158million tonnes in 2012, of which almost 70million came from aquaculture. Gustavo Valdez is another who has embraced its principles. In the Gulf of California, he can be found inspecting his four shrimp cages - each of which yield anything up to 13 tons of shrimp every four to six months. His enterprise is a far cry from traditional shrimp farms - where the hatcheries can give rise to disease - but it does rely on subsidies from the Mexican government. Meanwhile, eight miles off the coast of Panama, another diver nets a 10lb cobia for sampling before harvest. A graphic showing the amount of feed required to gain 1lb of body mass; and right, the June issue of National Geographic magazine . The fish, also known as the black salmon, is in one of 12-odd offshore pens belonging to Open Blue - the largest offshore fish farm in the world. Choc full with healthy omega-3 fatty acids, the cobia is a highly valued seafood. But unlike holding areas nearer the shore (often in coves), these pens, which can hold 40,000 fish, produce hardly any pollution, and are not densely stocked. Brian O'Hanlon, president of Open Blue, has housed his salmon cages in deep water so that they are continually cleansed by the current - and he hasn't yet needed to give them antibiotics. 'This is the future', he told National Geographic. 'This is what the industry is going to have to do in order to keep growing, especially in the tropics.' The images are from the June issue of National Geographic magazine.","Giant natural water filter off Vancouver Island, Canada, devised to help reduce pollution on fish farms .

Foot impressions taken from two crime scenes in Livingston, West Lothian, were sent to the company’s German headquarters as they believe the suspect was wearing their brand. The firm identified the footwear as £55 Adidas Adipure Essence which has given investigators a vital clue in tracing the predator who struck twice in just over a month.

Foot impressions taken from two crime scenes in Livingston, West Lothian, were sent to the company's German headquarters as they believe the suspect was wearing their brand . Now officers are tracing all shoppers who bought the trainers by credit or debit card in or around Livingston town centre. Detective Superintendent Pat Campbell, who is leading the inquiry, said: 'We recovered foot impressions from the crime scenes and reached out to Adidas for help identifying the model of the trainers. 'We were informed they were specialist tennis shoes and we’re now working to determine how many were imported into the UK and where they were sold. 'We are asking the public to think of neighbours, friends or relatives who match the description and have these distinctive trainers. 'Maybe they have been acting strangely in the last few months. The firm identified the footwear as £55 Adidas Adipure Essence which has given investigators a vital clue in tracing the predator who struck twice in just over a month . 'Perhaps they are shift workers and would be out early in the morning.' In the first incident, a 21-year-old woman was attacked in the garden of her home in Scott Brae at about 5.20am on April 8. The man had been hiding in the bushes but she managed to fight him off and he ran into nearby woods. Five weeks later in the early hours of May 7, a second woman was indecently assaulted by the same man when he broke into her flat. The 27-year-old was left traumatised when she woke to find him in her bedroom. Police believe the man may have been injured during the first attack when the woman fought back and have said he may have a scratch on his back and an injury to his little finger. Last month, an e-fit image of the man police wish to trace in connection with the attacks was released. The suspect is described as white, around 5ft 8in to 5ft 10in with dark hair, wearing a grey hooded top and the Adidas trainers. Det Supt Campbell said: 'The man in the e-fit could be the suspect or someone totally unconnected. 'We still want to trace this person to eliminate him from the inquiry.' Police are continuing to mount high-visibility patrols across Livingston, particularly in the Eliburn and Ladywell areas. Anyone with information is asked to call Police Scotland on 101 or the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.","Foot impressions taken from crime .

"By . Nick Enoch . Mourners said goodbye to a 16-month-old toddler, who died when her dad accidentally reversed over her, by dressing up in animal onesies for her funeral. Angel Pitts, who had just learned to walk, died from serious injuries in hospital after she was struck by the reversing car on June 14 outside her family's home in Leeds, West Yorkshire. The young girl’s devastated parents called for all those attending the service to wear animal onesies and bright colours in her memory. Mourners wore onesies today as they said goodbye to toddler Angel Pitts, who died when her father, Scott (pictured left), accidentally reversed over her. Angel's mother is also pictured (wearing the grey onesie) Angel Pitts, who had just learned to walk, died from serious injuries in hospital after she was struck by the reversing car on June 14 outside her family's home in Leeds, West Yorkshire . The young girl's devastated parents, Megin and Scott Pitts (pictured above), called for all those attending the service to wear animal onesies and bright colours in her memory . As the procession of 50 or so family and friends began the slow, silent, walk from the cul-de-sac where Angel lived and played, her parents followed directly with the rest of the crowd staying a respectful distance behind . Their request was taken up in earnest with bright pinks, yellows, and oranges replacing the customary funeral black. Angel’s parents, Megin and Scott - donning their onesies - followed her horse-drawn hearse on foot along a three-mile walk to the Cottingley Hall crematorium from their house. Other animals making an appearance among the mourners were a tiger, an elephant and a gorilla. The name ‘Angel’ was picked out in pink and white flowers on both sides of the hearse. The small white coffin could clearly be seen through the glass sides, along with a picture of Angel.

The funeral party followed Angel's horse-drawn hearse on foot along a three-mile walk to the Cottingley Hall crematorium from their house . Angel suffered fatal injuries in the incident outside her home in a quiet cul-de-sac (pictured) in Leeds . Despite desperate attempts by neighbours and paramedics to save her, she was confirmed dead a short time after arriving at Leeds General Infirmary . On the ground, outside each home in Angel’s street, lay a small bouquet of flowers. Having grown to around 100, the funeral party was too large to fit in the small chapel and many stood outside for the half-hour service, before joining the main party in the walk to Angel’s final resting place. Angel’s parents had earlier released a statement where they said: 'Angel Jackie-Jean Pitts died aged 16 months. 'This was a tragic accident that her father did not see coming and could have never imagined it happening. 'We would like to thank everyone for their support at this tragic time. 'Any donations are welcome, all to go to the Sweet Dreams charity that provides memory boxes at hospitals for parents that have lost a child.' At the time of the accident, Angel had wandered out into the garden while her mother was distracted and ended up behind the car.

'Nobody had seen that the little girl, who had just learned to . walk, had come out of the gate as well and had wandered towards the rear . of the car. 'Dad then came out of the house and reversed over the little girl.' Another neighbour said: ‘They are devastated. Even though it is an accident, the dad is blaming himself. 'It was horrendous, the other residents tried their best to help but there was nothing to be done to save her. 'She was a lovely 16-month-old girl who had just started to walk and wanted to explore the world.'","Angel Pitts, 16 months, died in 'tragic accident' earlier this month .

"By . Nick Enoch . The five-inch darts (Pfeile in German) were dropped in batches of 500 from WWI biplanes flying over enemy trenches to devastating effect . For the Germans in the trenches of World War One, the cry of 'Pfeile'! ('Arrows') would fill their troops with dread. It meant hundreds of tiny darts were going to drop on them, capable of piercing both helmet and skull. Now, one such missile - regarded as Britain’s first bomb - has emerged for sale. The five-inch darts were dropped in batches of 500 from biplanes flying over enemy trenches to devastating effect. They were capable of inflicting horrendous wounds - but upstanding British pilots viewed their use as underhand and eventually refused to use them. British War magazine, The War Illustrated, noted at the time the Royal Flying Corps’ aversion to using the projectiles, called flechettes. One edition stated: 'Our aviators think arrow-dropping dirty work - because the enemy cannot hear the things coming, and because they make such nasty wounds. 'Also it was not possible to drop them with sufficient accuracy.' Charles Grey, editor of The Aeroplane magazine, wrote in a 1915 edition: 'A friend of mine was at the military aerodrome when some of these arrows were being tested, with an unfortunate cow as the enemy. 'About three arrows struck the cow, and went clean through her into the ground, after which the cow died quite suddenly.' The rudimentary devices were superseded by darts with exploding tips and then full-scale bombs. Just 31 years after the flechettes were first launched from planes on enemy targets, the Americans dropped two devastating atomic bombs on Japan. The flechette for sale is among the . personal belongings of Harry Harse, an engineer stationed in France with . RFC Squadron 12 in 1916. Known as flechettes, the one for sale is among the personal belongings of Harry Harse (above), an engineer stationed in France with RFC Squadron 12 in 1916 . Although deadly, they were much sought-after battlefield mementos among troops. It is expected to fetch £100 when it goes under the hammer at Onslows auction house in Blandford, Dorset, on behalf of relatives of Mr Harse who live in Reigate, Surrey. Patrick Bogue, auctioneer, said: 'Harry Harse was a precision engineer who enlisted voluntarily at the outbreak of war and was involved in the manufacture of flechettes. 'The flechettes were packed into boxes which had a special release system on it. 'The flechettes were packed into boxes which had a special release system on it. The pilot would fly over enemy trenches and pull a string to release them, 500 at a time, over German troops. But they weren't very accurate and they certainly weren't very British,' said auctioneer Patrick Bogue. Above, a British WWI biplane . 'The pilot would then fly over enemy trenches and pull a string to release the darts, 500 at a time, over the German troops below. 'But they weren’t very accurate and they certainly weren’t very British - in fact the British pilots didn’t like using them at all. 'It was only when the Germans began using ungentlemanly methods of warfare that they became more accepted. 'Aircraft had only just started to be used in warfare and these darts were effectively the precursor to bombs. 'It’s incredible to think that in just 30 years it went from dropping rudimentary metal darts to dropping the atom bomb.'The auction will take place on July 9. At . the outbreak of hostilities, warring nations had limited air forces . which flew slow and unarmed reconnaissance planes into enemy territory. But . aerial warfare was quickly developed by both sides, initially with . bombs being dropped by hand and pistols being used on occasions. Machines . guns were mounted to the front of planes as well as being fitted to . observers’ platforms on two-seaters and intense battles commenced. The German air force pioneered the use of ‘flying wings’ – large numbers of aircraft patrolling into enemy territory together. Manfred von Richtofen, . the celebrated ace known as the Red Baron because of the colour of his . Fokker triplane, led such ‘flying circuses’ and became a hero among . German soldiers. In . Britain, the Royal Flying Corps, which was the Army’s flying service and . the Royal Naval Air Service were amalgamated in 1918 to form the Royal . Air Force. By this stage of the war, advanced planes such as Bristol Fighter were flying as high as 18,000ft achieving speeds of 123mph. In October 1918, the heaviest bomb of the war was dropped by a Handley Page at 1,650lb, an unthinkable weight at the beginning. Right up until the end of the war, the various nations’ air forces were evenly matched, suffering similar numbers of losses.","5-inch darts - regarded as Britain's first bomb - were dropped in batches of 500 from biplanes over enemy trenches .

"By . Nick Enoch . British poet Michael Edwards has been formally admitted to the Academie Francaise . A Briton was today finally admitted into France's top body charged with preserving the purity of the Gallic tongue. Michael Edwards, a poet who had twice tried, and failed, to join the Academie Francaise, is now one of 'The Immortals', as the hallowed body's 40 members are respectfully known. In his maiden address, he said: 'By opening the doors of your illustrious establishment, you are welcoming in its heart someone who is worse than a foreigner: an Englishman.' The 74-year-old literature professor, from Barnes, south-west London, added: 'The British would also like to have an institution that defends the English language, especially from Americanisms.' 'It's an earthquake, a revolution, a Briton at the Academie,' said French writer Frederic Vitoux in jest, while welcoming Edwards. Edwards got voted into the academy on his third try. Married to a Frenchwoman, Edwards has written several acclaimed books in French and English. He is a specialist in Shakespeare as well as 19th century French poet Arthur Rimbaud and 17th century French dramatist Jean Racine. The bilingual academic, who has dual nationality, taught at Britain's Warwick University until 2002 and at France's prestigious College de France in Paris where he was elected to a chair from 2002 to 2008. The academy's statutes do not contain any restrictions relating to the nationality of its members. A commission chosen from among the members of the Academie Francaise advises on what new words should be entered into the French dictionary, studiously defending French against foreign impurities, notably those from English. Meanwhile, the French Government has made a volte-face on banning the Twitter term 'hashtag' from all official documents. Until now, the Academie decreed that the French word 'mot-dièse' must be spoken when the '#' symbol appeared in print. But two of France's major dictionaries, . Robert and Larousse, have seen the light - and their 2015 editions will . contain not only 'hashtag' but also 'selfie', 'hipster', 'troll' [in the . offensive online comment sense of the word] and 'burger'. The bilingual academic, who has dual nationality, taught at Britain's Warwick University until 2002 and at France's prestigious College de France in Paris where he was elected to a chair from 2002 to 2008 . Married to a Frenchwoman, Edwards has written several acclaimed books in French and English . 'It’s always a very difficult choice. We shouldn’t say ""Anglicisms"" or ""Americanisms"", but ""Californianisms"" because most of these words come from West Coast of the United States, in particular Silicon Valley,' linguist Alain Rey, chief editorial advisor at Le Robert, told Le Parisien. The Académie Française was created in 1635 by Cardinal Richelieu, the chief minister to King Louis XIII. Its members hold office for life, and the body is the chief authority on the French language and publishes an official dictionary. In the past, it has asked French speakers . to replace the word 'Walkman' with 'baladeur', 'software' with . 'logiciel' and 'email' with 'courriel'. A commission chosen from among the members of the Academie Francaise advises on what new words should be entered into the French dictionary, studiously defending French against foreign impurities, notably those from English . The official uniform of the Academie is a green habit ('habit vert'), with a long black coat and black-feathered hat with golden leaf embroidery. The style was first adopted during Napoleon Bonaparte's reorganisation of the Institut de France. To round off the outfit, Immortals wear black trousers and a ceremonial sword.

"By . Nick Enoch . A mayor has sparked outrage by suggesting victims of bullying should 'grow a pair' and 'just stick up for them damned selves'. Cameron Hamilton, mayor or Porterville, California, made the remarks during a city council meeting earlier this month while discussing the issue of student safety. A series of 'Safe Zones' around town had been proposed, whereby children could seek refuge from bullies. Scroll down for video . Cameron Hamilton, mayor of Porterville, California, has sparked outrage by suggesting victims of bullying should 'grow a pair' and 'just stick up for them damned selves'. Above, the moment he made the comments during a council meeting earlier this month . At the council meeting, a series of 'Safe Zones' around Porterville (above) had been proposed, whereby children could seek refuge from bullies . But on the subject of the student-led programme, Hamilton said: 'I'm against bullying but I'm getting damn tired of it being used as a mantra for everything, and the ills of the world. 'Most people just have to grow a pair, and stick up for them damn selves.' Councilwoman Virginia Gurrola, who is in favour of the zones, replied: 'It's hard to just ""grow a pair"" when you're a 10-year-old girl.' Hamilton cast the only vote against further discussing the safety zones . His comments not only angered fellow council members but also gay rights advocates, according to Fox News. Melissa McMurrey of Gay Porterville said she felt attacked by the mayor's comments, given that some of the Safe Zones are mainly intended for young gay students. 'My feelings were really hurt and I was, essentially shocked by the end of it because it kind of felt like a little bit of a witch hunt, even though that was not the initial intention, from my understanding, of the Safe Zone project,' she told Abc 30. 'It's an opportunity for the community to come together, as a whole, and say that we're not going to take this bullying in our town,' she said. Porterville is a community of 55,000 residents 70 miles southeast of Fresno. Hamilton, who was elected mayor in 2008 and whose terms runs until 2016, cast the only vote against further discussing the safety zones. He said that although he is not anti-gay, he opposed the scheme because it would be expensive and expose the city to lawsuits if a Safe Zone became dangerous. The proposal will now not be discussed at next week's council meeting. Last year, the city was hit by controversy when the council rescinded a proclamation declaring June as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender pride month with a resolution calling June a month of community charity and good will to all.","Cameron Hamilton, mayor of Porterville, .

"By . Nick Enoch . A woman is suing three police officers and the city of Chicago for $1.35million (£800,000) after an off-duty officer shot dead her pit bull puppy as her five-year-old daughter looked on in horror. Video footage of the aftermath of the incident last year shows distraught owner Samantha Maglaya wearing blood-soaked clothes as she hugs neighbours. Ms Maglaya's daughter saw the officer shoot the four-month-old puppy eight times outside their home in Norwood Park just after 3pm on May 17, 2013, according to a federal lawsuit filed on Friday in the US District Court. Scroll down for video (warning: story contains graphic content) Samantha Maglaya is suing three police officers and the city of Chicago for $1.35m (£800,000) after an off-duty officer shot dead her pit bull puppy as her five-year-old daughter watched.

Ms Maglaya's daughter saw the officer shoot the four-month-old puppy, Maximus (above) eight times outside their home in Norwood Park, Chicago, according to a federal lawsuit filed on Friday in the US District Court . Ms Maglaya's daughter is seen wearing her beloved pet's dog collar . 'He was just like my baby. I carried him around. I fed him with a bottle.' Ms Maglaya told the Chicago Sun-Times at the time. She added: 'I heard my kid screaming, ""They're shooting the dog in the front yard.""' The officer claimed the dog, named Maximus, had been chasing his five-year-old son, who had been riding a bicycle nearby, NBC Chicago reported. And his wife had earlier voiced concern about their child's safety, requesting that the puppy be kept on a leash. Ms Maglaya said: 'He [Maximus] would sit in the yard and listen to the birds. He didn't even bark. He never growled.' According to the lawsuit filed by Ms Maglaya, Maximus had not posed as a threat; he had been playfully wagging his tail; and there was no child on a bike in the vicinity. Just after the shooting, Ms Maglaya's husband was fined for having the puppy off a leash and without a dog-tag, according to the suit. Above left, Maximus after the incident. Right, outside the Maglaya home . Just after the shooting, Ms Maglaya's husband was fined for having the puppy off a leash and without a dog-tag, according to the suit. It is also alleged the Chicago Police didn't accurately record the scene before cleaning it up. Ms Maglaya claimed the off-duty officer, and two fellow law enforcers, wanted her to leave the neighbourhood due to her race, and housing status, adding that one of the officers had been racially abusive to her. The three officers conspired to kill the dog as they didn't want it in the area, according to the suit. Ms Maglaya is comforted by neighbours after her dog was killed . The 22-count lawsuit claims include negligence; excessive force; illegal seizure; aggravated cruelty to animals; hate crimes against Maglaya and her daughter; criminal trespass to property; and intentional infliction of emotional distress, among other things. It also seeks to hold the city responsible. All three policemen are listed as . defendants in the suit, which claims the two officers who did not shoot Maximus helped the third one cover it up. The Independent Police Review Authority, which has been investigating the incident, has yet to comment.

"By . Nick Enoch . The US government has released new satellite pictures which it said showed Russian forces were still near the Ukrainian border in recent days, contradicting Russian assertions they had been withdrawn. President Vladimir Putin announced last Wednesday that the troops had moved, but NATO and the US both said they had seen no sign of a Russian withdrawal from the frontier. NATO officials have previously estimated Russia has around 40,000 soldiers close to Ukraine's border, exacerbating the worst East-West crisis since the Cold War. Scroll down for video . The photos showed what appeared to be about 20 Russian helicopters at Belgorod, near the Ukrainian border, on May 9. Alongside it, the US government published another image of the same area on March 26, also showing helicopters. An earlier photograph, from March 22, showed no helicopters in the area . The commercial satellite photos, published by the US State Department and on the US Mission to NATO's Twitter account, showed what appeared to be about 20 Russian helicopters at Belgorod, near the Ukrainian border, on May 9. Alongside it, the US government published another image of the same area on March 26, also showing helicopters. An earlier photograph, from March 22, showed no helicopters in the area. A second satellite photograph, taken in the Rostov area on May 12, within 75 km (50 miles) of the Ukraine border, showed what the U.S. government said was a group of Russian armoured vehicles. The vehicles were also there in an earlier picture of the same area, dated March 23.

An armed pro-Russian militant stands guard at a barricade outside the village of Shchastya near the eastern Ukrainian city of Lugansk today . Colonel Martin Downie, spokesman for Allied Command Operations at NATO, said recent comments by Russia's leadership on a troop withdrawal did not reflect realities on the ground. 'The reality is that Russia continues to have 40,000 high-readiness troops massed on Ukraine's border and another 25,000 troops in Crimea. The units on the latest satellite pictures show mechanised infantry, armoured vehicles and combat helicopters,' he said in a statement. 'These units are there to intimidate Ukraine's government and they could be used for an invasion of Ukraine, if ordered by Moscow. We will continue to keep a close eye on Russia's actions near our borders,' he said.

When NATO published similar satellite photographs in April showing a Russian military build-up near the Ukraine border, a Russian official disputed their authenticity, saying the images were from August last year. The allegation was denied by NATO officials, who said the photographs were recent. Ukraine is not a member of NATO and NATO officials have said the alliance will not get involved there militarily. NATO countries have sent planes, ships and some soldiers to reinforce eastern European members of NATO concerned about their security following Russia's annexation of Crimea. 'Combat helicopter with UN markings' spotted in East Ukraine . Video has emerged of a combat helicopter with UN markings in East Ukraine where it was allegedly used against pro-Russian separatists. The Mi-24 chopper was one of four such helicopters spotted near the Donetsk Oblast city of Kramatorsk by Russia's Life News. A spokesperson for UN . Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said any use of peacekeeping . equipment, bearing the name of the UN, for non-peacekeeping purposes, . would contravene UN rules. His office stressed that equipment marked with UN logos could only be used for UN-sanctioned tasks. 'It is the responsibility of Troop Contributing Countries (TCCs) that provide Contingent Owned Equipment to peacekeeping missions to remove all logos and signage bearing the UN's name once such equipment has been repatriated to the home country or is no longer being used for official UN purposes,' Ban's office said. The footage has yet to be verified. Roadmap for peace? Ukraine reluctantly agrees to talks . The Ukrainian government reluctantly agreed to launch talks on decentralising power today as part of a European-backed peace plan, but did not invite its main foes, the pro-Russia insurgents who have declared independence in the east. That deliberate oversight left it unclear what the negotiations might accomplish. Ukraine's prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, was to chair the first in a series of round tables with national lawmakers, government figures and regional officials as part of a peace plan drafted by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Locals collect parts of a seized armoured personnel carrier that was set alight during fighting at Oktyabrskoye village, about 12 miles from Kramatorsk, eastern Ukraine . The trans-Atlantic security and rights group also includes Russia and the United States. Even as Yatsenyuk launched the talks he was dismissive of them, thanking the OSCE for its efforts but saying Ukraine has its own plan to end the crisis. He gave no details of that plan. The road map aims to halt fighting between government forces and pro-Russia separatists who have taken over government buildings in the east and de-escalate tensions ahead of Ukraine's May 25 presidential vote. It lets the Ukrainian government decide specifics of the talks. Acting Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov said the talks would involve 'regional elites' - expected to include former Ukrainian presidents, officials and lawmakers. But he said the government would not stop its offensive to retake eastern cities now under the control of the separatists who declared independence on Monday. 'The government will act against those who are terrorising the region with arms in hand in line with the law, by continuing an anti-terrorist operation against them,' Turchynov said. Insurgents in the east shrugged off the round table as meaningless. 'We haven't received any offers to join a round table and dialogue,' said Denis Pushilin, an insurgent leader in Donetsk. 'If the authorities in Kiev want a dialogue, they must come here. If we go to Kiev, they will arrest us.' Even so, European officials applauded the start of the talks.","Photos appear to show about 20 Russian helicopters at Belgorod on May 9 .

"By . Nick Enoch . A family of Roma gypsies tricked three fellow Poles into moving to London, where one was forced into slavery and subjected to beatings - and all had their National Insurance numbers used to rip off the benefits system, a court heard. One female victim was constantly sexually molested and forced to shoplift and beg with her two children, who were kept in a locked room and also threatened with beatings, a jury at Croydon Crown Court was told. The court also heard that the woman's husband, and another man, were forced to collect scrap metal for up to 20 hours a day and hand all their money over to the family. Roma gypsies Ana Gil (left), 48, of Romford, Essex, and her son Dawid Gil (right), 30, have been charged with conspiring to traffic the husband of a fellow Polish couple into and within the UK for exploitation . Fabien Gil (left), 27, and his wife Bogumila Mirga (centre), 30, - along with Mateusz Gil (right), 19, all of Forest Gate, east London - are among the family of gypsies on trial. Mateusz is accused of subjecting a woman to repeated sexual assaults . Wladyslaw Gil (above) is charged with four counts of actual bodily harm against another Pole, Robert Wylezol . The accused familly are: Ana Gil, 48, and her boyfriend Jan Majewski, 48, both of Romford, Essex; her four sons Wladyslaw Gil, 32, of Ilford, Essex; Dawid Gil, 30, and Mateusz Gil, 19, both of Forest Gate, east London; and Fabien Gil, 27, and his wife Bogumila Mirga, 30, both of Forest Gate. 'The defendants are all members of a family originating in Poland who conspired or agreed to traffic three fellow Polish nationals and exploit them,' prosecutor Tim Hunter told the jury. 'Their identity documents were confiscated and they were made to work under conditions of bonded labour - and violence was routinely deployed. 'They used their identities to obtain tax credits and to apply for bank loans, vehicles and other goods and all the money would be paid into accounts controlled by these defendants.' One Polish couple and their two children were brought to the UK and kept under the control of Fabien Gil, the court was told. After the Polish family escaped, they later told police that Jan Majewski (above) was 'the brains behind the operation... the boss of the whole family' While the husband was sent to work at a banana-packing plant in Stansted and surrender 70 per cent of his wages, his wife and two children were kept locked in a room for a year. When that job ended, he was forced to collect scrap metal and hand all the proceeds over, purportedly in exchange for food and lodging. 'The defendants were claiming child tax credits for those two children and when the mother was allowed out she was forced to shoplift and beg,' said Mr Hunter. 'Fabien and Ana Gil threatened to beat up the children and Mateusz Gil also subjected the woman to repeated sexual assaults. 'He would follow her into the bathroom and pester her for sex. He would grab her breasts and buttocks.' The family escaped after the husband got Fabien Gil drunk one night, snatched his identity documents from the defendant’s wallet, and fled to Wales. They later told the police of Majewski: 'He was the brains behind the operation... the boss of the whole family.' The couple had seen another Pole under the control of the family, Robert Wylezol, who also came from the town of Nysa, near the Czech border and was used to break into squats for the defendants. 'He worked 20 hours a day collecting scrap metal in a pram and Fabien Gil kept all the proceeds and he was told to work or there would be no food. 'He received daily beatings from Wladyslaw Gil and on one occasion was beaten unconscious and suffered fractured ribs,' added Mr Hunter. 'The victim was also beaten with a metal pipe and urinated blood for a week and after escaping for one night and sleeping in a park was beaten unconscious, with ribs broken on both sides.' The jury were told the severity of the beatings were influenced by the amount of money Mr Wylezol made for the family and he was kept under their control by threats to kill his son and family living in Poland. He was moved to Wladyslaw’s new address in Ilford, where he slept in a locked storage room with no bed, until he escaped and slept rough for four months until assisted by a charity. Ana Gil, Wladyslaw, Dawid and Fabien are charged with conspiring to hold a person in slavery or servitude, in relation to Robert Wylezol - and all four are also charged with conspiring to traffic him into and within the UK for exploitation. Ana Gil, Wladyslaw, Dawid, Fabien and Jan Majewski are charged with conspiring to traffic the husband of the couple into and within the UK for exploitation. All five, plus Bogumila Mirga, face two identical counts in relation to the wife. Wladyslaw Gil is charged with four counts of actual bodily harm against Mr Wylezol and Mateusz Gil is charged with four counts of sexual assault against the wife. They have all pleaded not guilty to the charges, which date from January 1, 2009 until September 30, 2010 and the trial is expected to last six weeks. The trial continues.

An ‘untouchable’ drugs baron who ran a worldwide heroin and cocaine dealing ring from a mansion in Thailand is facing prison today after being arrested at IKEA. Craig Allen, from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, had convictions dating back to 1975 and 'thought he was above the law'. But now, the 50-year-old - nicknamed the 'ginger ninja' and 'little fella' - has been jailed for 20 years. His drugs operation made him £5,000 a week, which was used to fund a lavish lifestyle at the luxury estate he shared with his Thai wife and child. However, his empire crumbled when he was arrested at gunpoint - outside IKEA in Amsterdam - by Dutch police last October, and then extradited to the UK. When police searched his Dutch flat, they found 3kg of cocaine, 1kg of heroin, €425,000 (£350,000) in cash, scales, a cash-counting machine, rubber gloves, a vacuum-packing machine and other drugs paraphernalia. DI Craig Jackson from South Yorkshire Police, who led the investigation, said: 'Craig Allen is a sophisticated and determined drug trafficker who was directly responsible for the supply of Class A drugs onto the streets of South Yorkshire and across the UK. 'Much of Allen’s criminality was orchestrated from Thailand and the Netherlands and was undertaken by his UK-based co-defendants in a highly organised manner. 'He thought he was above the law, untouchable, and operating in a jurisdiction like Thailand gave him a degree of anonymity. 'But South Yorkshire and England will be safer places with Allen behind bars, there is no doubt. When police searched 50-year-old Allen's Dutch flat, they found 3kg of cocaine, 1kg of heroin, 425,000 euros (£350,000) in cash, scales, a cash-counting machine, rubber gloves, a vacuum-packing machine and other drugs paraphernalia . The 'untouchable' drugs baron ran a worldwide heroin and cocaine dealing ring from a mansion in Thailand he shared with his Thai wife and young child. Above, large wads of cash found at his flat in the Netherlands . David Brooke, prosecuting at Sheffield Crown Court where Allen pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial to conspiracy to import and supply heroin, and conspiracy to supply cocaine, said Allen was caught after five police operations in 2010 and 2011 which linked him to heroin and cocaine supply. In total, 24kg of Class A drugs worth around £1.85million were seized at locations around South Yorkshire and from two drugs mules who flew into Liverpool from Amsterdam with drugs hidden in their bodies. Allen was caught after South Yorkshire Police linked five Class A drugs operations to him primarily through mobile phone evidence. They discovered that in each case, Allen was at the helm, directing the delivery of drugs and exchange of cash in the UK to organised crime groups from his Thai mansion. He used up to 20 mobile telephones to conduct his operation. In the period covered by the police operations, nearly £200,000 was wired to Thailand. Officers linked each of Allen’s co-defendants back to him. Allen was caught after South Yorkshire Police linked five Class A drugs operations to him primarily through mobile phone evidence. Above, a bag of money found in Allen's Dutch flat . The court heard Allen has previous convictions dating back to 1975 when he was a juvenile. Between then and 1988, he committed dishonesty offences and in 1991 he was one of eight men who broke out of a prison bus in Sheffield while on remand for armed robbery and deception. The guards were manacled inside and the prisoners fled, sparking a national manhunt. Allen was captured after four months. In 1993, Allen was jailed for 12 years and six months for supplying heroin and amphetamines. He was jailed again in 2001 for two years for conspiracy to supply cannabis. Then in 2003 he was acquitted of involvement in the murder of Sheffield music promoter Lester Divers, who was shot dead at the wheel of his car. Allen fled to Spain with his then wife and son to make a 'fresh start' due to 'serious threats against him'. Allen’s barrister Adrian Waterman, QC said he tried to make a fresh start and worked as a painter and decorator - a profession in which he was formally trained. His wife returned to the UK with their son, but Allen was unable to go with her because of the threats against him and visited a friend in Thailand where he settled. 'It was irresistible to him not to stay away from a return to his old ways,' said Mr Waterman. 'He was safer associating with other drug dealers than living a more conventional life. He fell back into the drug-dealing world.' Allen's empire crumbled when he was arrested at gunpoint - outside IKEA in Amsterdam - by Dutch police last October, and then extradited to the UK. (File picture) He said Allen became a 'middle man' arranging the transportation of drugs on behalf of others. He left Thailand in 2010 for Amsterdam because he owed money to drug dealers, leaving behind his new Thai wife Kanya Plaengdee, whom he married in 2010, and their young child. Det Insp Jackson added: 'Craig Allen was directing and controlling the supply of Class A drugs into the UK for distribution in England and Wales from the other side of the world. 'He was Sheffield born and bred but his reputation extends far beyond Sheffield. He’s a very well-known figure. 'We worked with Dutch colleagues to identify his whereabouts and arrest him. He certainly wasn’t expecting it. He had no idea that we were on to him at all.' He said Allen’s arrest had been ‘a long time coming’. 'The investigation team have worked long and hard to see Craig Allen sentenced for his extensive criminality,' he added. 'I wish to personally thank the team of officers involved in this complex and protracted investigation for their tenacity, professionalism and drive to produce a methodically prepared case.' Allen and three co-defendants were jailed for a combined total of 61 years after admitting conspiracy to supply Class A drugs. O’Neil Richard Davidson, 36, of Stockport, Greater Manchester, was sentenced to eight years in prison. Steven Hudson, 43, of Sheffield, received a nine-year jail term. Selena Nickels, 45, of Sheffield, was sentenced to six years behind bars after she pleaded guilty on February 27. Leroy Grant, of Manchester, was found guilty of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs following a two-week trial. He was sentenced to 18 years. Brian Saunders, 48, of Sheffield, will be sentenced at a later date.","Craig Allen, 50, from Sheffield, S Yorks, sentenced to 20 years .

"By . Nick Enoch . Spring has truly arrived, with sunshine galore - and blossom beginning to appear on trees around Britain. And there's good news too for cherry-lovers as growers are predicting a bumper crop this year - over the longest and largest season ever recorded. However, next week's Bank Holiday weekend promises to be 'changeable' after a week of sunshine . While most of the country should bask in 'fine weather' over the coming days, snow is forecast on high ground in northern Scotland. By the Bank Holiday, only those in the South are promised the best of the weather, averaging around 15C - the same as is expected in London this Sunday.

The . rest of the country will experience a mixture of sunshine and showers . and temperatures 'a little bit lower than most people's . ideal barbecue temperature'. Helen Chivers, from the Met Office said: 'Our forecast suggests that there's going to be a lot of fine weather in . the UK over the next few days. 'The Bank Holiday's a little bit lower temperature-wise than most people's ideal BBQ weather. 'I would say at the moment we're looking at temperatures around about normal for April, around 13 to 15C.

Today, . the Met Office tweeted to warn hayfever sufferers about a 'high' pollen . count in the London area, and a 'medium' count for the rest of the . country. Britain currently has one of the highest rates of hay fever in the world with about 25 per cent of the population suffering. It is believed that the number of sufferers is likely to more than double to 32million by 2030. If you are affected, it can be helpful to avoid going outside when the pollen count is high - normally from early to mid-morning - and to avoid cutting the grass.

Experts from the British Cherry industry body believe this year's crop will be double last year's volume - with a bumper harvest of up to 4,000 tonnes. Above, cherry blossom in Greenwich Park . The first cherry harvest of the . season will probably come a month earlier than usual - and due to millions of . pounds of investment, thousands of new trees will also blossom. The boom has been sparked by the fifth warmest winter since records began. Experts . from the British Cherry industry body even believe this year’s crop . will be double last year’s volume - with a bumper harvest of up to 4,000 . tonnes. A spokesperson for British cherry farmers, said: 'It’s an exciting year for the British cherry industry. 'We’re . starting to reap the benefits of years of investment to reduce the need . for imports and give consumers what they want - large, juicy, British . cherries that can have more sugars than their foreign counterparts. 'We . are seeing a sweet comeback for British cherries - for the first time . ever, British cherries will hit the supermarket shelves in early June . right through to September.' Growers are benefiting from new investment in smaller trees and polytunnels that protect them from harsh weather and birds. It enables growers to produce up to four times more cherries per hectare. The . average cherry tree takes four years to start fruiting, so growers are . now starting to reap the benefits of new, early and late season . varieties. It means that Britons can expect to see home-grown cherries on the shelves from early June to September. There has been a concerted campaign to revise the British cherry industry over the past decade. Only 300 tons of cherries were produced in 2000, with many orchards made up of old, low-yielding trees. But the industry has been fighting back with new plantings and is growing fast as a result of the changes. Now . some of the UK’s top chefs have begun a campaign to encourage the . public to take pride in this quintessentially British summer fruit. Celebrity chef Rachel Khoo, who is famous for presenting BBC’s The Little Paris Kitchen, is backing the cherry renaissance. She said: 'British . cherries are gorgeous fruit with their lovely plump texture, rich . colours and stunning blossoms, making them the ultimate summertime . dessert. 'I’m delighted to be backing British growers, and I urge everyone to get on board and support British.' There . has been heavy investment in the industry to meet the demand for the . ever-popular British fruit which boasts a number of health benefits. Studies . have shown cherries can help to prevent cancer and have . anti-inflammatory properties which are important in combating arthritis . and heart disease.","Temperatures in the south set to hit a pleasant 15C this Sunday .

"By . Nick Enoch . It's sleek, British and wouldn't look out of place in a Bond movie. Petrolheads will be salivating at the sight of the Speedback - a new luxury sports car which was unveiled today. Made by David Brown Automotive, the GT was designed and built in Britain, has a bespoke interior and a handcrafted aluminium body. And although it takes some of its inspiration from the classic Aston Martin DB5, the connection ends there. David Brown looks on as the finishing touches are applied to  Speedback - the new luxury British sports car made by his company, in Coventry . The car has more than a passing resemblance to an 1960s Aston Martin DB5 (pictured). From the stylish air vents, to the large, circular lights and silver spoked wheels, the Speedback could easily pass for a modern update of James Bond's famous car . When viewed from the front, the Speedback could easily be mistaken for a DB5 thanks to its wide grill and bonnet ventilation . The car's grill, bonnet and front lighting is an almost identical shape to that seen on an 1960s Aston Martin DB5 (pictured). If you saw the Speedback in your rear-view mirror, it would be difficult to tell the two cars apart . Company founder and CEO, David Brown has . a long-standing background in engineering, vehicle manufacturing and an . equally strong enthusiasm for both classic and contemporary cars - . although he has no link with either Aston Martin or its founder, . Sir David Brown. The Speedback is driven by a Jaguar supercharged V8, a six-speed automatic gearbox and can achieve 0-62mph in 4.8 seconds with a top speed limited to 155mph. Next week, the Speedback will travel to Monaco to be shown publicly for the first time at the exclusive Top Marques show, which runs at the Grimaldi Forum from April 17 to 20. The cars look even more alike from behind. The Speedback's rear lights rise slightly from the boot, giving the car aerodynamic tail fins . Meanwhile the DB5 was famous for its tail fins. They were seen as a nod to the iconic fins seen on American cars during the 1950s, although delivered with an understated British cool that perfectly captured the mood of the following decade . It is driven by a Jaguar supercharged V8, a six-speed automatic gearbox and can achieve 0-62mph in 4.8 seconds with a top speed limited to 155mph. The Speedback is pictured sitting in front of its concept clay model . David Brown began to assemble his build team two years ago. Above, a detail of the dashboard controls, and part of the rear-light cluster . David Brown (car's emblem pictured) said: 'The launch of Speedback is the realisation of a dream for me, and is the result of skilful and dedicated work by a team of highly talented designers, engineers and craftsmen' Although the price tag of the car is not yet know, it is likely to be in the hundreds of thousands.

He said: 'The launch of Speedback is the realisation of a dream for me, and is the result of skilful and dedicated work by a team of highly talented designers, engineers and craftsmen. 'I am delighted at the reaction of our suppliers, potential customers and friends, and I look forward to presenting the car to the public in Monaco. 'The Speedback name perfectly reflects . the classic sports car tradition of the past, while also doing justice . to the sophisticated silhouette of the car’s hand-built body and unique . styling which features, among much other detail, a fold-down picnic . seat.' Made by David Brown Automotive, the GT has been designed and built in Britain, has a bespoke interior and a handcrafted aluminium body . The supercar will be produced in 'limited numbers' according to Mr Brown . Engineers, designers and craftsmen put the finishing touches to Speedback . The car is the result of 18 months of hard work by the David Brown Automotive team, including chief designer Alan Mobberley. 'This car will appeal to anybody who desires a truly individual sports car, which can boast a fine British pedigree and which will only be produced in limited numbers. 'This will ensure the kind of exclusivity associated with Britain’s once proud heritage of traditional, high-quality, automotive coach- building,' said Mr Brown. Although the price tag is not yet known, it is likely to be in the hundreds of thousands of pounds... so you'd better start saving.

"By . Nick Enoch . Pit boss Malcolm Fyfield (pictured outside court today) was one of seven people working inside the Gleision mine, near Pontardawe, South Wales, when a shaft flooded in 2011. He has pleaded not guilty to four counts of manslaughter . Miners working at a coal mine where four men died following flooding heard an explosion 'like a jet engine' moments before the sudden whooshing sound of water, a jury has heard. Pit boss Malcolm Fyfield was one of seven people working inside the Gleision drift mine, near Pontardawe, South Wales, when a shaft flooded in 2011. He survived after crawling out through sludge and dirt. As he was being treated by paramedics, Swansea Crown Court heard he told paramedics: 'They’ve gone. There is no hope for the others.' Following hours of searches, the . bodies of Charles Breslin, 62, Philip Hill, 44, Garry Jenkins, 39, and . David Powell, 50, were discovered. Father-of-two Fyfield has pleaded not guilty to four counts of manslaughter. MNS . Mining Ltd, which ran the mine at the time, denies four charges of . corporate manslaughter by failing to ensure a safe system of work was in . place. Prosecutor Gregg Taylor said coal was extracted from the 100-year-old drift mine using explosives. Conditions in the mine were said to . be cramped, with the ceiling height at just 77cm, almost 20cm lower than . a standard kitchen worktop. Mr Taylor said: 'Men worked this 2ft space by crawling on their hands and knees. 'It’s not modern... with machines, tracks and trains. This is a very historical practice.' Mr . Taylor said that at around 9am on September 15, mine worker David Wyatt . told colleagues he was going to 'fire the shots' - to blast the coal . from the seam. Emergency workers gather outside the mine to try to locate those trapped inside. Mr Fyfield survived after crawling out through sludge and dirt . Following hours of searches after the tragedy, the bodies of (top to bottom, l to r) Charles Breslin, 62, Philip Hill, 44, David Powell, 50, and Garry Jenkins, 39, were discovered . Mr Taylor said: 'They heard an explosion that sounded like a jet engine and their reaction was to shout ""run"".' The jury was told the 'deafening sound' of rushing water followed. Mr Wyatt and a colleague, Nigel Evans, managed to flee up the main shaft as the water gushed towards them. A frantic 999 call was then made by the late Mr Powell’s son, who also worked at the mine. After . being discharged from hospital on September 27, Fyfield told police . what he encountered while he was trapped inside the mine. Pictured, court sketch of (from left) MNS Mining Ltd directors Gerald Ward and Maria Seage, who are accused of four counts of corporate manslaughter, and Mr Fyfield . Conditions in the mine were said to be cramped, with the ceiling height at just 77cm, almost 20cm lower than a standard kitchen worktop. Above, the scene at Gleision Colliery as emergency services frantically worked to locate miners trapped inside . The . jury was told that the defendant found David Powell and tried to give . him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation in a flooded stall where there was only . 4in (10cm) of headroom. Re-telling Fyfield’s account, prosecutor Mr Taylor said: 'David Powell was showing no signs of life. 'It was not possible to get a pulse because of the debris around.' The pit boss then found Philip Hill about 16ft (5m) away, 'wrapped around a timber prop'. Tragic: Garry Jenkins, pictured with his partner Sarah was one of the four miners who sadly died after becoming trapped . Fyfield attempted mouth-to-mouth again, but air he tried to breathe into Mr Hill’s lungs came straight back out - suggesting that they were blocked with water. With water levels rising fast, Fyfield then made his exit. Mr Taylor also gave details of the post-mortem examination reports. He said all the men’s lungs and airways were blocked with 'coal-contaminated and silt' water. Addressing the jury directly, Mr Taylor asked: 'How did this happen? How did such a tragedy occur?' He said the key to answering these questions would be photographs and maps of the drift mine. Of the latter, he said plans of the mine had to be updated by Fyfield every three months. Mr . Taylor said the defendant was described as 'very experienced' in mining . and had owned and run a number of collieries - such as Nant Hir in the . Neath Valley. 'As a mine manager, Mr Fyfield was very well-regarded in the industry and by the Mines Inspectorate,' he said. The prosecution said that to work the drift mines, water had to be constantly pumped out . Rescue workers are seen leaving the colliery after spending 12 hours trying to find the trapped miners . Two women hug at a nearby community centre following the mining disaster . The jury was also told that Fyfield had been working as Gleision’s manager 10 weeks before the disaster. The jury was also told about the layout of the mine. Mr Taylor said Gleision being a drift mine meant colliers walked or crawled down a gradual slope to retrieve coal. The main shaft, serviced by a conveyor belt, was 275 metres long - with the entrance 145 metres above sea level. Dangerous: A picture from 2008 shows the Gleision mine when it was derelict . Offshoots from the main shaft, or stalls, were where miners would retrieve the coal from. Pointing to an area on a map shown to the court, Mr Taylor said the stall where the four men died was 100 metres off the main shaft. At this point, the height above sea level was around 86 metres. The prosecution also said that to work the drift mines, water had to be constantly pumped out. Mr Taylor also explained to the jury that since the incident, Fyfield now suffers with 'severe post traumatic stress disorder'. He has been given permission to leave the courtroom if he feels unable to listen to some of the evidence. Fyfield, who was sat next to wife Gillian, remained in court and heard all of the proceedings on the first day of his trial. A few feet away from him were two representatives of MNS - Maria Seage and Gerald Ward. The court has heard the name MNS comes from Miss Seage's full name - Maria Nora Seage. The trial is set to continue tomorrow. Workers at the scene. The main shaft, serviced by a conveyor belt, was 275 metres long - with the entrance 145 metres above sea level .

"By . Nick Enoch . For most people, a trip to the zoo is an occasional treat. But when little Muriel Thatcher first paid a visit, back in 1937, the thrill was such that she's been going back to the same one every two weeks ever since... clocking up more than 2,000 trips. Now, after seven decades of visiting Dudley Zoo, in the West Midlands, 87-year-old Muriel has been given a life membership to what she calls her 'second home'. Scroll down for video . Muriel Thatcher, 87, from Wolverhampton, has visited her favourite zoo more than 2,000 times over the past seven decades . Muriel (pictured left in the 1930s) has been given a life membership to Dudley Zoo, in the West Midlands after going there every two weeks over 77 years . After her first visit aged 10, on the day it opened, Muriel fell in love with the zoo and went as often as she could as a teenager, scraping together any cash she could get hands on to pay for her admission . No doubt Muriel will be glad about that as the daily admission price for her would have been £11.50. During a recent ceremony, staff at the zoo also presented her with her own bench (engraved in her honour) next to the monkey enclosure, along with a knapsack containing a thermos and packet of biscuits. The animal-loving pensioner, from Wolverhampton, said: 'When I heard that a zoo was opening, I begged my mum that she would take me and my younger sister. My first ever visit was just magical. I had never seen exotic animals. 'On the opening day, we waited for hours upon end as queues to get in snaked around the block and my mum wanted to give up and go home, but I begged her to stay. 'When we got in, it was worth every minute that we waited and I felt like I was taken to another world.' After her first visit aged 10, on the day it opened, Muriel fell in love with the zoo and went as often as she could as a teenager, scraping together any cash she could get hands on to pay for her admission. The pensioner has become somewhat of a VIP at the zoo and is invited to any special events . The animal-loving pensioner said: 'When I heard that a zoo was opening, I begged my mum that she would take me and my younger sister. My first ever visit was just magical. I had never seen exotic animals' Muriel, who catches two buses and makes a three-hour round trip to the zoo, has even adopted 23 of the animals . Muriel said: 'Visiting the zoo during the war was a bit of a challenge, as everyone had to concentrate on the war effort. 'Adding to that, the zoo had irregular opening hours because of air raid scares and the blackouts. 'Nevertheless, I still tried to go as much as possible and I used to take any food scraps for the animals, as food was scarce for humans let alone animals - and so I felt sorry for them.' The pensioner - who has never married nor has any children - catches two buses and makes a three-hour . round trip to the zoo, and has even adopted 23 of the animals. The former auxiliary nurse said her favourite animal are the tigers. She said: 'I was lucky enough to even be invited to a special audience to watch one of the tigers, Sarah, give birth to her cubs. 'The whole thing lasted about 20 minutes and it was such an amazing spectacle.' The pensioner has become somewhat of a VIP at the zoo and is invited to any special events. Muriel . knows all of the staff well, saying: 'They do treat me very well and . they let me hold some of the smaller animals whenever I go. 'They . will send a car for me if there is a function but I don't like all the . fuss and would even go if I had to walk all the way there.' Muriel, with staff from the zoo, as she sits on a bench engraved with her name for being one of their favourite supporters . The former auxiliary nurse said her favourite animal are the tigers. She said: 'I was lucky enough to even be invited to a special audience to watch one of the tigers, Sarah, give birth to her cubs' As one of the zoo's very first customers and certainly being its most loyal, Muriel said she has seen a lot of changes and has some great memories. She said: 'I particularly hold fond in my heart memories from the great summer of 1969. The atmosphere at the zoo was so electric and everyone had a blast. 'Everyone was happy because of the glorious weather and people were eating ice cream after ice cream to keep cool. 'Even the elephants who are used to high heats were having to be constantly cooled down with big buckets of water. 'Now that I'm saving on an annual pass, I'll be able to spend more money on treats for my favourite animals,' said the pensioner . Muriel said: 'I just love Dudley Zoo, it's a very special place for me and I never tire of it' Peter Suddock, CEO of Dudley Zoo, said: 'Muriel has been a season ticket holder for more years than she cares to remember and paid her first visit to the zoo as a ten-year-old schoolgirl, with her father and sister in 1937. 'She visits at least twice a month, regardless of the weather, and has been with us constantly throughout the good and bad times. 'Over the years, she has adopted many animals within the collection and knows all the members of staff on the keeping sections and offers encouragement and support in their projects. 'We often joke that Muriel knows more about the zoo than we do.' Muriel said: 'I just love Dudley Zoo, it's a very special place for me and I never tire of it. 'I cannot imagine life without the zoo - the staff are like family and it's the most magical place.'

Latchmere House was built in the 19th century, and was used as a hospital for treating shell-shocked officers during World War I . The plans will be decided by Richmond Council, although Kingston Council will also have a say. Latchmere House was built in the 19th century, and was used as a hospital for treating shell-shocked officers during World War I. During World War Two, it doubled as a shadowy interrogation base for prisoners of war, suspected Nazi double and even triple agents. Councillor David Cunningham said the history of the site should be remembered. Lord Haw-Haw (William Joyce), the Nazi propaganda broadcaster said to have been held at Latchmere (pictured with his wife Margaret) He said: 'It is fascinating because of the history going back to World War One. It is a history that needs to be remembered.' Hopes it could help ease Kingston and Richmond’s schools place crisis were ruled out in 2012 as it was 'too expensive' to buy from the Ministry of Justice. MI5 documents released in 1999 showed 480 suspects passed through Camp 020 during the war. The prison service took over the site in 1948, and it was used as a resettlement prison to help rehabilitate prisoners before release. An impression of how some of the new houses may look at the site . Its first inmates were members of the British Union of Fascists. Some were held in cells brightly lit 24 hours a day, others in cells kept in total darkness . MI5 operated Camp 020, at Latchmere House - where its 30 rooms were turned into cells with hidden microphones. The first of the German spies who arrived in Britain in September 1940 were taken there. Vital information about a coming German invasion was extracted at great speed. This indicates the use of extreme methods, but these were desperate days demanding desperate measures. In charge was Colonel Robin Stephens, known as ‘Tin Eye’, because of the monocle fixed to his right eye. It was not a term of affection. The object of interrogation, Stephens told his officers, was simple: ‘Truth in the shortest possible time.’ A top secret memo spoke of ‘special methods’, but did not elaborate. He arranged for an additional 92-cell block to be added to Latchmere House, plus a punishment room — known chillingly as Cell 13 — which was completely bare, with smooth walls and a linoleum floor. Close to 500 people passed through the gates of Camp 020. Principal among them were German spies, many of whom were ‘turned’ and persuaded — or maybe forced — to work for MI5. Its first inmates were members of the British Union of Fascists.  Some were held in cells brightly lit 24 hours a day, others in cells kept in total darkness. Several prisoners were subjected to mock executions and were knocked about by the guards. Some were apparently left naked for months at a time. Camp 020 had a resident medical officer, Harold Dearden, a psychiatrist who dreamed up regimes of starvation and of sleep and sensory deprivation intended to break the will of its inmates. He experimented in techniques of torment that left few marks — methods that could be denied by the torturers and that civil servants and government ministers could disown...

"By . Nick Enoch . Being the wife of a jockey can be nerve-racking, as Annabel Waley-Cohen found out at Cheltenham today. Her face, contorted into a variety of pained expressions, said it all as she watched her husband Sam finish third in the Ryanair Chase at Britain's biggest jump festival. But as well as being an amateur rider, Sam Waley-Cohen also has a rather fascinating claim to fame: he is believed to be the man who brought his close friends Prince William and Kate Middleton back together after their split in 2007. It was at a party thrown by Sam at his family’s mansion in Oxfordshire in June of that year that Kate and William were seen chatting - and within a few weeks they were holidaying together on a yacht in the Seychelles. Annabel Waley-Cohen watches her husband Sam ride in the Ryanair Chase at Cheltenham today. Sam Waley-Cohen threw a party in June 2007 - just months after his good friends Kate and William had split up. The reunited pair holidayed in the Seychelles weeks later . Annabel could hardly bear to watch as 'royal matchmaker' Sam rode Rajdhani Express in the Ryanair Chase . Annabel shouts encouragement to her husband . Annabel feels the relief after the race is over and her husband finished in third place . Speaking to the Mail in 2011, Sam was quick to play down his role as Cupid. ‘People love the idea that somebody put them back together but they put themselves together far more,’ he said at the time. By coincidence, it was at the Cheltenham Festival, in March 2007, that it first became clear there was any trouble in Kate and William's relationship. The spark appeared to be gone, whereas just a year earlier they were spotted kissing in public for the first time. Days later, pictures emerged of William partying in Boujis nightclub with other women. Sam Waley-Cohen (right) finished third in the race today.

Right, Sam has been involved in organising charity events, including the DayGlo roller-disco in 2008 at which Kate Middleton wore yellow hot pants . It was at the Cheltenham Festival, seven years ago (above), that cracks in Kate and William's relationship became apparent . That Easter, Kate gave William an ultimatum - to either commit to their relationship, or it was over. So it was that the young couple, who had met while studying history together at St Andrews University in 2001, called time on their romance. Mere months later, Sam threw his party... and the rest is royal history. The son of leading racehorse owner Sir Robert Waley-Cohen and his wife Felicity, the daughter of Viscount Bearstead, Sam is the product of a privileged background. However, tragedy struck his family while he was a teenager. Prince William kisses his wife Kate, Duchess of Cambridge on the balcony of Buckingham Palace after the Royal Wedding in April 2011 . Sam celebrates with Princess Anne after winning on Long Run at the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2011 . In 1995, his brother Thomas, younger by two years, was diagnosed with Ewing’s sarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer. He died in 2004, just days after his 20th birthday. For Sam, horse-racing helped him through his grief. In 2005, he unexpectedly won at the Cheltenham Festival, riding his father’s horse Libertine. And in 2011, he also won the Cheltenham Gold Cup on another of his father's horses, Long Run. Fast forward to the present and Waley-Cohen rode Rajdhani Express to third, behind winner and favourite Dynaste and second-placed Hidden Cyclone.

"By . Nick Enoch . All young people should visit not just British war graves but German ones too to ensure that they understand 'where we come from', War Horse author Michael Morpurgo has said. The best-selling writer and former children's laureate also suggested that children need to be told personal stories about historical events such as the First World War because these are often too big for them to comprehend. Speaking today at a conference for schools on how to mark the centenary of the Great War, Mr Morpurgo said stories are able to get through to people in a way that history books are unable to do. War Horse author Michael Morpurgo said children need to be told personal stories about historical events such as the First World War because these are often too big for them to comprehend. Above, Joe Dormers and friend Emma Thorogood at the grave of his great-great uncle Edwin Soper, of the Gloucestershire Regiment killed in the Great War in 1917, at Passchendaele, buried at Oxford Road cemetery Wieltje in Ypres, Belgium . All young people should visit not just British war graves but German ones too to ensure they understand 'where we come from', said Mr Morpurgo.

Royal Irish Rifles in a communication trench on the first day of the Battle of the Somme, in 1916 . At the same event, broadcaster Jeremy Paxman suggested people today lack the same 'sense of duty' that drove young men and women to fight in the First World War. Mr Morpurgo told delegates he wanted to inspire and alert young minds to what happened during the war because it was 'the critical moment of our times, it was the cusp of history'. 'I think it should be, I won’t say obligatory, but the minister of education in me says obligatory, for every child to go there and stand there and look at those graves, but not just our graves, to go to the German graves where actually they don’t go,' he said. 'Because they were sons and fathers just as our boys were. So I think that’s important because we are living in this world where we travel, we are European, we feel together with these people but it is important for us to know where we come from.' Corporal Stuart Gillies of The 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland practises his bagpipes today in Loos British Cemetery during a rehearsal for a reburial ceremony in France . Speaking at a conference for schools on how to mark the centenary of the Great War, Mr Morpurgo (above) said stories are able to get through to people in a way that history books are unable to do . He also said that fiction and stories can teach people about different topics. 'Of course history has to be the basis of it, that’s absolutely the case, but it is the case also that the records that are left behind, that is the diaries, the letters home, those voices which speak from the heart, from the front to those who are loved at home, or simply jotted down, or the poems that they wrote, they have a way of getting through to us as a history book might not be able to do.' He added: 'What I’ve tried to do all my writing life and all my teaching life is to bring stories to children. And I think the critical thing about making stories that work for children is that the children have to somehow feel the reality of the story.' Mr Morpurgo said that teachers can stand in front of pupils and tell them about a major moment in history - such as the atrocity of the Holocaust. 'It’s all huge, it’s all too massive to comprehend such suffering and anyway for them, it was then, so whilst they might write an essay about it and somehow you’ve told them that story, you haven’t touched them, and you and I all know the way to touch them - they read Anne Frank. 'They go there and they know it then, and they care about it because they care about one person.' In a written statement for the . conference, organised by Wellington College and Wellington Academy, . David Cameron said that children must be taught to understand the . significance of the First World War and the debt owed to the generation . who fought in it. In a written statement for the conference, David Cameron said children must be taught to understand the significance of the First World War and the debt owed to the generation who fought in it. Above, a wreath of poppies at a cemetery in Ypres, Belgium . The Prime Minister insisted that pupils must learn why war broke out, what it was like for those involved and how the conflict helped to shape modern society. And he suggested that schools should not 'shy away' from teaching pupils about the realities of the conflict. He said that this year’s centenary will be a 'hugely important national moment' which will bring people together to reflect on the sacrifices made by many men and women. 'I want to put children at the front and centre of those commemorations, so that they too understand the significance of the conflict and the debt we owe that generation.' The Prime Minister said pupils need to learn why . war broke out, and how 'political alliances and rivalries' could have . such an impact on the lives of people around the world. He added: 'Visiting the sites where it took place is a sobering reminder of those realities. 'Seeing . the thousands of names that cover the memorials, the row upon row of . headstones, brings to life the scale of the sacrifice.' As . many people as possible should visit the battlefields, which is why the . Government is giving two pupils and one teacher from every state . secondary school the chance to go to the Western Front, Mr Cameron said. Paxman: Young lack 'sense of duty' and focus on 'personal pleasure' People today lack the same 'sense of duty' that drove young people to fight in the First World War, according to Jeremy Paxman. Modern life is all about the 'pursuit of personal pleasure', a concept that would have been alien to young people during the Great War, the broadcaster suggested. Speaking at a conference for schools on . the War, Mr Paxman said that this attitude is one of the reasons he . believes such a conflict will not happen in the future. People today lack the same 'sense of duty' that drove young people to fight in the First World War, according to Jeremy Paxman . 'There was what is notably absent now - another thing that I think makes this sort of conflict unimaginable in the future - there was a sense of duty,' he said. 'If you consider the way we lead our lives now, we lead our lives essentially in an atomised fashion, pursing personal pleasure. 'It’s all about personal choice; do what you want, please yourself. 'This was a world that was unknown to young people in 1914, 1915, 1916.'","Mr Morpurgo said stories .

"By . Nick Enoch . Meet Shouta. He runs a casino in Macau. But that's not his only job. He also 'removes' people, in the Yakuza sense of the word. Now, in a remarkable new documentary - Black Business: Modern Day Yakuza - Shouta reveals what it's like to work for Japan's organised crime syndicate. As the title credits roll, the screen reads: 'Forget what you think you know... Japan is not all smiles and friendly customer service.' Scroll down to see short film . According to a new short film, Shouta (pictured) is a member of the Yakuza, the Japanese mafia . Shouta runs a casino in Macau but also has 'other business interests' in the US and Asia . Cigarette in hand, Shouta is then asked if he has ever killed someone. He replies: 'I don't kill people. I just ""remove"" them. There are certain situations that call for ""removal"". 'And removing someone is not just like firing someone,' he remarks ominously. Later in the footage, he adds: 'In our line of business, when a problem arises, we must act without hesitation.' The film was directed by videographer Luke Huxham, who is based just outside Tokyo. The Yakuza is believed to have more than 100,000 members spread across the country in different gangs. Together, they make the largest organised crime group in the world. In the film, which runs at just under 9 minutes long, Shouta, in his early thirties, reveals that his 'career' choice runs in the family. His father, and a good friend of his father, were both in the Yakuza. The film - Black Business: Modern Day Yakuza - was directed by videographer Luke Huxham, who wanted to capture what life is like in the Japanese mafia in the modern age . Shouta says that he had problems at school and was sent by his family to study in America. He now looks after various 'business interests' - and splits his time between the US and Asia. As well as dealing in prostitution, real estate and stockbroking, the Yakuza's latest emphasis has been on money-lending, according to Shouta - and not just in Japan. During the interview, Shouta also discusses how corruption extends to both the police and government. 'We have people within the police who are willing to help us, and also a strong connection to the political world. 'Is our business that bad? Look at all the corrupt politicians... well, possibly corrupted by us.' Towards the end of the film, he says: 'Do I feel guilty? No, not at all. We are simply businessmen.' When Mail Online asked Huxham whether Shouta was a genuine member of the Yakuza, he declined to answer, leaving it up to viewers to decide .

Last year, Huxham made another documentary about the Japanese underworld, called Underground Hero: Love To Hate Me, which concerned a Lamborghini fanatic. Both films were produced by Maiham Media, which states on YouTube: 'Japan is famous for many things, such as technology, sushi, temples, geisha and amazing customer service. 'One side of Japan not often seen but living in plain sight are the people conducting in ""Black Business"", the Yakuza. The Yakuza is believed to have more than 100,000 members spread across the country in different gangs . 'They're not petty criminals confined to the streets - they're international businessmen. 'Using knowledge, money, powers of persuasions and their influence in the government to help secure them lucrative international black business deals. 'To the everyday citizen, they serve as no threat, often polite and well spoken but if you are one to do business with them - make no mistake: they're ruthless, calculated people that will not hesitate to better their position at your expense.'

"By . Nick Enoch . A previously unknown sketch by John Constable that is said to be an early inspiration for his famous work The Hay Wain today sold for £42,000 - six times its estimated value . The small pencil drawing of a horse and plough was one of seven 'lost' works produced by the 18th century English painter which went under the hammer for a total of £222,000 (with fees added on), far exceeding the original expected sum of around £60,000. The sketches, and an eighth by Constable's son, Lionel, were bought in a London art store in 1952 by the current owner's father for £500. The works had been hung in their house in Norfolk ever since without the family realising who they were by.

"By . Nick Enoch . As EU leaders arrived at an emergency summit today to discuss the crisis in Ukraine, onlookers could be forgiven for thinking they were seeing double. With his oh so smooth forehead, hair swept back and hazel eyes, David Cameron addressed the media... as did his doppelganger - Luxembourg's prime minister, Xavier Bettel. Like Cameron, he wore a navy suit, plumping for pinstripes, possibly to help avoid confusion. David Cameron attended an emergency EU summit today to discuss the Ukraine-Crimea crisis... and also present was PM lookalike Xavier Bettel of Luxembourg (that's him on the right) The similarities don't end there: both men (born seven years apart) head up a coalition government: Cameron with the Lib Dems; Bettel (the liberal Democratic Party) with Luxembourg's Socialist Workers' Party and Green Party. If that wasn't strange enough, before becoming PM, Bettel worked as a barrister - the same profession as David's elder brother, Alex Cameron QC. Brothers in arms, indeed. The EU leaders were holding an emergency summit at the EU headquarters in Brussels to discuss a response to Russia's troop deployment in Ukraine's Crimea. The similarities don't end there: both men (born seven years apart) head up a coalition government - Cameron with the Lib Dems; Bettel (Democratic Party) with Luxembourg's Socialist Workers' Party and Green Party . Cameron is married with three children; while Bettel is his country's first openly gay PM and is in a relationship with architect Destenay Gauthier . During the talks, the leaders agreed a limited package of sanctions to be put in place with immediate effect. They warned Russia of 'far-reaching consequences' unless it enters into direct talks with the Ukraine government to end the crisis. And they warned of further measures, including asset freezes and travel bans, unless there was swift action. Nationality: British . Age: 47 . Politics: Conservative . Appointed PM: 2010 .

Education: University of Nancy, MA in public and European law, postgrad diploma in political science and public law . Family: In relationship with Destenay Gauthier. Bettel is Luxembourg's first openly gay PM . Cameron and Bettel deep in discussion, pictured last December . Mr Cameron said: 'We cannot accept Russia creating new facts on the ground without these talks taking place. 'Illegal actions committed by Russia cannot pass without a response. It cannot be business as usual with Russia. 'If Russia does not rapidly engage in direct talks with the Ukrainian government to find a solution to this crisis, we have been clear in the statement today that we will go further.' Immediate measures include suspending negotiations on a more liberal visa regime for Russians, halting work on a comprehensive new agreement on relations with the EU, and suspending preparations for the G8 summit in Sochi.

"By . Nick Enoch . At first glance, these two images of the Thames, with the Houses of Parliament in the background, could be taken on the same day. But now compare them with another split image of the river - one showing a woman from the present day, the other showing a policeman from yesteryear. These remarkable pictures are actually stills from a film, illustrating a shot-by-shot comparison of London now and in 1927. It was 86 years ago that Claude Friese-Greene - a cinema technician, filmmaker and cinematographer - travelled across the UK with a new colour film camera to create his famous collection of films, The Open Road. Scroll down for video . These two images of the Thames look almost identical... but they were shot 86 years apart - the one on the left in 1927 . A policeman walks along Albert Embankment by the Thames in cinematographer Claude Friese-Greene's original film; right, the same stretch of pavement in 2013 . Separated by the years, two toddlers pose next to a Peter Pan statue in Kensington Gardens.

Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square, as seen (left) in Friese-Greene's London segment of his famous collection of films, The Open Road, and, right, the scene today . The filmmaker's trip culminated in London with scenes that captured the daily life of Londoners as well as several iconic cityscapes, such as Hyde Park, Marble Arch and Petticoat Lane. Some of the original silent film's title cards will seem rather old-fashioned, and just a tad chauvinist to the modern viewer. One of them reads: 'Now a little contrast, from the peace of the park to Peticoat Lane - where London's husbands amuse themselves while London's wives cook the Sunday dinner.'

"By . Nick Enoch . Roland Holman, 55, insisted he smothered his 76-year-old mother Myrna (above) in her bed because she 'asked him to end it' A man who suffocated his cancer-stricken mother with a pillow dialled 999 shortly afterwards and sobbed: 'My mum has had cancer and I've just stopped everything and I've killed her. Can you please come round and put me away?' Roland Holman, 55, insisted he smothered his 76-year-old mother Myrna in her bed because she 'asked him to end it'. Today, Holman, of Plaistow, east London, was jailed for 18 months, having earlier pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Mrs Holman was suffering from terminal pancreatic cancer and had been given 12 weeks to live. Her son, a former shop steward, was alone with her at her home, also in Plaistow, on June 1 last year. At 5.09pm, Holman made the 999 call, adding: 'She [his mother] asked me to put an end to it and I did. 'I killed my mum, I suffocated her, she wanted me to do it.' When police arrived at the house, they found Holman in tears, sitting beside his mother's lifeless body clutching her 'pale white hand' under the covers. He later said to police: 'She told me she didn't want to be here anymore. I did it. I did it. 'I don't drink, I don't smoke - I just killed my mum. My family took turns looking after her, it was my turn - she was very ill. 'She wanted to go to the toilet and I lifted her to the commode but it was too late. 'There was blood and mess all over the place. She looked at me and asked me to do it for her. I lifted her back onto the bed and put the pillow over her. She didn't even struggle. 'I loved her, I would have done anything for her.' Speaking at the Old Bailey, Judge . Richard Marks said: 'It is clear that at the time of her death, your . mother was gravely ill and had a short time left to live. 'You . and other members of the family were taking it in turns looking after . her and I have no doubt that seeing the rapid deterioration of her . condition along with her pain and distress must have been deeply . upsetting for you all. 'It is against that background and to . put an end to her suffering that you brought an end to her life by . suffocating her with a pillow. 'I'm prepared to accept that you believed that is what she wanted when you acted as you did. Speaking after the hearing, Roland Holman's brother, David (pictured above, today), said: 'It's disgusting that someone can make a 999 call saying they have just killed their mother and get away with it' 'One consequence of what you did is she was not able to die surrounded by her family by whom she was clearly greatly loved and none of them had the opportunity of saying goodbye to her - all of that she no doubt would have wanted. 'There is no doubt many people believe that euthanasia should be legalised but that is not the position and what you did was unlawful and wrong. 'The matter is too serious for any outcome other than one of an immediate custodial sentence.' Holman was charged with his mother's murder on June 2 last year and later pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Psychiatrists accept that he was suffering from a depressive illness which would have diminished his responsibility at the time of the incident. Prosecutor Max Hill QC said: 'It was the defendant's understanding that his mother wanted him to relieve her from suffering and he felt overwhelmed and helpless trying to care for her. 'There's no evidence that the deceased asked anyone to end her life so we cannot accept there is any likelihood she made such a request to the defendant. James Scoby QC defending, said: 'Roland Holman above anybody understands the sanctity of life. 'He had been suffering from depression for about three years before the incident and was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time of this desperate act. 'He expects the key to be thrown away. Seeing your mother die in front of your eyes is crushing and that is why he acted on impulse the way he did. 'He accepts he has denied her family the chance for them to say goodbye properly.' Holman, also of Plaistow, has already served around seven and a half months and is due to be released within a few weeks. Speaking after the hearing, his brother, David Holman, said: 'It's disgusting that someone can make a 999 call saying they have just killed their mother and get away with it. 'He is a good guy and did it only to help my mum but that judge has given him a pat on the back and let him go free. 'I never had the chance to sit with mum and hold her hand. 'I said to him that morning, ""If you can't cope, I won't go"". 'Why did he have to stick a pillow over her head?' Judge Marks said he hoped that in time David 'feels able to forgive his brother'.","Roland Holman insisted he smothered his mother, Myrna, 76, because she 'asked him to end it'

"By . Nick Enoch . Married police officer Christopher Semak (above), who had sex with a 14-year-old girl, has been jailed for six years . A married police officer who had sex with a 14-year-old girl after sending her text messages saying he would be as 'bad as the paedophiles I am trying to catch' was jailed for six years today. West Midlands Police said Christopher Semak, an officer in south Birmingham, carried out the crimes between April 2010 and November 2011 when the girl, who was known to the man, was aged 14 and 15. The 33-year-old officer was arrested on January 24, 2012 at his Kings Norton home - on the same day the girl, then aged 16, revealed that she had been systematically assaulted over the course of two years, police said. Stafford Crown Court heard 18 encounters between the pair took place in Semak’s car while his young child was in the front seat. Afterwards the girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, would write in her diary about their sexual exploits. Semak was handed the prison sentence following a four-week trial. The court heard the girl's parents discovered what was going on after they found more than 200 messages from Semak on her phone. They then asked their daughter about the messages, and she admitted having a relationship with the officer. Two days later, the victim’s parents are said to have confronted Semak who simply said: 'I have been stupid.' Stafford Crown Court heard 18 encounters between the pair took place in Semak's car while his young child was in the front seat . On January 21, the girl confided in a teacher, who then contacted Children’s Services and police. In a police interview three days later, she told officers that she and Semak had began flirting in March 2010. She also said Semak said to her, 'Can you not tell anyone I’ve been texting you because it does look a bit weird, a 30-year-old that’s texting a 14-year-old'. Another follow-up text message read to the court added: 'Of course I want to, but if we did things and it got out I’d lose my job, my family and go to prison because you’re only 14. I think we should leave it till you’re old enough.' He later added in another text: 'I can’t do this with you being so young, it would make me as bad as a paedophile.' Judge Mark Eades told him: 'You knew from your position [as a police officer] you shouldn’t do it, you even made reference in your texts about being viewed as a paedophile, as a child molester - it’s true isn’t it? 'You saw her as ripe for the plucking. She was impressionable, going through puberty and all the anxieties that brings. You found her attractive and your lust overtook what you knew to be right. 'We have that graphic series of text messages that made it clear you were having sex at every opportunity you could. What’s even more disturbing is you were quite happy to have your son with you.' Semak, from Kings Norton, Birmingham, is banned from working with or having unsupervised access to children under the conditions attached to the order. He was also ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for life . After a major police investigation was launched, the officer, who joined the force in 2010, was suspended, with his access to police buildings restricted. A police spokesman said that as part of the lengthy inquiry in which texts and emails were scrutinised, detectives did not find any victims other than the girl who was known to Semak outside of work. Detective Superintendent Tim Bacon, from the force’s Public Protection Unit, said: 'Christopher Semak has today been found guilty of sexual activity with a child. 'It is clear that he groomed the victim for his own sexual gratification. His actions were disgraceful for any person let alone a man who, when he became a police officer, swore an oath to protect people. 'Throughout his trial, Semak failed to take responsibility for his own actions. A police spokesman said that as part of the lengthy inquiry in which texts and emails were scrutinised, detectives did not find any victims other than the girl who was known to Semak outside of work . 'The verdict of the jury today reflects their belief that this was in fact a tissue of lies designed to undermine the victim and save himself. 'The sexual exploitation of children is child abuse. In this case, the offender is a police officer who whilst not on duty at the time betrayed the trust that the victim and others had in him to take advantage of the victim and in doing so has caused her severe emotional trauma. 'I hope that he will reflect on his actions and the emotional scars he inflicted on his victim and those around him.' Police said Semak was handed a sexual offences prevention order in addition to the jail sentence. Semak is banned from working with or having unsupervised access to children under the conditions attached to the order. He was also ordered to sign the sex offenders’ register for life. With criminal proceedings now completed, the case will go before a special police disciplinary panel where senior officers will determine his future with the force in line with national guidelines.","Christopher .

"Maria Zhang, senior director of engineering at Yahoo Mobile, is being sued by Nan Shi, former principal software engineer . Shi said she was coerced into having 'oral and digital sex' with Zhang, who allegedly promised her 'bright future' The engineer claimed she was fired after she complained about alleged harassment to Yahoo's human resources . Yahoo has denied the allegations, calling Miss Zhang an 'exemplary' executive . In a tech magazine profile in April, Zhang said she is passionate about mentoring other female engineers . Ms Zhang's attorneys have attacked the suit as 'inhumane' and 'outrageously false' By . Snejana Farberov . and Reuters Reporter . and Ted Thornhill . Published: . 09:43 EST, 17 July 2014 . | . Updated: . 13:07 EST, 17 July 2014 . A leading woman executive at Yahoo who has been accused of sexual harassment and wrongfully terminating her colleague’s employment has launched a defamation suit against her accuser. Maria Zhang, a senior director of engineering at Yahoo Mobile in America, is alleged to have coerced Nan Shi, a principal software engineer, to have sex on numerous occasions in a flat owned by the company near its headquarters. But Zhang’s attorneys have labelled the accusations as ‘outrageously false’. Sex scandal: Maria Zhang, left, a senior director of engineering at Yahoo Mobile, has been named in a lawsuit filed by Nan Shi (right), a former principal software engineer at Yahoo, who accused her boss of forcing her into an intimate relationship, but Ms Zhang has launched a counter-claim . They told The Wrap: ‘Making such extreme false accusations with the sole intention of causing undue harm is simply inhumane. Maria is an exemplary Yahoo executive, and we intend to fight vigorously to clear her name. ‘In Shi's case, the answer [for the lawsuit] is simple: financial gain. Shi made false claims that Zhang coerced her into having sex so that Shi could extort Yahoo Inc. for money.’ In legal papers filed by Ms Shi in California, it is claimed Zhang forced her subordinate to work gruelling hours and write work emails in her own time, ‘sometimes right after sex’. Miss Zhang told Miss Shi she would have a ‘bright future’ at Yahoo if she complied, it is claimed, but would lose her ‘job, her stocks [shares in Yahoo] and her future’ if she rejected her advances. Miss Shi alleges that after she complained to human resources she was fired. In her complaint, Miss Shi says she met her boss when she went to work for a mobile company Miss Zhang set up in Seattle. When Yahoo bought the company last year, both women moved to California and ended up sharing an apartment. In a newspaper interview, Miss Shi described how Miss Zhang allegedly surprised her one morning as she slept on the couch in their apartment. She said: ‘I was in a deep sleep one morning, sleeping on the sofa because she had taken my bed, when she came in without clothes on, crawled into my blanket, and woke me up, hugging me, kissing my face and neck. ‘I woke up and got scared; I was shocked. I said, “What are you doing?” She said she’d liked me a long time, but I didn’t feel the same toward her. I said, “Come on, we’re friends; I love you as a person, but not as a lover”.’ Roommates: Shi's complaint states Zhang told her to move into a temporary Yahoo housing apartment with her in Sunnyvale after the two came to California in 2013 . In the complaint, she accuses Miss Zhang of unfairly downgrading her performance reviews for the second and third quarters of 2013. According to court documents, Yahoo’s human resources personnel refused to conduct an investigation when Miss Shi complained about the advances. Instead Miss Shi was put on unpaid leave and eventually fired. Miss Shi, a native of Beijing who graduated from Ohio University with a degree in computer science, is seeking financial as well as punitive damages. The lawsuit also names Yahoo as a defendant. In April, Silicon Valley Business Journal named Miss Zhang as one of its Women of Influence of 2014. Her profile stated that ‘she is passionate about supporting women’ and ‘she actively mentors other women engineers’.Miss Zhang told the magazine that she was fortunate that she has many opportunities ‘to influence other women’s careers’. When asked to name something about her that would surprise others, she replied that she has a growing collection of Hello Kitty paraphernalia. Miss Shi’s claims are the latest scandal to hit Silicon Valley. An escort, Alix Tichelman, is accused of killing Google executive Forrest Hayes with an overdose of heroin on his yacht. And the mobile phone dating app Tinder has denied allegations that a female marketing executive was repeatedly called a ‘whore’ by a senior executive.

"By . By Tim Talley And Brady Mccombs, Associated Press . One man's quest to explain his brother's mysterious jail cell death 19 years ago has rekindled long-dormant questions about whether others were involved in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. What some consider a far-flung conspiracy theory will be at the forefront during a trial set to begin Monday in Salt Lake City. The Freedom of Information Act lawsuit was brought by Salt Lake City attorney Jesse Trentadue against the FBI. He says the agency won't release security camera videos that show a second person was with Timothy McVeigh when he parked a truck outside the Oklahoma City federal building and detonated a bomb, killing 168 people. The government claims McVeigh was alone. Scroll down for video . On a mission: Jesse Trentadue is on a quest to explain his brother's mysterious jail cell death that has rekindled long-dormant questions about whether others were involved in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing . Looking for answers: Kenneth Trentadue was found bruised and stabbed by his family after the FBI said he hanged himself . Unsatisfied by the FBI's previous explanations, U.S. District Judge Clark Waddoups has ordered the agency to explain why it can't find videos from the bombing that are mentioned in evidence logs, citing the public importance of the tapes. Trentadue believes the presence of a second suspect in the truck explains why his brother, Kenneth Trentadue, was flown to Oklahoma several months after the bombing, where he died in a federal holding cell in what was labeled a suicide. What do they know? The FBI claims Timothy McVeigh was alone when he planted the car bomb that killed 168 in 1995, but some conspiracy theorists believe Trentadue died as part of the agency's investigation into a second man who was on the scene with McVeigh . His brother bore a striking resemblance to the police sketch that officials sent out after the bombing based on witness descriptions of the enigmatic suspect 'John Doe No. 2,' who was the same height, build and complexion. The suspect was never identified. 'I did not start out to solve the Oklahoma City bombing, I started out for justice for my brother's murder,' Jesse Trentadue said. 'But along the way, every path I took, every lead I got, took me to the bombing.' The FBI says it can't find anything to suggest the videos exist, and says it would be 'unreasonably burdensome' to do a search that would take a single staff person more than 18 months to conduct. Jesse Trentadue's belief that the tapes exists stems from a Secret Service document written shortly after the bombing that describes security video footage of the attack that shows suspects - in plural - exiting the truck three minutes before it went off. A Secret Service agent testified in 2004 . that the log does, in fact, exist but that the government knows of no . videotape. The log that the information was pulled from contained . reports that were never verified, said Stacy A. Bauerschmidt, . then-assistant to the special agent in charge of the agency's . intelligence division. Several investigators and prosecutors who worked the case told The Associated Press in 2004 they had never seen video footage like that described in the Secret Service log. The FBI has released 30 video recordings to Trentadue from downtown Oklahoma City, but those recordings don't show the explosion or McVeigh's arrival in a rental truck. If he wins at trial, Trentadue hopes to be able to search for the tapes himself rather than having to accept the FBI's answer that they don't exist. Kathy Sanders and Jannie Coverdale, who both lost grandchildren in the bombing, are grateful for Trentadue's pursuit of the case. Sanders said she's been waiting 19 years to see the tapes. The wreckage of the Alfred P Murrah building burned itself into the national psyche in 19956 but did McVeigh have company when he planted the bomb that did it? Was another man involved? Terry Nichols (left) was sentenced to life in prison for helping McVeigh plot his terrorist act. Michael Fortier, the star witness in the Oklahoma City bombing trials, was released from federal prison in 2006 after serving a sentence for failing to inform authorities of what he knew about the bombing plot . 'It is worth pursuing,' Coverdale said. 'I know there was somebody else. I have never stopped asking questions.' But former Oklahoma Rep. Susan Winchester, whose sister, Dr. Margaret 'Peggy' Clark, was killed in the bombing, said she is satisfied that officials have identified everyone responsible for the bombing. 'I was very comfortable with the decisions that came out of the federal and state trials,' Winchester said. 'I have reached that point in my life where I can continue.' Jesse . Trentadue's mission began four months after the bombing when his brother . died at the U.S. Bureau of Prisons' Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma . City. Kenneth Trentadue, 44, a convicted bank robber and construction . worker, was brought there after being picked up for probation violations . while coming back to the U.S. at the Mexican border, Jesse Trentadue . said. His . death was officially labeled a suicide. But his body had 41 wounds and . bruises that his brother believes were the result of a beating. In 2008, . a federal judge awarded the family $1.1 million in damages for extreme . emotional distress in the government's handling of the death, but the . amount was reduced to $900,000 after an appeal. Jesse . Trentadue's best guess about the motive is that his brother died in an . interrogation gone wrong by investigators demanding information Kenneth . Trentadue didn't have. Jesse Trentadue filed the Freedom of Information Act lawsuit in 2008. Taking the feds to court: Now Trentadue is on a mission to reveal the truth about his brother's death and his suing the FBI to get answers . Going toe-to-toe with the federal government has come at a personal price for Jesse Trentadue, 67, who says he's lost time with his children and wife that he can't recover. But he has no regrets, fueled by his love for his brother. Just three years apart, the two shared a bed, hunted coons together and played on the same sports teams growing up in a coal camp in West Virginia. Their paths diverged as adults - Jesse becoming an attorney while Kenneth fell into drugs and crime - but the brotherly bond never broke. Before his death, Kenneth Trentadue had overcome his heroin addiction and had a newborn baby at home in San Diego, Jesse Trentadue said. The brothers spoke by phone from jail the night before his death, with the two discussing how he would soon be out. 'What I learned growing up in the coal fields is that you fight even when you know you can't win,' he said. 'Because you have to make a stand on some things. Justice for my brother is certainly one of them.'","Jesse Trentadue believes his brother Kenneth was arrested by the FBI after the 1995 bombing in the belief he was Timothy McVeigh's accomplice .

"By . Stephanie Nebehay And Kate Kelland . World Health Organisation suggests gay men take antiretroviral AIDS drugs (stock image) to protect themselves from infection, alongside condoms . Gay men, prostitutes, and prisoners have stubbornly high rates of HIV and are threatening progress in the global AIDS battle, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). For the first time, the organisation is ‘strongly recommending’ gay men consider taking antiretroviral AIDS drugs as an extra way of protecting themselves against infection, alongside using condoms. Such an approach, known as pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP, is a way for at-risk people to protect themselves by taking a single pill. This is usually as a combination of two antiretrovirals, taken every day. ‘Globally we are failing certain populations that have the greatest risk yet we know have universally poorer access to health services,’ said Gottfried Hirnschall, director of the WHO's department. ‘These are men who have sex with men, sex workers, transgender persons, specifically transgender women, persons who inject drugs and persons who are in prisons or other closed settings.’ AIDS experts estimate that globally, HIV incidence among gay men could be cut by 20 to 25 per cent through PrEP - averting up to one million new infections in this group over 10 years. PrEP, when taken consistently, has also been shown to cut the risk of HIV infection in high-risk people by up to 92 percent. ‘The reason we are adding this to our prevention choices for men who have sex with men is that we have these very worrying increases in HIV incidence,’ added Rachel Baggaley, coordinator of the WHO's department for HIV/AIDS. The WHO said studies estimate female sex workers are 14 times more likely to have HIV than other women, gay men are 19 times more likely to have HIV than the general population, and transgender women are almost 50 times more likely than other adults to have HIV. The approach is known as pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP, and experts estimate PrEP could cut incidence of HIV in gay men by 20 to 25%. PrEP, when taken consistently, has also been shown to cut the risk of HIV infection in high-risk people by up to 92 per cent. Stock image of a HIV test is pictured . For injecting drug users, the risks of HIV infection can be 50 times higher than the general population. These people are most at risk of becoming infected with the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS, yet are least likely to get HIV prevention, testing and treatment services, the Geneva-based United Nations health agency said. A Mississippi girl born with the AIDS . virus and in remission for years, despite stopping treatment, is now showing signs that she still harbors HIV. The . news is a setback to hopes that very early treatment with powerful HIV . drugs might reverse an infection that has seemed permanent once it takes . hold. The girl is now . nearly four years old. As recently as March, doctors said she . seemed free of HIV despite not having been on AIDS drugs for about two . years. That was a medical first. But . on Thursday, doctors said tests showed that she is no longer . in remission. She is now back on treatment and is responding well, the . doctors added. ‘We are seeing exploding epidemics in some of these key populations,’ Gottfried said - adding these groups account for up to 50 per cent of new cases of HIV infection. Some 35.3 million people worldwide are infected with HIV, but the rising number of patients reflects great strides in recent years in developing sophisticated HIV tests and combination AIDS drugs and getting them to many of those who need them to stay alive. As a result, the annual AIDS death toll is falling, dropping to 1.6 million people in 2012 from a peak of 2.3 million in 2005. New HIV infections are also steadily declining, and dropped by a third in 2013 from 2011. Yet figures show the key high risk populations continue to have high infection rates, and appear to be hard-to-reach in terms of getting the right prevention messages, or getting them the testing and treatment health services they need. Hirnschall continued that in many countries, gay men, sex workers and other marginalised groups are left out of national HIV plans and excluded by discriminatory laws and policies. ‘None of these people live in isolation,’ he warned. ‘Sex workers and their clients have husbands, wives and partners. Some inject drugs. Many have children. Failure to provide services to the people who are at greatest risk of HIV jeopardises further progress against the global epidemic.’ The WHO report, released ahead of the International AIDS Conference in Melbourne, Australia on 20 July, said that by the end of 2013, around 13 million people worldwide were taking AIDS drug treatment. This has led to a 20 per cent drop in HIV-related deaths between 2009 and 2012, it said.","High rates of HIV in gay men, prostitutes and prisoners are .

"By . Sanchez Manning . Earl Spencer and Lord Rothschild are leading a growing revolt by landowners against the Government’s High Speed Two rail line. A string of aristocratic families are among almost 2,000 petitioners lobbying Parliament to stop the controversial scheme going ahead in its current form. They have joined a chorus of protest from other campaigners who argue that the line will blight property prices, carve up Britain’s waterways and threaten countryside idylls. Earl Spencer pictured with his wife Karen, right, complains the rail link will go through his ancestral estate in Wormleighton, left,  which the family abandoned during the English Civil War . The new objectors, including Prince William’s close friends Nicholas and Alice van Cutsem and the Duke of Wellington’s  descendant Lord Richard Wellesley, have made their views public in official petitions to Parliament asking for amendments to the Bill paving the way for the proposed £50 billion link from London to Birmingham. The scheme, which the Government argues will boost Britain’s economy, will cut the  1 hour 21 minute journey time from London to Birmingham  by 32 minutes. The objectors complain that the link will ‘sever’ their estates, cause ‘intolerable noise’ and adversely affect wildlife  and areas of outstanding natural beauty. The Spencer Family left the Wormleighton Estate in Warwickshire, pictured, when the moved to Althorp in Northamptonshire in 1645 . And they are calling for a long list of changes including tunnelling, fences to protect wildlife, higher compensation payments and anti-noise barriers. Princess Diana’s brother Earl Spencer has submitted his petition because the line is earmarked to go through the Wormleighton Estate in Warwickshire. The Spencer family lived in the manor until 1645, but abandoned it for the Althorp estate in Northamptonshire during the English Civil War. In the petition the Earl and the other trustees of the estate complain their land will be ‘severed’ by the proposed HS2 rail line. The document says Government plans to acquire parts of the land through compulsory purchase, needed to dump excavated earth, are of particular concern and brands the compensation scheme ‘inadequate’. The HS2 link is being opposed by a section of aristocrats who complain the rail link will cause them nuisance and disruption . Another issue raised is that the HS2 construction will exacerbate ‘the problems associated with rabbits and deer’, with Earl Spencer calling for fencing to be installed to protect the estate, which encompasses the 16th century Wormleighton Manor. A second petition by Lord Rothschild raises concerns that part of the Waddesdon Estate in Buckinghamshire, given by his family to the National Trust, will be hacked off when the HS2 route is driven through it. He speaks of the ‘intolerable’ noise and dust expected from the works, as well as warning of the possible reduction in visitors to the estate. Nicholas van Cutsem, a childhood friend of Prince William, and his wife Alice are equally upset about the havoc the HS2 line looks set to wreak in their bucolic corner of England. The pair live in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire – a few hundred feet from the route. Army Major van Cutsem warned in his petition: ‘Public right of ways will be stripped of their rural nature and tranquillity by HS2. Your petitioner and family will also suffer years of disruption and difficulty from the construction.’ Van Cutsem backed suggestions it would be better for the high-speed trains to go through a ‘bored tunnel’. Meanwhile Lord Richard Wellesley, who owns a farm on the Marston St Lawrence Estate in Brackley, Northamptonshire, which will be bisected by the HS2 route, also made his discontent clear. The upper-class rebellion brewing in the Tory heartlands is likely to come as fresh embarrassment to the Government, which has experienced opposition to HS2 from the ranks of Tory MPs. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission has also entered a petition. It demands  the Government backtrack on powers allowing them during the construction work to disturb war memorials and First World War graves, without informing the Commission. Ralph Smythe, from the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said last night: ‘The proposals before Parliament for HS2 will, unless radically changed, destroy the setting of some of the country’s most historic houses.’","Objectors complain high-speed link will cause 'intolerable noise'

"By . Sanchez Manning . Blasted: Superdrug admits it has had to stock cheap drinks to lure customers to the store . Superdrug has been accused of fuelling Britain’s binge drinking culture by selling cheap  alcohol in its stores alongside cosmetics. The retailer, better known for beauty products and in-store pharmacies, admitted it has resorted to stocking cheap wine, beer and alcopops to entice customers into struggling outlets. But a Conservative MP last night branded its decision irresponsible and called on Superdrug to take the booze off the shelves – accusing the firm of targeting younger customers with its alcohol promotions. In a branch in Chatham, Kent, customers can buy bottles of wine for just £2.49, while a brand of peach schnapps is on sale for just £4.49 – almost £2.50 cheaper than the same drink in Tesco. The town’s MP Tracey Crouch, chairwoman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Alcohol Misuse, said: ‘I’m very disappointed because this isn’t what their core selling is about. They’re about health and beauty products. ‘They are clearly marketing at young, female consumers and I don’t think it’s a responsible thing to do. I share the concerns about cheap booze in supermarkets and Superdrug is contributing to the issue of people pre-loading before they go out in an evening. ‘They should remove alcohol from their stores. ‘Other shops might follow Superdrug’s lead, which will be damaging for our High Street and won’t help us, as a nation, deal with young people binge drinking on cheap booze.’ Her call was backed last night by Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker, who said: ‘It is not impressive to see a national chain specialising in medicines and health care now dealing in alcohol sales. 'Industry needs to raise its game and do much more to help reduce problem drinking – and retailers have to recognise they have a significant part to play.’ MP Tracey Crouch has attacked the move as 'irresponsible' and a fuel for dangerous binge-drinking culture . The attack comes after supermarkets were criticised for using cheap drink promotions to attract customers. Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged to crack down on promotional deals, which he blamed for increasing anti-social behaviour turning town centres into the ‘Wild West’. Another Superdrug outlet in Tamworth, Staffordshire, is selling Echo Falls red, white and rose wine for £4.19. Meanwhile 70cl bottles of the alcopop Caribbean Twist, which sell for £2.50 in most supermarkets, are promoted as ‘great value’ at £1.79. A store assistant said: ‘The Echo Falls was under £4 recently and the shelves were soon empty. We had to order more. We had San Miguel beer in December and that went quickly.’ But Superdrug managing director Joey Wat defended the alcohol sales, saying it was the only way to stop some branches closing down. Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker and Alcohol Concern have also blasted the prices for encouraging 'pre-loading', when teenagers drink before going out . In a letter responding to concerns raised by Ms Crouch about the Chatham branch, he wrote: ‘We sell alcoholic drinks in a very small number of our stores – only six out of 870. 'There is one reason for the sale of alcohol in these stores – to drive footfall and sales as the six are significant loss-making stores and at serious risk of closure. ‘It is the last resort to save the jobs of our people.’ Superdrug insisted the branches in question do not have pharmacies. But responsible drinking campaigners said Superdrug should not be treating alcoholic beverages like another product to increase profits. Alcohol Concern’s Emily Robinson said: ‘Should shops be selling alcopops and wine beside shampoos and mascaras? This sends out the wrong message about alcohol – it’s not just any product, it can be harmful, addictive and dangerous. 'With alcohol now sold in Superdrug, Argos and a pub on the M40, we would ask the Government whether their licensing rules need to be reconsidered.’ Today Superdrug backtracked over its decision to sell alcohol. A spokesman said: 'We have decided to cease selling alcohol in the five Superdrug stores which currently offer this range. 'The introduction of this category into a very small number of stores was a trial to see if this was a product area our customers wanted us to stock, to ensure the continued viability of these stores and to safeguard jobs on the high street.'","Conservative MP branded store 'irresponsible' for £2.49 wine offer .

"By . Sanchez Manning . NHS bosses have been accused of trying to ‘cover up’ a mistake that delayed paramedics delivering potentially life-saving treatment to an eight-year-old boy who suffered a fatal asthma attack. Clayton Barker started struggling for breath while suffering a serious asthmatic episode at his grand­mother’s house in Oldham on the evening of March 14 last year. His grandmother immediately called 999 for medical help. Clayton Barker suffered a serious asthmatic episode at his grandmother's house in Oldham last year . But an inquest was told on Thursday the operator mistakenly logged the call as a ‘green’ code case, which allows ambulance crews more time to reach a patient, rather than a ‘red’ coded life-threatening emergency. The error meant that paramedics took 23 minutes to reach the schoolboy – arriving around six minutes after he died, despite efforts to resuscitate him by a family friend. Last night, Clayton’s mother Gemma Barker accused North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) of trying to ‘cover up’ the mistakes made on the night of his death. Her comments came after Angela Lee, acting manager of NWAS emergency centre, changed her evidence on the night before the inquest. A catalogue of errors is being blamed for eight-year-old Clayton's death from an asthma attack . Mrs Lee originally submitted a statement to the coroner in June last year saying there were ‘no appro­priate resources’ to send when the call came in at 7.17pm. And she said in a letter to Mrs Barker that no ambulance was ­available until one was eventually dispatched at 7.29. But, on Wednesday, Mrs Lee said she wanted to change the NWAS statement because further study of its records showed a rapid response vehicle was ready at 7.21. She said that, because Clayton’s grandmother’s call was wrongly coded green, this ambulance went to another less serious incident involving a toddler rather than Clayton. Clayton's mother, Gemma Barker has accused North West Ambulance Service of trying to 'cover up' the mistakes made on the night of his death . Mrs Barker, 31, said: ‘When they sent me the letter in the first place they told me they had done all the investigating they could and that the conclusion they came to was that there were no other ambulances available. It does look suspect. ‘When she [Mrs Lee] came up with the extra evidence I just thought it does look like they’re trying to cover it up.’ The inquest was told that, if the ambulance available had been sent at 7.21 it could have reached Clayton by 7.27 or 7.28, offering paramedics a window of between six to eight minutes to treat his asthma attack before he collapsed. Because Clayton's grandmother's call was wrongly coded green, the ambulance went to another less serious incident . But instead a team was sent just before 7.30, arriving at 7.40 – some six minutes after his heart stopped. The inquest was told that the 999 operator, who has more than two years’ experience, misheard Clayton’s grandmother and thought she said he could speak between breaths, when in fact he could not. Mrs Barker, who has two other sons, said she believed the delay in the paramedics’ arrival played a part in the death of Clayton, who had suffered seven serious asthma attacks previously and survived. Offering her condolences to the family, Mrs Lee said the mis-coding of the call was a ‘tragic mistake’. The inquest has been adjourned until next June so that medical experts can be called to determine whether earlier treatment could have saved Clayton’s life. Mrs Barker’s lawyer, Zak Golom­beck, a clinical negligence expert from Slater and Gordon law firm, said: ‘On behalf of Gemma and her family, while the conclusion of  the inquest would have been pref­erable to allow for some closure, the Coroner has made the correct decision to adjourn and seek further evidence to ensure the inquiry will be as full and fearless as it should be.’","Clayton Barker struggled for breath while suffering asthmatic episode .

"By . Sanchez Manning . Britain's canal network is at risk of being ravaged by the Government’s controversial High Speed 2 rail line, campaigners warned yesterday. The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) says the tranquillity of some of Britain’s most idyllic waterways – and canal boat holidays enjoyed by thousands of people each year – will be destroyed by train noise and ugly concrete viaducts built as part of the project. The group has identified more than a dozen historic canals threatened by the building of the HS2 rail line from London to Birmingham and the proposed extension to Leeds and Manchester. Ugly and noisy: What HS2 might look like crossing a peaceful canal in the British countryside, speeding past and creating a cacophony in the once peaceful canal network . Mock-ups of prospective designs for the HS2 trains, which have been widely protested inside and outside of London . These include picturesque Fradley Junction, where the Coventry and Trent and Mersey Canals meet, and neglected waterways such as the Sheffield and Tinsley Canal, which features in the film The Full Monty. The CPRE has called on the Government to move the line away from the canals in its response to the consultation on the proposed Birmingham to Leeds section, which closed on Friday. A spokesman said: ‘Nowhere in the consultation material have they considered the combined impact of all of HS2’s route on the canal network. The CPRE is calling for the route to be changed so it does not get in the way of canals and, where it crosses them, for viaducts to be designed so they fit in with the local scenery.’ Gren Messham, campaigns manager at the Inland Waterways Association, said: ‘These trains are very noisy – between 90 and 100 decibels. Where the rail lines have to cross a canal, HS2 Ltd needs to get better at reducing the noise.’ Stop HS2 protest signs in Wendover, Buckinghamshire. Support for the protests comes from across Britain, with many residents of towns that the HS2 lines will either cut through or go near voicing their concern . A protestor wearing a mask depicting Prime Minister David Cameron demonstrates against the High Speed 2 (HS2) rail line at Parliament on November 25, 2013 in London. Camden has had a large amount of anger towards the prospective high speed train, as it may carve up land both around and below houses . There are major concerns about the waterways at Fradley Junction, Staffordshire, a conservation area and tourist hotspot. The owner of the local Swan pub, Richard O’Kane, 51, said: ‘HS2 will be cutting across the canal and taking this beautiful and highly photographed landmark away from us. I see HS2 as a big threat.’ But in Sheffield, where the local canal has been derelict for years, Gordon Lambert, managing director of narrowboat company Calder Valley Marine, said: ‘The new rail link can only have a good effect. It will bring much-needed prosperity.’ Ben Ruse, spokesman for HS2 Ltd, said: ‘Building a railway that will create thousands of jobs and free up capacity on the country’s rail network is a challenging business, so it is vital we maintain meaningful dialogue with all parties around HS2. It is inevitable that HS2 will cross over a number of waterways along the line of the route. ‘The plans set out in the Environmental Statement accommodate extensive environmental mitigation and are the results of the largest public consultation and engagement scheme ever undertaken in the UK. People have until 27 February to submit their views on the environmental statement.’ The intricate system of canals in Britain would be crisscrossed by the HS2 network, which people are arguing would be a terrific eyesore to the countryside .","HS2 is set to travel through several major British towns, such as Oxford .

"By . Sanchez Manning . Britain could be covered in foreign road signs if a controversial new scheme to standardise their design across Europe is brought in. The UK’s distinctive red-circle speed signs and the ‘no-entry’ symbol as we know it could vanish. Instead we could be made to adopt German and French-style signs, such as a number on a solid  red circle. Halt! Britain could be covered in foreign road signs if a controversial new scheme to standardise designs across Europe is brought in . Can you read these EU warnings? Answers at bottom of page . The changes for A-roads proposed to the European Commission last week are said to be needed to pave the way for ‘intelligent’ cars with cameras able to read road signs and talk to drivers. Some new Volvos and Fords already have the technology. Now the European Road Assessment Programme (EuroRAP) and the independent crash-testing authority EuroNCAP argue that for the system to work effectively across Europe, all EU countries need to use the same signs . The RAC said the plan should be taken seriously and could create ‘a sensible new standard’. But last night politicians called it ‘madness’ which would confuse motorists and waste millions. And here's one we might find useful! There are, as far as we know, no plans to adopt this 'drunken people crossing' sign from Thailand . Eurosceptic Conservative MP Peter Bone said: ‘This is Europe gone mad again. ‘They want to waste British taxpayers’ money on something that won’t make a jot of difference. Nobody has any problems driving around Europe. Why should we all have exactly the same signs? ‘It will cost a lot of money and add a lot of confusion. They’re trying to solve a problem that doesn’t exist.’Tory MP Jason McCartney said predictions of cars reading signs sounded like Tomorrow’s World. Meanwhile, road markings across Europe could also be standardised so that white lines along the edges of A-roads, particularly in rural areas, are a uniform 6in wide. The plan  has raised fears among MPs and local authorities that thousands of miles of roads will need to be repainted, costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds. 'Advanced driver assistance systems are already fitted to cars such as the Ford Kuga and Volvo S60. Cameras recognise signs and transmit warnings to the dashboard... which is why the European bodies want a common ‘language’. Mac McGuire, head of Highways at Cambridgeshire County Council, said: ‘At a time when local authorities are strapped for cash, this is not going to be a priority.’ The Campaign to Protect Rural England warned that new road markings and signs could pose a threat to some of the country’s most idyllic areas. EuroRAP chairman John Dawson said: ‘The technology can stop deaths so you’ve got to start treating lane markings like they matter.’ The Department for Transport insisted the changes would not be implemented.","New designs needed for 'intelligent' car cameras, says Euro road group .

"By . Sanchez Manning . and Ben Ellery . A Health Minister last night led calls for a ban on ‘dangerous’ mobile phone apps that encourage young people to binge-drink. Norman Lamb, the Lib Dem Minister for Care, called on Google and Apple to launch an urgent investigation into ‘irresponsible’ drinking games sold through their online markets, which could fuel drink-related health problems and anti-social behaviour. The intervention came after a Mail on Sunday investigation uncovered hundreds of alcohol-related apps and promotions on social media sites that critics say target youngsters and popularise excessive drinking. Excess: The Let's Get Wasted app, left, on Google Play asks players to tap in what alcohol they have to hand . Binge drinking: It then randomly selects a player and they are instructed to drink what the app suggests . This newspaper identified more than 340 alcohol-related apps available to download on the Google and Apple stores. Some . of them have been downloaded tens of thousands of times by British . users, many of whom are suspected to be under the age of 18. Examples . of drinking games online include Let’s Get Wasted on Google Play, which . has  been downloaded 8,000 times in the UK, either for free or for just . 83p. Players tap in the types of alcohol they have to hand and choose a cartoon character as their avatar. Designer: Chris Gabler, 23, from Vienna, developed the Let's Get Wasted app . The game then selects a player roulette-style and they are instructed to drink what the app suggests. Volumes are decided at random. Players monitor their alcohol levels through stages including ‘tipsy’, ‘boozy’, ‘well-oiled’, ‘drunk’ and ‘loaded.’ If a player refuses a drink, the game makes a ‘chicken’ noise. The winner is the first to reach the final stage of ‘wasted’. Developer Chris Gabler, 23, from Vienna, said: ‘I was looking at the Play store for a drinking game so I decided to make my own. ‘The responses were very positive. On a weekend, about 2,500 people all over the world play my drinking game.’ Other games such as King of Booze and Bomba Drink - both of which are drinking challenges featuring cartoon characters and video game-style graphics - are currently being sold through Apple’s App Store. A recent Australian study found that the majority of alcohol-related apps for mobile phones or tablet computers fell into ‘entertainment’ categories rather than ‘health’. Researchers from the Burnet Institute in Melbourne said: ‘The majority of popular alcohol-related apps encouraged alcohol consumption.’ After The Mail on Sunday alerted him to the games, Mr Lamb said: ‘It’s pretty abhorrent and I condemn those organisations because it promotes behaviour which has a massive impact on our A&E departments and police forces. 'The damage that it can do is immense, so I think the people who promote these apps should think again.’ Concern: Norman Lamb, left, has called on Google, right, and Apple to launch an urgent investigation into 'irresponsible' drinking games sold through their online markets . Conservative MP Andrew Percy, a member of the Health Select Committee, called the apps ‘dangerous’ and backed Mr Lamb’s call for a ban. Ben Shields, 24, whose teenage brother Mark died after drinking three pints of beer and eight double spirits in 40 minutes, said: ‘I’m appalled apps which encourage young people to get wasted are being marketed in their thousands by Google. ‘I have learnt first-hand just how dangerous alcohol can be.’ Google said: ‘Apps that focus on consumption or sale of alcohol must be rated “high maturity” so parents can control their children’s access to them.’ Apple last night declined to comment.","Let's Get Wasted app asks players to tap in what alcohol they have to hand .

"By . Sanchez Manning . Britain’s National Parks and beauty spots are under ‘unprecedented threat’ of being built upon due to the Government’s relaxation of planning laws, campaigners will warn tomorrow. The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) says that more than 30 formerly protected areas are being considered or approved for large scale housing projects or developments which could leave a permanent scar on the countryside. More than ten National Parks face being blighted by construction schemes, while designated Areas of Outstanding Natural beauty (AONB) across home counties such as Kent, Essex and Sussex are also at risk, campaigners say. Ashdown Forest: The Sussex beauty spot of Crowborough, in the High Weald area, is under threat. A scheme to build 200 new homes on three sites in the town is being considered by Weald District Council but has sparked major opposition . Applications to build on ‘so-called protected areas’ have increased rapidly since the Government reformed planning rules in March last year, making it easier for developers to get permission to build. CPRE president Sir Andrew Motion is expected to call on the Government to look again at the policy changes and consider providing extra protection for the most beautiful countryside. They say among the National Parks under threat are the South Downs, the Yorkshire Dales, Dartmoor and the Lake District. More building work is also planned to take place in a large number of AONBs in the North Pennines and Surrey Hills. Iconic: The White Cliffs of Dover could also see development. Farthingloe and the Western Heights are part of the famed area. 521 homes, a 90-apartment retirement village, health centre, hotel and conference centre were given the go-ahead in June . South Downs: Sunset over Fulking Escarpmen but Upper Stoneham farm has proposals for a solar panel farm. The area, part of the South Downs National Park is two miles from Anne of Cleves' home and the historic town of Lewes. A 50-acre solar farm could be built over fields . Hawkhurst: Developers have been trying to build 120 new homes. The plans, which have been fought by 'Save Our Village' campaigners, were initially rejected  by the parish council, but the developers have since appealed the decision . The report highlights: . The CPRE says one of the worst affected areas is the High Weald, which runs through Kent, East Sussex and Surrey. Farmsteads, woodlands, open heaths and ancient routeways within this site are being threatened by proposals to build 650 houses.

A number of the homes are proposed to be built around historic towns and villages such as Cranbrook and Hawkhurst in Kent. Meanwhile, some 200 of the properties may be erected in the East Sussex town of Crowborough on the doorstop of Ashdown Forest where A.A. Milne’s Winnie the Pooh books are set. And a controversial housing development in the historic rural village of Long Preston in the Yorkshire Dales received planning permission earlier this month. The CPRE’s Neil Sinden said: ‘The National Parks and AONBs are judged to be the most beautiful landscapes and they’re what people think about when you talk about the countryside. We’ve gathered dozens of examples of large scale development in these locations. It’s the biggest single threat to the so-called protected areas for decades.’ Mr Sinden said the balance has decisively tipped in favour of the developers and ‘because of these recent planning changes the scale of the pressure is unprecedented’. He urged the Government to act on the CPRE’s report, saying: ‘We’re trying to raise the profile of this unprecedented level of threat to our most treasured countryside.’ But a spokesman for the Department of Local Government and Communities, which formulates national planning policy, rejected the CPRE’s claims calling its report ‘misleading’. He said: ‘Strong planning protections remain in place for National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The best way to support this is to ensure local people who know their areas best are included in decisions about their future.’","Campaign to Protect Rural England says 30 areas considered for development .

"By . Sanchez Manning . Madeleine McCann’s parents say the ‘pieces of the jigsaw’ are  fitting together in the investigation to solve the mystery of their daughter’s disappearance after the discovery of fresh ‘substantive’ evidence. Kate and Gerry McCann’s comments yesterday came as detectives revealed they have ‘the most complete picture to date’ of what happened when Madeleine, then aged three, went missing in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz on the night of May 3, 2007. Scotland Yard, which in July launched a new full inquiry into the disappearance of Madeleine, says it has discovered new material  after trawling through mobile phone calls made by people in the resort in the days before she vanished. Crimewatch: A new appeal will be launched later this month to find missing Madeleine McCann . The breakthrough will be revealed in a Crimewatch TV special due to be shown on October 14 as part of a fresh appeal for information. Kate and Gerry, who will feature in the show, said they were ‘greatly encouraged’ by the new evidence. In a joint statement, they said: ‘We are really hopeful the forthcoming appeal on Crimewatch will bring further new evidence which will take us a step closer to finding Madeleine and to bringing those responsible for her abduction to justice.’ In the programme, police will outline a new theory they say will give a ‘different understanding’ about the case. Detective Inspector Andy Redwood, the senior investigating officer, said: ‘We believe we have the most complete picture to date of the events surrounding her disappearance. New evidence: DCI Andy Redwood believes they have the 'most complete' picture to date . 'We are making targeted and new appeals for help from the public. I believe there are people out there who hold the key to Madeleine’s disappearance, and that so far they may be unaware of that fact. ‘Through this latest round of  publicity we hope to take the next step forward. There is a huge public desire to help us.’ Hopeful: Kate McCann is encouraged by Scotland Yard's findings . The log of mobile phone traffic analysed by Scotland Yard is made up of thousands of calls from people who live in 31 countries. As a result, detectives have contacted police forces across the world to identify anyone who was at the Portuguese resort when Madeleine went missing. Officers have established that  the majority of holidaymakers in the resort were from the UK, Ireland, Holland and Germany. As a result, the TV special will be aired on British, German and Dutch television. It will feature an interview with the McCanns, while highlighting new leads uncovered by police. The programme will also feature  a reconstruction of events in the  Portuguese resort on the night Madeleine disappeared. However, Kate and Gerry have banned the re-enactment of their daughter’s disappearance from  taking place in Portugal through fear of angering the country’s police. Instead they have allowed filming to go ahead in neighbouring Spain, with actors playing the roles of the anguished couple. A three-year-old child actress, bearing a striking similarity to their daughter, will double as Madeleine. Crimewatch editor Joe Mather said: ‘We are very hopeful this major reconstruction, along with the substantial new lines of enquiry, will prompt viewers with vital information to get in touch with officers in the studio.’","Scotland Yard trawled calls made by people staying in the holiday resort .

"By . Ap . and Daily Mail Reporter . President Barack Obama warned North Korea on Saturday that the United States 'will not hesitate to use our military might' to defend allies, showcasing U.S. power in the region amid China's growing influence and Pyongyang's unpredictable nuclear threats. Obama's visit to Seoul comes as North Korea has threatened to conduct its fourth nuclear test, leading Obama to raise the possibility of further sanctions. 'The commitment that the United States of America has made to the security of the Republic of Korea only grows stronger in the face of aggression,' Obama said in a speech to some of the 28,000 American service members stationed in South Korea to keep watch on its northern neighbor. 'Our alliance does not waiver with each bout of their attention seeking. It just gains the support of the rest of the world.' Warning: Obama says he 'will not hesitate' to use force against North Korea . The website 38 North, which closely monitors North Korea, said commercial satellite imagery from Wednesday showed increased movement of vehicles and materials near what are believed to be the entrances to two completed tunnels at Punggye-ri nuclear test site. The movements could be preparations for an underground atomic explosion, although predicting underground tests is notoriously difficult. Obama ridiculed North Korea's attempt to show force. 'Anybody can make threats,' he said. 'Anyone can move an army. Anyone can show off a missile. That doesn't make you strong.'

'We don't use our military might to impose these things on others, but we will not hesitate to use our military might to defend our allies and our way of life,' Obama said to cheers from the uniformed troops who filled a field house at Yongsan Garrison, headquarters for U.S. forces in South Korea. Obama's 10-minute speech followed a rare joint defense briefing with South Korean President Park Geun-hye that focused on efforts to counter the North's nuclear ambitions. U.S. Army Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, the commander of the joint U.S.-South Korea command, told the two presidents that his team 'works together every day to make sure that we defend the Republic of Korea and that we deter North Korea.' Following his remarks, Obama was heading to Malaysia, the third stop on his four-country Asia swing. The mission of the trip was to underscore U.S. commitment to the region at a period of uncertainty between North Korea's provocations and China's growing power. While the U.S. has long been the most powerful military influence in the Asia-Pacific region, Pentagon spending is being slashed at the same time China has been boosting its defense budget. Beijing still lags far behind the U.S. in both military funding and technology. But its spending boom is attracting new scrutiny at a time of severe cuts in U.S. defense budgets that have some questioning Washington's commitments to its Asian allies, including some who have lingering disputes with China.

At the same time, the U.S. military is seeking to redirect resources to the Asia-Pacific as it draws down its commitment in Afghanistan, though there is concern that budget cuts could threaten plans to base 60 percent of U.S. naval assets in the region. Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Jonathan Greenert recently warned that U.S. capabilities to project power 'would not stay ahead' of potential adversaries, given the fiscal restraints. Earlier Saturday, Obama promoted trade between the U.S. and South Korea with executives from businesses including Hyundai, Samsung, Korean Air, Microsoft, Boeing, Goldman Sachs and others. 'As important as the security relationship is and the alliance is between the Republic of Korea and the United States, what is also important is the incredible and growing economic ties that are creating jobs and opportunity in both countries,' Obama said.

"By . Sanchez Manning . They are the £250 trainers that have won a host of celebrity  fans, convinced by promises that they improve posture and reduce back pain. But now a scientific study has shown that the MBT shoes favoured by stars such as Madonna, Paris Hilton and Gwyneth Paltrow have no benefits for sufferers of lower back pain – and in some cases can make problems worse. The findings will be especially embarrassing for the company behind the footwear – because it funded the research. Paris Hilton in her pair of pink MBTs. They are said to improve balance and increase muscle sensitivity . MBT stands for Masai Barefoot Technology and the shoes have a curved ‘rocker’ sole which is said to mimic the effect of walking without footwear on soft sand or grass. Despite their chunky appearance, manufacturers say their health benefits include improving balance and increasing muscle activity. But almost two decades after they were launched in 1996, scientists  have discovered that they are no better for people with lower back pain than traditional sports shoes. The damning report states: ‘Rocker sole footwear has been marketed with persuasive advertising suggesting that use of this footwear leads to a reduction in low back pain. Manufacturers claim that the unstable curved sole can positively influence mechanisms associated with chronic lower back pain, such as poor balance, sub-standard muscle function [and] poor posture . ‘Manufacturers claim that the unstable curved sole can positively influence mechanisms associated with chronic lower back pain, such as poor balance, sub-standard muscle function [and] poor posture. ‘However, there is no evidence in the literature supporting these claims.’ Researchers at King’s College London, Hertfordshire University and two London hospitals recruited 115 people who suffer from chronic lower back pain to wear either a rocker sole shoe or a standard trainer for at least two hours each day while standing and walking. After assessing the participants, the scientists concluded: . lRocker sole shoes appear to be no more beneficial than flat sole shoes in reducing pain in people with chronic lower back problems. lIf a person’s lower back pain is  predominately aggravated by standing or walking, it may be more beneficial to wear a flat-sole shoe. Celebrity fans include fitness fanatics Madonna (left) and Gwyneth Paltrow (right) lThose given flat-soled shoes were more satisfied with their trainers than those given MBTs. The findings, which are due to be published in the journal Spine in October, will add to the woes of MBT, coming just 18 months after the Swiss parent company filed for bankruptcy. Abel Galindo Muniz, from MBT’s medical academy, challenged the report’s findings, saying that hundreds of thousands of customers had reported that their back pain had been helped by the use of the shoes. He said: ‘There are many studies published in medical journals showing the benefits in balance, posture, muscle activation, blood circulation and  impact absorption.’ He added: ‘We always say in our claims that it “may” help lower back pain. Like all health and fitness tools, for many people it does help and for some it does not.’ Other famous names said to wear MBTs include Jodie Kidd, Heidi Klum, Sadie Frost, Jemima Khan and actress Mischa Barton.","Study shows the MBT shoes have no benefits for sufferers of back pain .

Former England striker Shearer told ESPN last week that Brazil first choice centre forward was slow, cannot shoot and should be replaced in the Selecao XI. Despite having a good scoring record for Brazil over the last year, Fluminense forward Fred is not known for his mobility and drew a blank in Brazil's first two games, a 3-1 win over Croatia and a 0-0 draw with Mexico.

Shots/On Target: 1/1 . Fouls won: 3 . 'I just don't understand why Brazil are still picking him,' Shearer said. 'He doesn't move, he doesn't shoot and he's dragging the team down. 'I don't know if Brazil should change the system or play Neymar as a false nine, but the fact is that Fred is not the answer for what they are doing now.' And Shearer's comments appear to have riled the Brazil squad with Alves hitting back in support of his international team-mate on Saturday, saying a former professional should know better than to criticise. 'Those comments are some of the most idiotic that anyone can ever say,' Alves told reporters at Brazil's base camp just outside Rio de Janeiro. 'Someone who played football, who knows how difficult it is to be a football player, how difficult it is to beat opponents, compete, score goals - it's a shame for football and a lack of respect for his colleagues that play the game. It's something to be ashamed of.' Misfiring: Fred had a good Confederations Cup but has struggled to light up the World Cup .

Brazil sit top of Group A ahead of their final group game against Cameroon, with the team that tops the group to face either Chile or the Netherlands in the last 16. The Selecao have been criticised in the media for their lacklustre performances so far - they required a soft penalty to give them the lead against Croatia - and Alves expressed concern at what he said might be unreal expectations. 'Fans want to the team to win, scoring five, 10 goals so when we don't manage that they read things very differently from us, because they act with emotion and we act with a bit more criteria. 'We think that our fans have created a huge amount of expectation in the team and we are clearly working to provide answers to those expectations. 'People are normally very pessimistic and they're tremendously negative, but we need to stay faithful and defend the work we're doing, which I think is very well done.'

England's number one: Webb has taken charge of some of the most important games in recent years . And despite criticism of refereeing in the Premier League from the likes of Jose Mourinho, Dyke spoke of his pride at the quality of England's referees. 'Howard Webb, Mike Mullarkey and Darren Cann will be England's refereeing trio in Brazil and are rightly regarded as among the best in the world,' he said.

"By . Luke Salkeld . It does not look, or sound, particularly appetising. But after milkshakes and smoothies comes a new drink called Soylent – and its inventors claim it could spell ‘the end of food’. Invented by an American entrepreneur Rob Rhinehart, who was frustrated by the amount of time it takes to prepare and eat normal meals, it is claimed the drink contains all the necessary nutrition we need. To its first 30,000 customers, Soylent comes in white boxes containing pouches of powder and small containers of oil. The future of nutrition? Entrepreneur Rob Rhinehart claims his powder the drink contains all the necessary nutrition we need. File picture . Mixing the two with water then gives the drinker 2,000 calories in liquid form, according its makers. It is claimed that essential fats come from canola oil, carbohydrates from a food additive called maltodextrin and oat flour, while rice provides the protein. Vitamins, minerals and rich oils are added to the mix. Mr Rhinehart, a 25-year-old software engineer, says the drink is ‘delicious’ and described traditional solid foodstuffs as the ‘fossil fuel of human energy’. But scientist have been expressing their doubts. Ashley Blackshaw, a professor in enteric neuroscience at Queen Mary, University of London, says ‘all sorts of trace elements and phytochemicals, such as lycopene which is found in tomatoes, are missing’ from Soylent. He says these elements are often found in plants and many are just beginning to be understood. Lycopene, for example, has been linked to lower rates of prostate cancer. And he told a newspaper: ‘There’s the issue over the link between the efficient bacterial fermentation in the colon and cancer. Obsolete? The inventor described traditional solid foodstuffs as the 'fossil fuel of human energy' ‘Everything in there is very finely balanced and out gut has evolved over millions of years, and if I even had a suspicion of a history of colon cancer, I’d stay away from a product like this.’ He added: ‘There is more and more work being done on the links between food and mood. ‘A shortcut like Soylent throws all that out the window. ‘We have to remember comfort food isn’t just a luxury to spoil ourselves with, but something that scientifically, we are increasingly seeing as something that should be part of our daily life.’ Carbohydrates (200g): Protein (50g): Fat (65g): Sodium (2.4g): Potassium (3.5g): Chloride (3.4g): Fibre (5g): Calcium (1g): Iron (18mg): Iodine (150ug): Magnesium (400mg): Zinc (15mg): Selenium (70ug): Copper (2mg): Manganese (2mg): Chromium (120ug): Molybdenum (75ug):  Vitamin A (5000IU):  Vitamin B6 (2mg): Vitamin B12 (6ug):  Vitamin C (60mg): Vitamin D (400IU): Vitamin E (30IU): Vitamin K (80ug): Thiamin (1.5mg): Riboflavin (1.7mg): Niacin (20mg): Folate (400ug): Biotin (300ug): Panthothenic Acid (10mg): Plus extras not considered essential:  Lycopene (500ug): Omega-3 Fatty Acids(750mg): Ginseng (50ug): Gingko Biloba (100ug): Lutein (500ug): Alpha Carotene (140ug): Vanadium (100ug)","Inventor Rob Rhinehart was fed up with the time and money spent cooking .

"By . Luke Salkeld . E-cigarettes with sweet flavours are being targeted at school children and could get them hooked on nicotine, it has been claimed. The devices are rapidly becoming the subject of school bans after the introduction of flavours including strawberry, chocolate, candy-floss and vanilla fudge. Their increasing appeal has been likened by critics to the surge in sales of alcopops after the sweet flavoured alcoholic beverages became widely popular among young drinkers with a sweet tooth. E-cigarettes with sweet flavours are being targeted at school children, critics have claimed today . E-cigarettes do not contain tobacco, so are not covered by legislation which has banned smoking in enclosed places across the UK. Instead an electronic inhaler vaporises liquid nicotine. They are currently legally sold to under 18s, and are often cheaper than traditional cigarettes. Although they do not contain the harmful tar found in normal cigarettes, experts fear they could encourage young people to swap to tobacco. And many schools have already banned them. One of them, Highfield Humanities College in Blackpool, does not allow them on the premises. Deputy head Sara Dewhurst explained: ‘The reason for the ban is over concerns that pupils could be encouraged to start smoking.’ And Andy Sievewright, from Acton High School in West London last year wrote to parents: ‘Young people who use e-cigarettes could easily become addicted to nicotine and progress to smoking.’ E-cigarettes have been widely used by celebrities, with fans apparently including Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Moss, Lily Allen and Cheryl Cole. And the sweet flavours are said to add to the appeal. A E-cigarettes are now being made in a variety of sweet flavours, critics have compared them to alcopops - which are popular with young people as they are sweet (library image) Ella Williams, 18, from Dorchester, Dorset, told the Sun: ‘It’s a social thing. ‘Everyone was talking about e-cigarettes so I tried one of my brother’s. ‘It was strawberry flavour which I liked. I’ve also tried the menthol one.’ She added: ‘E-cigs are cool because you can smoke them indoors and there is no smell to them, so it’s good to do with your friends on a night out.’ Last month the Welsh Government proposed banning the use of e-cigarettes in public places due to fears it could normalise smoking among the young. An American study of nearly 40,000 youths found that teenagers who had tried an e-cigarette at least once were six times more likely to try tobacco. Dr Ram Moorthy, a spokesman for the British Medical Association, said yesterday: ‘Ultimately these devices do contain nicotine and young people smoking them are developing a habit which they could potentially be stuck with for life.’ He told a newspaper: ‘It is also concerning that these devices so closely mimic cigarettes, which is normalising smoking just when the smoking ban has done so much to make it socially unacceptable. ‘There have been very worrying reports that teenagers have been asking for e-cigarettes for Christmas presents and that they have become commonplace in the playground.’ He added: ‘We want to see legislation banning e-cigarette sales to under-18s brought in as soon as possible, and see it strongly enforced.’","E-cigarettes now come in strawberry, chocolate, candy-floss flavours .

Gareth Williams, 47, installed tiny hidden spy cameras in clocks, fans and toilet cisterns in order to obtain pictures and videos of boys without their knowledge. The married father of four even put a camera in the changing rooms on school sports day in order to catch as many children as possible. Gareth Williams was jailed for five years for filming children in the toilets and showers of his school with secret spy cameras - but he is still being paid by education authorities, months after he pleaded guilty . Cardiff Crown Court heard that Gareth Williams installed secret cameras in the school toilet on sports day to catch as many children as possible . Cardiff Crown Court heard that Williams was appointed deputy headmaster at Glantaf High School in 2008, one year before the first indecent images were recorded . A court heard how Williams also . installed cameras in two private homes, as well as the large mixed . school where he worked, for his sexual gratification. He was investigated by police after computer specialists found he had been buying illegal images of children  on the internet. Officers . who searched his home found two laptops and 11 memory sticks  along . with the pinhole camera gear  and software he had installed with the aim . of browsing the  internet undetected. Williams, . from Cardiff, was deputy head of Glantaf Welsh-language high school in . the city, where former pupils include Hornblower actor Ioan Gruffudd and . former Blue Peter presenter Gethin Jones. The court heard a total of 31 boys at the 1,300-strong school aged between 11 and 16 were caught on Williams’s cameras. Cardiff Crown Court heard he had 16,419 indecent images of children and 691 videos. The court heard some of the images dated back to 2009 – a year after he was appointed deputy head at the school. The court heard that Williams had 16,419 indecent images of children and 691 videos at his home in Cardiff . Prosecutor . Michael Jones said of the images relating to the voyeurism charges: . ‘All these images were of children exposed as they were using the . lavatory or the showers. ‘They . had also been uploaded to a computer and catalogued by their age at the . time the children were filmed. Officers discovered images of young . males and the school’s badge could be seen. ‘They had been filmed in the changing facilities in the  school sports hall.’ Williams, . who concealed one camera as a meter on the water cistern, even filmed . himself on some of the videos as he secretly installed his devices. Mr . Jones explained: ‘On one of the videos he is seen crossing his fingers . as he put it up. It showed he is hoping the camera is capturing the best . possible images.’ Mr Jones . continued: ‘This was a serious systematic abuse of trust. A devious and . determined invasion of privacy of the children. The effect on children, . staff and parents was one of complete and utter disbelief.’ Williams . pleaded guilty to 31 charges of voyeurism and the making and possession . of more than 16,000 indecent images of children. The voyeurism charge . states Williams recorded other persons  for the purpose of sexual . gratification. Williams had . also been coach of an under-15 rugby team and helped out with a scout . group, while his duties at the school where he worked included . ‘pastoral care’. In police interviews Williams said he had been looking at child images for ten years ‘to understand physical development’. He also admitted an ‘enduring interest in boys’ development’ but couldn’t explain why. He admitted it had become an obsession. After . he was sentenced, his wife Georgina said in a statement: ‘I feel . physically sick at what he has done to me and my family. I was . shell-shocked and my whole world came crashing down.’ A judge sentenced Williams to five years at Cardiff Crown Court (pictured), describing his actions as 'depraved' Judge Rhys Rowlands told Williams: ‘This is a dreadful and protracted breach of trust on  your behalf. ‘As . a result of your depraved behaviour you have lost your career, . livelihood and reputation. But this is nothing compared to the worry and . real horror which is felt by parents who have trusted their children to . you.’ The judge also ordered Williams to sign the sex offenders’  register, banning him from working with children. He said: ‘I cannot conceive that you will ever be able to return to your previous occupation.’ The governors at the school said they had been ‘dismayed’ by the revelations. In . a joint statement with Cardiff Council they said: ‘The sense of . betrayal and disappointment among the pupils, staff and wider school . community is profound. This has been a very distressing episode for all . concerned.’ Catrin Davies, . from the Crown Prosecution Service Wales, said: ‘The offences committed . by Gareth Williams constituted a gross breach of the trust placed in him . by those close to him, his community, his pupils and  his employers.’","Teacher bought spy cameras over the internet and installed them in the toilet .

The BBC’s sacking of a veteran DJ after he accidentally played a song featuring the N-word has had such an impact on his health that he may not work in radio again, it emerged yesterday. David Lowe, 67, has a condition known as a dystonic tremor which he says has worsened significantly since he was punished for broadcasting a 1930s recording of The Sun Has Got His Hat On. The corporation was forced to apologise to the presenter for its poor handling of the situation and offered him his job back. David Lowe (pictured with his wife Jenny), 67, has a condition known as a dystonic tremor which he says has worsened significantly since he was punished for broadcasting a 1930s recording of The Sun Has Got His Hat On . But Mr Lowe, who had been with the BBC for 32 years, said he could not accept what he called the ‘magnanimous gesture’ because his condition – which is rooted in the central nervous system – had deteriorated through stress. Mr Lowe lost his job after he played a recording of the song by Ambrose & His Orchestra on his Sunday night show on Radio Devon. The version includes the line: ‘He’s been tanning n****** out in Timbuktu, now he’s coming to do the same to you.’ The programme, for which Mr Lowe was paid £5,000 a year, had an estimated audience of tens of thousands. It is understood that only one person complained and that Mr Lowe, who was unaware the word was in the lyrics, planned to apologise to listeners on his next programme. However he was prevented from doing so by bosses who asked him to ‘fall on his sword’. The sacking came shortly after Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson received a telling off from BBC executives after unbroadcast footage emerged of him apparently mumbling the word. Yesterday Mr Lowe, who lives with his wife Jenny, 69, in Torquay, said his poor health means he had ‘respectfully declined’ to go back to his old job. He told the Daily Mail: ‘When I’m faced with unexpected stress, this exacerbates the condition. ‘It will take me a long time to get back to the way I was before all of this blew up, so I really must put my health first.’ He said he had been ‘compelled to pay the ultimate price’ for falling foul of ‘today’s unforgiving obsession with political correctness’. Mrs Lowe said: ‘The tremor affects David’s upper body, his head, his eyes, and his hands. It has got worse since this all happened.’ The BBC said: ‘We accept that the discussion with David Lowe about his future could have been handled better.’ Mr Lowe said he had received messages of support from across the world. And former Radio Devon manager Roy Corlett said: ‘It was an accident and for someone to lose their job is disgraceful.’","David Lowe, 67, lost his job after he played a recording of the song .

But one said: ‘Apparently we’re the ones ruining the school’s reputation – but we aren’t the ones having sexual relations in the headmaster’s office.’ A special assembly has been held at the school to tell pupils to ignore the video and focus on their exams. Scene: The video, featuring sounds of moaning, was allegedly filmed at Bryn Tawe School (above) in Swansea . They have been told there is an . external investigation under way and the matter will be dealt with ‘in . the fairest way possible’. Mrs Bale was linked to the case by angry parents. She was not at the home she shares with husband Carl yesterday and neighbours said the pair had ‘gone away’. She later answered her mobile phone but refused to comment when the allegations were put to her. Headmaster: Married Mr Daniels (pictured) and Mrs Bale are said to be 'close' and pupils claim to have seen them together at a McDonald's restaurant . Married Mr Daniels and Mrs Bale are said to be ‘close’ and the two were recently judges of a reading challenge at the 750-pupil school. Mrs Bale lives in a £150,000 detached house at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac in Pontardawe, north of Swansea. There was no one at the house yesterday. A neighbour said: ‘Bethan is away and I don’t know when she will be back.’ The neighbour, who did not want to be named, added that her husband Carl was also not at home but he did not know if they were away together. Mr Daniels has refused to  comment on the allegations and was not at his £350,000 detached bungalow in Ammanford yesterday. Wife Heledd, 50, a mother of three, answered the door and said her husband was out. She said she did not want to speak about the case. Heini Gruffudd, the chairman of governors, said: ‘The school has received a complaint which did not name anyone involved. ‘Following this the governing body is holding an investigation, in co-operation with the local authority. The head teacher and another member of staff are currently suspended and Simon Davies, currently deputy head teacher, will be managing the school for the time being. ‘The school is running normally and we won’t be commenting further at this time.’ 'Running normally': Deputy head Simon Davies is managing the school while an investigation takes place . Bryn Tawe’s latest Estyn report – the Welsh equivalent of Ofsted – awarded it a rare ‘double-excellent’ status. The Welsh-medium secondary school, which means Welsh is the first language, was praised by inspectors and they singled out Mr Daniels for his contribution. ‘The vision and strategic direction provided by the headteacher is excellent, with a clear and sustained focus on maintaining and achieving high standards,’ they said, adding that he was ‘supported by an enthusiastic senior management team’.","Headmaster Graham Daniels, 50, suspended over an alleged 'sex tape'

"By . Luke Salkeld . If grey skies and rain ruined your fun over the Easter break, the next few days could make up for it. This Bank Holiday weekend, forecasters are predicting dry and fine weather for many. Temperatures as high as 20C are expected in south-eastern England on Monday. Three-year-old Tallulah Ferguson enjoys running through the flowers as the country gears up for a sunny Bank Holiday weekend . But across the UK, tomorrow is the best bet for catching rays. After a potentially frosty night, temperatures will reach the mid-teens in the West and South West, while it will be cooler in the East with cloud and some rain in the North and Scotland. The South will see warm weather into Monday, when it will bask in temperatures near 18C. In inland parts of the South East, the mercury is set to reach 20C, with breezes cooling coastal areas. Eddy Carroll, of the Met Office, said: ‘It looks as though much of the UK will enjoy some pleasant spring weather this weekend. ‘Although the nights and mornings will be chilly, it should feel pleasantly warm in the daytime sunshine. ‘The best of that warm sunshine is likely across central and southern parts of England. ‘Northern parts of UK look set to have some rather changeable conditions, but even here there will be some brighter and drier spells, especially in the east.’ Leon Brown, of The Weather Channel, added: ‘Through to Bank Holiday Monday, central and southern Britain will be dry and fine with plenty of sunshine under high pressure. ‘Beware a widespread ground frost and some air frosts on Saturday morning.’ ‘Gradually, though, it will become warmer, with afternoon temperatures of 15C to 17C by Sunday and 18C to 19C by Monday in central and western areas.’ A display of azaleas and rhododendrons after they bloomed two weeks early at Exbury in the New Forest, Hampshire .

"By . Luke Salkeld . This is the latest - and cutest - development in wildlife photography... the animal selfie. One was taken by a little lamb which used its nose to touch the screen of a smart phone which had been placed on the ground by a farmer. The other is the work of an inquisitive otter which grabbed at a camera to show just how clever he is with his hands. Flash, bang, wallop: Musa the otter snatches a photographer's camera to catch a classic selfie pose . Sheepish: The Greyfaced Dartmoor lamb used its nose to push the screen of a smartphone on the ground . Normally associated with celebrities and social networks, these pictures offer a far more natural approach to the photographic genre which has become increasingly popular across the world. And perhaps it is no surprise that one of them was taken by an animal known for following the herd. Farmer David Fursdon had placed his handset on the floor of a barn to bottle feed another animal when the three-week-old lamb decided to investigate the gadget. The Greyfaced Dartmoor lamb, which has not yet been named, apparently pressed his nose against the phone's touch screen, taking a picture of himself. Mr Fursden, who lives near Exeter, Devon, posted the image on Twitter, explaining: 'He managed to borrow the phone to take a selfie. Musa and a companion peered excitedly into the lens at Washington Wetlands Centre in Tyne and Wear . Owen Humphreys, the photographer whose camera was nabbed, said Musa 'snatched it in both paws' 'He nicked the phone while I was bottle feeding his sister! He's bright!' The 61-year-old added: 'I was just topping them up with the bottle because the ewe is only producing milk from one of her udders. 'I tried to take a photograph of the ewe but she was a bit suspicious of the phone and she didn't like it much. 'But then the lamb's bossy brother came barging in and was really engaged by the phone. He was certainly not camera shy.' Meanwhile, Musa, an otter at the WWT Washington Wetland Centre in Tyne and Wear, grabbed the kit of professional photographer Owen Humphreys, who explained: 'I had just put the camera down and the otter came up to the bars and snatched it in both paws. This little Exeter lamb, which has yet to be named, made farmers on Fursdon Estate burst out laughing . He was fumbling around the hay on the ground when he happened upon David Fursdon's phone . 'The female otter was in the background and didn't seem too interested in him showing off. 'I burst out laughing when I saw it and knew it would have taken a funny picture. 'The craze for selfies has gone mad.' Dan Baker, grounds and facilities manager at the centre, said: 'They are very playful and inquisitive animals. 'In the wild they tend to live in family units so they are quite happy being in people's company and interact with visitors. Catriona Fursdon of the Fursdon Estate near Exeter, Devon, was shocked when she noticed the selfie . 'Musa loves shiny pebbles and his trick is to lie on his back and do a juggling act with them.' A 'selfie' is the name given to a self-portrait photograph, typically taken using a hand-held digital camera or camera phone, and posted on social networking sites. The most famous one ever taken was by this year's Oscars host Ellen DeGeneres, and included a group of Hollywood A-listers. The poses are often casual, taken with the camera held at arm's length or into a mirror, and typically feature only the person- or animal - taking the picture. A recent survey showed that Britons take around 35million 'selfies' a month.","Greyfaced Dartmoor lamb in Exeter, Devon, used nose to work smartphone .

"By . Luke Salkeld . Among Britain’s biggest and best known stags, The Monarch was a proud, dignified beast. But his 16-year life has come to an ignominious end after being shot at by bungling poachers. Illegal hunters put the handsome red deer in their sights on a private estate in the New Forest in a suspected attempt to snatch his spectacular 16-point antlers, worth around £1,000. But they never got their hands on him. Magnificent: The Monarch, was badly wounded by a shot to the head for a low-calibre gun. He fled to the safety of a lake, where he later drowned . Sad demise: The Monarch's lifeless body is retrieved from Burley Park lake in the New Forest, Hampshire . Loss: The Monarch (left) was owned by Dan Tanner (right). The stag was often spotted by visitors on the popular New Forest Deer Safari tours run by the farmer . Whoever pulled the trigger used a . firearm with insufficient power to kill the animal instantly and the . wounded beast is thought to have bolted off in agony before drowning in a . nearby lake. His body has . now been fished out of the water and the hunters have become the hunted . as police investigate  the stag’s death. It is thought the calibre of . the rifle used to target the stag was too low and the bullet simply . ricocheted off its huge skull. Faced with danger, deer often head for . sanctuary in water as they are strong swimmers. The . Monarch, who stood over 8ft from his hooves to the tip of his antlers . and weighed around 25 stone, was so well known in the New Forest that . gift shops sell souvenirs including mugs, clocks and jewellery with his . picture on. His untimely death comes three years after another of . Britain’s biggest known stags – the Emperor of Exmoor – vanished. The . red deer is the UK’s largest land mammal and can live to around 18 . years. Missing their stag: The Monarch was the largest of 40 red deer (pictured) owned by Dan Tanner at Burley Park near Ringwood in Hampshire . Fame: The Monarch was so well known in the New Forest that gift shops sell souvenirs with pictures of him on it including mugs, clocks and jewellery . The red deer is the largest land animal in Britain - with stags typically standing at around four and a half feet from hoof to antler. At eight foot tall, The Monarch was roughly twice the size of a typical red deer stag. Red deer first migrated into Britain from Europe 11,000 years ago. They were used extensively by Mesolithic man as a source of food, skins and tools. Until the 20th Century they were largely confined to the Scottish Highlands and south west England, but an increase in forest cover means populations can now be found in Dumfriesshire, the Lake District and East Anglia. Feral . and privately-owned herds are present in the north of England, north . Midlands, East Anglia, Sussex and the New Forest - where The Monarch . lived. The red deer's antlers grow more complex with age, with stags continuing to grow extra branches up to a maximum of 16 - at which point they are at full maturity. At 16-years-old when he was killed, The Monarch was a 16-branch antler stag - another reason his massive head would have been so attractive to hunters. Stags in Britain regularly live up to 18 years of age, although red deer tend to have a higher than average infant mortality rate - with fawns living in the Scottish Highlands particularly susceptible to the cold weather during their first winter. During the breeding season from September to November, stags engage in elaborate displays of dominance - including roaring and fighting. Serious injury and death can result but fighting only occurs between stags of similar size. Due to his massive bulk, The Monarch is unlikely to have ever been challenged by another stag. The Monarch was the . biggest – and the head – of a herd of 40 red deer owned by farmer Dan . Tanner and kept at Burley Park near Ringwood, Hampshire where he was a . popular sight on New Forest Deer Safari tours. Yesterday . Mr Tanner, 65, said poaching was still a real problem. He added: . ‘Because The Monarch had such a fine set of antlers he would have been . very attractive to poachers.  They would have wanted his head as a . trophy.’ Jamie Cordrey, . from anti-poaching group The Deer Initiative, said illegal hunting was . ‘unpredictable and very hard to police’. And Dorothy Ireland, of the . British Deer Society, said poachers have no feeling for animals they . have either injured or shot. The Monarch’s body has now been given to a local farmer who intends to mount the antlers on a plaque. A . spokesman for Hampshire police confirmed that it was investigating a . firearms offence. It is illegal to shoot privately-owned deer and those . found guilty of doing so can face fines of £5,000. Waste: Before being shot, The Monarch was a strong swimmer. It is thought he drowned after becoming disorientated as a result of his wounds . Slow death: The Monarch did not die from the initial shot as the poachers failed to use a powerful enough gun . Dominant: The Monarch was the largest of 40 red deer at Burley Park in Hampshire. Although there are other stags in the herd, The Monarch is thought to have been the firm leader .","Hunters wanted 16-year-old stag's huge antlers, which were worth £1,000 .

"By . Luke Salkeld . A trainee barrister falsely accused her boyfriend of raping her 11 times in an attempt to get out of taking her law exams, a court heard. Rhiannon Brooker, 30, alleged Paul Fensome had repeatedly assaulted her, leading to the 46-year-old being arrested, charged and held in custody for 30 days. But detectives could not find any evidence he had carried out the attacks. It emerged that Brooker had used the allegations as ‘extenuating circumstances’ in a failed attempt to dodge her bar exams, a jury was told. Rhiannon Brooker, 30, is accused of falsely claiming her boyfriend raped and assaulted her before using the allegations as 'extenuating circumstances' in a failed bid to get out of her legal exams . She is accused of making 11 false . claims of rape and nine of assault, two of which alleged false . imprisonment. Prosecutor David Bartlett told Bristol Crown Court: ‘One . of the reasons for her false allegations was that she was living an . active social life and not doing the work required to pass.’ She made up the claims to ‘give substance’ to her bid to be allowed to delay her exams. The . court heard how Brooker, a law graduate, had been studying for her . barrister qualifications at the University of the West of England (UWE). Shortly before she moved . to Bristol in 2010, she appeared at a shop where she worked with . injuries and complained her boyfriend had assaulted her, Mr Bartlett . said. At UWE she told fellow . students she had been assaulted and raped, and occasionally displayed . physical injuries, but had not reported the matter to police. She . claimed Mr Fensome had forced her to have sex on several occasions and . once she told a friend she had lost a baby because he had punched her in . the ribs. Brooker leaves court, where she is on trial over claims she made 11 false allegations of rape and nine of assault against her boyfriend . She said facial injuries and bruising were as a result of her attempts to end the relationship against his will. In March 2011 a domestic violence adviser encouraged her to keep a log of incidents and report them to police. She finally went to police in May 2011 but all the allegations were denied by Mr Fensome, a railway signalman. She told officers she had been grabbed by the throat and held against a wall after Mr Fensome accused her of cheating on him. The . court saw a video of a police interview in which she said: ‘He got . increasingly irritated and angry because of the fact I was denying it. ‘He was accusing me of all sorts with all people. ‘As . we got home he tripped me up as we were coming through the door and I . fell down. 'I said to stop being so stupid, then he grabbed me by the . throat and put me against the wall. 'He put his hand around my neck and . throat, his grip was tight, I found it hard to breathe. He said I was . malicious and nasty.’ However, Mr Fensome denied the allegations and had ‘cast iron alibis’, the court heard. Texts . from his phone and his work shift patterns either undermined or . disproved the claims. Experts suggested Brooker’s injuries had been . self-inflicted, Mr Bartlett said. After . charges against Mr Fensome were dropped, Brooker, of Frampton . Cotterell, Gloucestershire, confirmed they were false, and admitted that . injuries seen by witnesses, including her friends and doctors, were . self-inflicted, the court heard. She . later told police: ‘The allegations were not true and I am sorry I made . them. I find it very difficult to understand why I said these things. Overstayer: Bristol Crown Court heard how a warrant had been issued for Hamidi's deportation . ‘I . believe that in some funny way I have hit out against Paul as he was . close to me – the nearest target of those unresolved feelings of anger – . and I regret the hurt that I’ve caused him as a result. ‘I . am trying to work hard with these feelings and I understand that they . have to be resolved and put behind me. 'Ordinarily I am a truthful and . honest person which makes it all the more difficult for me to understand . how this has happened.’ Brooker sat only the first four of her 12 . assessments for her course and persuaded the Extenuating Circumstances . Committee to let her sit the rest later. But she went on to fail because . she exceeded the time limit. Mr Bartlett said Brooker’s knowledge of criminal law was likely to be greater than that of most rape complainants. ‘The . prosecution alleges that she knew that the course of justice was being . perverted and intended to pervert the course of justice throughout that . period. 'Brooker seemed oblivious to the impact of the false allegations . on Mr Fensome’s family, causing distress, disruption and expense. 'In . addition, Brooker deceived other students and her tutors, who committed . time and emotional support to her cause. ‘We . suggest that the defendant has an inherent tendency to fabricate . allegations and needs always to be the centre of attention.’ Brooker denies perverting the course of justice. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Rhiannon Brooker claimed she was raped and assaulted by Paul Fensome .

"By . Luke Salkeld . Row: Unions are calling for  Bath headteacher Kim Sparling for the culture at the school despite it gaining an outstanding Ofsted rating under her leadership . A headmistress is facing calls to resign despite achieving an ‘outstanding’ Ofsted rating for her school – after inspectors criticised her culture of fear, intimidation and bullying. Kim Sparling – who took a tough stance on uniform, behaviour and attendance – is said to have left staff feeling threatened and ‘fearful of making any mistake’ after frequent dressing-downs in front of pupils. Officials sent to Oldfield School in Bath cited ‘very low morale’ among staff and an ‘over-reliance on disciplinary procedures’ to manage them. Chairman of governors Julie Cope stood down in the wake of their report and the NASUWT union called for the headmistress to resign. Union spokesman Wendy Exton said: ‘As many of the issues at Oldfield, as alleged in the report, have been due to behaviour from Mrs Sparling, how can we move forward positively while the current head teacher remains?’ The high-flying secondary school, rated ‘outstanding’ in its last full inspection at the end of 2012, has been at the centre of a prolonged row since a snap visit by inspectors in December. A team from Ofsted spent three days at the academy to carry out a ‘Section 5’ inspection, which are called only when specific concerns are raised. But the outcome sparked controversy when Ofsted declined to publish its full report and instead released only limited information. The three-page document focused on the safety of children at the 775-pupil school and concluded that procedures were in order. Probe: Inspectors were called to Oldfield School in Bath after a number of complaints and allegations were made about an 'over reliance on disciplinary procedures to manage staff' It did, however, express concerns . about the relationship between the governors and Mrs Sparling, and said . the board did not properly hold her to account when dealing with issues . such as complaints. A campaign was launched to release the full . nine-page report, and it was later published on a charity’s website, . accusing Mrs Sparling of creating a hostile culture. Campaign: A teaching union has led a campaign to release the draft Ofsted report after a limited version saying that Mrs Sparling was not sufficiently challenged her . Despite . the ‘significant flaws’, the report praised pupils as highly  motivated . with an ‘outstanding’ level of achievement. It said: ‘The head . teacher’s leadership style intimidates staff, resulting in a climate of . fear which pervades the school. Despite very effective teaching, threats . and bullying are commonplace, with many staff working in fear of losing . their job. 'Staff feel threatened and are fearful of making any . mistake.’ It went on: ‘Many . describe being shouted at in front of other staff and students.’ Ofsted . has repeatedly refused to answer questions about who decided not to . publish the full report. 'Neither Mrs Sparling nor her lawyers responded . to a request for comment. She is now on sick leave. Her . leadership is being investigated by the Department for Education and . the Education Funding Agency. Mrs Sparling joined Oldfield in 1998, . having previously been deputy head at St John’s School in Marlborough. Over the next few years, she did not shy away from imposing stricter . rules. In 2007 Oldfield was . graded ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted. But the school has come under increasing . criticism after parents began to complain that their grievances were . not taken seriously enough.","Union demands Kim Sparling quits despite success of school .

A day later a navy blue Regatta coat was found nearby containing a wallet and a faded picture of a child. A . date on the back of the picture reads April 13, 1952, but it is unclear . what this refers to or if the jacket and wallet even belonged to the . dead man. His injuries are understood not to be consistent with . drowning, and it is believed the man had something wedged in his throat. The bearded victim was discovered by a member of the public on Tuesday on the popular beach. A dark navy-blue Regatta jacket was found near to the unidentified man . The set of keys found near the body . The man was was reportedly completely naked apart from socks and one walking shoe. A day later a dark navy blue Regatta coat was found nearby . Resident . Joan Taylor, 72, said of the investigation: ‘Everyone is talking about . it. It’s a small place and to find a murder victim on the beach and have . police buzzing around is not an everyday thing.’ Yesterday police confirmed that the investigation had changed direction. Detective . Chief Inspector Dave Thorne, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said: ‘We . are now treating the discovery of the body as suspicious. The change in . tack has come about as a result of the post-mortem. There are injuries . on his body that we are not able to explain, and as a result of that we . are treating the death as suspicious.’ He . added: ‘We are not happy that they were caused by natural means or . through rock or sand abrasions. We can’t really avoid the fact there may . be a third party involved. They are external injuries over various . parts of his body. Police are working with coastguards and other experts to find out where the body may have entered the water . ‘We think he was in the water for between 12 and 24 hours.’ A police spokesman said the man’s fingerprints had been sent to Interpol. The set of keys consists of a Citroen car key, two mortice lock keys, a hippopotamus key-ring and a red fob.","Naked man was found washed up in on popular north Cornwall tourist beach .

"By . Luke Salkeld . At first glance, they look like good Samaritans helping a person in a wheelchair across a busy road. In fact, heroin addicts Adam Webster and Sarah Harcourt are kidnapping a quadriplegic man and wheeling him into a park to mug him for just £6. The couple were arrested within 40 minutes of robbing Stephen Dooley, 38, after being caught on CCTV. Caught on camera: Adam Webster, 38, and Sarah Harcourt, 35, abducted Stephen Dooley, 38, from a council activity centre in Norwich and pushed him to a nearby park to steal his money . Prolific offenders: Heroin addicts Adam Webster and Sarah Harcourt stole £6 and dumped their victim . Innocent: Stephen Dooley is now terrified to go out and the robbery left his confidence in tatters, the court heard . Webster was jailed for six years . yesterday and Harcourt was imprisoned for four years and 12 weeks for . the crime, which has left Mr Dooley too scared to go out. Both . terms exceed the four years given on February 22 to Lewis Gill, who . killed Asperger’s sufferer Andrew Young, 40, in Bournemouth last year . with a single punch, which was also caught on CCTV. Sentencing . Webster, 38, and Harcourt, 35, at Norwich Crown Court, Judge Anthony . Bate said: ‘This was a despicable crime driven by self-centred greed and . an utter disregard for your victim’s feelings.’ The . pair abducted Mr Dooley last August from the Vauxhall Resource Centre, a . community centre in Norwich where he ran a book stall, and wheeled him . out of sight before demanding his cash. After . they left, he managed to make his way back to the centre where staff . called police, who tracked the pair down using security footage. Harcourt admitted robbery and kidnap, while Webster was found guilty in . court. Mr Dooley – whose . disability makes it hard for him to communicate – used an interpreter to . tell the court from behind a screen about his fear during the ordeal. Chain of events: The thies are seen forcing their disabled victim across a main road and into a park on a summer's day last August . Mr . Dooley’s father, the Reverend Gerald Dooley, described in an impact . statement read out in court how the community centre was ‘a really big . part of Stephen’s life’ but he ‘does not want to leave the house’ now . and ‘is afraid and has become introverted’. He . had attended the centre for more than ten years and saw it as a home . from home. In his own victim statement, Mr Dooley said: ‘Working on the . book stall was the one thing I did by myself. I miss it lots …but now I . am too scared to go.’ Devious: Webster and Harcourt had targeted Stephen Dooley as he attended a centre holding activities for disabled people for callously robbing him . Cast aside: After the cash was taken from Mr Dooley, who became disabled as a baby, he was just left to fend for himself. Thankfully the thieves were arrested within 40 minutes after being caught on CCTV . Detective . Constable Jim Starling said yesterday: ‘Harcourt and Webster are the . lowest of the low. To target a man who clearly has no means of defending . himself or calling for help is beyond belief.’ Detective . Sergeant Richard Dickinson praised Mr Dooley for his bravery in being a . witness, adding: ‘Giving evidence is a traumatic experience for any . victim of crime, but it’s particularly poignant in Steve’s case as he . has limited means of communicating. ‘I believe his evidence was crucial in securing a guilty verdict.’","Adam Webster and Sarah Harcourt took Stephen Dooley from a book stall .

"By . Luke Salkeld . Victim: Linda Bull, pictured here when she was 21, was raped and strangled by Arthur Duncan in 1970 . A convicted murderer and rapist is in line for compensation after a court ruled that his human rights were breached when he was not given rehabilitation treatment in jail. Arthur Duncan, who raped and strangled Linda Bull, claimed he had no access to sexual offenders' rehabilitation programmes for a period of five years. His victim's family described the decision to back his claim as a 'kick in the teeth'. One of the UK's longest-serving prisoners, Duncan raped Miss Bull, 22, then strangled her with her tights in 1970, when he was 18. He is serving a life term and has repeatedly been refused parole to protect the public since the murder in Andover, Hampshire. But, to the horror of his victim's family, he is now in line for a payout. 'My parents' lives were left in devastation after losing their daughter in such a horrific way and they were never the same,' said Shelagh Paynter, Miss Bull's sister. 'We were never offered counselling or compensation, yet the criminal seems to have the help. 'We aren't asking for anything, but our lives have been in turmoil. We are the victims here and we didn't get anything, so why should he? It's disgusting.' Mrs Paynter, 62, a retired social worker who lives in Dorset, said criminals who commit such heinous crimes should forfeit their human rights. 'We have all suffered because of what happened and we will continue to suffer but hearing that he is in line for a payout is just a kick in the teeth,' she said. 'I am horrified. He is a bad person and will ask for anything he can, but the biggest issue for me is that a worker in the system has obviously told him he has these rights. 'And to think a judge has then ruled in his favour is such an injustice.' Mrs Paynter, who said the case had brought back the pain of her sister's murder, said the family was planning to write to the judge 'to try and stop this from happening'. Horrified: The sister of Linda Bull, Shelagh Paynter at her home in Christchurch, Dorset . Duncan claimed his rights under article five of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects liberty and security, were breached when he had no chance to access sexual offenders' programmes between April 2007 and July last year. Officials argued that there had been no failures and that progress through rehabilitation was 'very much a matter of judgment for the prison authorities'. They said fantasies involving bondage and non-consensual sex offending had been 'an ongoing issue'. But judge Lord Glennie ruled in Duncan's favour last month. He said officials had 'simply failed to provide him with programmes and courses which they themselves recognised were a necessary part of his rehabilitation'. He also said they were necessary 'to enable him to make progress towards having an effective review before the parole board'. The judge said a further hearing should take place before a final decision is made. Duncan has repeatedly been caught with hardcore pornography. He was once found with  brides' photos cut from a local paper – with their addresses on the back. He later admitted to fantasising about going to one of the women's homes and tying her up. He has been moved around Scottish jails ever since and is now a prisoner at Glenochil near Stirling. It is believed that Duncan would have brought his case using taxpayer-funded legal aid, although this was unconfirmed last night. He was a soldier in the Royal Artillery when he attacked Miss Bull close to her home at night. He then took a photograph from the victim's handbag 'to see what she looked like'. A psychiatrist believed Duncan had an abnormal mind because of 'sexual oddities and sadistic fantasies'. In 2002 a judge ruled he should serve a minimum of 10 years in jail before he can seek release. A Scottish Prison Service spokesman said it was inappropriate to comment as a further hearing is due.","Arthur Duncan raped and strangled Linda Bull in 1970, when he was 18 .

"By . Luke Salkeld . and Tom Kelly . and Hugo Gye . A violent thug who killed a vulnerable man with a single punch during a row over a bicycle could have his sentence extended following an investigation by the Attorney General. Lewis Gill was sentenced to just four years in prison over the death of Andrew Young, whose mother described the jail term as an 'absolute joke'. After multiple people complained to the Attorney General's Office, officials announced today that they will review the sentence - which will allow the killer to walk free within just two years. Scroll down for video . This is the shocking moment Andrew Young was punched by Lewis Gill - Mr Young died of head injuries a day later in hospital . Mr Young was attacked by Gill after the 40-year-old became involved in an argument with his friend . Gill, 20, can be seen to walk away after looking back to see his victim lying motionless on the ground . Announcement: The Attorney General's Office said today that it would review the sentence . A spokesman said: 'The Attorney General's Office has received a number of requests to look at the sentence given to Lewis Gill. 'If . a sentence given in a Crown Court appears to be very low, or unduly . lenient, anyone can ask the Attorney General to examine the sentence, . within 28 days of sentencing. 'This process has now started. We have asked the CPS to send us more information on this case.' The sentence was imposed by Judge Keith Cutler, who was criticised for his handling of the inquest into the gangster Mark Duggan, whose shooting by police sparked the riots of 2011. Victims' Commissioner Baroness Newlove urged officials to bear in mind the ordeal suffered by Mr Young's family since his death. 'I'm appalled by this disgraceful act of violence - my thoughts go out to the victims' family and friends at this time,' she said. 'It's entirely right that the sentence will be reviewed for this shocking crime. 'I know how traumatic it is to go through the courts as a victim when you are already so hurt and vulnerable. That's why I urge everyone involved in this case to put victims first in the pursuit of justice.' Mr Young (left), who suffered from Asperger's Syndrome, was said to be able to speak several languages but had the social skills of a 14-year-old due to his condition. Gill (right) pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter and was jailed for four-and-a-half years . Mr Young became involved in an argument with cyclist Victor Ibitoye after he told him that cycling on the pavement was dangerous . The shocking incident took place on a . busy street in Bournemouth when Mr Young, 40, warned Victor Ibitoye that . riding on the pavement was dangerous. When the conversation ended Lewis Gill, who was with Mr Ibitoye, punched Mr Young, taking him by surprise. Distressing CCTV footage shows the Asperger’s sufferer toppling back on to the road, violently striking his head. After the hearing Mrs Young said her son (pictured) did not cause Gill 'any harm' Gill, . who has a conviction for handling stolen goods as well as robbery, then . walks away, with a glance back at his motionless victim. Passers-by came to Mr Young’s aid but he died the following day in hospital. His mother Pamela was at his bedside. Yesterday Gill, 20, pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter for which he was jailed for just four years. Mrs Young said: ‘You can see Andrew didn’t cause Lewis Gill any harm. ‘I . wish that awful man who took my son away had pleaded not guilty so he . would have got a longer sentence. The sentence is an absolute joke. ‘I’m a committed Christian but I think that if someone takes a life they should be prepared to forfeit their own.’ She said that too few killers served full sentences. Tory . MP David Davies said of Gill’s punishment: ‘That’s an outrageously lean . sentence. In two years he will be out walking the streets after taking . somebody’s life. ‘He has . attacked someone unprovoked and should be properly punished. People . need to realise if you punch someone like that, and they fall backward, . they can die.’ Explaining . why Gill would receive just four years, Judge  Cutler told him: ‘What I . have had to look at is what was in your mind at the time you threw that . punch. ‘You wanted to . cause some injury to Mr Young. If you wanted to cause grievous bodily . harm it would have been a murder charge. You are very, very lucky that . was not in fact the outcome.’ The judge told the hearing at Salisbury Crown Court on Friday that the case lay somewhere between murder and manslaughter. ‘I bear in mind your early guilty plea. I accept there is no pre-meditated element and provocation does exist,’ he told Gill. Keith Cutler made a controversial decision to hold a 20-second silence for Mark Duggan . The judge who sentenced Lewis Gill was at the centre of the Mark Duggan inquest that ended in January. At . the start of the hearing, Keith Cutler made the controversial decision . to hold a 20-second silence to acknowledge the ‘regrettable loss of a . young life’. The death of Duggan, a gangster who was shot twice by police marksmen, sparked the London riots that broke out in summer 2011. The . senior circuit judge led the silence – virtually unprecedented at an . inquest – by lowering his head and clasping his hands together. He . later explained: ‘It was my idea. I know it was controversial, and I . know the police were bristling about it and sections of the media were . very critical, but I believe that Mark Duggan’s death led to a great . deal of unrest. ‘I thought that a few moments’ reflection at the start of the inquest might be quite healing.’ He . also said he would ask the dead man’s family to help shape . recommendations on police firearms procedure. Jurors were given special . protection by police as they left the Royal Courts of Justice, following . the intimidation and abuse they faced from Duggan’s supporters during . the hearing. There were claims the judge had treated the Duggan family with ‘kid gloves’ during the inquest which ended last month. Judge . Cutler once admitted that he enjoys having the power to show leniency. And he has reacted angrily to criticism from Government ministers who . accused judges of ‘soft’ sentencing. The response came in 2006 in his role as secretary of the Council of Circuit Judges. The married father-of-two is a Christian who was installed as a lay canon of Salisbury Cathedral in 2009. The Duggan inquest ended with an 8-2 majority jury verdict that his death was a lawful killing. After the hearing, Mr Young's mother Pamela described the sentence as a 'joke' The . maximum sentence for manslaughter is life, but the term can be shorter, . at the discretion of the judge. With half his sentence served on . licence, and allowing for time already served, Gill could be out of jail . in under two years. The . judge told Gill, from Sutton, Surrey, that Mr Young was no threat: ‘You . are a powerfully built young man. You must have known that [the punch] . was going to cause a significant injury and, very sadly, it did.’ Gill was also sentenced to two three-month terms to run consecutively with the manslaughter sentence. This . was for committing the crime while on a suspended sentence for the . robbery and handling offences. In mitigation, Steven Perian said: ‘He . wishes he could turn back the clock and not react in the way he did.’ Mr . Young, a former grammar school pupil, regular church-goer and speaker . of several languages, was said to have the social skills of a . 14-year-old due to his Asperger’s. Taxi . driver Simon Scott said of him: ‘Andrew was always friendly and polite . and often struck up conversations with strangers. He was gentle and . wouldn’t hurt a fly.’ His . mother added: ‘He was very particular because of his Asperger’s and he . wouldn’t have liked seeing someone riding a bicycle on the pavement.’ The incident took place outside a Tesco Express in the Charminster area of Bournemouth at 4.25pm on November 6.","Andrew Young, 40, died in hospital after he was punched by Lewis Gill .

"By . Ben Spencer . and Ian Drury . and Luke Salkeld . Troops were on standby last night as Somerset was braced for more floods – and Environment Secretary Owen Paterson admitted it could take 20 years to solve the area’s problems. High winds, torrential rain and a tidal surge are expected to swamp coastal defences and swell already bursting rivers over the weekend. This will spell more misery for the Somerset Levels, which have been under water for a month. Water water everywhere: Major Ali Robnson and Sgt Leigh Robinson survey the flooded Somerset levels yesterday . More than 60 pumps are running at full power to drain an estimated 1.5million tons of water from the flooded area but more storms will only deepen the crisis, which has seen the Environment Agency accused of gross incompetence for failing to dredge clogged rivers that have burst their banks. Pat Flaherty, deputy chief executive of Somerset county council, said the Levels could be under water for weeks. The Ministry of Defence has sent three military planners – an Army major and captain and a lieutenant commander from the Royal Navy – to meet council chiefs to assess the disaster. Surveying the scene: OC Major Al Robinson, Sergeant Leigh Robinson and Tony Hurry of Somerset County Council look at a map in Burrowbridge . High up: The Ministry of Defence has sent three military planners ¿ an Army major and captain and a lieutenant commander from the Royal Navy ¿ to meet council chiefs to assess the disaster . Coming in: At first light, an advanced party of engineers rolled into the drowned villages to scope out the worst-affected areas and work out how to help them . Mr Paterson said last night after chairing a meeting of the Government’s Cobra emergency committee: ‘We established that we do need a proper 20-year plan to satisfactorily cover this very specialist part of the country. ‘It’s clear from our forecasts that there is further bad weather coming in, there will be heavy rain and that, combined with significant high spring tides around the coast, mean that I’m afraid there is real risk of flooding to properties.’ He reiterated David Cameron’s call for dredging to restart for the first time since 2005. The Prime Minister tried to seize control of the situation on Wednesday, calling for an end to the arguments that have held up action and insisting that dredging must go ahead. The Environment Agency has come in for severe criticism for stopping dredging in the mid-1990s. But David Jordan, operations director . at the quango, who earns more than £160,000 a year, told Sky News last . night: ‘People are trying to make this an Environment Agency-only . problem.

Trouble ahead: A Nasa satellite image shows the huge storm over the Atlantic heading for the UK . ‘It is something which is shared by others and must be owned by others so we come to a collective and agreed way forward.’ His organisation has pledged only £350,000 to dredge the two key rivers in Somerset – the Parrett and Tone – an operation which will cost at least £4million. Yet it has been willing to spend £20million on a bird sanctuary on the Somerset coast. ‘We have a responsibility to ensure that the taxpayers’ money we are given to invest in reducing flood risk is spent to the best effect,’ Mr Jordan said. ‘We are committed to the dredging, we . have put money on the table and that won’t change. But it is also clear . that other parties need to pay their way too. ‘We . believe that even had the dredging taken place, we would still be . seeing very extensive flooding across the Somerset Levels and Moors.’ Mr Paterson said a plan would be in place within six weeks for a long-term approach to tackling flood risk in Somerset. ‘We . established quite quickly that we do need to dredge quite quickly the . two main rivers, we established that we do need a proper 20-year plan,’ he said. ‘I’ve given all the local agencies six weeks to come together with a definitive plan.’ Royal Marines from 40 Commando, based in nearby Taunton, are on standby to assist in the crisis as the fresh storms approach.

"By . Luke Salkeld . A wife who secretly buried her dead husband under a garden rockery and continued to collect his benefits payments for four years was jailed yesterday. Rebekah Sturdey disposed of her husband Geoffrey's body on their isolated small holding - and pocketed over £70,000. The 56-year-old carried out the secret burial with two other women after he died aged 60 of a suspected heart attack. Cover-up: The body of Geoffrey Sturdey was hidden by his wife Rebekah on a remote farm in West Wales . Officials became suspicious after disability allowance and pension credits totalling £77,318 were paid in Mr Sturdey's name after he was last seen alive in 2008. A court heard Mrs Sturdey told investigators her husband had gone on a touring holiday around Europe. But checks revealed he had no valid passport and a £20,000 aerial and land search was launched by a specialist forensic team to find his body in a plot on the land near Tregaron, West Wales. Sturdey buried her husband with the help of his paid carer, Boqer-Ore Adie and Adie's daughter, Karmel. Prosecutor Huw Rees said Adie, 43, was paid in excess of £19,000 in income support and carers' allowance for looking after Mr Sturdey in the years after he died. The Department for Work and Pensions said after October 2008, when Mr Sturdey died, his wife and carer claimed £21,718 in disability living allowances, £9,415 in carer's allowance, £10,143 in income support and £36,041 in pension credits. Search: Sturdey was sentenced to 20 months for preventing the lawful and decent burial after police discovered the body at her home (pictured) Mr Rees said: 'He was buried in a rockery at twice the depth of a normal grave. 'The women later admitted the rockery was the easiest place to bury a body but it was what he wanted. 'His body was remarkably well-preserved and he was identified by his dental records. 'The women were originally arrested on suspicion of murder but tests showed he had died of natural causes. Avoided jail: Karmel Adie 25 admitted preventing the lawful and decent burial  of Geoffrey Sturdey and was given a nine month suspended sentence at Swansea Crown Court . 'He had a history of stroke and heart attacks.' The court heard it had been Mr Sturdey's wish to be buried on his land at the 20-acre farm. Swansea Crown Court heard Iranian-born Mrs Sturdey and her British-born husband had set up a religious community along with Adie and her two children. Mr Rees explained: 'Their home contained a large number of religious books. 'They were not part of any organised group but they studied the Bible, particularly the Old Testament and Adi had taught herself Hebrew. 'Mr Sturdey had chosen his own burial plot where he expected to be raised from the dead. 'The group expected Jesus's return to earth after his death.' Mrs Sturdey and Adie carried on being paid the benefits after his death in October 2008. Investigators found more than £6,000 cash in a sweet tin, and gold worth £50,000. Sturdey and Adie admitted fraud by failing to notify authorities they were in receipt of disability allowance and pension credits in Mr Sturdey's name. Their Beth Berin 'wildlife haven' and religious community was at the end of a remote track near the village of Llwynygroes, deep in the Welsh countryside. Warnings on the gate told hikers and walkers to keep away and the Ten Commandments were pinned up on a board at the entrance. Mrs Sturdey admitted conspiracy to prevent the lawful and decent burial of her husband. Adie and stepdaughter Karmel Adie, 25, admitted the same charge. Representing Sturdey, Christopher James said: 'She respected his wishes for his burial. They did not wish for a post mortem examination to be carried out. 'The burial was in accordance with their Biblical beliefs.' Mrs Sturdey and Adie were both given 20 months in prison. Karmel Adie was given a nine-month suspended sentence. Judge Keith Thomas described their crime as 'highly unusual and a unique set of circumstances'. He said: 'You took advantage of the sad death of Geoffrey Sturdey to conceal the fact he had passed away and deliberately continued to claim benefits. 'You were not entitled to that money. 'Whatever the motivation for burying him on the land without notifying the authorities, it gave you the opportunity to enrich yourself at the expense of the rest of us. 'You told a series of lies to fool the authorities. This was a calculated fraud.' Mr Sturdey's body has since been reburied under the rockery in accordance with his wishes.","Rebekah Sturdey hid her husband' Geoffrey's body on their small holding .

"By . Luke Salkeld . A newborn girl has been killed by a dog that her father brought home from a pub, it was reported yesterday. The body of six-day-old Eliza-Mae Martha Mullane was found by her mother Sharon John after the infant was apparently mauled by a male Alaskan Malamute, a powerful, husky-type dog bred for pulling sleds. The distraught mother ran into the street and screamed: ‘The dog ate my baby’s head.’ The pet was said by neighbours to have been with the family for just a few months after the little girl’s father Patrick Mullane arrived home with the animal after a night out. Sharon John, pictured left, and Patrick Mullane, pictured right, whose six-day-old baby girl has died after being mauled to death by the family dog . Officers have seized an Alaskan Malamute (file picture), a breed which is known for its gentle temperament . Probe: Police officers are pictured above investigating the scene in Pontyberem . Seized: A dog has been seized by police after the baby was killed in Pontyberem, Carmarthenshire, Wales . Attack: Ms John and Mr Mullane (pictured)'s newborn daughter died following a suspected dog attack by the family's Alaskan Malamute called Nisha . Friends said the 33-year-old had rescued the dog, called Nisha, after . being told its previous owner was going to have it destroyed. Yesterday . neighbours in the village of Pontyberem, near Carmarthen, South Wales, . spoke of the nightmare scenes after Eliza-Mae was found dead and police . seized the animal from the family home. The baby had already spent . three days in intensive care in hospital after being born last . Wednesday, and came home to her newly prepared nursery only at the . weekend. Police were called to the house that Miss John, 42, . shares with Mr Mullane and her two other children Harley, five, and . Lily-Rose, three, at about 8.30am yesterday. Neighbour Patricia Punter, 71, said: ‘It was terrible. ‘I’ve never heard anything like it. Sharon was in a state of shock and just screaming. ‘She just kept on saying, “The dog ate my baby’s head. The baby’s gone”. ‘They’d had the dog for a few months because Pat is really soft for dogs. Sharon John, 42, ran to her neighbours after her six-day-old girl was found dead next to their pet dog called Nisha . ‘He . brought it home from the pub because someone had told him they were . going to get rid of it. Nisha was about five or six years old but looked . older. I think it may have badly treated in the past. ‘God only . knows what has gone on in there. But Sharon was in bits – she was with a . policeman and they wouldn’t let her back into the house. ‘She’d only brought the baby home in the last week. It is just awful. They loved their dogs as much as their children.’ Officers have revealed the family dog has been seized in connection with the death . The family have another pet dog, a terrier called Roxy. Family friend Gemma Prosser, 22, described the incident as ‘heart-breaking’. ‘One . minute they had a bundle of joy in their arms and all those lovely . things to look forward to when you are new parents,’ she said. Incident: Eliza-Mae and her family lived in Pontyberem, Wales . The Alaskan Malamute is the largest of the Arctic dog breeds.

"By . Luke Salkeld . Mr Milligan, 51, a senior executive at Sky Media, and his daughter Emily were killed by the propellers . A TV executive and his eight-year-old daughter were killed by their speedboat after he took the steering wheel from his wife and accelerated, catapulting the family of six into the water, investigators found. Nick Milligan, who had drunk some wine but was well below the drink-drive limit, had been steering but swapped places with his wife Victoria – and detached the ‘kill cord’ which stops the power if the driver is thrown. She then took control without attaching the cord and was encouraged by her family to do another run around the Camel Estuary in north Cornwall, the official accident report said. Mrs Milligan had begun a slow, wide turn when her husband sitting next to her reached over, took the helm and opened the throttle of the 300hp engine to execute a tighter turn. The Cobra rigid inflatable called Milly rolled violently, tossing the couple and their four children into the water. Mr Milligan, 51, a senior executive at Sky Media, and his daughter Emily were killed by the propellers as the unmanned and out of control boat circled the family under full power. Mrs Milligan, 39, lost part of a leg and their five-year-old son Kit suffered ‘life-changing’ wounds in the accident off Padstow last May Bank Holiday weekend. The couple’s two other children, Amber, 12, and Olivia, 11, escaped with minor injuries largely thanks to water sports instructor Charlie Toogood who jumped on board from his own boat and cut the power. Scroll down for video . Nick Milligan, with his wife Victoria and children (from left to right) Emily, Olivia, Kit and Amber . Yesterday the Milligan family said in a . statement: ‘We are still coming to terms with this tragic accident which . has left us without Nick, a loving husband, father, son and brother, . and Emily, whose life was only just beginning. ‘We sincerely hope that awareness of this accident will mean that another family does not have to go through anything similar.’ A . report by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) said: ‘Mr . Milligan who was in the co-driver position suggested that they should . turn to starboard for another run. Due to encouragement from the . children and Mr Milligan she [Mrs Milligan] began a slow wide turn. ‘Mr . Milligan then reached across in front of his wife, took the helm in his . right hand and the throttle in his left, and then increased the engine . throttle setting to full as he turned the helm to starboard. Mrs Milligan, 39, lost part of a leg and their five-year-old son Kit suffered ¿life-changing¿ wounds in the accident off Padstow last May Bank Holiday weekend . ‘The boat immediately accelerated and heeled into the turn and then suddenly and violently rolled back to port and ejected all its occupants out over the port side and into the water. The boat then continued to circle under full power. ‘The family were on the surface of the water, supported by their lifejackets and buoyancy aids, and the boat circled back towards them, striking several of them.’ The family from Wandsworth, south-west London, own a £2million home in Trebetherick, north of the exclusive Cornish resort of Rock. Mr Milligan bought the speedboat in 2012. At 12.25pm on May 5 last year the family boarded Milly at Rock and headed towards Polzeath before performing a number of laps around the bay at around 30 knots. he family from Wandsworth, south-west London, own a £2million home in Trebetherick, north of the exclusive Cornish resort of Rock . Just after 2pm the family pulled into Padstow where most disembarked for lunch while Mr Milligan remained on the boat and drank some wine. After lunch the family set out again with Mr Milligan at the helm and the cut-off cord attached. Eight minutes later they stopped and Mrs Milligan took the helm, without attaching the kill cord. She was heading back towards Rock when they decided to do another ‘run’ up the bay towards Gun Point and the tragedy happened. Investigators said both Mr Milligan and his wife had the relevant training to operate a powerboat and knew how to use a kill cord. Mr Milligan’s alcohol level was well below the UK’s drink-drive limit. The report stated: ‘The turn to starboard which led to the ejection was initiated by Mrs Milligan but Mr Milligan almost immediately reached across his wife and took control of the helm. It is likely that he did this because he thought that a tighter turn to starboard was required to keep Milly clear of the beach on the Padstow side of the estuary. ‘The manner in which Mr Milligan took the helm appears to have been out of character as he was known to be a safety-conscious and prudent individual.’ The MAIB made a series of recommendations, including an urgent reminder for speedboat users to use kill cords at all times and to test them regularly. * The headline on yesterday’s article about the inquiry into . the tragic deaths of Sky TV executive Nick Milligan and his daughter Emily said . he had been drinking before he took control of his speedboat. In fact, as the . article itself reported prominently, the Marine Accident Investigation Branch . found Mr Milligan’s alcohol level was well below the UK drink drive limit. We . are happy to make this clear and apologise to Mr Milligan’s family and friends . for any distress the headline caused.","Nick Milligan had drunk some wine but was well below the drink-drive limit .
