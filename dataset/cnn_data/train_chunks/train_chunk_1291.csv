'There was lots of good football. If it had been 11-a-side, who knows? ‘I’m enjoying my football, I’m enjoying my family, my friends and I’m enjoying my retirement. I’m an ambassador for United and I’m on the club’s board of directors so I still watch a lot of games.’ Meanwhile, Ferguson has revealed that France manager Didier Deschamps ordered his squad to read his autobiography ahead of the World Cup.

"Defence Secretary: Michael Fallon said Britain wanted Turkey to become 'more involved' in the fight . Turkey last night warned it was ‘unrealistic’ to expect it to launch a ground offensive against Islamic State without support from other Nato members. Britain and the United States have been pressing Turkey for weeks to play a major military role against the extremists who have now advanced to within less than a mile of its border with Syria. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon yesterday said Britain wanted Turkey to become ‘more involved’ in the fight against Isis. But Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has ruled out a unilateral offensive. Speaking after talks in Ankara with Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg he warned that the US-led bombing missions against Isis forces in Syria would not be enough, but said that Turkey would not get involved at this stage. ‘You need to take into consideration all options, including an operation on the ground,’ he said. ‘You cannot expect Turkey to do a land operation. This is not a realistic approach.’ Turkey has the second largest army in Nato but has chosen to stand by and watch the ferocious battle for the Syrian border town of Kobani, which is besieged by Isis fanatics. There has been growing frustration among members of the US-led coalition being assembled against Isis at the reluctance of Turkey to intervene, despite having forces positioned on the border. One British defence source last night said Turkey appeared to be waiting for an attack by Isis in order to invoke Nato’s principle of collective self-defence, which could drag the entire military alliance into the war. Kurdish protesters throw stones at Turkish soldiers on an armoured vehicle trying to disperse them during a protest demanding that the Turkish government do more to help the Syrian border town of Kobani yesterday . Mr Fallon yesterday confirmed that Britain and the US would be stepping up pressure on Turkey to take the initiative against Isis. ‘Turkey certainly could help,’ he said. ‘It’s a matter for Turkey, but other allies in the region have been helping. ‘From the south, some of the Gulf countries and Saudi Arabia were helping in American strikes and in the end, yes, this is a situation that can only be resolved not just by America and by Britain but by the region itself. ‘So we’d certainly like to see Turkey more involved, but in the end that’s obviously a decision for their government. He went on: ‘They’re certainly very aware of the situation in Kobani, the desperate situation there, and obviously we’ll have to see whether they can help more... Not getting involved at this stage: Speaking after talks in Ankara with Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg (left), Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu (right) yesterday ruled out a unilateral offensive . ‘Every country comes to this from its own position. They’ve obviously had difficulties with Kurdish extremism in the past; they’ve had hostages very recently and so on. ‘But clearly every country in the region has got to see now what it can do to contribute to deal with Isil [ISIS]. Otherwise we will have Iraq falling apart and Syria falling apart and that is a danger to the entire region.’ Mr Fallon also confirmed that Britain is working with the United States to set up military training camps for ‘moderate’ Syrian fighters elsewhere in the Middle east. He said: ‘We are looking, with the United States, at training of the moderate Syrians that we can identify, but outside Syria. 'Providing training in camps elsewhere in the Middle East, where we can train those in community self-defence in being able to resist Isil [Isis], but doing that outside Syria and then putting them back into the fight in Syria, and we’re trying to identify that effort at the moment. Blast: Smoke rises following an airstrike by US-led coalition aircraft in Kobani, Syria, during fighting between Syrian Kurds and militants of the Islamic State group yesterday . ‘There’s the Free Syrian Army, there are moderate elements in that, and there are other places in the Middle East where they could be trained, in Jordan for example, in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere. That’s something we’re looking at very urgently now.’ Mr Fallon acknowledeged that Isis has to be defeated in both Iraq and Syria, but said ministers do not believe that Parliament is ready to authorise the extension of military action into Syria. ‘We don’t have authority from Parliament to operate in Syria at the moment. Our judgment at the moment is that Parliament wouldn’t give us that authority,’ he said. Madeleine Moon, a labour member of the Commons defence committee, said there was no case for further British intervention until Turkey stepped up to take its share of responsibility. She said: ‘Let’s talk about Turkey’s role – they won’t even let us fly our jets to help, so they have to fly from Cyprus. There is no good that can come from Britain taking unilateral action.’","Michael Fallon says UK would 'certainly like to see Turkey more involved'

"It was just over a year ago this week that David Moyes and Manchester United finally decided they had perhaps had enough of Wilfried Zaha. When the talented but unreliable young winger turned up 45 minutes late for a reserve game at Salford, the reigning Barclays Premier League champions chose to move him on. It was not the first time Zaha had erred in this way and it was not just at Old Trafford where he could not be relied upon. He had been known to keep people waiting for hours to see him at his house, too. Over time, things like this get you a reputation that is hard to shake. Take this anecdote from one Barclays Premier League manager from last January's transfer window. Linked with a loan move for Zaha, I asked him what his intentions were. Wilfired Zaha completed a permanent move back to Crystal Palace on Monday . Zaha celebrated with fellow loanee Yaya Sanogo as Crystal Palace made it through to the FA Cup fifth round . Zaha failed to make an impact following his £10m move to Manchester United in January 2013 . Former United boss David Moyes soon realised in training that Zaha was not for him . Appearances . Premier League - 0 (2 as sub), 28 minutes . FA Cup - 0 (0) League Cup - 1 (0), 78 minutes . Champions League - 0 (0) Community Shield - 1 (0), 61 minutes . 'Yeah I was looking at it,' he said candidly. 'But I know one of the backroom staff at United and they have told me not to go near him. 'They say he is good enough but he isn't doing things right.' That final sentence perhaps sums up Zaha's short career at Old Trafford. Certainly he is talented. He has played for England and will now continue his career as a Barclays Premier League player with Crystal Palace. But Zaha's application and attitude – at least among last season's management set-up at United – was never considered to be right. He played 22 minutes against Newcastle and six against Aston Villa in the Premier League before heading to Cardiff. How relevant things like time keeping are to what happens on a football field depends on your point of view. However, the prevalent view among most at the top level these days is that if you can't get the small things right then what chance have you with the big things? Zaha poses with former United manager Moyes after linking up with the squad in the summer of 2013 . The 22-year-old only made two Premier League appearances for Manchester United . Zaha did impress during the 2013 pre-season tour of Australia and Asia but it didn't last . Zaha revealed his move to United by claiming he was 'on his way to the top of the Premier League' And when members of your own club are privately warning friends in the game not to touch you then it's time to accept you have some issues to address. Certainly when Sir Alex Ferguson signed him for £10million from Palace two years ago, eyebrows were raised throughout the game. Then just 20, the gifted forward had already earned something of a mixed reputation, depending on who you talked to. Ferguson, for sure, would have backed himself to fix him. But, then, Ferguson wasn't sticking around beyond the season's end so why sign him and leave him for somebody else to handle? Zaha was instrumental during Crystal Palace's play-off winning season in 2013 . Zaha returned to Palace on loan  this season after Louis van Gaal deemed him surplus to requirements . Zaha has made two appearances for England after making his debut against Sweden in 2012 . Only four players from the team that started their 4-0 defeat by MK Dons are still at Old Trafford . That is one of the more peculiar – and unanswerable – parts of the whole affair. For Moyes, it was a hospital pass and one that Ferguson's replacement soon realised he had little interest in taking. Short of players because of injuries, Moyes used Zaha on a pre-season tour of Australia and Asia in 2013 and the new signing impressed. But the environs of a summer tour are far removed from the reality of daily life at a Premier League club and – once he saw him on the training ground regularly – Moyes began to realise he wasn't for him. Senior United players didn't disagree, either. Players like Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Ryan Giggs questioned much of what went on during Moyes' brief spell at the club but there were precious few dissenting voices when it came to the distance the United manager put between Zaha and the first-team picture. There were other niggling issues, too. Zaha and Moyes fell out over the business of the player's company car, for example, something that still hadn't been resolved at the time Zaha eventually moved to Cardiff on loan this time last year. From his point of view, Zaha felt he was never given a chance at Old Trafford. Speaking on last summer's tour of America, he vowed to do all he could to impress current manager Louis van Gaal. He was reluctant to criticise Moyes and deserves credit for that. Zaha has been rejuvenated since Alan Pardew's appointment as Palace manager in December . Zaha was loaned out to Cardiff last January after failing to make an impact at United . Ultimately, though, Zaha's chance of establishing himself as a Manchester United player has now gone. Maybe it just came too soon for him. Maybe Moyes was just the wrong manager but now Van Gaal has passed similar judgement. Zaha's form and application has by all accounts been good while on loan at Palace this season. Maybe a lesson has been learned. At Old Trafford, though, he will forever be consigned to a list labelled 'mistake'.","Wilfried Zaha signed for Manchester United in January 2013 for £10m .

"Two former British Army soldiers who have travelled to Syria to fight against Islamic State insist they are not mercenaries but involved in a war of ‘good against evil’. James Hughes, 26, and Jamie Read, 24, are helping Kurdish peshmerga defend the embattled city of Kobani from the brutal terror group, whose ranks reportedly include 2,000 British Muslim recruits. Photographs posted on Facebook show the pair on the Syrian frontline dressed in combat fatigues and armed with assault rifles, posing in bullet-scarred buildings. Scroll down for video . Brothers in arms: Jamie Read, right, with American Jordan Matson, who is also fighting in Syria . James Hughes is helping Kurdish peshmerga defend the embattled city of Kobani from the brutal terror group . On the website of the security firm they founded, Mr Hughes and Mr Read said they were motivated by ‘conscience’, not money, to travel to the warzone ‘to assist innocent people in the face of terror from IS’. Insisting they were volunteer fighters, not guns for hire, the ex-servicemen said they would ‘not do nothing while innocent men, women and children are tortured and murdered by Islamic State while the international community stands by and observes from the luxury of their boardrooms or their tanks on the hill’. They add: ‘This is not a religious war nor is it a racial war, this is a war of good against evil – a magnificent simplicity.’ But Mr Read’s mother said yesterday she was not happy that her son had travelled to Syrian Kurdistan – known as Rojava – to fight the Islamist extremists. Speaking from her family home in Carlisle, Wendy Armiger, 43, said: ‘He’s been in touch to say he’s okay, but I don’t like the fact that he’s gone there. It’s his life, but he’s my son.’ Mr Hughes, from Malvern, Worcestershire, said he had served in the infantry for five years, including three tours of Afghanistan, before leaving earlier this year. Mr Read, who lives in Newmains, North Lanarkshire, said in an online CV that he had been in the Army for three years, specialising in reconnaissance, before leaving in 2010 to work for private security companies. In August, the friends set up the Pathfinder Group Terrorism & Conflict Research Center, a security company with the intention of providing ‘specialist intelligence and surveillance services’, and building up detailed information about terror groups. The firm’s motto is: ‘We will go where the rest fear to go’. On Facebook, Mr Read describes how he had been involved in a fierce clash with IS jihadists. Kurdish fighters in the battle for Kobani: More than two months into its assault on Kobani, the Islamic State group is still pouring fighters and resources into trying to capture the besieged Syrian Kurdish town . People's Protection Units: The Kurds have long-established communities in the north of both Iraq and Syria and have resisted any attempts to extend the violence of Syria's civil war into the areas they inhabit . He wrote that the ‘s*** hit the fan’, prompting Jordan Matson, 28, a US veteran wounded fighting with the Kurds who is understood to have recruited the Britons, to reply: ‘It’s always interesting the first time you have a bullet fly past your head.’ Graham Penrose, a security consultant who is liaising between the ex-soldiers and their families, said: ‘They are not being paid. They are not participating for any commercial gain.’ The Met Police are investigating reports that a 17-year-old woman from Haringey, North London, was also making her way to Syria to join the struggle against IS. She was last seen in Belgium after catching the Eurostar in the UK and would be the first known British female fighting the jihadis. Iraqi forces say they retook two towns north of Baghdad from Islamic State fighters today, driving them from strongholds they had held for months and clearing a main road from the capital to Iran. There was no independent confirmation that the army, Shi’ite militia and Kurdish peshmerga forces had completely retaken Jalawla and Saadiya, about 70 miles north-east of Baghdad. Many residents fled the violence long ago. At least 23 peshmerga and militia fighters were killed and dozens were wounded in the fighting, medical and army sources said. 'We have liberated Jalawla and Saadiya,' said Mala Bakhtiar, a senior official in the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan party, speaking by phone from a nearby town. He estimated 50 Islamic State fighters were killed out of a force of 400. Iraq’s Shi’ite-led government, backed by U.S.-led air strikes, has been trying to push back the Islamic State since it swept through mainly Sunni Muslim provinces of northern Iraq in June, meeting virtually no resistance. Last week the army broke a months-long siege of the country’s largest refinery north of Baghdad, but Islamic State fighters continue to take territory in the western province of Anbar, which shares borders with Syria, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. The militants have been fighting in the last two days to take full control of the Anbar provincial capital Ramadi. On Sunday, Iraqi and foreign jets struck Islamic State fighters near central Ramadi, provincial council member Mahmoud Ahmed Khalaf told Reuters. Clashes continued in the city, he said. Jalawla and Saadiya are located in Diyala province which is mainly under the control of the Baghdad government forces and Kurdish peshmerga. Recapturing the towns would help secure the Kurdish-controlled towns of Kalar and Khanaqin to the north as well as nearby dams and oil fields, peshmerga Secretary-General Jabbar Yawar said. It would also allow the road to be reopened between Baghdad and Khanaqin, close to the Iranian border. While the hardline Sunni Islamic State forces have not advanced into Baghdad, they hold a ring of towns around the mainly Shi’ite capital and have claimed responsibility for a series of bombings in Shi’ite districts of the city. A car bomb in the Shi’ite town of Yousufiya, 20 miles southeast of Baghdad, killed five people on Sunday, police and medics said. Two other bombs in towns near the capital killed four other people. Battleground: A fighter can be seen running through the streets of Kobani. It has been under attack since mid-September, when the Sunni Muslim extremists seized a series of villages and much of the town . Counterattack: A combination of concentrated airstrikes and the arrival late last month of a group of 150 Iraqi peshmerga forces with advanced weapons blunted the edge of the Islamic State offensive . They call themselves the Lions Of Rojava and boast, 'It is better to live one day as a Lion that a thousand days as a sheep.' They are the foreign fighters who have travelled to Syria to fight, not for jihad, but on behalf of the Kurdish communities who are defending their communities from the advance of Sunni Islamists. Just as hundreds of young Europeans have gone to fight for the radical Islamists of Islamic State, so increasing numbers are now travelling to fight for their avowed enemies, the Kurds. Westerners in Kurdistan: A photo of Western fighters from the Lions Of Rojava Facebook page . Jordan Matson, a former U.S. soldier now with Syrian Kurds' People's Protection Units (YPG), operates The Lions Of Rojava Facebook page openly calling for volunteers to travel to join the fight. Just as many of the Islamic State's foreign volunteers have been drawn from the ranks of Sunni Muslim youth worldwide, many of the initial YPG volunteers have come from the Kurdish diaspora. In August a hairdresser from South London was reported to be the first Briton to travel to fight alongside Kurdish forces. Ethnic Kurd Mama Kurda from Croydon, 26, travelled to Iraq to join the Kurdish peshmerga as they desperately tried to halt Islamic State's lightning advance. But since then many others have been inspired to take up arms against Islamic State, perhaps also inspired by the radical socialist experiment underway in the Kurdish autonomous region of Rojava. Inspired by the social ecologist and anarchist Murray Bookchin it has adopted a vision of 'libertarian municipalism' calling for Kurds to create free, self-governing communities. Last month it was reported that a currently serving British marine had been questioned by police on suspicion he was travelling to fight with Kurdish militias during his leave. The 22-year-old Royal Marine Commando was quizzed after he prepared to fly from California on a one-way ticket to Turkey. He was suspected of being in contact with Kurdish militant groups. Two women, Canadian Jew Gill Rosenberg, 31, and Danish Kurd Joanna Palani, 20, have also reportedly travelled to fight with the Kurds, inspired perhaps by the images of female fighters on the front line against Islamic State terrorists. It is perhaps the only place in the world where women are fighting on the front line of armed conflict. There are also claims that a number of European biker gangs have travelled to Syria and are helping to assist the resistance. Leaders of the Cologne-based Median Empire Motorcycle Club, which has strong Kurdish links, have posted images of their German riders posing in the city - some of them carrying weapons. The news came just days after three members of a notorious motorcycle gang from the Netherlands were told they had not committed any crime by travelling to Kobani to join the fight against ISIS.","Afghanistan veteran James Hughes reported to have travelled to Syria .

David Cameron has warned China it is 'mistaken' and 'counter-productive to bar a British parliamentary fact-finding mission from Hong Kong. MPs are pressing for an emergency Commons debate after Beijing said it would not allow MPs from the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee to enter the former British colony, where pro-democracy demonstrators have been staging protests since September. Downing Street said that the action had 'amplified' concerns about the situation in Hong Kong, which has enjoyed a degree of autonomy from Beijing under the ""one country, two systems"" arrangements instituted at the time of its handover from UK control in 1997. Mr Cameron's official spokesman told a regular Westminster media briefing: 'The Prime Minister's view is that the decision with regard to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee is a mistaken one. 'We will continue to have a dialogue with the Chinese authorities on this, both through the Foreign Office here in London with the Chinese Embassy in London and through our embassy in Beijing.' 'The argument that we will be taking forward with the Chinese authorities is that the reason why the Prime Minister thinks it is a mistaken decision is because it is counter-productive. It only serves to amplify concerns about the situation in Hong Kong, rather than diminishing concerns.' Committee chairman Sir Richard Ottaway said they had been told by the Chinese embassy that they would be turned back if they tried to enter Hong Kong, which they had been planning to visit as part of an inquiry into its relations with the UK 30 years after the joint declaration. Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying said police had been very tolerant but would now take 'resolute action'. 'Some people have mistaken the police's tolerance for weakness,' he told reporters. 'I call for students who are planning to return to the occupation sites tonight not to do so,' said Leung, who did not respond when if police would clear the sites this evening. As police tackled the running battles in Admiralty, tensions escalated across the harbour in the gritty working-class district of Mong Kok, which had been the scene of violent clashes in recent weeks before the clearance of a large protest encampment from a major road there last Wednesday. The unrest came as British lawmakers said they had been told by the Chinese Embassy they would not be allowed to enter Hong Kong as part of an inquiry into Britain's relations with its former colony and progress towards democracy.

The overnight clashes came after student leaders called on activists to escalate their protests and surround government headquarters, galvanising supporters to make their way to the buildings in Admiralty, next to Hong Kong's central business district and some of the world's most expensive real estate. Student representative Nathan Law urged protesters to continue the disobedience movement that began in late September, calling it a 'long journey'. Despite several waves of clampdowns, crowds of protesters, many in protective goggles and body armour, refused to leave the area and continued to press against police lines, chanting 'We want universal suffrage!'. They threw bottles, helmets and umbrellas at police as tensions simmered into mid-morning.

"Sir Alex Ferguson's claim that he brought flop Bebe to Manchester United on the recommendation of Carlos Queiroz is false, insists his former assistant manager. Ferguson signed the forward in a £7.4million deal in August 2010 from Vitoria Guimaraes, a price tag considered exorbitant by many given his career to that point included a single season in Portugal's fourth tier. Ferguson has said Bebe was the first player he had brought to Old Trafford who he hadn't seen in action personally, crediting Queiroz for convincing him to make the signing. VIDEO scroll down to watch Bebe scores remarkable goal during for Pacos de Ferreira . Bebe, who signed to Manchester United in 2010, appears in Gary Neville's 2011 testimonial against Juventus . Former Manchester United assistant  Carlos Queiroz says he had nothing to do with his countryman's signing . Sir Alex Ferguson (right) claims Queiroz was the one who advised him on the purchase of the winger . Bebe played just two league games at United and didn't start once before moving to Benfica . 'Bebe was not even part of our scouting files for the national team of Portugal,' said Queiroz, who in 2010 was the manager of his home national team. 'He didn't exist in a system where nothing escaped us. 'So Bebe going to Man United took me by surprise. 'I called my coaches and asked them what was going on, why he didn't exist.' The transfer has been subject of a corruption investigation by Portugal police into why the Premier League giants would pay so much for a lower league player. Bebe is widely regarded among the most disappointing signings of Ferguson's illustrous 26-year reign at United. Bebe played jut twice in the league for the Red Devils before moving to Portugal's Benfica in the summer in a £2m deal. Before that he'd spent time on loan with Besiktas, Rio Ave and Pacos de Ferreira. Bebe came to United having not even appeared for Guimaraes - the winger, soon after signing with agent Jorge Mendes, was picked up by United just weeks after a free transfer from Estrela after the third division club didn't pay his wages.

Islamic State has tanks and artillery  surrounding the town, Bahjat added. Polat Tan, a senior commander with the Kurdish militia in Syria, said: 'We will do everything to resist these advances,” he told FoxNews.com. 'We will fight till every last drop of blood, but if help does not arrive soon, disaster is at hand.' The numbers of Kurdish refugees fleeing into Turkey to escape the advance of Islamic State jihadists in northern Syria has slowed considerably over the last few days, Turkish officials said on Wednesday. Some 140,000 mainly Kurdish refugees have now crossed the border into Turkey after the militants moved on the town of Ayn al-Arab late last week. But after the flight of tens of thousands over the weekend triggered fears of a new refugee crisis, with Turkey already hosting some 1.5 million Syrian refugees from the three-and-a-half year conflict, the flow has now steadied.

U.S.-led air strikes against IS targets in Syria just over the border did not appear to have prompted a new wave of refugees, the source said.

"Sir Alex Ferguson believes Louis van Gaal is the right choice to lead Manchester United forward and describes the Dutchman as a 'formidable' figure. The legendary United manager, writing in updated chapters of his autobiography, admits he struggled to deal with leaving his Old Trafford last season, but seems happy to have a man he calls an 'ultra-professional' at the helm now. Ferguson played a part in appointing his successor David Moyes, but now says United's board made the right choice in going with Van Gaal after a difficult transitional season last year. Sir Alex Ferguson has praised Louis van Gaal as the right man to manage Manchester United . The legendary United boss and their current manager come face-to-face in the Champions League in 2010 . Ferguson and Van Gaal talk as United faced Barcelona in a 3-3 Champions League draw in 1998 . The front cover of Ferguson's autobiography, which will be released on Thursday after being updated to include chapters on his life after retirement from management. Price: £8.99 . The 72-year-old Scot adds in the new edition of his book, extracts of which were leaked on Tuesday, that he sees Ryan Giggs as a great choice as Van Gaal's assistant, saying that the pair can learn a lot from each other. 'Louis is what I would call a managers’ coach,' Ferguson writes. 'He’s one of those committed ultra-professionals. If I had to choose one word for him it would be ""formidable"". 'Football is his life. Wherever he has managed, every footballer will have learned from him. He was a good choice.' And Ferguson calls Giggs' appointment: 'a terrific decision. Louis could help Giggs learn about this business; Ryan could help Louis in understanding the inner workings of United.' The two-time Champions League winning boss was often seen sitting in the stands at Old Trafford last season, with critics saying that his presence heaped more pressure on Moyes during troubled times. But Ferguson says he found the transition difficult, admitting that he felt 'a little bit disorientated,' and writing: 'I had been the United manager for the best part of 27 years, and now I was in a directors’ seat with fans asking me for autographs.' Looking back on last season, with United languishing in seventh place in the Premier League, Ferguson also reflects on one of the most contested title races in recent years. Ferguson calls Van Gaal an 'ultra-professional' in his updated autobiography chapters . Ferguson retired from management after leading United to the Premier League title in May 2013 . Ferguson (centre) says Ryan Giggs' (right) appointment will allow him and Van Gaal to learn from each other . Ferguson often found himself sat in the stands as he struggled to get to grips with leaving his role . * I spoke to Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra about their Manchester United futures... but dressing-room was out of bounds . * I tried to convince David Moyes to keep Mike Phelan as Manchester United assistant manager . * I had nothing to do with David Moyes' sacking - I found out by reading the paper . * Manchester United were not in decline when I left... David Moyes was sacked because his team were too slow . He calls Liverpool's ultimately unsuccessful title charge 'brilliant' but cast doubts on the ability of Manchester City to add to their second Premier League title. City, currently five points behind early leaders Chelsea, only took the lead in the title race last season late on after Liverpool's defeats to Chelsea and Crystal Palace. City eventually claimed the crown by two points. And Ferguson says that narrow margin of victory - as well as the City's title triumph in 2012, when they pipped United on goal difference - could show a weakness in City's armour. 'There was no question that City possessed the best group of players,' Ferguson writes. 'Though the fact they have twice won the league so narrowly leaves a question mark. Why is that?'

"Duncan Ferguson was involved in a motorway pile up when an Audi crashed into the back of his £18,000 BMW today, but refused to go to hospital . He is known for his hard-man reputation both on and off the pitch. So imagine what this motorist must have felt when they crashed into the rear of an £18,000 BMW only to find former Everton striker Duncan Ferguson behind the wheel. The 43-year-old was driving on the M57, where it becomes the Knowsley Expressway, near Liverpool this morning when an Audi A3 struck the back of the blue BMW 1 series he was driving. The white Audi A3 convertible, worth around £25,000, was badly damaged in the pile up, which happened at around 7.30am, with its front bonnet left crumpled. The extent of the damage done to the BMW is unknown. Neither driver is thought to have sustained serious injuries, and true to his hard-man image Ferguson is believed to have refused to go to hospital for treatment. Ferguson, who is now a first team coach at Everton, is believed to have been driving a company car belonging to the club at the time of the crash. The crash caused long tailbacks as rush hour got underway, and drivers were advised to find another route. Ferguson, who won seven caps for Scotland during his career, spent ten years at Everton as a player  in two spells, from 1994 until 2006, with a short spell at Newcastle in the middle. He was even touted as a potential successor to former boss David Moyes when he left for his ill-fated role at Manchester United in 2013, but the job eventually went to current incumbent Roberto Martinez. Police and the Highways Agency confirmed that the crash had happened at around 7.30am. It was deemed to be a minor incident and no arrests were made. Everton Football Club has not responded to MailOnline's request for comment. The former Everton striker, 43, was driving on the M57, where it becomes the Knowsley Expressway, near Liverpool this morning when another car struck the back of the blue BMW 1 series he was driving .

Although he scored more goals than any other Scottish player in the FA Premier League, finding the net 68 times, Duncan Ferguson also racked up nine red cards, and a three-month prison sentence for assault after headbutting another player during a game. While playing for Rangers in 1994, Ferguson headbutted Raith Rovers striker John McStay. Referee Kenny Clark did not book Ferguson over the incident, telling Rovers players he had not seen it, but Ferguson but was subsequently charged with assault. He was sentenced to three months in prison in 1995, by which time he had left Rangers for Everton. He served 44 days. In 2001, Ferguson confronted two intruders who had broken into his home, managing to detain one - Barry Dawson - until police arrived. Two years later, Ferguson confronted another burglar at his home, who subsequently spent two days in hospital. Carl Bishop, who was jailed for four years in 2003, had complained that he had been assaulted by Ferguson, but this was dismissed by police.","Former Everton striker was driving club's BMW 1 Series at time of crash .

"North Carolina election officials repeatedly offered ballots last week to an impostor who arrived at polling places with the names and addresses of 'inactive' voters who hadn't participated in elections for many years. No fraudulent votes were actually cast: It was the latest undercover video sting from conservative activist James O'Keefe, whose filmmaking résumé reads like a target list of liberal causes. He famously shuttered ACORN, the community organizing outfit once linked to Barack Obama. He dressed in an Osama bin Laden costume and waded across the Rio Grande from Mexico to America as a show of disdain for U.S. border policy. He videotaped people admitting they sold taxpayer-provided cellphones for drugs, shoes, handbags and spending cash. Now O'Keefe has strolled into more than 20 voting precincts in Raleigh, Durham and Greensboro, N.C., proffering the names of people who seldom vote in order to test the integrity of the election process. It seems to have failed on a massive scale. 'I just sign this and then I can vote?' he asked one poll worker. 'Yep,' came the reply. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . In precinct after precinct, North Carolina election officials confirmed that anyone can participate there on Election Day without proving he or she is eligible to vote . In all, 20 locations offered to let an undercover impostor vote on the same day he turned up with only someone else's name and address . North Carolina is one of 33 states – plus the District of Columbia – where voters can cast ballots long before election day, and one of 19 states where people can vote without showing any documents whatsoever. In 2016, however, an aggressive voter ID law will take effect in the Tarheel State. Last week O'Keefe's Project Veritas Action organization took its first deep-dive into North Carolina election politics, filming Democratic campaign workers saying they would help illegal immigrants vote for incumbent Senator Kay Hagan. This time he strolled into polling places in Raleigh, Durham and Greensboro to see how easy it would be to vote fraudulently in the name of another person. He was offered twenty ballots at a variety of polling places before a pair of officials finally challenged him. 'They wanted to protect the system,' O'Keefe says in the video, released exclusively to MailOnline. 'They had to break the rules to do it.' 'Of all of the undercover investigations I've conducted, this was by far the easiest,'he said Monday. 'They were willing to pass out fraudulently obtained ballots like it was Halloween candy.' If North Carolina is a hotbed of voter fraud – conservatives suggest it is, and that the dynamic benefits Democrats – the ground rules will change before the 2016 election. In 2013 Governor Pat McCrory signed a set of sweeping new voting rules into law, including a no-exceptions requirement that voters show a government-issued ID on Election Day. 'The state legislature took extremely aggressive steps to curtail the voting rights of African-Americans,' U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder claimed at the time. After a lawsuit from the Obama administration and a series of legal appeals, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled last month that the state is entitled to make voters prove who they are. That provision of the law won't go into effect until 2016 – other sections, including a ban on same-day voter registration, are in force already – making this go-round the last of its kind in the Tarheel State. But McCrory's government is already sending Department of Motor Vehicles mobile units into 32 communities this month, two years ahead of time, to provide free IDs to anyone who wants them. Guerrilla videographer James O'Keefe went to polling places in three North Carolina cities, posing as people who records show hadn't voted in ages . Election officials offered O'Keefe forms to sign and promised they would let him vote (he never actually signed forms, voted, or claimed to be the people whose names he was using) Ballots for everyone: Helpful election workers are following the law by opening the voting booth to all comers, but in 2016 the system will be turned on its head . The offer is an important one: The 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits the levying of 'poll taxes,' meaning that if an ID is required to vote, a free option must be made available. By this time in 2016, the state government hopes, naysayers who see the voter ID law as a barrier to minorities and the poor will see hundreds of thousands of new, zero-cost IDs coming out of voters' wallets and purses. For now, though, O'Keefe is using North Carolina as a proxy for the other 42 states – and the District of Columbia – which don't require voters to show a photo ID. His crew used publicly available election rolls to identify 'inactive' voters and then chose 30-year-old men for him to impersonate. The final footage shows election officials, over and over, accepting O'Keefe's claim that he was one of those people. 'With almost three-quarters-of-a-million inactive voters and no voter ID law in place, we could have turned the election results for most major candidates in the state,' he claimed Monday. 'What we uncovered in this video illustrates how easy it would be for a well-orchestrated campaign with no regard for the law to change the outcome of a major election. Voter laws across the country need to be changed immediately to prevent this sort of potential voter fraud.' FINALLY: One poll worker realized that the name and address O'Keefe offered belonged to someone who hadn't voted in a long time – but he actually broke the law by insisting on seeing identification . O'Keefe has tweaked the political left on the contentious voter ID issue before. In 2012 he filmed an actor walking into a Washington, D.C. polling place and giving an official the name and address of Eric Holder – the U.S. attorney general who was so outspoken against ID requirements. The young man was offered the high-ranking Obama administration official's ballot before pulling O'Keefe pulled the plug on their experiment. In the resulting video, the impostor is seen offering to go to his car and produce a photo ID 'faster than you can say ""furious""' – a dig at Holder, who presided over the botched Operation Fast and Furious gunwalking scandal. 'You don’t need it,' the poll worker replied, referring to the ID. 'It’s all right.' 'As long as you’re in here, you’re on our list, and that’s who you say you are, you’re okay.' In other videos, O'Keefe has demonstrated that New Hampshire residents could get ballots in the names of deceased persons, and that Minnesotans could vote by offering the names of sports superstars including New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. Some voter fraud episodes, though, become news on their own. One that surfaced on Saturday appeared to track with what might have happened if O'Keefe had broken the law and actually voted with the ballots he was offered. In Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, the county clerk reported that a voter trying to cast an ballot during the 'early voting' period was shocked to learn that someone had already voted in his name three days earlier. In North Carolina, as in 18 other states and five US territories, no identification at all is required before people exercise their right to vote in the 2014 congressional midterm elections . Racist? Some civil rights activists insist a move to require IDs at the polls is rooted in anti-black prejudice, but the late South African President Nelson Mandela advocated the same policy at the start of the African National Congress 1999 election campaign . He hadn't voted, he insisted. And the signature on the first voter card filed in his name didn't match his own. The man was allowed to vote on what's known as a 'provisional ballot,' and it's unclear whether it will be counted. Bobbi Shearer, the Director of New Mexico's Bureau of Elections, told KOB-TV4 that local election officials in the state's northern reaches weren't to blame. 'I have nothing but praise for their efforts to try to ensure integrity in the election,' Shearer said. 'It is just that under current law, there are no means available to poll workers to help them determine if a voter is actually the person he says he is.' Like North Carolina, New Mexico has no law on the books requiring an ID on Election Day.","Conservative guerrilla filmmaker James O'Keefe pretended to be a series of North Carolinians who hadn't voted in years .

"A young Egyptian woman has died from bird flu, the second death from the virus this year, a health ministry spokesman said. The 19-year-old contracted the deadly H5N1 strain after coming into contact with infected birds and died Monday at a hospital in the southern region of Assiut. Egypt has identified seven cases of the virus in people this year, including the two who died, spokesman Hosam Abdel Gaffar said. Deadly chicken: The 19-year-old contracted bird flu after coming into contact with infected poultry, and died Monday at a hospital in the southern region of Assiut (stock image) Egypt's health ministry had announced in an earlier . statement the discovery of the disease in a 30-year-old woman in . the southern area of Minya, bringing to seven the number of . confirmed Egyptian cases of the disease. Another of the victims was a three-year-old who had been . exposed to infected birds and was doing well, it said. Bird flu, also known as avian flu, is an infectious viral illness that spreads among birds. In rare cases, it can jump the species barrier and infect humans. Two strains in particular - H5N1 and H7N9 - have caused serious concern among experts in recent years. This follows Britain’s first bird flu outbreak since 2008, which was reported this weekend. An Egyptian health worker gives vaccinations to chickens at a house north of Cairo (stock image) The virus has been discovered at a duck farm in the village of Nafferton, East Yorkshire. The virus is from the H5 group and is still being tested - though officials insist it is not the dangerous H5N1 strain and should pose little risk to humans. But all 6,000 ducks on the stricken farm - run by specialist duck supplier Cherry Valley - will be culled 'immediately' to reduce the risk of the virus spreading. The alarm was raised after a private vet visited the farm and had suspicions that the virus was present, so alerted the Animal and Plant Health Agency, who swiftly contacted Defra. John Vernam, the managing director of Cherry Valley - which supplies crispy Peking duck meals for Chinese restaurants - said: 'I can confirm that a farm operated by Cherry Valley has today tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza. 'Culling and disinfection will be carried out under the authority of Defra and the APHA. 'Avian influenza is a disease of birds and the risk to the general public is judged by health experts to be negligible. 'We are working closely with Defra and other agencies and are confident that the controls in place are proportionate to the risks involved. 'We will be continuing our vigilance over the coming days and, like all poultry producers in the area, will be working with the authorities in the ongoing surveillance programme.' Officials are investigating whether the outbreak is linked to a discovery of the non-human H5N8 strain at a farm in the Netherlands yesterday - but test results are only expected in a few days.","A 19-year-old Egyptian woman has died from bird flu .

"Remarkable interviews with the circle of confidantes who surrounded Adolf Hitler in the days before his suicide have been shown for the first time on German television. In testimony from beyond the grave, the group of aides, secretaries and friends described life in the squalid bunker retreat beneath the Reich Chancellery in Berlin as Russian troops moved in. They revealed intimate domestic details of Hitler's favourite tea, the love letters from his admirers and the love song that he and Eva Braun, the woman he married in the underground hide, listened to over and over again. Scroll down for video . Last day: Adolf Hitler and his wife Eva Braun pose with their pets. The dictator is holding his favourite dog Blondi on a leash. He was to have her poisoned with cyanide . Final days: The bunker where Hitler spent his final days with his new wife Eva Braun before committing suicide . But the footage is also full of the horror of the weeks leading up to the fall of Berlin as the dictator prepared for his death. The interviews were conducted at Nuremberg three years after the war by an American film unit and carried out by US judge Michael Musmanno. He had helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals and had been given special access to the remnants of Hitler's court because the US Navy believed rumours that the Fuehrer had escaped to Argentina after the war. Historians had long believed that the footage was lost to history. But late last year a portion was found in an archive in Nuremberg. The rest was recovered from from relatives of Mr Musmanno . Last night the extraordinary film was broadcast for the first time in a programme called 'Witnesses to the Downfall.' Love song: Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun. Arthur Kannberg, Hitler's butler, revealed how a song called 'Blood Red Roses' was the favourite of Hitler and Eva, a record they listened to 'over and over' Traudl Junge, who was Hitler's . favourite secretary, told the cameras how her boss was receiving love . letters from besotted followers right up until his suicide in the Berlin . bunker in April 1945. 'That . was my first job for him, bringing the post from women who had nothing . better to do than write to him. They were love letters, yes,' she said. 'But I only remember him as someone . paternal who was always worried about me. I never saw him as the . statesman, I didn't attend any of his conferences. We were summoned only . when he wanted to dictate and he was as considerate then as he was in . private. 'And our . office, both in the Reichschancellery and in the bunkers in the Wolf's . Lair or in Berklin , we were so far removed from his command quarters . that we never saw or even heard any of his rages that we heard whispers . about. We knew his timetable, whom he received, but except for the few . men he sometimes had to meals we attended. 'My . colleagues told me that in the earlier years he talked incessantly, . about the past and the future, but after Stalingrad, well, I don't . remember many monologues. 'We . all tried to distract him, with talk about films, or gossip, anything . that would take his mind off the war. He loved gossip. That was part of . that other side of him, which was basically the only one we saw. 'When I came to type his final testament . in the bunker during the last days of the war I thought he would . justify his actions and explain why Germany is in this position. That he . had a way out from our terrible tragedy. But he repeated only the old . slogans which he had used in his speeches.'

When he handed them over he said; 'Look after these until we meet . again.'' 'He also . spoke of a 'secret stash' of treasure of Hitler's which he hid near to . his home at Berchtesgaden, but it has never been found. August Wollenhaupt, the barber of .

One . bunker functionary called Lorenz said that after Hitler and Eva married . on April 29 1945 'there was a little party in the bunker. There was champagne but Hitler didn't drink any. He was concerned about getting his last will and testament down.' Relationship: Hitler (standing third from right) and va Braun (kneeling far right). His butler said 'Hitler and Eva were very much in love, but perhaps not to the extent that he ever wanted children with her' Killed: Eva Braun with Hitler's beloved dog Blondi . Hitler's air force aide Bernd Freytag von Loringhoven told the cameras about the poisoning of Hitler's beloved Alsatian dog 'Blondi'. 'He watched as cyanide was slipped into its mouth and its jaw was pushed down to break the glass,' he reported. 'Hitler . was emotionless. He only wanted to know if it worked and it did. Later . the propaganda minister's wife Magda Goebbels would use the capsules to . murder all her children as they slept.' Hitler was given his beloved dog as a gift and he became so fond of her that she slept in his bedroom in the bunker during his final days. But this affection was not shared by Eva Braun who preferred her two Scottish Terrier dogs named Negus and Stasi. According to Hitler's secretary she hated Blondi and was known to kick her under the dining table. According eyewitness accounts, Hitler's dog-handler, Feldwebel Fritz Tornow, shot Blondi's puppies outside the bunker after Hitler and his new wife committed suicide . A Colonel Holsten who was in the . bunker when Hitler and Eva ended their lives on April 30 1945 told how . he saw the bodies being dragged up the narrow stairs to the Reich . Chancellery garden where they were doused in petrol and set aflame. 'I was frozen,' he said, 'then raised my arm automatically one last time in the 'Hitler Greeting' to salute him.' Hermann Karnau, an S.S.  bodyguard of the Fuehrer who escaped the bunker and tried to return to it at the last moment, said; 'I tried to get back through into the bunker through the emergency exit when I saw about 20 metres away from me the bodies of Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun. 'They had been set on fire.  When I went to the spot early in the evening to try to move them into a hollow in the ground, they disintegrated. 'I recognised that it was Hitler from his uniform and his distinctive moustache.  I had seen the Fuehrer alive that morning sitting in his favourite wicker chair.  Later in the day, before the suicides, I recalled seeing four men arrive with gasoline cans which they said was for the air conditioning system inside the bunker.

LIFE correspondent Percy Knauth sifting through the dirt & debris . in the shallow shell hole where the bodies of Hitler and Eva Braun were . thought to have been burned after their suicides, in the garden of the . Reichstag. 'As I remembered that the air conditioning system was fuelled by diesel, I personally denied them entrance to the bunker. I relented after Heinz Linge, Hitler's valet, vouched for them. This was, of course, the petrol that was to be used to cremate the bodies of Hitler and Eva Braun. 'I last saw Hitler alive around about 4.00pm that day.  I believed that the Fuehrer had been poisoned by his personal physician Dr Ludwig Stumpfegger.' Erich Kempka, Hitler's chauffeur from the earliest days of the Nazi movement, scrounged the necessary fuel to burn the bodies in the garden of the Reichs Chancellery. He said; 'I remember with complete sureness that I was called on April 30 by S.S. Sturmbannfuehrer Guensche while I was in the Reich Chancellery garage asking me to bring over five cans of petrol to the bunker. 'Once there Guensche told me the Fuehrer was dead and that he had been ordered to burn his corpse 'so that he would not be exhibited at a Russian freak-show.' 'I then helped carry the corpses. While Linge and an orderly whom I do not remember were carrying the corpse of Adolf Hitler, I carried the corpse of Eva Hitler.  I noticed the long black trousers and the black shoes which the Fuehrer usually wore with his field-gray uniform jacket. 'The corpses were taken from the bunker to a spot about four to five metres distant from the bunker exit and at this location both bodies were cremated. 'Guensche poured the complete contents of the five cans over the two corpses and ignited the fuel. Reichsleiter Martin Bormann, Reichs minister Dr Goebbels, SS-Sturmbannfuehre Guensche, SS Sturmbannfuehrer Linge, the orderly and I stood in the bunker entrance, looked towards the fire and all saluted with raised hands .'","Filmed testimonies about Hitler were made three years after the war .

"Islamic State militants have shot and wounded a senior Syrian rebel commander inside Turkey, it has been claimed, raising yet more questions of Ankara's commitment to defeating the terror group. Abu Issa, the leader of a group fighting ISIS in the besieged city of Kobane, and his 20-year-old son Ammar, were ambushed by jihadists in the southeastern Turkish town of Urfa on Friday afternoon. The pair - who had been attending a meeting with Turkish officials - were snatched from their car in an apparent kidnapping attempt, after the driver of their car allegedly simply switched off the engine when confronted by four heavily armed ISIS militants at a roadblock. After being seized they were driven at high speed towards the Syrian border and only managed to escape when one of the third-party smugglers ISIS uses to transport people and weapons into Syria bailed on the plan after spotting Turkish soldiers. Scroll down for video . Conflict: After being kidnapped in Turkey, Abu Issa was driven at high speed towards the besieged Syrian town of Kobane (pictured) where is a senior figure in the anti-Islamic State group Thuwar Raqqa . Hostile: Abu Issa is the leader of a group fighting ISIS in the besieged city of Kobane (pictured). He and his 20-year-old son Ammar, were ambushed by jihadists in the southeastern Turkish town of Urfa on Friday afternoon . Militant: The attempted kidnapping raises serious questions about Turkey's commitment to joining the international effort to destroy the Islamic State terror group in Syria and Iraq . None of the Islamic State attackers wore masks and two of them were known to Abu Issa from fighting in Kobane, his aides in the Thuwar Raqqa rebel group told the Telegraph. Using an alternative acronym for the terror group, spokesman Ahmed Abdul Khader said: 'Isil cars blocked the road ahead of them, and four armed men grabbed them from the vehicle. It was 6.30pm.' A matching account of the kidnapping was reportedly given to the newspaper by another military commander in the group, Abo Ayham. He claimed that Abu Issa's driver - who was also his most trusted advisor - had been in on the plot, driving the rebel leader into a quiet back road where the extremist were waiting, refusing to turn the vehicle around when ordered to do so, and turning off the car's engine rather than trying to escape. Location: The southeastern Turkish town of Urfa - where Abu Issa was kidnapped - is approximately 50 miles from the Syrian border. His kidnapping was only aborted when a third-party smuggler helping the militants bailed on the plan when he saw Turkish soldiers close to the Syrian border crossing near Kobane . Fighting: Black smoke is seen rising from an ISIS-held building inside Kobane yesterday afternoon . Hit: A cloud of thick white smoke rises from a building in Kobane following an airstrike by a U.S. airplane . Kurdish forces defending a besieged Syrian town against ISIS fighters received supplies and weapons in an airdrop Sunday, US military officials said. The airdrops into Kobane, on the border of Turkey, were the first conducted by the US in Syria and followed a series of American and coalition airstrikes supporting the Kurds. The US stated earlier Sunday that it had launched 11 airstrikes overnight in the area of Kobane. In a statement Sunday night, US Central Command said  C-130 cargo planes made multiple drops of arms and medical supplies that had been provided by Kurdish authorities in Iraq. The airdrops were intended to support continued resistance to ISIS as the Islamist extremist group attempts to gain control of Kobane. The news raises yet more questions about Turkey's commitment to the international fight against ISIS, after Ankara drew a great deal of international criticism for refusing to intervene to help Kurdish fighters battling militants just 200 yards over the border in Kobane. There are also serious questions over why Turkey has allowed thousands of Western jihadists - who enter the country on budget airlines in tourist resorts - to easily pass over the border into Syria to join ISIS fighters there. Turkey has long argued that ISIS does not have a presence in the country. Others claim small cells are able to operate in southern Turkish towns, easily popping over the border to fight in Syria before returning home to Turkey. There are even claims from those on the ground that wounded ISIS militants are routinely smuggled from the frontline to receive treatment in Turkish hospitals, which are better equipped and less-stretched than those in northern Syria. Turkey has also been accused of allowing up to 3,000 detained Western jihadists to rejoin the Islamic State in Syria in return for the release 49 diplomats who had been held prisoner by the terrorists.

Syrian refugees now living in Turkey watch the ongoing fighting over the border in their hometown Kobane . Syrian refugee children, one flashing the V-sign, peer through the window of a school building that has been serving as a refugee center in the Turkish border town of Suruc, Turkey . Experts believe Turkey's reluctance to fully commit to the fight against ISIS is two-fold. Firstly the brave Kurdish fighters battling ISIS in northern Syria have links to the Kurdistan Workers' Party - a group long-banned in Turkey amid accusations of terrorism. Secondly, due to Turkey sharing borders with both Syria and Iraq, Ankara is understood to be worried that any move against ISIS could trigger a wave a car and suicide bombings there - something that would be devastating for the country's hugely important tourism industry. This morning the main Syrian Kurdish armed group defending Kobane against an ISIS offensive said it hopes for more support after the U.S. air-dropped arms to its fighters for the first time. The U.S. military said on Sunday C-130 aircraft had delivered small arms, ammunition and medical supplies provided by the Kurdish authorities in Iraq. 'It will have a positive impact on the course of military operations and certainly we are still hoping for more support,' Redur Xelil told Reuters via Skype. An American journalist has been killed in a car crash in Turkey just days after claiming she claimed the Turkish intelligence services had threatened her over her reporting of the siege of Kobane. Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle'. Shim's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested, claiming Turkish intelligence agents had accused her of spying after one of her reports suggested ISIS militants were being smuggled back and forth over the Syrian border in the back of aid vehicles. Tragic: Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle' Shim, an American citizen of Lebanese origin, had been working in Turkey for Press TV - the Iranian state-owned television network. In a report published on the company's website, it is claimed she had been in a rental car on the way back to her hotel in the town of Suruc in Urfa Province when the 'suspicious' accident took place. Neither the 'heavy vehicle' nor the driver involved in the crash have been located after the incident, Press TV claimed, adding that her parents 'refused to believe' the crash had been an accident and are planning to pursue the matter legally. Press TV's account of the crash has been somewhat disputed by Turkish newspaper Hurriyet Daily News, however, who said the vehicle involved was a cement mixer and that the as-yet-unidentified driver had been arrested at the scene. Death: Serena Shim's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested, claiming Turkish intelligence agents had accused her of spying . Only last Friday Shim was interviewed on camera by Press TV about her fears of being arrested by Turkish intelligence agencies. In the short interview she alleged that she had been approached and accused of spying after a report in which he said she claimed to have received images of Islamic State terrorists being smuggled over the Turkey-Syria in vehicles belonging to the World Food Organization and other aid groups. Shim described herself as 'surprised' at the accusation, 'because I have nothing to hide and I have never done anything aside my job.'","ISIS tried to capture senior Syrian rebel leader while he was in Turkey .

"An Australian body recovered from the Malaysia Airlines MH17 wreckage site had an oxygen mask wrapped around his neck, a Dutch prosecutor has claimed. Wim de Bruin, a spokesman  for the Dutch agency investigating  the incident, has informed the passenger's relatives that a mask was discovered around his neck  but officials are yet to release the Australian's name. He said it was not clear from forensic testing when the mask was applied to the man's face, but its discovery has raised questions that he was conscious after the plane was hit by a missile on July 17 over east Ukraine near the Russian border. Wreckage of flight MH17 is strewn across a field in eastern Ukraine . A body recovered near the wreckage was apparently wearing an oxygen mask, according to a Dutch official . Mr De Bruin said Dutch forensic experts investigated the mask 'for fingerprints, saliva and DNA,' but it did not produce any results, Associated Press reported. It comes as Holland's Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans apologised to the families of MH17 victims for revealing that a passenger was wearing a mask on live TV. It resulted in a flood of phone calls to investigators from the relatives of the 298 passengers and crew who perished, including 38 Australians, seeking more information about the passenger. Mr Timmermans had asked talk-show host Jeroen Pauw whether he was aware that a passenger was wearing a mask on the flight when he said: 'Did you know that someone was found with an oxygen mask over his mouth?' But he apologised  on Thursday, saying: 'I have an enormous amount of sympathy for the next-of-kin,' he said. 'The last thing I want to do is compound their suffering in this way,' The Sydney Morning Herald reported. The Dutch Foreign Minister received international acclaim for a speech he made days after the incident. He suggested that the discovery of the oxygen mask-wearing passenger revealed that at least one person was conscious when the plane was hit by a missile fired by Russian-backed rebels. He also added during the interview that it was unlikely that any of the 298 passengers and crew on board saw the missile approaching. 'No, they did not see the missile coming, but did you know that someone was found with an oxygen mask over his mouth? So someone had the time to to do that,' he said. There was no evidence to conclude that the final moments could not have been as described in his speech at the UN - when he played through scenarios of passengers on the plane.

'Did they lock hands with their loved ones, did they hold their children close to their hearts, did they look each other in the eyes, one final time, in a wordless goodbye? We will never know.' Experts investigating the crash said everyone on board was most likely killed immediately or, if not, became unconscious within seconds. A preliminary report published by the Dutch Safety Board revealed puncture holes in the wreckage suggested small objects penetrated the plane through the cockpit. It was also revealed that holes were found on the cockpit floor and damage to the body was consistent with 'high-energy objects' piercing it from the outside. Forensic experts have so far been unable to recover all bodies from the crash site. About  228 coffins have been flown back to the Netherlands for identification, but some of the coffins contained only partial remains. It is unknown how many bodies remain unaccounted for and only 262 victims have been identified so far.

"The U.S. military and its allies hit Islamic State forces with 15 air strikes in Iraq and Syria during a three-day period, the U.S. Central Command revealed today. Thirteen attacks were carried out in Iraq since Wednesday and two more targeted Islamic State in Syria. The air strikes in Syria hit an Islamic State fighting position and staging area near Kobani and a tactical unit near Aleppo, Central Command said. In Iraq, bunkers, vehicles, a bulldozer and a fighting position were destroyed near Kirkuk and a large unit and four tactical units also were hit in five air strikes. Scroll down for videos . Hits: An explosion following an air strike is seen in western Kobani neighborhood on Sunday. The U.S. announced it had made 15 air strikes on ISIS since Wednesday . Near Mosul, two raids destroyed vehicles and a heavy weapon while another tactical unit was hit near Ramadi. Islamic State vehicles, tactical units, a fighting position and a building were hit in strikes near the Iraqi cities of Ar Rutbah, Falluja, Al Qaim and Baiji, Central Command said. The report comes after it emerged that a dozen of the United States Air Force's most feared attack aircraft were to be deployed in the battle against ISIS. Twelve A-10 'Warthogs' are being moved from Afghanistan to Kuwait to carry out patrols. They will be joined within weeks by around six Reaper drones armed with missiles, the New York Times reported. Shelter: A boy looks out from a window inside the bullet-riddled facade of his home after what activists said were overnight U.S.-led air strikes against the Islamic State in Raqqa on Monday . Destruction: A general view shows a school for the deaf and mute, destroyed in what activists said were overnight U.S.-led air strikes against the Islamic State, in Raqqa on Monday . The new weaponry marks an increase in the options open to military planners who have struggled to strike ISIS. A-10s, originally designed to destroy Soviet tank squadrons if the USSR had invaded the West, have proved a deadly weapon against Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. Slow-moving and equipped with a devastating 30mm cannon capable of firing almost 4,000 rounds a minute - as well as missiles and 500lb bombs - they can fly as low as 50ft and engage targets far more slowly than the bombers and fighter-bombers which have so far been deployed in Iraq and Syria. The decision to deploy A-10s and Reapers comes after a major battle-planning conference involving more than 200 commanders from 33 countries involved in the fight against ISIS. Deadly force: A line up of A-10s is pictured at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina earlier this year. Planes of this type will arrive in Kuwait for combat operations against ISIS next week . America remains by far the largest single country involved, but has now received backing from more Muslim countries. The main concern over the campaign has been the lack of targets to strike because of the nature of ISIS, which combines large groups acting like a conventional army, with insurgency tactics. Figures published in the New York Times show that just one in four missions over the last three months actually involves dropping bombs or firing missiles. Three-quarters of planes return to base without having deployed their armament.","Thirteen attacks were carried out in Iraq since Wednesday and two more targeted Islamic State in Syria, the U.S. Central Command has revealed ."
"Sir Alex Ferguson has insisted that David Moyes’ failure at Manchester United was not his fault and that the slow style of play his successor introduced was alien to his players. The legendary United manager, writing in updated chapters of his autobiography, rejects suggestions that Moyes inherited an ageing team and an ‘antiquated’ club that was already in decline. Ferguson, who retired in May 2013 after 27 highly successful years at Old Trafford, also distanced himself from the widely-held belief that he was solely responsible for appointing Moyes. And he says that he was not involved in the sacking of his successor after only 10 months in the job. Sir Alex Ferguson (left) handed over the reins at Manchester United to David Moyes (right) Moyes found Ferguson's standards impossible to live up to and was sacked in April 2014 . United fans displayed a banner at Old Trafford hailing Moyes as 'The Chosen One' throughout most of his reign . But some fans later vented their fury with a 'Wrong One - Moyes out' banner, which was flown over the ground . Ferguson retired from management after leading United to the Premier League title in May 2013 . The front cover of Ferguson's autobiography, which will be released on Thursday after being updated to include chapters on his life after retirement from management. Price: £8.99 . The 72-year-old Scot believes the former Everton manager found it a ‘massive jump’ from Goodison Park to Old Trafford. ‘He hadn’t realised just how big United is as a club,’ writes Ferguson. Ferguson adds in the new edition, extracts of which were published by The Guardian on Tuesday, that Moyes went against United’s traditions by adopting a more conservative style of playing. ‘The pace of play slowed down a touch. The reason for playing at speed was that United players had been accustomed to operating that way,’ writes Ferguson. ‘If the tempo slowed for any reason, I would be into them at half-time. “This is not us,” I would say. Playing with speed never hindered our results. It was our way: energy and determination in the last third of the pitch.’ Ferguson relives the catalogue of poor performances and defeats which built up the pressure on Moyes. In particular, Ferguson refers to the 3-0 home defeats by Liverpool and Manchester City in March and he describes how, in the second half against Brendan Rodgers’ team, it was ‘hard to watch that kind of outcome when Liverpool are the ones dishing out the pain’. Ferguson also reveals in the latest version of My Autobiography — officially released tomorrow but leaked yesterday afternoon — that he was not involved in the process to sack Moyes or the decision to appoint Louis van Gaal, who he describes as ‘formidable’, last summer. Despite this, Ferguson stops short of admitting that he chose the wrong man in Moyes, saying it was a democratic decision following a thorough assessment of the candidates. He writes: ‘There appears to be an accepted view out there that there was no process. Nonsense. We feel we did everything the right way: quietly, thoroughly, professionally.’ Samir Nasri celebrates a goal in United's 4-1 Manchester derby defeat under Moyes last September . Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick and Danny Welbeck reflect on their humiliation at the Etihad Stadium .

United's squad react to their Champions League quarter-final exit at Bayern Munich . * I spoke to Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra about their Manchester United futures... but dressing-room was out of bounds . * I tried to convince David Moyes to keep Mike Phelan as Manchester United assistant manager . * I had nothing to do with David Moyes' sacking - I found out by reading the paper . *Louis van Gaal is formidable... and he and Ryan Giggs can learn from each other . Ferguson won 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups, four League Cups, two European Cups and the European Cup-Winners’ Cup during his tenure at United. He announced his retirement in May 2013, shortly before leading United to another title success. The first edition of his autobiography was released in October 2013. Moyes was revealed as his successor on May 9, signing a six-year contract. He was sacked on April 22 this year. Ferguson also rails against suggestions that the set-up at United was ‘antiquated’ in the new chapter. He writes: ‘Antiquated was a bizarre description of the structure I left behind at Manchester United. Have you seen our new training ground?’ And the former United manager dismisses complaints that he left behind an old squad. He points out that the group who won the title by 11 points featured nine players aged 25 and under, including Jonny Evans, David de Gea and Danny Welbeck. He also says that Chelsea, this season’s title favourites, have six players in their thirties but he doesn’t hear ‘any grumbles about the age of their group’. Ferguson does reveal that he tried to talk Moyes into retaining Mike Phelan as assistant manager. Moyes brought his own backroom staff with him from Everton and Ferguson says: ‘Maybe David felt he had to be sure all corners were covered in terms of his support system. I felt that network was already there, with plenty of great people already in important slots.' Ferguson played a big role in choosing Moyes as his successor after 26-and-a-half years in charge at United . Ferguson and Moyes arrive together at the  annual League Managers Association awards in 2013 . Rio Ferdinand was one of several players highlighted after Ferguson's retirement for being past his best . Ferguson reveals for the first time how the Old Trafford hierarchy made the decision to sack Moyes without consulting him. He was made aware that Moyes was on the verge of losing his job when he saw a newspaper report while flying back to Manchester from Aberdeen on the Monday after United’s 2-0 defeat at Everton. ‘At the same time, David Moyes texted me. I wasn’t sure what to say to him because I was unsure what was happening at that exact moment. I spoke to Ed (Woodward, executive vice-chairman) when I got back to Manchester and established that a final decision had been made. ‘I knew Ed wanted to tell David Moyes in person the following day and that we had come to the end of David’s time at Old Trafford.’ Ferguson rubbishes claims that he exerted too much influence at United after his retirement but admitted he spoke to Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra about their futures. He says players did not come to him to complain as the season unravelled under Moyes, writing: ‘Did players come to see me to complain? Did they hell. Utter nonsense.’ But he writes that Ferdinand did ‘ask my advice on his future’ and that he had a similar chat with Evra. Ferguson denies being abused by United fans at one home game and said nobody around him heard any dissent aimed at him. He adds: ‘I wouldn’t ever expect to be abused by Manchester United fans.’ Like our Manchester United Facebook page.","Sir Alex Ferguson has updated his controversial autobiography .

"Gold Coast woman Helena Sidelik is one of the two Australians still missing in the Ukraine . All but two Australian victims killed in the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight 17 have been identified, with hopes of finding them fading after 100 days of searching has passed. Now, the Dutch-led-multi-nation investigation fear that recovering further evidence is highly unlikely, with only 36 of the 38 Australians  recovered from the crash site in eastern Ukraine. In July pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine shot down flight MH17, killing 298 passengers on board. Gold Coast woman Helena Sidelik is one of the two Australians still missing in the Ukraine. The 56-year-old had been returning home after attending a friend's wedding in Amsterdam when she died on MH17. 'It's now been three months and as time goes by there seems to be more chance that Helena may not be found and she may not get a proper burial and that is very distressing,' her brother Hans Sidelik told Fairfax. 'We know that this is a slow process. All we want is for my sister to be identified and for her to come home.' In Milan last week, Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop insisted for Russian President Vladimir Putin to allow investigators to gain access into the crash site before winter sets in. Scroll down for video . All but two Australian victims killed in the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight 17 have been identified .

Thirty Australians have been brought back home, as 40 Australian Federal Police continue to work with Dutch, Belgian, Malaysian and Ukraine personnel on the investigation, The Sydney Morning Herald reports. A ceremony has been held for each Australian victim returning from the crash site. As for the families of the deceased, a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade official has been appointed individually to help them with statements to the media and pastoral care. But Jerry Skinner, an American lawyer and co-associate of Sydney law firm LHD lawyers is now warning the MH17 families on compensation rights and risks. Malaysians hold a candlelight vigil for passengers and crew of crashed flight MH17 . Australian Emma Bell (pictured, left) and Mary and Garry Menke were 3 of 38 Australians on board flight MH17 . He explains that when a deal is registered in the European Court of Human Rights by a German academic, in this case Professor Elmar Giemulla, their rights to adequate compensation may be withheld. 'A lot of Australian families will be unaware that this action could lock them into compensation levels that the families never approved,' Mr Skinner said. Although Professor  Giemulla only represents three German families, he is still filing his action on behalf of all passengers on board MH17. 'If he is successful, Australian families who choose to pursue further damages from Russia, Malaysia or Malaysia Air could be limited or barred by a legal action they did not authorise,' Mr Skinner told Fairfax. Thirty Australians have been brought back home, as 40 Australian Federal Police continue to work with Dutch, Belgian, Malaysian and Ukraine personnel on the investigation .

While speaking to the German media, Professor Giemulla said he hopes for $1.3 million in compensation for each victim. Malaysian Airlines have offered $5000 to each victim, which does not include the final compensation sum. Discussions surrounding compensation has only just began but are expected to take years.

"Footage has emerged of Darren Wilson - the police officer who killed Michael Brown - threatening to arrest a man for filming him. The video shows Wilson approaching a resident in Ferguson, Missouri, and demanding that he put away his camera. It comes as a grand jury deliberates whether or not to indict Wilson for killing Brown in August, which sparked months of protest and accusations of racism. Scroll down for video . 'Lock your ass up': Darren Wilson was filmed last year threatening to arrest a man for filming him . The arrest was filmed in 2013, but was only posted online this week. It shows Wilson telling Mike Arman, a 30-year-old Ferguson resident, to put away his phone or be arrested. Wilson, thinking he is being photographed rather than filmed, said: 'If you wanna take a picture of me one more time, I’m gonna lock your ass up.' In response, Arman, identified by the Guardian, said: 'Sir, I’m not taking a picture, I’m recording this incident, sir.' The clip cuts out after Wilson approaches, but an incident report which Wilson filled out after the event revealed that Arman was cuffed and taken to Ferguson police station. Killed: Michael Brown, 18, (left) was shot dead by police officer Darren Wilson (right) in Ferguson, Missouri - an incident which sparked protests and accusations of racism . Fatal confrontation: Wilson is pictured above standing over Brown immediately after the shooting . There he was charged with failure to comply with Wilson, and also for breaching regulations on pit bull dogs. The charges were later dropped, Arman claims, when he showed police the video footage and proved his pet was not a pit bull. The incident offers another insight into Wilson, whose behavior during the fatal confrontation with Brown is under intense scrutiny. Wilson was investigating a theft when he came across Brown and a friend, whom he first told off for jaywalking. He then confronted them over the robbery, leading to the fatal shooting of Brown. Same day: Newly-released footage has also shown Wilson, left, visiting Ferguson police station after the killing . Recordings released yesterday from the event suggests the entire incident took less than 90 seconds. Accounts of the shooting vary wildly. Leaked details of Wilson's account tell how an aggressive Brown tried to wrestle him inside his SUV, and only let go after being shot. The account then purportedly says Brown ran away, only to 'charge' at Wilson, leading him to fire several more shots, which killed the 18-year-old. 'Intimidation': Protesters have complained about their treatment at the hands of the law at demonstrations over Brown's killing . Demonstrations: Brown's death sparked protests and vigils in Ferguson, where riot police officers came toe-to-toe with furious activists accusing them of racial violence . Others say Brown was in fact shot in the back while fleeing. Some have said he was raising his hands in submission when the fatal shots came. A grand jury is currently deliberating on whether to indict him over the shooting, and is expected to make its decision this month. A Ferguson police spokesman suggested to the Guardian that the filmed officer might not be Wilson - even though he wrote the incident report after arresting Arman.","Darren Wilson was filmed last year threatening to arrest Mike Arman .

"Ethnic Kurds clashed overnight with alleged members of a hardline Islamist movement in Hamburg last night, as ISIS clashes spread far from Syria. Police in the northern German city say 14 people were injured overnight in the violence involving hundreds of demonstrators before riot police were able to quell the disturbance. Police spokesman Karina Sadowsky said this morning that fighting began after hundreds of Kurds held a protest against the Islamic State group. Scroll down for video . Violent: Police walk through the mist of a water cannon during clashes in Hamburg, northern Germany, between Kurdish protesters and alleged Islamists after demonstrations outside a mosque turned violent .

Police confront  protesting Kurds: Police in the northern German city say 14 people were injured overnight in the violence involving hundreds of demonstrators wielding machetes and iron bars . Police surround a trio giving attention to an injured protester: Police spokeswoman Karina Sadowsky said this morning that fighting began after hundreds of Kurds held a protest against the Islamic State group . Similar protests took place throughout Europe on Tuesday by Kurds seeking to draw attention to Islamic State's onslaught against the Kurdish town of Kobani in northern Syria. The violence erupted after a standoff between the protesters, rumoured online to be supporters of the PKK, and members of a nearby mosque associated with the Salafist movement - a strict interpretation of Islam backed and funded by the Saudi regime. Local media reported that some demonstrators came armed with iron bars and machetes. Sadowsky says police used water cannons to break up the protest, and arrested 22 people. The Local reports that 400 Kurds gathered near the Al-Nour mosque after an earlier demonstration against the violence in Iraq and Syria. They were met by about 400 Salafi Muslims, according to police who said members of both groups came armed with metal bars, machetes and other sharp objects. Fighting broke out at about 11pm, prompting police to block all roads and try to drive vehicles between the two groups. After midnight police moved in with water cannon, staying on the streets in riot gear until the early hours of the morning. It's not the first inter-ethnic violence in Germany related to the current Middle East crisis. On Monday evening six people were hurt in Celle, Lower Saxony, after a brawl broke out between about 30 Muslims and 60 Yazidi Kurds. Around 60,000 Yazidis live in Germany. Ready to fight: Kurdish protesters brandish iron bars as they confront Muslims outside the Al-Nour mosque . Defending the mosque: Youths stand in front of the Al-Nour mosque, where the confrontation between Kurds and what police said were Salafist Muslims took place . Some 400 Kurds were said to have gathered at the mosque after an earlier demonstration, where they were met by an equal number of 'Salafi' Muslims. Both sides came armed with iron bars and machetes, police said . Nasty: A policewoman takes away weapons found after the fighting, while blood soaked clothes lie on the floor . Last night's violence in Germany came as at least nine Kurdish demonstrators were killed by police in Turkey as demonstrations against the government's failure to help Syrian Kurds fighting Isis just across the border turned violent. Turkey's pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party had called for citizens to protest the assault on Kobane, where the situation turned 'extremely critical' overnight. Officers used tear gas and water cannons to disperse protesters in Turkey's predominantly Kurdish eastern and south-eastern provinces, as well as the capital Ankara and in Istanbul, where cars were set on fire and demonstrators threw rocks and fireworks at police. There were rumours that in some areas police opened fire on demonstrators. Burning streets: Kurdish protesters are pictured in a street in the Turkish city of Diyarbakir as the anti-ISIS demonstrations across Turkey on Tuesday continued into the night . Explosions: Protesters throw fireworks at riot police on the streets of Istanbul on Tuesday evening . Five people were killed in Diyarbakir, the largest Kurdish city in the south-east, which saw clashes between protesters and police. A 25-year-old man died in Varto, a town in the eastern province of Mus, and at least half a dozen people were wounded there in clashes between police and protesters, local media reported. Two people died in south-eastern Siirt province, the governor was quoted as saying by CNN Turk Television, and another died in neighbouring Batman. Curfews were imposed in five predominantly Kurdish south-eastern provinces after the protests, in which shops and banks were damaged. Interior Minister Efkan Ala called for an end to the protests. 'Violence is not the solution. Violence triggers reprisals. This irrational attitude should come to an end immediately,' he told reporters. City on fire: A bus burned by Kurdish protesters is pictured at the Gaziosmanpasa district in Istanbul . Fighting back: Demonstrator flee as police use tear gas and water cannons in Istanbul . Violence: Turkey's pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party had called for democratic action against the assault on Kobane by ISIS . Some European countries are arming the Kurds, and the American-led coalition is carrying out airstrikes against the Islamic extremists, but protesters say it is not enough. Tensions are especially high in Turkey, where Kurds have fought a three-decade-long battle for autonomy and where Syria's violence has taken an especially heavy toll. Protests were reported in cities across Turkey on Tuesday, after ISIS fighters backed by tanks and artillery engaged in heavy street battles in Kobane. Police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse demonstrators in Istanbul and in the desert town of Kucuk Kenderciler, near Kobane on the Turkish side of the border. One person in Istanbul was hospitalized after being hit in the head by a gas canister, Dogan reported. Some protesters shouted 'Murderer ISIS!' and accused Turkey's government of collaborating with the Islamic militants. Authorities declared a curfew in six towns in the southeastern province of Mardin, the Anadolu Agency reported. Tension in Turkey: Protesters are seen hurling rocks and stones at police in Ankara, the capital of Turkey . Supporting the Kurds:  Protests were held across Turkey in support for the Kurdish fighters in Kobane . Several protesters in Ankara (pictured) and Istanbul covered their faces with scarves or gas masks . Although several calm protests were held across Europe on Tuesday, several cities in Turkey saw violence on the streets and clashes between demonstrators and riot police . Hundreds of thousands of Kurds live elsewhere in Europe, and mobilized quickly via social networks to stage protests after the advance on Kobane. Some European Kurds have gone to the Mideast recently to join Kurdish forces. In Brussels on Tuesday, about 50 protesters smashed a glass door and pushed past police to get into the European Parliament. Once inside, some protesters were received by Parliament President Martin Schulz, who promised to discuss the Kurds' plight with NATO and EU leaders. In Germany, home to Western Europe's largest Kurdish population, about 600 people demonstrated in Berlin on Tuesday, according to police. Austria, too, saw protests. Kurds peacefully occupied the Dutch Parliament for several hours Monday night, and met Tuesday with legislators to press for more Dutch action against the insurgents, according to local media. The Netherlands has sent six F-16 fighter jets to conduct airstrikes against Islamic State in Iraq, but says it does not see a mandate for striking in Syria. Protesters throw stones at a police vehicle in Ankara as officers attempt to disperse the crowd . Action: Turkish riot police detain protesters after using tear gas to disperse people in Ankara . France, too, is launching airstrikes on Islamic State positions in Iraq but not in Syria, wary of implications on international efforts against President Bashar Assad. ‘We don't understand why France is acting in Kurdistan in Iraq and not Kurdistan in Syria,’ said Fidan Unlubayir of the Federation of Kurdish Associations of France. Kurds protested overnight at the French Parliament and plan another protest Tuesday. Kurds also staged impromptu protests against the Islamic State fighters in Helsinki, Oslo and Stockholm. On Monday, protesters at the U.S. Embassy in Cyprus urged the international coalition to provide heavy weaponry to Kurdish fighters and forge a military cooperation pact with the Kurdish group YPG.","Kurdish protesters confronted Salafist Muslims outside a mosque .

"Turkish soldiers appear to have fired tear gas at citizens who were watching another day of bloody fighting in the besieged Syrian border town of Kobane. Scores of observers retreated from hillsides just a mile from the town - where the death toll in six weeks is said to have topped 800 - after military vehicles swept in earlier today in what Turkey claimed was a bid to ensure their safety. Onlookers were seeing rubbing their eyes as canisters landed in between their vans and motorbikes on the rocky outcrop, which had afforded the best views of the fighting from a distance. Chased away: Turkey fired tear gas on scores of observers who had gathered on a hillside near the border with the Syrian town Kobane . Wiping his eyes: It is not the first time the Turkish military has chased away citizens from the hillside, around a mile from the fighting . Staying put: The Rudaw news agency reported journalists retreated but citizens remained on the rocky outcrop as the military arrived . According to the Kurdish news agency Rudaw, soldiers in military vehicles ordered the citizens and journalists to retreat to other hills further from Kobane, which had a poorer view of the fighting. While the journalists complied, some of the residents remained and had the gas fired on them in an attempt to make them disperse. A military spokesman told Rudaw the move was to ensure the onlookers' safety, but did not elaborate any further. It is not the first time Turkey has tear-gassed citizens watching the bloody conflict in Kobane. Clashes erupted earlier this month between armed Turkish police and Kurdish refugees as they tried to march back to the border and stage a protest about the conflict. Guards in body-armour and helmets used tear gas to drive a group of around 200 desperate demonstrators back behind Turkish lines. Pinching his nose: The gas firing (pictured) appeared less severe than earlier this month, when Kurdish protesters were forced back . Military: Turkish Army vehicles were seen on the hillside as in Kobane, just a mile away, Islamist extremists tried to seize a border gate . Leaving: The gas canisters landed between vans and motorbikes, with people reportedly retreating to a hill with a poorer view . The scenes came on another day of fierce fighting between Kurdish forces and ISIS extremists, who have been battling to capture the strategic stronghold of Kobane for more than a month. ISIS militants - also called ISIL or Islamic State - tried to seize a post on the border between Kobane and Turkey last night but were repelled once more by Kurdish fighters, who have held them at bay for weeks after the West feared the town would fall. Kurdish official Idris Nassan said the militants shelled a border gate before being pushed back, adding: 'Of course they will try again tonight. Last night they brought new reinforcements, new supplies, and they are pushing hard'. To lose the border gate -- the only official way for the Kurdish fighters in Kobane to cross into Turkey -- would be a major blow to the fighters defending the town as well as the civilians who still remain. Iraqi Kurdish reinforcements are expected to arrive in Kobane but it is not clear how soon. The U.S. launched five fresh air strikes around the town today alongside 12 separate strikes in Iraq. What they could see: The view from the hillside today as Kobane witnessed another round of ISIS attacks and U.S. airstrikes . Strike: The U.S. strikes today (pictured) destroyed seven ISIS vehicles and a building used by the terror group, said U.S. officials . The U.S. Central Command said the strikes destroyed seven vehicles and one building belonging to the militants near Kobane - while in Iraq, forces concentrated on the area around the strategic Mosul Dam and near Fallujah. Britain, France, Australia, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Bahrain have all aided the assault, the U.S. officials added. Today one of the few groups which claims to monitor the situation on the ground in Syria said the death toll in Kobane had reached 851 - including almost 500 ISIS extremists. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, based in Britain, said 302 fighters from the Kurdish YPG group had so killed so far, compared to 481 from ISIS. The Observatory's list also included ten fighters from other groups, 21 civilians, and one volunteer bringing ammunition to the Kurds.

"A British jihadi bride has taken to Twitter to warn her 'sisters' back in the UK against contacting married men in Syria and to get their own militant husbands. Aqsa Mahmood, a 'bedroom radical' who travelled to Syria earlier this year, advised women thinking of joining extremists in the Middle East 'not to be a home wrecker' in a series of Twitter posts this week. Writing under an alias, the 20-year-old invited 'sisters' to use encrypted messaging services to make contact with those waging jihad abroad, but urged them not to ask questions 'already answered' in extremist blogs. Scroll down for video . Aqsa Mahmood, a British jihadi bride who travelled to Syria earlier this year, has been tweeting advice for 'sisters' in the UK . Posting for the first time since threatening the West on the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, she wrote: ‘Sisters please for the sake of Allah contact the sisters whom [sic] are online. 'Also know the fact many brothers whom you contact and chat to are married. Have some self respect and don't be a homewrecker.' The messages come after a string of threats against the West were detailed in an online diary by the former student. As well as warning against contacting the husbands of female extremists, she told would-be militants to 'pack thermal clothing' if they intend to travel to Syria, where the winters are 'too much'. 'Bun (forget) Scotland, the winters here are too much. Sisters please don't forget to pack thermal clothing or you'll regret it later on,' she wrote. She also hinted at her whereabouts, making reference to the Syrian town of Manbij, north east of Aleppo. The 20-year-old posted a series of tweets from a Twitter account offering other female jihadists advice . The former student also referred to a horse in the Syrian town of Manbij and tweeted this photograph . Today a spokesman for the 20-year-old's family said the posts were 'torturing' her parents. 'The family are aware of recent tweets. The best advice they could offer Aqsa is to not to offer any advice to young Muslims to whom she is essentially offering a death sentence,' Aemar Anwar, the family's lawyer, said. 'It's an extremely painful (situation) of mixed emotions - of extreme anger that their daughter has shamed them and shamed the community of Scotland. 'She has joined a cult that murders and tortures innocents. Yet again she's out there tweeting, attempting to take other children from their families. 'It's extremely difficult for her parents, not knowing whether she's dead or alive, wondering whether she will ever return home safely and added to that is the anger and shame at what she continues to do. 'What she claims to do in the name of Islam doesn't match with any of the values they taught her. A spokesman for the girl's parents Muzaffar and Khalida Mahmood said Aqsa's continued messages is 'torturing' the couple who are trying 'to move on with their lives' 'It's daily torture for them worrying about her yet having to get on with their lives. They have three other children to think about. 'She's gone now, but there's still this constant drip from Aqsa.' Mr Anwar added while her parents would still welcome the youngster back to the UK, the window of opportunity for her safe return is narrowing. 'She'll either be killed there by a drone or another militia. Or she can come home. 'We publically stated that every case should be treated on a case by case basis, and it may well be the situation that the authorities will want to speak to her. 'But if she was to face criminal sanctions it would be much better than what is likely a death sentence in Syria. Mahmood has not been seen by her family since fleeing their Glasgow home last November. In February, the former private schoolgirl married an extremist and began chronicling her life in the Middle East in a series of blog and Twitter posts. A spokesman for Police Scotland said: 'Enquiries are continuing into this matter.'","Aqsa Mahmood fled Glasgow for Syria after marrying an Islamic extremist .

"Turkey keeper Volkan Demirel took things into his own hands on Sunday night after he refused to play in his nation's Euro 2016 qualifier against Kazakhstan - due to receiving abuse from fans. Interestingly, the fixture took place at the Turk Telekom Arena - the home of Galatarasay. The 33-year-old - No 1 for his national side - was warming up ahead of the game when it appeared a section of partisan Galatarasay fans made their feelings known to Demirel. Volkan Demirel refused to play for Turkey after receiving abuse from fans prior to the game . A fight broke out when Demirel was leaving the stadium though he remained unscathed . Large numbers of the media witnessed the fracas outside the stadium after the match . And after receiving abuse from a number of fans already, one fan appeared to take things to the next level, giving Demirel an ironic thumbs up.

"Rescued: British female jihadi Umm Khattab al-Britaniyya (pictured) blogged about her release . A British female jihadi has claimed the Islamic State (IS) sent a lawyer to secure her release from a Turkish prison so she could join the terror group in Syria. Eighteen-year-old Umm Khattab al-Britaniyya describes in her blog how IS commanders arranged for a lawyer to come to the prison and persuade the Turkish authorities to free her and two other female fighters. She said the lawyer ‘worked some magic’ after they were arrested near the Turkish border and jailed. Umm Khattab, who is now living in the IS-run city of Manbij, northern Syria, with 16-year-old British jihadi twins Salma and Zahra Halane, says she feared she was going to be sent back to Britain. It is not clear whether the IS lawyer went to court to argue the case or simply made legal representations on behalf of the three women. In her diary Umm Khattab recounts that when she first arrived in Turkey earlier this year she met two other European female jiahdis. But when they tried to cross the border into Syria they were all arrested and imprisoned by the ‘Turkish military’ on suspicion of being members of IS. Umm Khattab, who married a Swedish jihadi recently killed in Kobane, says on her Tumblr blog: ‘We tried to act like Syrians but they made us lift our niqab up and they knew we weren’t Syrians. So the T [Turkish] military men took us to their base and were questioning us whether we were with “Daesha” [IS]. ‘We completely denied all claims and said we were aid workers lol.’ The Turkish authorities were so concerned about the women that the next day they booked them on return flights to their home countries. Umm Khattab recounts: ‘Me and the sister’s [sic] were just annoyed cause we were being sent back to Dar al-Kufr [land of non-believers]. ‘So Dawlah (IS) found out about our predicament and sent us a lawyer who worked some magic and after a looooong tiring week in prison they let us go, Alhamdulillah [all praise to God].’ While jihadis waging war in the Middle East are vocal in their hatred of Western society, those from Britain are greedily devouring Western products like Nutella and Red Bull on the frontline, it has emerged. Bounty and Snickers bars, energy drinks and non-alcoholic beer are among top treats for foreigners fighting for Islamic State (IS) in Syria and Iraq. It has been estimated that between 500 and 2,000 Brits have joined thousands of other foreigners fighting for the group. But despite IS rejecting ideals of civilised states, its fighters are happy to lap up the West’s goods, including junk food and other gadgets, such as the latest iPhones. One shopkeeper based in the central Syrian city of Raqqa, told the Financial Times: ‘These snacks were either unknown, or luxuries we couldn’t afford. ‘But when the fighters requested them, I didn’t ask questions. I ran to my supplier and placed an order.' After the IS lawyer had secured their release, the three women and their five children – all under the age of five – made a second attempt to cross the border, but were stopped and imprisoned again. This time one of Umm Khattab’s two friends used the guard’s mobile phone to contact her husband, an IS fighter, and after he spoke to the officials, they were all released. Umm Khattab adds: ‘Then we went outside and there was a car outside for us but I still was very paranoid, so we went in the car and inside was the man who had interrogated us. ‘So this guy drives... to another boarder [sic] controlled by Dawlah and we didn’t even have to run across. They opened the gates for us and we entered shaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam by the will of Allah.’ Although the case cannot be verified as Umm Khattab has chosen not to reveal her true identity, it shows how far IS is able to infiltrate Turkey’s border security to bring fighters and their families into Syria.","Umm Khattab al-Britaniyya claims she was rescued by an ISIS lawyer .

"Argentina traveled to Hong Kong looking for a morale-boosting victory following their 2-0 loss to bitter rivals Brazil. It's fair to say they got what they came for. Lionel Messi - who missed a penalty against Brazil - came off the bench to score twice as Argentina claimed an easy 7-0 victory against Hong Kong. Gonzalo Higuain and Nicolas Gaitan also scored a brace each while Ever Banega opened the scoring. Hong Kong had secured an important 2-1 win against Singapore on Friday but offered little against a far superior Argentina side. Host commentator . Full-time and it's an easy victory for Argentina. Some supporters ran on to the pitch as the game neared the end with one lucky fan even getting his shirt signed by Messi! Messi scores again to make it 7-0. The 27-year-old cuts in from the right, runs through four bodies on the edge of the area and unleashes an unstoppable shot. Argentina have breezed to this victory. Hong Kong have barely ventured into the opposition half. Manchester United star Angel Di Maria comes on for Gaitan who can be pleased with his contribution. Barcelona's Javier Mascherano, formerly of Liverpool, comes on for Fernando Gago while Enzo Perez is replaced by Roberto Pereyra. And another! Gaitan gets his second of the match. It took him only six minutes. Messi is on the scoresheet. Gaitan finds the Barcelona frontman with a tidy through ball and Messi casually chips the ball over the goalkeeper. The man everyone wants to see, Lionel Messi, is on the pitch. The Manchester City right back comes on for Inter Milan's Roncaglia for the last half an hour. It's Higuain at the double! Gaitan squares the ball to the Real Madrid frontman who taps the ball into the net. Easy. Debutant goalkeeper Nahuel Guzman is replaced by Agustin Marchesin who received his first call-up in four years for this clash. Nothing the goalkeeper could do about that one... 3-0 to Argentina. Nicolas Gaitan cuts in from the right before hammering the ball into the back of the net. Game over? Very (very) probably. Napoli striker Higuain powers a header home to double Argentina's lead. Banega, Gaitan and Pastore have seen so much of the ball during the first half... so much so, that the stats show that Hong Kong have had just 22 per cent of possession. It looks to be so hot and humid in Hong Kong that the players soaked shirts appear to be sticking to them. Not ideal conditions for a game of football. Second week in October and the return of 'proper football weather' - cold, dark, wet nights - is on the horizon here in England. The midfielder is in the thick of the action once again. However, after trading passes with goalscorer Banega, the 25-year-old shoots wide of the target from 20 yards out. Argentina have the lead and it's Sevilla midfielder Ever Banega with the goal. The midfielder, a target for Everton a couple of seasons ago, takes full advantage of a mistake by goalkeeper Yapp to put Argentina ahead. Yapp failed to hold onto Nicolas Gaitan's side-foot, the  nearest Hong Kong defender made a hash of his clearance and the ball fell to Banega on the edge of the area to smash the ball into the net. PSG goalkeeper Javier Pastore was played in by Gonzalo Higuain on the left of the box in acres of space but the Hong Kong goalkeeper Yapp Hung Fai saves well. Argentina, without star men Lionel Messi and Angel di Maria, will be looking to make amends for Saturday's 2-0 defeat to fierce rivals Brazil. Former Real Madrid midfielder Fernando Gago, now with Boca Juniors in his homeland, captains the side in Messi's absence. Argentina: Guzman, Roncaglia, Otamendi, Vergini, Vangioni, Perez, Gago, Banega, Pastore, Higuain, Gaitan. Hong Kong: Yapp, C. Lee, Agbo, Naegelein, Huang, Xu, W.

"At least 24 people have died after a boat carrying suspected migrants from Afghanistan and Syria sank off the coast of Istanbul, Turkish authorities said today. Coast guard vessels, divers and passing fishing boats rescued six people, while an unknown number will still missing. In all, about 40 people, many of them children, were believed to have been on board the vessel. Loss: Bodies of suspected migrants pulled from the water are covered as they lie on a harbor after a boating accident near Rumeli Feneri, in the Black Sea coast of Istanbul, Turkey . The Istanbul governorship office said the boat issued a distress call early this morning about three miles north of the Bosphorus Strait in the Black Sea . Refugees from countries such as Syria and Afghanistan and people migrating for economic reasons often pass through Turkey while trying to reach Europe by sea or land . Colonel Sakir Cicek, of the Turkish military's general staff command in the capital, Ankara, said the people on board were believed to be from Afghanistan and Syria. He said it was unclear where the vessel had set sail from. Emrecan Kolcu, one of the fishermen involved in the search and rescue operation, said he headed to the area when another fisherman radioed that he had seen a body in the sea. ""We saw dead bodies,"" Kolcu said. ""It was not possible not to see them, anyway. Everywhere was full of dead bodies. They had life vests on them."" The Istanbul governorship office said the boat had issued a distress call early this morning about three miles north of the Bosphorus Strait in the Black Sea. Seven coast guard vessels, a team of divers, one helicopter, two police vessels and numerous fishing boats were assisting in the search-and-rescue operation. Coast guard vessels, divers and passing fishing boats are scanning the sea for more survivors.

"A teenage girl who is believed to have travelled to Syria to join the fight against Islamic State was identified yesterday. She is Silhan Ozcelik, who went missing a month ago and is thought to be the first UK female to volunteer against the fanatics. Police have pinned an appeal poster to a noticeboard at the Kurdish Community Association in Haringey, north London, where she was an active member. A Kurdish teenager from London who is feared to have joined the fight against Isis in Syria has been named as 17-year-old Silhan Ozcelik, pictured above . Describing Silhan as a missing person, the poster says the teenager was last seen on the morning of October 27 at St Pancras international rail station. Officers think she caught a train to Belgium and then travelled to Syria probably via the Turkish border. It is possible that Silhan, who is a high achiever at school and hoped to become a human rights lawyer, wanted to join the YPJ, an all-female militia protecting Kurds from the IS militants. However, according to her family, she went to Syria simply to carry out humanitarian work. Her brother Engin told the Mail that their parents – Sultan and Ergun, both 51 – were unhappy about the posters. ‘We are not very happy about that because it has given an image of her that is wrong and upsetting,’ said the 26-year-old. ‘We are 100 per cent sure she has gone away to carry out humanitarian and charity work and not to become a fighter against IS.’ His sister has taken part in protests in London against atrocities by IS forces. The Kurdish association’s 50-year-old chairman, who did not want to be named, said: ‘She was upset about what has been happening to Kurdish people abroad. The police have called into the association twice in recent weeks looking for more information and they appear very worried about her.’ Merciless: Isis fighters in Raqqa, Syria . British police have arrested a man alleged to have helped the girl to travel to Belgium from where she planned to join Kurdish guerrilla fighters, according to Arman Banirad, of the Kurdish Community Association in Haringey. He also said that British Kurds are travelling to join the fight against Isis in Syria. Mr Banirad told MailOnline: ‘She was an activist and very politically in tune with the movement. ‘As many people are, she had a terrible feeling of impotence about not being able to do much here. She was very reserved and never discussed anything with people here. ‘Afterwards when we realised she had gone, I spoke to a lot of individuals and no-one had any idea this was going through her head. ‘I can’t confirm that she has gone to fight or not because after she went everything went quiet.’ He said many in the Kurdish community felt the same: ‘They are fighting for humanity and it is better to join the Kurdish YPJ than to join ISIS. Personally I believe that as long as it’s not Isis, it is obviously better.’ Mr Banirad said he knew of others seeking to join the fight: ‘This is a desperate situation. I have had cousins calling me up and crying down the phone, saying they can’t do nothing and the only thing they know is violence. Police are trying to establish if Ozcelik has taken up arms against Isis in Kobane (pictured) ‘I always say the power of the pen is more powerful than the Kalshnikov but the whole region is under threat.’ It follows the news that two former British Army soldiers have travelled to Syria to fight against Isis. James Hughes, 26, and Jamie Read, 24, are helping Kurdish peshmerga defend Kobane from the brutal terror group, whose ranks reportedly include 2,000 British Muslim recruits. Photographs posted on Facebook show the pair on the Syrian frontline dressed in combat fatigues and armed with assault rifles, posing in bullet-scarred buildings. On the website of the security firm they founded, Mr Hughes and Mr Read said they were motivated by 'conscience', not money, to travel to the warzone 'to assist innocent people in the face of terror from IS'. Insisting they were volunteer fighters, not guns for hire, the ex-servicemen said they would 'not do nothing while innocent men, women and children are tortured and murdered by Islamic State while the international community stands by and observes from the luxury of their boardrooms or their tanks on the hill'. Brothers in arms: Jamie Read, right, with American Jordan Matson, who is also fighting in Syria . James Hughes is helping Kurdish peshmerga defend the embattled city of Kobani from the brutal terror group . They add: 'This is not a religious war nor is it a racial war, this is a war of good against evil – a magnificent simplicity.' But Mr Read's mother said yesterday she was not happy that her son had travelled to Syrian Kurdistan – known as Rojava – to fight the Islamist extremists. Speaking from her family home in Carlisle, Wendy Armiger, 43, said: 'He's been in touch to say he's okay, but I don't like the fact that he's gone there. It's his life, but he's my son.' Mr Hughes, from Malvern, Worcestershire, said he had served in the infantry for five years, including three tours of Afghanistan, before leaving earlier this year. Mr Read, who lives in Newmains, North Lanarkshire, said in an online CV that he had been in the Army for three years, specialising in reconnaissance, before leaving in 2010 to work for private security companies. In August, the friends set up the Pathfinder Group Terrorism & Conflict Research Center, a security company with the intention of providing 'specialist intelligence and surveillance services', and building up detailed information about terror groups. The firm's motto is: 'We will go where the rest fear to go'. On Facebook, Mr Read describes how he had been involved in a fierce clash with IS jihadists. He wrote that the 's*** hit the fan', prompting Jordan Matson, 28, a US veteran wounded fighting with the Kurds who is understood to have recruited the Britons, to reply: 'It's always interesting the first time you have a bullet fly past your head.' Graham Penrose, a security consultant who is liaising between the ex-soldiers and their families, said: 'They are not being paid. They are not participating for any commercial gain.' Iraqi forces say they retook two towns north of Baghdad from Islamic State fighters today, driving them from strongholds they had held for months and clearing a main road from the capital to Iran. There was no independent confirmation that the army, Shi'ite militia and Kurdish peshmerga forces had completely retaken Jalawla and Saadiya, about 70 miles north-east of Baghdad. Many residents fled the violence long ago. At least 23 peshmerga and militia fighters were killed and dozens were wounded in the fighting, medical and army sources said. 'We have liberated Jalawla and Saadiya,' said Mala Bakhtiar, a senior official in the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan party, speaking by phone from a nearby town. He estimated 50 Islamic State fighters were killed out of a force of 400. Iraq's Shi'ite-led government, backed by U.S.-led air strikes, has been trying to push back the Islamic State since it swept through mainly Sunni Muslim provinces of northern Iraq in June, meeting virtually no resistance. Last week the army broke a months-long siege of the country's largest refinery north of Baghdad, but Islamic State fighters continue to take territory in the western province of Anbar, which shares borders with Syria, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. The militants have been fighting in the last two days to take full control of the Anbar provincial capital Ramadi. On Sunday, Iraqi and foreign jets struck Islamic State fighters near central Ramadi, provincial council member Mahmoud Ahmed Khalaf told Reuters. Clashes continued in the city, he said. Jalawla and Saadiya are located in Diyala province which is mainly under the control of the Baghdad government forces and Kurdish peshmerga. Recapturing the towns would help secure the Kurdish-controlled towns of Kalar and Khanaqin to the north as well as nearby dams and oil fields, peshmerga Secretary-General Jabbar Yawar said. It would also allow the road to be reopened between Baghdad and Khanaqin, close to the Iranian border. While the hardline Sunni Islamic State forces have not advanced into Baghdad, they hold a ring of towns around the mainly Shi'ite capital and have claimed responsibility for a series of bombings in Shi'ite districts of the city. A car bomb in the Shi'ite town of Yousufiya, 20 miles southeast of Baghdad, killed five people on Sunday, police and medics said. Two other bombs in towns near the capital killed four other people.","Silhan Ozcelik, of Haringey, N London, feared to have travelled to Syria .

"Bodies of 186 victims who died when Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot out of the sky have been located by rescuers, amid fierce accusations that Russia and pro-Russian rebels are trying to sabotage the investigation. Emergency workers employed by the Ukrainian government were allowed to access the eight-square-mile crash site today, and later began to pile up bodies in the fields. But independent investigators dispatched to the scene complained that they were being kept out. At the same time authorities accused the rebels in control of the site of spiriting away dead bodies, looting their possessions and plotting to remove chunks of the downed plane.

Some of them even looked slightly intoxicated,’ a spokesman said. Yesterday another OSCE expert told CNN that it seemed as if nobody was in control of the site. Michael Bociurkiw, said: 'It basically looks like the biggest crime scene in the world right now, guarded by a bunch of guys in uniform with heavy firepower who are quite inhospitable. 'And there didn't seem to be anyone really in control, for example. One of our top priorities was to find out what happened to the black boxes. No one was there to answer those questions.' Ukraine's government today also issued a statement complaining rebels had not handed over the black boxes. Describing the site today, the spokesman said: 'Some of the body bags are open and the damage to the corpses is very, very bad. It is very difficult to look at.'

Senior . politicians in Malaysia today warned the rebels against touching . anything in the site - describing any interference as a 'betrayal' of . the victims. Transport . Minister Mr Liow Tiong Lai said: 'Interfering with the scene of the . crash would undermine the investigation itself.

A . freelance journalist on the scene said that he saw rebels take a pair of . binoculars from his suitcase, then throw them away when they discovered . they were broken. A network of high-tech eavesdropping and early-warning satellites operated by the Pentagon most likely played a key role in determining that the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile over the Ukraine. According to a report by the Los Angeles Times, intelligence officials almost certainly relied on a technical discipline known as measurement and signature intelligence, also known as MASINT, to obtain key bits of information about the missile launch. The sophisticated system of satellites at the Pentagon’s disposal could have pinpointed the location from which the missile was fired and plotted out its trajectory as it shot up into the sky on a collision course with the MH17 Flight. Riki Ellison, founder and chairman of Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, an industry lobby, told the paper that intelligence analysts would have become aware the missile launch because of its heat signature. U.S. Air Force-operated satellites orbiting the Earth are equipped with hyper-sensitive sensors that pick up on heat from missile and booster plumes. In fact, the detectors are so fine-tuned that they even spot forest fires. The system of satellites, run as part of the Defense Support Program, sends back early warnings each time it detects an intercontinental ballistic missile launch. Also, American radars scattered around Europe have the capacity to provide data on the exact launch site, the missile’s destination and its speed. The other vital intelligence tool is a fleet of U.S. listening satellites that collect electronic signals from foreign defense systems. Armed with this data, U.S. analysts would be able to determine the source of the signals and the weapon used. The Russian-made Buk missiles, like the one that downed the jet Thursday with 298 people on board, are equipped with a radar system that gives off unique signals, making it possible to triangulate the launch site and trace its route.

Heavily armed riot police officers stand prepared at the gates to bar Cairo University students protesting against the government from leaving the campus . An Egyptian court yesterday dropped its case against Mubarak over the massacre of hundreds of protesters in the 2011 uprising that ended the 83-year-old's 30-year rule. Two people were killed and nine were wounded last night,when security forces fired tear gas and birdshot to disperse about 2,000 protesters who attempted to enter Tahrir Square - the symbolic heart of the revolution. Security forces also closed a Cairo metro station, the state news agency said, an apparent effort to prevent gatherings downtown. Clashes also erupted at Zagazig University in the Nile Delta, and the state-owned Al-Ahram newspaper said 11 students were detained after setting fire to a building. Crowd begins to disperse as tear gas is fired: Police dispersed crowds gathered in Tahrir Square after a court in Egypt dropped charges against former President Hosni Mubarak over the killing of 239 protesters . A court dismissed the charges nearly four years after the uprising ended the 86-year-old's three-decade rule .

A protester sends up his prayers as he and others stand hemmed in by barbed-wire barriers at Tahrir Square . Many Egyptians who lived through the rule of former airforce officer Mubarak view it as a period of autocracy and crony capitalism. His overthrow led to Egypt's first free election. But the winner, Mohamed Mursi, was ousted last year by Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, another military officer who won a presidential vote in May. Egyptian authorities have since jailed Mursi and thousands of his Muslim Brotherhood supporters, sentencing hundreds to death in mass trials that drew international criticism. By contrast, Mubarak-era figures have been released and new laws curtailing political freedoms have raised fears among activists that the old leadership is back. 'Down with Hosni Mubarak, down with every Mubarak, down with military rule' said one Facebook page that called for protests against the ruling. The ruling was seen by activists as the latest sign that the rights won during the revolt are being eroded. The country is now led by a new army-backed president, former military chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.

Ousted Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak (pictured leaving a military hospital yesterday) will not face murder charges over the deaths of Arab Spring protesters in 2011 .

However, al-Rashidi said Mubarak, like any other human, erred at times and suggested that his old age should have spared him a criminal trial. 'To rule for or against him after he has become old will be left to history and the Judge of Judges, the Righteous and the Justice (God) who will question him about his rule,' said the judge, who threatened to jail anyone attending the 45-minute hearing if they reacted in any way to the ruling before he adjourned the session.

"A Malaysian family on Friday sued the government and beleaguered national carrier for negligence in the mysterious disappearance of flight MH370, in what is believed to be the first lawsuit filed over the disaster. It was filed by lawyers on behalf of the two underage sons of Jee Jing Hang - Jee Kinson, 13, and Jee Kinland, 11 - who was on board the ill-fated Malaysia Airlines flight. Gary Chong, one of the lawyers for Mr Jee's relatives, said the suit was filed in a Malaysian court on Friday. Scroll down for video . Malaysian lawyer Arunan Selvaraj, center, who filed a lawsuit against Malaysian Airlines on behalf of two boys whose father was on ill-fated MH370, speaks to journalists outside a courthouse in Kuala Lumpur . The family is suing Malaysia Airlines for breach of contract, saying the carrier failed in its contractual responsibility to deliver Mr Jee to his destination. The family is also suing Malaysia's government, civil aviation authorities, immigration department and air force for negligence. The boys are seeking damages for mental distress, emotional pain and the loss of support following the disappearance of their father. He operated an Internet business earning monthly income of nearly 17,000 ringgit (£3,200). 'We have waited for eight months. After speaking to various experts, we believe we have sufficient evidence for a strong case. A big plane missing in this age of technology is really unacceptable,' Arunan Selvaraj, another of the boys' lawyers, said. Chong said the family would seek damages but declined to specify a figure. MH370 inexplicably disappeared on March 8 with 239 people aboard on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in what remains one of history's greatest aviation mysteries. Malaysia's government believes the flight diverted to the far southern Indian Ocean, citing sketchy satellite data, but no trace has been found despite an extensive search. Neither the government nor airline has revealed any results from investigations into the tragedy, and officials have consistently stressed that only the recovery of the lost Boeing 777 aircraft will provide full answers. MH370 (pictured over Poland in February) inexplicably disappeared on March 8 with 239 people aboard while on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, in what remains one of history's greatst aviation mysteries . Some next-of-kin of missing passengers bitterly accuse the government and airline of a bungled response and cover-up, charges that are strenuously denied. Malaysia's air force came under particular fire after top officer acknowledged military radar had tracked the red-eye flight as it doubled back over Malaysian airspace after diverting. The air force took no action, saying the radar blip was not considered a security threat. The chances of success for the lawsuit were not immediately clear. Aviation experts told AFP that under international law it is an airline's responsibility to prove it was not to blame for an accident. The lack of evidence could complicate that task for the carrier. Neither the government nor airline has revealed any results from investigations into the tragedy, and they consistently stress that only recovery of the lost Boeing 777 will provide full answers. Pictured is a crew member on an Australian search plane . Steve Wang, a Chinese man whose mother was on the plane, said many Chinese families had retained lawyers but he didn't think any of them had filed a lawsuit yet. 'We are examining the laws to figure out how to best bring our cases - for example, if we should file the suits in Malaysia. But without knowing where the plane is, evidence is lacking, and there are still possibilities that things may change,' Wang said. 'For now, it looks very difficult for us to bring a suit against the Malaysian government and its military.' The airline also has been hammered by the loss in July of flight MH17 - apparently shot down - over Ukraine with the loss of 298 lives, and is in dire financial straits as business has dried up. A state-linked investment fund has directly taken over the airline as part of a rescue plan. In countries such as China - home to the majority of MH370 passengers - and Malaysia, courts are considered relatively conservative regarding the awarding of damages.

"Police and protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, clashed once again Wednesday night as tensions boiled over during a planned demonstration against the shooting of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson in August. Between 100 and 150 protesters marched to the police station from just blocks away from Brown was shot. They chanted, demanding justice for Brown and calling for the arrest of Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson. When the group finally arrived at the police station, the march then turned ugly and into a stand off against Ferguson police, who brought out riot gear and protective shields as they erected a barricade on the opposite side of the street. The spark for the rise in tensions came after Michael Brown's official autopsy was leaked and shows how the 18-year-old was shot in the hand at close range during a struggle with the Ferguson police officer who fatally shot him. Demonstrators march toward the police station as protests continue in the wake of 18-year-old Michael Brown's death  in Ferguson, Missouri . Police police move in to arrest a demonstrator outside the police station as protests continue . Accounts: Details emerged earlier this wee Darren Wilson (left), the police officer who killed Michael Brown (right), describes a violent encounter in which Wilson was allegedly hit in the face several times before firing a gun which Brown was trying to wrest away from him . The St. Louis Post-Dispatch obtained the St. Louis County medical examiner's autopsy and an accompanying toxicology report that shows Brown had used marijuana. The newspaper reported that St. Louis medical examiner Dr. Michael Graham and another pathologist not involved in the investigation reviewed the report and said it indicates a wound to Brown's hand came at close range. Activists said the leak of the report to the newspaper simply added to tensions in the community, which has been the site of numerous protests, including last nights where there have been regular clashes between demonstrators and police, in the 10 weeks since the shooting. Yesterdays protest was scheduled to coincide with a day of action planned to take place nationwide to draw attention to police brutality . It was on August 9th when the shooting happened. It was shortly after noon when Brown was walking down the middle of a neighborhood street with a friend and Officer Wilson, who was driving by, ordered them out of the street. Accounts then differ but witnesses and law enforcement officials have agreed that Wilson and Brown became embroiled in an altercation through the window of the Wilson's vehicle and Wilson exited his vehicle and shot Brown several times. Brown was shot once in the hand and was eventually killed outside the vehicle. Graham told the Post-Dispatch that the autopsy report 'does support that there was a significant altercation at the car.' Aftermath: Pictured above in a grainy cellphone photograph grab, Wilson stands over Brown after the fatal - and hotly-disputed incident . Michael Brown's official autopsy shows the 18-year-old was shot in the hand at close range during a struggle with the Ferguson police officer who fatally shot him, two experts said in a published report . The leaked report indicated  a wound to Brown's hand came at close range . Brown family attorney Benjamin Crump said that the autopsy offers no insight into why Wilson killed Brown . Brown family attorney Benjamin Crump told the Associated Press that the autopsy offers no insight into why Wilson killed Brown. The newspaper posted a copy of the autopsy and toxicology report on its website. Medical examiner's office administrator Suzanne McCune confirmed the posted information was accurate but said her office won't officially release the documents until the investigation is complete. The newspaper did not say where it obtained the documents. Wilson remains on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation into the shooting that has sparked sometimes violent protests in Ferguson. On Tuesday, Gov. Jay Nixon appointed a special commission to look at how the region can move forward after the concerns raised by the shooting and its aftermath. Wilson confronted Brown and Dorian Johnson as they walked back to Brown's home from a convenience store. After the shooting, Brown died at the scene. Between 100 and 150 protesters marched from the corner of Canfield Drive and Florissant Avenue, a few blocks from where Brown was shot . The protestors demanded justice for Michael Brown and called for the arrest of Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson . Some witnesses have told authorities and news media that Brown had his hands raised when Wilson approached with his weapon and fired repeatedly. The leaked report comes days after the New York Times, citing federal government officials briefed on a civil rights investigation, reported that Wilson told investigators he feared for his life and battled with Brown in his vehicle over his gun. A grand jury is considering charges against Wilson, who has not spoken publicly about the shooting. Protesters have said they expect widespread unrest if he is not charged and local and state authorities have said they are preparing for that possibility. ""There is a lack of trust. That is why people are protesting every single night,"" said Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change, a civil rights organization. ""They have a fundamental belief that the system is stacked against them. These continual leaks raise a lot of suspicion."" Ferguson, Missouri, police and protesters clashed on Wednesday night after tensions escalated during a scheduled demonstration, part of the Ferguson October movement . Michael Brown's gunshot wounds included a shot in the hand at close range, his official autopsy shows, according to an analysis reported by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper . At least two people were detained after demonstrators threw water bottles at the police barricade . Wilson told investigators that during a struggle for his pistol inside a police SUV, Brown pressed the barrel of Wilson's gun against the officer's hip . The officer tried to prevent Brown from reaching the trigger, the source told the newspaper, and when he thought he had control, he fired . Once the group arrived at the Police Department the march turned into a standoff against Ferguson police, who had erected a barricade on the opposite side of the street . Ed Magee, a spokesman for the St. Louis County prosecutor's office, said a decision is expected sometime in mid-November. Brown's death has sparked protests across Ferguson, a primarily black community with a mostly white police force and city government, and has drawn global attention to race relations in the United States. The St. Louis County medical examiner's autopsy indicates that Brown's hand was close to Wilson's weapon, according to forensic experts interviewed by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. The autopsy said a microscopic examination of Brown's hand tissue showed particles ""consistent with products that are discharged from the barrel of a firearm."" The medical examiner also found that Brown tested positive for marijuana. A representative for the county medical examiner verified the authenticity of the autopsy report the newspaper posted and said the office did not provide the report to the Post-Dispatch. Wilson said he fired two shots, and Brown was hit in the hand and ran. Wilson told investigators he fired again when Brown turned back and charged at him . Immediate response: In this image investigators crowd round Brown's body immediately after the shooting . Wilson said he had no choice but to draw his pistol when faced with the 'incredibly strong' teen. Brown was 6-foot-4 and nearly 300lb at the time of his death. Wilson said he couldn't use his pepper spray in the close quarters because it would have hit him too. His baton was out of reach at the back of his belt. In the statement Wilson told how Brown grabbed at the pistol and continued to hit him in the face. The officer, who said he almost passed out in the attack, then told how he felt Brown, whose strength he found remarkable, twisting the barrel towards his own body. At one point, the muzzle of the gun was pointed at Wilson's own hip. Wilson went on to describe how he jerked back inside the car, loosening Brown's grip on the gun enough for him to squeeze the trigger. Vigils: Demonstrators - pictured on October 20 - have continually held vigils for Brown since the shooting in August. They are pictured above on Canfield Street, where he died . But, he said, the first time nothing happened - because Brown had his finger in the gun's hammer, which stopped it from firing. Separate accounts of the events which have been made public have also claimed there was a scuffle of some sort inside the police car - citing blood and skin samples picked up in investigations. When Wilson pulled the trigger again, the pistol went off, hitting Brown's hand and sending glass cascading around the car. Evidence presented by the Post-Dispatch from the autopsy report also seems to support a close-range impact. The document told how the entry wound in Brown's hand had no 'stippling' - a feature of mid-range impacts - suggesting a point-blank release. In his account, Wilson then described firing a second shot - which missed. Brown then ran away. Response: Police have donned riot gear to meet the protesters in ugly confrontations . Wilson said he was left unable to radio for backup because his transponder had been knocked away from the right setting in the chaos. So, on his own, Wilson said he got out of the car and gave chase. It was at that point when Brown turned. Wilson said Brown then 'charged' at him and wouldn't stop when he yelled. He started firing, and hit four times. One shot, Wilson said, hit Brown's forehead and brought him down. He also denied - as many witnesses have claimed - that Brown had his hands up in a gesture of surrender. Wilson's extensive account is at odds with several others which have emerged in the wake of the killing, which has sparked widespread and ongoing protests in the Missouri town. Others have said Brown was fleeing, or had unambiguously surrendered. It has also been suggested that Wilson himself was more aggressive toward Brown than suggested in the latest account.","Scheduled demonstration turns tense as protesters and police clash .

"Federal Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has confronted a crowd of conservative Christians, saying he is a Christian and a supporter of same-sex marriage. 'I am a Christian and a supporter of marriage equality under the law,' Mr Shorten told the Australian Christian Lobby national conference in Canberra on Saturday. The move drew a mixed reaction with some gay marriage advocates saying he shouldn't have given the ACL credibility by addressing them. Labor leader Bill Shorten has fronted a crowd of conservative Christians and called on them not to use religion as an instrument of exclusion . The opposition leader began his speech as if was a sermon - by quoting from the scriptures. He went on to say when the scriptures are used to attack blended families like his own, demonise people based on who they love or claim marriage equality is a step towards bestiality, 'I cannot stay silent'. 'No faith, no religion, no set of beliefs should ever be used as an instrument of division or exclusion,' Mr Shorten said. 'Freedom of worship does not mean freedom to vilify. 'These prejudices do not reflect the Christian values I believe in.' 'I am a Christian and a supporter of marriage equality under the law,' Mr Shorten told the Australian Christian Lobby national conference in Canberra on Saturday . Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said the issue wasn't even on the table for the government . These attitudes sent a message that Christianity was incompatible with modern life, he said. He added that the current laws in Australia are discriminatory, and it was time they were changed. Mr Shorten was applauded on the conclusion of his speech and ACL managing director Lyle Shelton thanked him for his 'fearless and frank' speech. Liberal senator Cory Bernardi, who made comments linking bestiality and gay marriage, said no one would take Mr Shorten's comments seriously. 'Pretty sure no-one takes lectures on morality and marriage by Bill Shorten seriously,' he tweeted on Saturday. Liberal senator Cory Bernardi said no one would take Mr Shorten's comments seriously . Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said the issue wasn't even on the table for the government which has the more pressing matters of national security and the economy. But his colleague, Josh Frydenberg, who supports the idea of a conscience vote in the Liberal party, admitted there had been a shift in attitudes. Australian Marriage Equality acting director Ivan Hinton-Teoh congratulated Mr Shorten on his 'powerfully-worded address' and said the speech marked a powerful moment in history. But Equal Marriage Rights Australia said Mr Shorten's attendance was hypocritical after Labor's motion against Liberal politicians attending the 'extremely anti-gay' World Families Congress in August. '(His attendance) is completely outrageous and extremely hypocritical,' spokesman Ben Cooper said in a statement.","Labor leader Bill Shorten fronted a crowd of conservative Christians and called on them not to use religion as an instrument of exclusion .

"Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop has squared up to Russian President Vladimir Putin about the MH17 investigations on the sidelines of a summit in Milan. Ms Bishop met with Mr Putin on Friday at the ASEM summit in Milan, where she said the Netherlands-based scientists identifying the victims of the crash require further visits to the site before winter.

Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop speaking with Russian president Vladmir Putin on Friday at the ASEM summit in Milan . Ms Bishop met with Putin on Friday at the ASEM summit in Milan, where she said the Netherlands based scientists identifying the victims of the crash require another visit to the site before winter . The unofficial meeting comes just days after Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he would 'shirt-front' his Russian counterpart at the forthcoming G20 summit in Brisbane. The MH17 site is still too dangerous to access, with reports that a small team of observers were met with gunfire there earlier this week. In July, Malaysian Airlines flight 17 was shot down by a missile in rebel-controlled eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board, including 38 Australian citizens and residents. The investigations have been hampered by limited access to the site, which is controlled by Moscow-backed Ukrainian rebels. Ms Bishop had formerly tried to raise the issue with Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at the summit, but was met with disregard when he said it was 'a matter for Ukraine'. 'It is very frustrating but it has been very frustrating throughout... on the ground in eastern Ukraine the rebels from time to time have prevented access to the site, so what Russia says in the international arena is not always carried through on the ground,' Ms Bishop told Sydney Morning Herald. She said the investigations must be executed before the heavy snow typical of Ukrainian winter bury the site and hamper the situation further.

"Tragic: Quinn Lucas Schansman, a dual U.S.-Dutch citizen, is the only American confirmed killed aboard Flight MH17 . A 19-year-old American citizen who has been confirmed killed aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was remembered by his grieving relatives and friends today as a kind young man with a great sense of humor. Quinn Lucas Schansman, 19, a dual U.S. and Dutch citizen, was on his way to meet family members who were vacationing in Malaysia when his plane was hit by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile. Quinn was born in Fort Lee, New Jersey, but spent most of his short life in the Netherlands. He also had family in Georgia. His father, Thomas, worked in San Mateo, . California, and New York City as an account executive for the Netherlands Foreign . Investment Agency, a Dutch government bureau that helps foreign . companies get established in Holland. On Friday, . Quinn's grandfather Ronald, who was visiting his sister's home in . Woodbury, New Jersey, this week, made a statement about the tragedy . that claimed his grandson’s life. ‘You go through all the phases of mourning,’ Ronald Schansman told NBC Philadelphia. ‘At the moment, it's just mourning. And of course anger. ‘It didn’t need to happen. [It was] A senseless thing to do.’ Scroll down for videos . Quinn's Facebook page shows he was dating Floor van Dranen, who posted loving pictures of her with her boyfriend on Thursday after learning he had been killed . Quinn's family is from Hilversum in the north of the country. It was not immediately clear where his family was from in the United States . Rage: Quinn's grandfather Ronald Schansman, speaking from his sister's house in New Jersey, said their family demand justice for the 19-year-old and the rest of the passengers and crew of the doomed flight . According . to Mr Schansman, Quinn was on his way to join his father, stepmother . and siblings in Indonesia. From there the family were supposed to travel . to Bali for a week-long vacation before returning home to Amsterdam. Now, Thomas Schansman is heading back to Holland, where he will await the return of his 19-year-old's son's remains. 'We want to know why,' Ronald Schansman said. 'Who shot?' Quinn . Schansman's friend from high school described the 19-year-old as caring . and sensitive - the kind of boy who was willing to stick up for his friends and diffuse a tense situation with humor. ‘If . there was a fight in class he could cool everyone down again, made a . joke and it was like it never happened,’ Fabienne Schriek told NBC. The U.S. State Department is still . checking to see whether there are more American victims among the 298 . passengers and crew members on the flight from Amsterdam to Kuala . Lumpur, Malaysia. 'At . this point, the individual that I mentioned is the sole person that we . can definitively say is a U.S. or dual citizen,' the President said in a . White House press conference today. 'At this point, having worked through the list, this is our best assessment of the number of Americans that were killed.' He cautioned that more American victims could be identified. 'So cute!' According to Quinn's Facebook page he and Floor had been dating since last September. He commented on this picture #she #is #so #cute .

President Barack Obama has confirmed that 'at least' one American was killed aboard Flight MH17. The State Department is reviewing whether there were more U.S. citizens involved . Internal White House emails obtained by BuzzFeed appear to show that the White House knew shortly after the crash Thursday that there were not 23 Americans aboard the plane, as had been widely reported on Thursday. President Barack Obama made very brief remarks about the crash on Thursday afternoon before a pre-planned speech in Delaware. 'Obviously . the world is watching reports of a downed passenger jet near the . Russia-Ukraine border. And it looks like it may be a terrible tragedy. Right now we’re working to determine whether there were American . citizens on board. That is our first priority,' he said.

We’ve got actually some better-looking Bidens with us here today.  We've got Beau and his wife, Hallie, are here. Give them a big round of applause. We love them.'

"Former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson ensured he didn't miss Louis van Gaal's first FA Cup game after taking a helicopter to Somerset to see the Red Devils in action. United beat League One side Yeovil Town 2-0 on Sunday afternoon and Ferguson, who retired in May 2013, flew in to watch the game from the stands at Huish Park. Having been humiliated 4-0 by MK Dons in the Capital One Cup second round in August and with no European football this term, the game against Gary Johnson's struggling side was only Van Gaal's second outside of the Premier League fixture list.

"Russian experts have claimed Malaysian Boeing MH17 was shot down by a Ukrainian warplane and not a ground to air missile. This follows the release of 'leaked' satellite images which show a missile streaking towards the passenger plane, produced tonight  by Russia's main state broadcaster. It was claimed that the space pictures were from a British or US satellite. Scroll down for video . Russian Channel 1 has released satellite images which suggest Malaysian Boeing MH17 (top of picture) was shot down by a Ukrainian warplane (bottom left) The flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was travelling over the conflict-hit region when it disappeared from radar. A total of 283 passengers, including 80 children, and 15 crew members were killed. TV presenter Mikhail Leontiev claimed that the mysterious source who provided the images concluded they showed 'how a Mig-29 fighter plane destroys the Boeing passenger plane'. The West has repeatedly suggested the plane was shot down by pro-Moscow rebels using a Russian-made BUK missile system. It was claimed that the mysterious source who provided the images concluded they showed 'how a Mig-29 fighter plane (pictured) destroys the Boeing passenger plane' A total of 283 passengers, including 80 children, and 15 crew members were killed after MH17 was shot down . Russia has argued an unidentified plane was in vicinity at the time of the crash, and that Ukraine and the West have hushed up this fact. The Kremlin-owned channel's presenter said: 'Today we have all grounds to suppose that a State crime was committed by those who deliberately destroyed the plane. And by those who are cynically hiding it, having the full information.' The extraordinary broadcast came ahead of Western leaders including David Cameron confronting Vladimir Putin over the crash at a summit in Australia. Channel One claimed: 'We have at our disposal a sensational shot, supposedly made by foreign satellite spy during the final seconds of MH17 above Ukraine.' Ivan Adrievskiy, vice president of Russian Engineers Union, suggested the image was taken by an American or British satellite . An 'expert' called George Bilt was cited as saying the Boeing was shot out of the sky in 'a classic fighter jet attack from the rear' The reported disputed a BUK missile as the cause of the tragedy. 'To cut it short, it looks like there was no BUK and no launch from the ground. There were dozens professional and thousands of amateur witnesses, and no-one registered it,' claimed Leontiev. Ivan Adrievskiy, vice president of Russian Engineers Union, said: 'We see a photograph taken from space from a low orbit. Usually such images are taken for the sake of general reconnaissance of the air and the ground. 'The coordinates of the photograph mean we can suppose that the image was taken by an American or British satellite. 'We have studied this picture in detail and did not find any sign proving it to be fake.'

Vladimir Putin  accused the Ukrainians of 'constantly shelling' the MH17 crash site earlier this week amid steeply rising concern in the West that he has ordered massive military reinforcements to bolster pro-Moscow rebel forces. At least 21 trucks, six tanks and 14 howitzer cannons were seen driving through rebel-territory to Donetsk, while residents reported a convoy of 12 unmarked military trucks. Ukraine alleges that recent days have seen a huge increase in military hardware, professional soldiers and AK-74 assault rifles fitted with laser pointers moving towards Donetsk from Russia.","'Leaked' images show a missile streaking towards the MH17 flight .

Nasri told BeIn Sports: 'We met with Sir Alex in Paris, in a hidden place, out of sight, so as not to fuel the rumours. 'But there was one thing that was a problem; I was asked to go to war with Arsenal to be able to join. I could not see myself doing it, especially with Arsene Wenger.

"The public relations expert hired to help restore public opinion in the city of Ferguson has been fired as it emerged he shot a man dead eight years ago. Devin James was brought in to rebuild the community after a white police officer shot unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. But today his employers were forced to apologize for the appointment as they discovered James was convicted of reckless homicide in Tennessee in 2006. James has founded his company on his personal story of overcoming a background filled with gangs and drugs - and says the shooting in Shelby County, Tennessee, was in self defense. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Fired: Devin James has been fired a month after he was hired as it emerges he shot a man dead in 2006 . It comes the day after violent protests broke out in the city with people calling for the police chief to resign. James was subcontracted two weeks after the killing on August 9 as authorities were condemned for failing to employ senior figures of ethic minorities. The case has sparked a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into the Ferguson Police Department for possible civil rights violations in the majority-black district. Today, Ferguson Mayor James Knowles told the Post Dispatch that Ferguson officials knew about the conviction before they signed a contract with him. However, a spokesman for St. Louis Economic Development Partnership today revealed James failed to declare his conviction when he took up the $155-an-hour job, the St Louis Post Dispatch reported. He was brought in to Ferguson to restore public opinion after the shooting of Michael Brown on August 9 . Conflict: Last night protesters called on police chief Thomas Jackson to resign as he stepped out to apologize . Anger: Signs that read 'Chief Jackass resign' were bound to the gates of the station as violence broke out . James - whose firm The Devin James Company has offices in California, Illinois, Missouri, Oregon and Washington state - was behind the apology video recorded by Police Chief Thomas Jackson to Michael Brown's family and supporters on Thursday. The video to Brown's family and the community acknowledged that Brown's body - which was left for more than four hours - should have been removed from the street much sooner after he was killed. Acknowledging the decision to terminate his contract, James told CNN: 'I started my company shortly afterwards and pretty much have been doing everything I could to get my life on the right track and to get going in a different direction. 'I've always been forthright with my clients about that.' Devastation: The shooting of unarmed black teenager has uncovered deep divisions between races in the majority-black community. Supporters continue to lay tributes more than a month after the killing . Protesters perform a 'hands up, don't shoot' chant. Michael Brown allegedly held his hands up as he was shot . A statement from St. Louis Economic Development Partnership read: 'We have asked Elasticity, our contracted communications firm, to release Devin James from his subcontractor role, due to a lack of transparency. 'While we admire his personal growth from difficult circumstances and commend him for his high quality work in Ferguson, it was the lack of information about his background that prompted us to make this move. 'Mr. James failed to inform us of his prior conviction. 'He also did not reveal this information to Elasticity when he was hired as a subcontractor. 'As of today, we are developing new vendor due diligence policies which we believe will prevent similar incidents in the future.'","Devin James was brought in to Ferguson to rebuild relations after white officer Darren Wilson shot dead unarmed black teenager Michael Brown .

"CLICK HERE to read Sam Peters' full match report from Twickenham . England’s players showed solidarity with their cash-strapped opponents at the final whistle as they gathered for a silent prayer on the Twickenham turf. Captain Chris Robshaw and his team-mates formed a circle with Samoa — who had threatened to boycott the game in a row over pay and governance with their union. ‘That is the brilliant thing about the rugby community,’ said Robshaw. ‘You support each other. They could have pulled out, so we’re extremely grateful they honoured the game.’ England and Samoa players united after the game to show their solidarity at Twickenham . Chris Robshaw led players in a show of appreciation to Samoa for allowing the game to go ahead . The Samoa team had threatened to strike ahead of the game after problems with their governing body . 'We want to thank all the Samoan guys for the way they played, we know they've got a lot of issues at the moment and all the England guys are really appreciative of the spirit and the way the game was played today,' he told Sky Sports 2. 'I think it was a great spectacle, even if it was a bit loose at times, but all the English team are very grateful.' Another thing the English players will be grateful for is the win after a torrid run of five defeats on the bounce was finally brought to an end. Bath's George Ford (centre) impressed on his full international debut at fly-half . Jonny May uses his blistering pace to open the scoring for England in the first half . All of those defeats, of course, came against the two top ranked teams in the world in New Zealand and South Africa, but Robshaw admitted it was great to just get back to winning ways. 'It was great to get a win. It's a results business and we know there was a few errors out there and we were a little bit loose with the ball, but it was great to play a game here at night and the crowd were absolutely fantastic,' he added. Despite looking disjointed at times England still managed to run in three tries, with Jonny May dotting down twice and Mike Brown crossing over after a delightful offload from Anthony Watson. Mike Brown (centre) crosses over to get England back to winning ways after a dismal recent run . May crosses the line to score his second try in England's 28-9 defeat of Samoa . One of the biggest positives was the performance of new fly-half George Ford, who played a key role in May's first try with a loop around Owen Farrell and then set up Brown's touch down with a well-worked cross-field kick to Bath team-mate Watson. Speaking in front of the Sky cameras after his first senior start for England, the 21-year-old, who also kicked over 13 points, said: 'I think we got there in the end. The start was very scrappy. Obviously, Samoa are a very physical team and they came flying at us. 'We probably didn't adapt to that quickly enough I suppose and with the rain coming down we should have gone for field position. But we addressed that at half-time, came out and started the second half well.'","England defeated Samoa 28-9 in Autumn International Test at Twickenham .

"Dutch investigators have found more human remains at the MH17 crash site in Ukraine almost four months after the airliner was shot down over the war-torn country. An official from separatist authorities in the self declared Donetsk People's Republic, made the announcement today but added it was too early to say if they were of passengers on the doomed flight or of combatants who died in fighting that has taken place in the same area. The Malaysia Airlines flight from Amsterdam en-route to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down over Ukraine on July 17. Scroll down for video . Separatist authorities have said that Dutch investigators have recovered more human remains from the MH17 crash site in Grabove . MH17 was brought down on July 17 with 298 passengers on board, near the village of Grabove . Dutch investigation teams have taken the lead in the operation. Australia committed more than 600 personnel at the height of the mission to search and recover . Accident investigators looking into the July crash are assessing the viability of hiring local contractors to collect wreckage still beyond their reach because of the continuing pro-Russian insurrection . Kiev has blamed pro-Russian separatists for the airliner's destruction while Russia claims a Ukrainian military aircraft brought it down. The Netherlands is leading a probe into the downing of the Malaysia Airlines jet on July 17, in which all 298 on board, including 193 Dutch nationals, were killed. At the crash site in Grabove today, barriers could be seen with the message: 'Forbidden area - there could be remains of victims of the MH17 crash here'. Ella Karakut, a transport official in the separatist government said: 'Human remains have been found by experts from The Netherlands. They will be examined. 'Meanwhile, the work on removing debris from the plane has been suspended.' The shooting down of flight MH17 as it flew over the conflict zone has stirred angry accusations between Moscow and the West over just who was responsible . Barriers marked ""forbidden area - there could be remains of victims of the MH17 crash here"" could be seen at the site in Grabove on Friday, AFP journalists said. The announcement comes after Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said earlier today that there was no chance that all the remains of the victims of MH17 will ever be recovered. The sobering assessment was made as he met with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and met with some of the 600 Australian personnel involved in the search and recovery mission. The Dutch government has refused to deal directly with the rebels who control the site, whom it regards as illegitimate . Mr Rutte visited the headquarters of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Canberra earlier today. In saluting the 'professionalism' of Australian workers he also praised the country's defence chiefs for their swift action, adding that while they had never met before 'it felt like they had worked together for years'. But there was a reminder that despite all the hard work, there is likely to be heartache for some families. ‘We are still not yet there, we are still trying to get all the remaining remains back,' Mr Rutte said. 'We want to unite, if possible, everybody with their loved ones but we are not absolutely sure that we will be able to do that but we will do everything in our power.' A Dutch safety board report into the MH17 disaster found, in September, that a 'large number of high-energy objects' penetrated its fuselage. Dutch PM Mark Rutte said 'we want to unite, if possible, everybody with their loved ones but we are not absolutely sure that we will be able to do that but we will do everything in our power' The Dutch PM thanked the Australian personnel called into action following the downing of MH17, with 38 Australians on board, 196 Dutch nationals and 43 Malaysian citizens were among the 298 passengers . The Dutch Prime Minister thanked the Australian personnel called into action following the downing of MH17, with 38 Australians on board, 196 Dutch nationals and 43 Malaysian citizens were among the 298 passengers and crew. It's believed up to 20 victims remain unidentified, at least two of them thought to have ties to Australia. Mr Rutte again stressed the importance of a thorough, independent investigation into the attack before any decision on those responsible should face trial. Prime Ministers Mark Rutte (Netherlands) and Tony Abbott (Australia) have worked closely together ever since the July 17 disaster which saw 298 passengers and crew on MH17 killed when it was shot down. On Friday they planted a ceremonial silver birch tree at the National Arboretum in Canberra . The Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott plant a silver birch tree at the National Arboretum  in Canberra. Mr Rutte has been in Australia to discuss the MH17 flight crash that killed 298 passengers and crew on route to Amsterdam from Kuala Lumpur in July . His Australian counterpart agreed that 'it was a very intense time and it’s not yet finished because we have yet to see the perpetrators of this crime brought to justice'. 'We are now in the resolution stages rather than the active response stages,' Mr Abbott added. 'At its heights almost 600 Australian personnel were deployed overseas to the Netherlands and the Ukraine. Prime Minister Tony Abbott thanks his Dutch counterpart. Mr Abbott is understood to now be seeking a one-on-one meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin when both leaders attend the annual APEC leaders summit in China next week . 'It was a textbook case of how Australia can respond at every level. It was our country at its best, even in the worst of times.' The two leaders then planted a tree at the National Arboretum in Canberra. The Dutch government has refused to deal directly with the rebels who control the site, whom it regards as illegitimate. It has said investigators are endangered. Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders was expected to discuss the issue with his Ukrainian counterpart Pavlo Klimkin in Kiev on Saturday.","Official from separatist authority says more remains found at crash site .

"Google chairman Eric Schmidt has warned that National Security Agency spying is going to 'break the Internet' and cause countries to start their own networks to avoid foreign surveillance. The Silicon Valley titan spoke out at a conference organized by NSA opponent Senator Ron Wyden. He was just one of the big voices sounding an alarm about American surveillance practices. Representatives from Google, Microsoft, Facebook and other major tech firms say their industry stands to lose a fortune as international customers flee American technology companies over concerns that their data is being siphoned off carte blanche and analyzed by American intelligence officials. 'The simplest outcome is that we're going to end up breaking the Internet,' Schmidt said in the gymnasium of a Palo Alto, California, high school. Scroll down for video . US Senator Ron Wyden (left) and Google chairman Eric Schmidt (right) spoke out against the NSA's mass collection of data at a panel discussion . 'Because what's going to happen is, governments will do bad laws of one kind or another, and they are eventually going to say, ""We want our own Internet in our country because we want it to work our way, right? And we don't want these NSA and other people in it."" 'The cost of that is huge, in terms of knowledge, discovery, science, growth, jobs, ect.' He also said that spying is already hurting global connectivity and trust in the Internet. 'The impact is severe and getting worse,' he warned. The result could see American companies cut out technology growth - no longer able to provide apps, server space, hardware or other services, to the rest of the world because of NSA spying, Schmidt said. Sen Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, has been an outspoken critic of the NSA's spying practices and has stepped up his criticism ever since former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked a drove of top-secret documents. The internal memos revealed that intelligence services have been tapping directly into the data streams of US tech companies to mine personal information  in the name of national security. The publication of those practices have caused many foreign customers to flee American tech services like Google and Facebook. 'Just as people won't put their money in a bank they won't trust, people won't use an Internet they won't trust,' Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith said. The panelists pointed out that Germany recently ended a contract with US phone carrier Verizon because of the company's participation in the NSA surveillance program.","Eric Schmidt spoke at a panel discussion sponsored by Oregon Senator Ron Wyden, an NSA critic .

"These amazing pictures show the life-or-death struggle faced by Kurdish fighters as they battle through rubble-strewn streets against ISIS extremists in the battle for Syrian border town of Kobane. Images from the front-line show the trail of destruction left in the town, where weeks of fighting have taken place as Islamic State militants make their advances. US-led air strikes have hit jihadist positions in the north and east of Syria today, including an oil field, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Armed Kurdish fighters are seen holding guns as they cower in one of the many destroyed buildings in the town of Kobane in Syria .

The destruction left after weeks of fighting in the town, which has seen most of its 55,000 residents flee and attempt to seek refuge . A Kurdish fighter takes a moments rest whilst lying among debris yesterday. According to the group the movement of ISIS has slowed . Us-led airstrikes were launched on jihadist positions in the north and east of Syria today after militant shelling killed two civilians . The raids against ISIS came after militants shelled a camp for those displaced from Kobane - known as Ain al-Arab in Arabic - and killed two people, said the monitoring group. A spokesperson for the Observatory said: 'Four explosions were heard during the night in Deir Ezzor province [in eastern Syria], caused by US-Arab air strikes in the area of the Tanak oil field and an IS checkpoint... killing two people.' The Britain-based monitoring group, which relies on a network of sources on the ground for its reports, said it was unclear whether the casualties were jihadists or civilians. It has reported that four other people were injured, including a child, at the camp for people forced from Kobane by violence. These up-close and personal images show what life is really like in Kobane for Kurdish fighters, who are backed by Iraqi peshmerga . Kobane, which lies on the border with Turkey, has been besieged by IS for nearly two months as fighters stand guard for battle . In September ISIS launched a full scale assault on Kobane from the west and south of the town, destroying homes and buildings . An exploded mortar shell is seen lying in the streets in front of what might have once been a shop, which has seen been destroyed . The US-led coalition, which launched strikes against jihadist positions in Syria in September, also hit IS militants - which controls most oil fields in Deir Ezzor province - in Kobane. The town on the border with Turkey has been besieged by IS for nearly two months and these latest photographs show Syrian Kurdish fighters armed and ready for battle as their town lies in ruins. Men are seeing carrying guns in the streets, while other armed fighters hide in one of the many destroyed buildings. The Kurdish forces, backed by rebels and Iraqi peshmerga fighters, have been battling to expel IS from the town, where most of the 55,000 residents have fled. A Kurdish fighter is seen running through the streets of Kobane where violent fighting has broken out as ISIS tries to capture the town . The town has been left virtually empty as almost 90 per cent of its population has fled to seek refuge - mostly in neighbouring Turkey . Iraqi Kurdish regional government delivered two truckloads of ammunition that secretly crossed into the town via Turkey on Wednesday . Separately, the Syrian Observatory said fighting on Thursday night near Lebanon killed 31 combatants loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad and 14 rebels, including Al-Qaeda militants. There has been frequent violence in Syria's Mount Hermon, but the toll over recent days has been unprecedented. In recent weeks, Lebanon has all but closed the border officially to incoming Syrian refugees, with troops bolstering border security. More than 1.1 million Syrian refugees are living in Lebanon, straining the country's limited resources and infrastructure. Thick plumes of grey smoke rise from an ISIS position in eastern Kobane, after an airstrike by the U.S-led coalition . The pillars of smoke, which swept across the skyline, could be seen from a hilltop outside Suruc on the Turkey-Syria border earlier today . Last week ISIS released images of their fighters engaging in street fighting in Kobane as part of their latest publicity stunt. The pictures, distributed by the media office in the ISIS 'capital' of Raqqa in Syria, show jihadis firing rocket-propelled grenades and assault rifles in the ruined streets of the town. Meanwhile, an international rights group claimed Islamic State militants tortured and abused Kurdish children captured earlier this year near the town. Human Rights Watch based its conclusions on interviews with several children who were among more than 150 Kurdish boys from Kobane abducted in late May as they were returning home after taking school exams in the city of Aleppo. It said around 50 of the Kurds escaped early in their captivity, while the rest were released in batches - the last on October 29.

"Recovery work has begun at the wreckage site of Malaysian Airways flight MH17 - four months after it was downed over Ukraine. The Dutch Safety Board (DSB), which is leading the investigation into the tragedy - which cost the lives of 298 people including 10 Britons - has up to now had limited access to the crash site. But the board announced a few days ago that it hoped to start the recovery soon and today announced work had begun. The investigation team said the wreckage would be collected over several days before being transported to the Ukrainian government-controlled city of Kharkiv and then flown to the Netherlands. The plane was on its way from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when the crash happened on July 17 this year in an area where pro-Russian separatists operated. Scroll down for video .

Dutch investigators and an Emergencies Ministry member work at the site where nine people who were on the flight have still not been found . Local workers transport helped to transport wreckage of the Malaysia Airlines crash site which is in the middle of a conflict zone . A preliminary report by the DSB in September said the wreckage was 'consistent with the damage that would be expected from a large number of high-energy objects that penetrated the aircraft from outside'. Today, the DSB said: 'Today the recovery of wreckage from flight MH17 has started. Dutch inspectors had hoped to collect the parts themselves, but they remain concerned about the safety of their staff in the rebel-held conflict zone, and so have decided to work with local services after an initial focus on finding human remains and belongings. 'The DSB commissioned the recovery and transportation to the Netherlands of the wreckage as part of the investigation into the cause of the crash of flight MH17. 'As part of the investigation the DSB intends to reconstruct a section of the aircraft.' The board went on: 'It is expected that the recovery operation will take several days, depending on the safety conditions and other factors. This will be assessed daily. 'The recovered wreckage will be collected at a location near the crash site, from where the wreckage will be transported to Kharkov (in Ukraine) and finally to the Netherlands. 'At this point the DSB cannot give detailed information about the means of transportation and the time schedule.' Despite the difficulty in accessing the site due to fighting in the area, the black box flight recorders were recovered early on and were passed to the DSB after being inspected at the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) headquarters at Farnborough in Hampshire. Local workers use an electric saw to break apart parts of the wreckage, which along with debris, will be transported to the Netherlands . The process is expected to take several days at the site located about 70km from Donetsk in Ukraine .

In its September preliminary report, the DSB said the black box information showed the MH17 flight proceeded normally until 1.20pm local time after which all recordings 'ended abruptly'. The DSB said pieces of wreckage were pierced in numerous places and that most likely there had been 'an in-flight break up'. The board added that it aimed to publish a full report within one year of the date of the crash. The MH17 disaster followed on from the disappearance in March this year of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which was flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 237 passengers on board. A reconstruction of a section of the MH17 aircraft by Dutch investigators would echo the work done by the AAIB which gathered wreckage from Pan Am flight 103 after it exploded over Lockerbie in December 1989 and painstakingly rebuilt part of the fuselage at Farnborough as part of its investigation.

The crash, on July 17 this year, cost the lives of 298 passengers, including 10 Britons, and came soon after the disappearance of MH370 . Work began to remove the wreckage of flight MH17 from rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine, today and is expected to take several days . The Dutch Safety Board said it could not reveal detailed information and the means of transportation and time schedule . The DSB's preliminary report in September said the wreckage was 'consistent with the damage expected from a large number of high-energy objects that penetrated the aircraft from outside' The report said the  black box information showed the flight proceeded normally until 1.20pm local time and then recordings 'ended abruptly' Members of the Dutch export team watch as parts of the wreckage of the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 are removed and loaded on a truck . The DSB said pieces of wreckage were pierced in numerous places and that most likely there had been 'an in-flight break up' The Dutch Safety Board added that it aimed to publish a full report within one year of the date of the crash . The wreckage must be cleared before harsh winter weather conditions in Ukraine make it impossible for recovery to continue . Dutch inspectors had hoped to collect the parts themselves but they remain concerned about the safety of their staff in the conflict zone . After an initial focus on finding human remains and belongings, the Dutch team have now decided to work with local services .

"At least nine people have died in clashes between protesters and police Turkey as demonstrations against ISIS's advance on a town on the Syrian-Turkish border turned violent. Turkey's pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party had called for citizens to protest the assault on Kobane, where the situation turned 'extremely critical' overnight. Officers were forced to use tear gas and water cannons to disperse protesters in Turkey's predominantly Kurdish eastern and southeastern provinces, as well as the capital Ankara and in Istanbul, where cars were set on fire and demonstrators threw rocks and fireworks at police.

Tensions are especially high in Turkey, where Kurds have fought a three-decade-long battle for autonomy and where Syria's violence has taken an especially heavy toll. Protests were reported in cities across Turkey on Tuesday, after ISIS fighters backed by tanks and artillery engaged in heavy street battles in Kobane. Police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse demonstrators in Istanbul and in the desert town of Kucuk Kenderciler, near Kobane on the Turkish side of the border. One person in Istanbul was hospitalized after being hit in the head by a gas canister, Dogan reported. Some protesters shouted 'Murderer ISIS!' and accused Turkey's government of collaborating with the Islamic militants. Authorities declared a curfew in six towns in the southeastern province of Mardin, the Anadolu Agency reported. Hundreds of thousands of Kurds live elsewhere in Europe, and mobilized quickly via social networks to stage protests after the advance on Kobane. Some European Kurds have gone to the Mideast recently to join Kurdish forces. Tension in Turkey: Protesters are seen hurling rocks and stones at police in Ankara, the capital of Turkey .

In Germany, home to Western Europe's largest Kurdish population, about 600 people demonstrated in Berlin on Tuesday, according to police. Hundreds demonstrated in other German cities. Austria, too, saw protests. Kurds peacefully occupied the Dutch Parliament for several hours Monday night, and met Tuesday with legislators to press for more Dutch action against the insurgents, according to local media. The Netherlands has sent six F-16 fighter jets to conduct airstrikes against Islamic State in Iraq, but says it does not see a mandate for striking in Syria.

Kurds protested overnight at the French Parliament and plan another protest Tuesday. Kurds also staged impromptu protests against the Islamic State fighters in Helsinki, Oslo and Stockholm. On Monday, protesters at the U.S. Embassy in Cyprus urged the international coalition to provide heavy weaponry to Kurdish fighters and forge a military cooperation pact with the Kurdish group YPG.","At least nine people dead in protests across Turkey on Tuesday .

"Russia today produced 'evidence' that it claims shows at least one military aircraft was flying close to Flight MH17 when it was shot down, killing all 298 on board. Data from air traffic controllers in Rostov-on-Don, leaked to a Moscow newspaper, appears to show an unidentified object flying at the time of the crash on 17 July and remaining in the area for 20 minutes after the crash. Russian military experts have previously claimed  a Ukrainian war plane shot down the Malaysia Airline flight, but it has taken 119 days for sources to produce the 'proof'. While the official Dutch-led probe into the MH17 horror is still underway, Western sources have suggested the aircraft was downed from rebel-held Ukrainian territory by a Russian-made BUK missile system. Ukraine has denied any of its aircraft were in the sky at the time. This screen grab, leaked to a Russian newspaper, claims to show that at least one military aircraft was flying close to Flight MH17 when it was shot down. The red arrow points to one or more unidentified aircraft which, an expert claims, bear the hallmarks of military planes. In the image, the blue lines apparently show the routes of other passenger planes, while the purple line is said to be the route of MH17 until its final signal . The screen grab shows the situation in the air over Rostov and nearby areas of Ukraine at the time of the crash, claimed Sergei Melnichenko, of Flight Safety agency, in Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper. However, Melnichenko - contrary to the newspaper - told MailOnline that he was not saying it must be a Ukrainian war plane. He says it must be a manned aircraft rather than, say, a small drone, but cannot tell what altitude it was flying at. He conceded it could be a helicopter though this would have been more easily noticed by people on the ground. The 'warplane(s)' gave off a 'primary signal' which the radar detected, but not their full identification, in contrast to the passenger aircraft flying past the crash site. The crash happened several minutes before MH17 was due to fly into Russian air space, in a sector controlled from Rostov. While hard for laymen to verify, he claimed the information it shows was culled directly from air traffic control data in Rostov and that a red arrow points to one or more unidentified aircraft which, he claimed, bear the hallmarks of military planes. Moscow newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets carried a reoprt (above) that claims data from air traffic controllers in Rostov-on-Don appears to show an unidentified object flying at the time of the crash on 17 July and remaining in the area for 20 minutes after the disaster. However, this could not be independently verified . 'We fully trust the sources which helped us to make it public,' he told the newspaper, indicating the mystery plane or planes circled over the MH17 crash site immediately after the Boeing 777 was downed. 'The data from the Rostov radar station tells us about the situation at the moment of the crash and 20 minutes afterwards.' It records other identified passenger planes and MH17 until its final signal. 'We can clearly see that at the moment of the crash and after it, to the North of the Boeing's route, some aircraft were flying. 'It is likely to have been military because all the dots are very close to each other. We can make a conclusion that it was either one or two aircraft; in any case, there was something there. In the image, the blue lines show the routes of other passenger planes. The purple line is the route of MH17 until its final signal. The unidentified object or objects are apparently shown as a cluster of marks inside the circle. Their routes to and from the site are not seen, apparently because they did not identify themselves in the way that passenger planes do. Mr Melnichenko said the reason there is no trail of the alleged warplane(s) is that the image is a snapshot of a 20-minute period which included the moment MH17 was downed. It means that the mystery aircraft(s) were already in place, possibly waiting for MH17 to arrive. And they were still in place when the snapshot was ended. An emergency services worker photographs debris from MH17 the day after the crash in Ukraine on July 17 . 'Military aircrafts are either not equipped with such answering devices or the pilots switch them off when working on a military task,' he said. So the radar shows the plane but 'we can't say what is there, what sort of plane, how high it is flying. But the fact is that it was there.' He claimed that the aircraft could not be Russian since NATO would have exposed this fact immediately. The pro-Russian fighters had no aviation, he said. The newspaper echoed Russian military experts in accusing the West and Ukraine of a cover-up of the presence of a warplane in the sky close to MH17. 'The fact of these marks at the radar does not fit with statements from Ukrainians that its military planes were not flying in this area at that moment,' said Melnichenko. 'It is also important that the location of these marks at the radar - to the left of the Boeing's route - fits the photographs from the crash scene where we can clearly see the left side of the cockpit and the left wing were hit.' It has been argued before that this is the wrong angle for a strike by a BUK missile. Today's claim echoes an allegation from commander of Russian Air Force Igor Makushev four days after the crash. Military sources in Moscow said they had registered 'accelerating aircraft of Ukrainian Air Force, supposedly Sukhoi-25' - which was approached the passenger airplane, flying at a distance of three to five kilometres. Makushev claimed the military aircraft 'continued flying above the place where the passenger airplane went down'. Vladimir Putin this week called for a thorough probe to determine all the causes of the plane's demise.","Data from air traffic controllers claims to show mystery planes near MH17 .

"Three-dimensional models of a 'priority area' in the Indian Ocean have been revealed as the search for MH370 ramps up. In the images huge mountains, deep trenches and dormant volcanoes are seen strewn across the search area - but there's no sign of the plane yet. The search for the plane is set to resume later this month, and mapping the ocean floor is essential to ensure the survival of underwater equipment that will be used. Three-dimensional models of the area MH370 is thought to have gone missing in the Indian Ocean have been revealed. They will be used to direct deep-sea equipment when the search for the plane resumes later this month. The maps reveal various features include large ridges and deep trenches (shown) Malaysia Airlines flight 370 disappeared over the Indian Ocean on 8 March with 239 people on board, and no sign of the plane has been found since then. It has been widely reported that better maps of Mars exist than this portion of the sea floor where the plane is thought to be located, so the new maps will be key in the hunt for the plane. The models show the designated MH370 search area, which includes the seabed around an area known as Broken Ridge. 8 March 12:21am . Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 departs from Kuala Lumpur, south west Malaysia, due to land in Beijing at 6.30am the same day. On board are 227 passengers and 12 crew. 1.20am . Eight villagers report seeing lights in the sky and hearing noise in the Marang area of north east Malaysia. 1.30am . Air traffic control makes its last recorded sighting of air traffic control. The plane is last seen on civilian radar above the waters where the South China Sea meets the Gulf of Thailand. 1.45am . Several sightings of the planet are reported, including a businessman in Kora Bharu and a bus driver in Penaruk. 2.15am . Military radar detects what could be the jetliner 200 miles north west of Penang Island in the Northern Malacca Strait. The primary search area - dubbed the ‘priority area' - is  an arc 23,000 square miles (60,000 square kilometres) in size, roughly the size of Croatia, 1,120 miles (1,800km) off the Australian coast. This area formed when two geological plates separated 20 to 100 million ago creating mountains, volcanoes and trenches. Seamounts - remnants of submarine volcanoes - are also present in the area. These large geological structures are typical of two such spreading plates. Structures include rugged ridges that reach heights of 985ft (300 metres) and trenches that are up to 4,590ft (1,400 metres) deep. At the end of this month the search will resume to try to find any sign of MH370 in this area. This will include using a deep-sea search vehicle attached to a boat by an armoured cable 6.2-miles (10km) long. Knowing where ridges and volcanoes lie is vital to ensure the equipment does not crash into an unseen object while underwater. The vehicle will use sonar to scan the ocean floor for anything that might resemble MH370, and it will also be able to detect the presence of aviation fuel. Knowing the location of the features is essential to steer deep-sea vehicles around them. Later this month equipment will be lowered on a cable to search the seabed using sonar and other techniques to try and find MH370. The maps  reveal raised areas (shown) that will need to be dodged by underwater vehicles . The primary search area - dubbed the ‘priority’ area - is an arc 23,000 square miles (60,000 square kilometres) in size, 1,120 miles (1,800km) off the Australian coast. This area was created when two geological plates separated 20 to 100 million ago, forming large mountains, volcanoes and trenches (shown) ‘The recently acquired high-resolution bathymetry data [the study of ocean floors] has revealed many of these seabed features for the first time,’ the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said in a statement. ‘It is also revealing finer-scale seabed features that were not visible in the previous low-resolution, satellite-derived bathymetry data.’ The new 3D models were maid using high resolution survey data, including satellite gravity measurements and some ocean passage soundings. Identification of the features will assist in navigation during the underwater search phase. The estimated location of MH370 in this area was derived from a series of brief pings - electronic ‘hellos’ - from the plane to a satellite before it disappeared. And it's hoped some sign of the plane will finally be found when the search starts again. The deep sea search vehicle will use sonar to scan the ocean floor for anything that might resemble MH370, and it will also be able to detect the presence of aviation fuel. Seamounts (shown) - remnants of submarine volcanoes - are also present in the area . Malaysia Airlines flight 370 disappeared without a trace in the early hours of 8 March while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The Boeing 777 with the registration number 9M-MRO is seen here on a previous flight over Poland on 5 February 2014 before its final flight .","3D models of the area MH370 is thought to have gone missing in the Indian Ocean have been revealed by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau .

"The head of the South Korean ferry company responsible for the deaths of 304 people who drowned when its vessel capsized in April has been jailed for ten years. Kim Han-sik, the chief executive of Chonghaejin Marine, was found guilty of negligence causing death and embezzlement - as it emerged he routinely allowed overloading and illegal renovations to be made to increase the ship's capacity. The sentence is the toughest penalty handed down to anyone other than the ferry's crew over the tragedy - in which 304 passengers, mostly teenage children died. Scroll down for video . Kim Han-sik, the chief executive of Chonghaejin Marine who operated the ferry on which 304 people died, has been jailed for ten years . Kim, 71, also received a 2 million won (£1150) fine for failing to stop the improper storage and overloaded cargo on the ship that judges ruled contributed to the sinking, the Gwangju District Court said in a statement. He apologised to the families of the victims but said last month that he was simply a paid employee of the company and the decisions that led to the disaster were made by the firm's de-facto owner, Yoo Byung-un. Yoo, who was the head of the family that owned a holding company at the centre of a network of business interests that included the ferry operator, was found dead in June. The overloaded Sewol, carrying 476 people, capsized 12 miles off the island of Byungpoongon on April 16 - while making a turn on a routine voyage to the holiday island of Jeju. Capsized: The ship capsized while making a turn during a routine voyage to the holiday island of Jeju . The vessel was later found to be defective, with additions made to increase passenger capacity making it top-heavy and unstable. By routinely overloading the Sewol, Chonghaejin made an extra £2 million in profit in the past year, according to the indictment. Alongside Kim, four other Chonghaejin officials were sentenced to three to six years in prison on similar charges, and two other company employees got suspended prison sentences, according to a court verdict. Doomed: The 6,825-tonne Sewol ferry was carrying 476 people on board when it capsized. Of the 304 who died, 250 were students from the same high school . An official from the Korea Shipping Association, which oversees safety issues of ships, was sentenced to three years in prison for allowing the ferry to leave a port near Seoul without checking its cargo and storage. Two employees at a private company that loaded the ship both received a two-year prison term. During the trial, prosecutor Park Jae-eok said the five jailed defendants neglected the passengers' safety in return for economic benefits and must be held responsible. Kim, the CEO, encouraged managers at a weekly gathering to meet the ferry's cargo goals even as he sought to sell the ship because of instability caused by the redesign, mounting losses and too much cost, Park said. If the cargo goal was not met, the weekly meeting was used to caution employees, he said. The approach of winter and the structural weakening of the vessel that has been under water for seven months in strong currents made it dangerous for divers to continue searching . Negligent: Lee Jun-Seok, the captain of the South Korea ferry that capsized killing 300 people including 250 pupils from the same school, was sentenced to 36 years in prison, but acquitted of murder . Sentenced: Lee (second left in front row) sits in court with other senior members of the Sewol ferry who were given jail terms of between 15 and 30 years, but also found not guilty of murder . The prosecutor also said that the employees at Chonghaejin were responsible for the captain and crew's abandonment of the sinking ship and the failure to protect passengers because they did not oversee sailors' emergency training and spent only £1 on training last year. That money covered the fee for issuing a paper for a sailor who received education elsewhere, Park said. The 15 surviving crew members including the captain were convicted last week on negligence charges and sentenced to between five and 36 years in jail. Last month South Korean prosecutors sought the death penalty for the captain of the ferry, Lee Joon-seok, 68 - after branding him a liar who abandoned the Sewol despite knowing that hundreds of trapped passengers would probably die. The decision to end the search was agreed by the families of the nine passengers still missing . The public rage directed at Lee had intensified following the release of pictures showing him clambering aboard a lifeboat while hundreds of young passengers remained trapped in their cabins and other parts of the sinking ferry. It emerged that before leaving his ship the captain had instructed the remaining passengers to stay where they were, even as the vessel began to tilt dramatically. Prosecutors argued that this decision alone contributed to the tragic loss of life. Many of the victims' families also demanded the death sentence but Lee was ultimately convicted of gross negligence last week and sentenced to 36 years behind bars - meaning he will most likely die in pirson. After the prosecution rested its case, Lee apologised to the families of the victims, saying he never intended to harm anyone. 'I will repent until the day I die and ask for the victims' families' forgiveness,' he said. 'I swear with my hand over my heart, I did not intend to kill anyone. I never even thought of such a thing.' More than seven months after the ferry Sewol sank on its way to a southern resort island, the country is still grappling with the aftermath of the disaster that exposed serious shortcomings in public safety and sparked fierce political wrangling . Divers recovered 295 bodies from the wreckage before the government stopped underwater searches last week. Nine victims remain missing.","Kim Han-sik, chief executive of Chonghaejin Marine, guilty of negligence .

"They had endured the cataclysmic power of Typhoon Haiyan and the devastating tidal waves whipped up by the super-storm's 150pmh winds. But now they were trapped in a flooded hotel with water waist-deep. Surrounded by fallen cables, the elderly and frail survivors were terrified. Rescue, however, soon arrived. Wading through the hazardous courtyard, these men loaded them on to mattresses and began to ferry them to the relative safety of the hotel building in Leyte Province, in the Philippines. The heroic rescue was captured on video by a reporter who warned guests about the cables in the water. Scroll down for video . Residents caught in the centre of Typhoon Haiyan waded through water up to their waist as they rescued four elderly people trapped in the storm . There were fears the water in the courtyard had been electrified by fallen cables and the reporter said he could feel his legs 'tingling' Despite the obvious dangers, the distressed and vulnerable people were all brought to the safety of the main hotel building where they were able to evacuate to the higher floors . He tells them: 'I can feel electricity in the water. My legs are tingling.' The video shows the raw power of the storm that it is feared has left thousands in the Philippines dead. It shows the hotel being battered by winds in excess of 150mph. Trees are seen being bent under the force of the winds and at one point water can be seen pouring down the staircase of the hotel. The reporter says off camera: 'So we have a storm surge starting to flood the ground floor of the hotel. 'Residents are evacuating up to the second floor.' The rescuers were in a race against time to bring the elderly residents to safety amid concerns about electricity in the waist-high flood water . The video of the rescue shows the tsunami-like impact the category five storm had on the area . Despite the obvious dangers to the rescuers, the four elderly people were brought through the flooded courtyard on top of mattresses. The official death toll from the category five storm now stands at 2,275 but that is expected to rise sharply. Yesterday, bodies were still being piled up on the side of the road and witnesses say there is little official counting of the dead. The figures from the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said 3,655 were injured, with a further 80 missing. The hotel residents were forced to evacuate to higher floors when the ground floor became submerged by water . At one stage water could be seen pouring down a staircase inside the hotel . The storm, one of the most powerful on record, hit the country's eastern seaboard on Friday, destroying tens of thousands of buildings and displacing about 600,000 people. A massive relief operation is underway, though many in the disaster zone have yet to see much assistance. There are reports of widespread looting and even exchanges of gunfire between armed men and security forces amid drastic food shortages in the affected cities.","Rescue of elderly through waist-deep flood water caught on camera .

"Relatives of MH370 passengers are outraged after a senior Malaysia Airlines representative allegedly said the beleaguered carrier is planning on officially declaring the plane 'lost', which would call off the search. Commercial director Hugh Dunleavy said authorities are working to set a date,  likely by the end of the year, to formally announce the loss of the Boeing 777, which vanished off radars on March 8 with 239 people aboard. An organisation representing families of the MH370 passengers said Mr Dunleavy's comments, denied by both Malaysia Airlines and Australia, had brought 'intense agony and confusions to family members'. Scroll down for video . Still searching: Malaysia Airlines' commercial director said the company is preparing to declare flight MH370 officially lost which would see the search, pictured in April, called off . 'We don't have a final date but once we've had an official loss recorded we can work with the next of kin on the full compensation payments for those families,' Mr Dunleavy was quoted as saying. An industry source said once the plane is declared lost, all search efforts will be stopped. 'The talk has been that the search has been futile so far and it's unlikely to bring anything,' the source said. The comments were allegedly made by Mr Dunleavy during an interview with the New Zealand Herald last week. Anger: Relatives of MH370 passengers, pictured here in Beijing earlier this year, said Mr Dunleavy's comments had brought 'intense agony and confusions to family members . Survey ship M/V Fugro Discovery which is searching for missing flight MH370. Reports the plane may be declared lost has sparked anger among passengers' relatives . But Voice370, an association of MH370 victims' relatives, said in a statement late Monday that it was 'bewildered' by the report . 'Such unilateral declaration brings intense agony and confusions to family members and makes us lose faith in the search effort,' it said. In a statement Monday, Malaysia Airlines distanced itself from Mr Dunleavy's comments, saying it was his personal opinion and 'ongoing search and recovery operations will remain and will not be discontinued'. It said any information regarding MH370 will only be communicated by the Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) in Australia. Officials at the JACC said Tuesday that Mr Dunleavy's comments were 'greatly disturbing for the families and loved ones of the passengers and crew on board MH370', reiterating Australia's commitment to the search. MH370 inexplicably disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in what remains one of history's great aviation mysteries. Australia has been spearheading the hunt for the plane, which is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean off western Australia. Some next-of-kin bitterly accuse the Malaysian government and airline of a bungled response and cover-up, charges that they have strenuously denied. A Malaysian family last month sued the government and the airline for negligence in what is believed to be the first lawsuit filed over the disaster.","Malaysia Airlines is set to declare MH370 officially lost, a representative said .

"The FBI is asking for help identifying an American fanatic fighting for ISIS in Syria.

And the Bureau hopes that somebody watching the video may recognize the terrorist. Scroll down for video . Familiar? The FBI is asking Americans to watch an ISIS terror video in the hope that they can identify this man, thought to be an American . Agents uploaded their own cut of the video, which skips the graphic and violent portions of the 55-minute original, entitled The Flames of War. But it does show the American figure, wearing a black mask and combat fatigues, boasting over captives whom he says are being forced to dig their own graves. ISIS's black flag billows in the background. The scene then cuts to a different scene, where a row of prisoners kneel as the American-voiced figure boasts of the Islamic State's treatment of 'kuffar' - a derogatory term for non-Muslims. The video fades away as the figure turns, gun in hand, towards the waiting men. Wanted: The Bureau has set up a phone line and a website, hoping to receive tips over his identity . A statement from the FBI said: 'In releasing a segment from the video, the FBI hopes someone might recognize the man through his voice and appearance. 'In the segment, the faces of purported prisoners are obscured and their executions are not shown. Michael Steinbach, of the FBI’s Counterterrorism Division, said: 'We’re hoping that someone might recognize this individual and provide us with key pieces of information. No piece of information is too small.' Discussing the videos, the director of the Bureau, James Comey, said they appeal to 'troubled souls' and give them the push they need to 'emerge from the basement' as full-fledged jihadists. Brutal: In the FBI cut of the video, an excerpt of the much Flames of War film, the American-voiced man stands over captured Syrian soldiers, and gestures at them with his gun. It doesn't show their execution . He said: 'These homegrown violent extremists are troubled souls who are seeking meaning in some misguided way. 'And so they come across the propaganda and they become radicalized on their own independent study, and they're also able to equip themselves with training again on the Internet, and then engage in jihad after emerging from their basement.' The FBI is also urging people to report anybody they know who has traveled - or might want to travel - to Iraq and Syria to fight. Steinbach said the agency 'need' help from the American public to identify any would-be jihadists - and have set up a phone line and web page for any tip-offs. Suspect: These pictures are believed to be that of Mohammed Hamzah Khan, a 19-year-old from Illinois who was arrested on Saturday allegedly trying to join ISIS . The U.S. government has estimated that more than 100 Americans have left the country to fight with ISIS, some of whom have now come back. Intelligence officials are said to have confirmed the identities of a dozen Americans on the ground on the side of ISIS. On Saturday the FBI arrested Mohammed Hamzah Khan at O'Hare airport, Chicago, as he tried to fly to Turkey. The 19-year-old, from nearby Bolingbrook, Illinois, is accused of attempting to travel overseas to support terrorism - which carries a maximum sentence of 15-years. Khan is also charged with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. He reportedly told FBI agents how he hoped to join ISIS - and investigators who scoured his home found documents outlining his intentions, including a letter asking his parents to join him. Americans? Around 100 U.S. citizens are thought to have left the country for Syria - and some have returned . Other Americans have made similar attempts. Twenty-year-old Adam 'Fadi Fadi' Dandach was arrested by FBI in Los Angeles in July, and confessed he was headed to Syria to join up with ISIS. The next month investigators took in Donald Ray Morgan, 44, of North Carolina over firearms violations, NBC reports. But the agency then discovered pro-ISIS messages on his social media accounts, including an image of him swearing fealty to ISIS's ruler, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. A Colorado woman, Shannon Maureen Conley, has pleaded guilty in court to charges that she tried to fly to Turkey to become involved with ISIS. One man who made it was Douglas McAuthur McCain, 33, of Minnesota. According to the New York Times, he was fighting on the front lines in August when he was killed by a rival Syrian group. FBI sources told the paper that American jihadists tend to be younger than those from elsewhere, often in their teens or early twenties.

"The brother of a Muslim fanatic who died in Syria after bragging about his '5-star jihad' has been charged with preparing to carry out terrorist acts. Mustakim Jaman, 23, was arrested, along with his parents after police raided their Portsmouth home last week. His brother, Ifthekar Jaman, 23, died last year in a battlefield clash 2,000 miles from his Hampshire home last December after declaring he was ready to die a martyr. Mustakim Jaman, 23, has been charged under the Terrorism Act after police raided his Portsmouth home . He became one of the most infamous British extremists when he boasted on BBC Newsnight that the 'holy war' in Syria was like '5-star jihad' because of its 'relaxing' nature. Mustakim Jaman  went on Newsnight to defend his brother, saying he died 'doing a good deed' and was always trying to be the 'best Muslim' he could. He was arrested by the south-east counter-terrorism unit on 14 October on suspicion of being involved in a Syria-related terrorism plot. The 23-year-old was remanded in custody to appear at Westminster magistrates court in London tomorrow. Ifthekar Jaman, 23, (left) became one of the most infamous British extremists when he boasted on BBC Newsnight about the '5-star jihad' in Syria. His sister Tamannah Shaharin (right) was also arrested . Jaman was arrested alongside his brother, Tuhim, 26, and his parents, Enu Miah, 57, and mother, Hena Choudhury. His parents were released on bail on 15 October. Jaman's 29-year-old sister Tamannah Shaharin, was also arrested in Greenwich, south east London. A 23-year-old woman from Farnborough and a 29-year-old woman from Greenwich, south London, were also held on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of terrorism acts. Officials said the arrests were part of a nationwide operation and linked to the Syrian conflict. Police have warned that an increasing number of British Muslims are joining the conflict there and may return to Britain after receiving terrorism training. Portsmouth is home to a handful of young men who have left England to join Islamic State fighters in Syria . The official threat level in Britain is set at 'severe,' indicating that an attack is highly likely.

"These mind-boggling images capture the scale of soaring apartment blocks in one of the world's most densely populated areas; Hong Kong. As home to a population of more than seven million crammed into an area measuring just 424 square miles, space in Hong Kong is at a premium. It means that, when it comes to providing accommodation for Hong Kong's huge population, the only way to go is up. Mind-boggling: Photographer Michael Wolf's incredible shots capture the extreme scale of skyscrapers in one of the world's most densely populated places; Hong Kong . The result is the soaring high-rise buildings captured to incredible effect by German photographer Michael Wolf in his project Architecture of Density. The images reveal the densely packed apartments crammed into towering skyscrapers, with laundry spilling from barred windows and hanging over cramped balconies. Earlier this year the Hong Kong-based Society for Community Organisation (SoCO) highlighted the plight of the city's most under-privileged people, increasing numbers of whom are being forced to live in almost inconceivably small spaces. In districts including Sham Shui Po, Yau Tsim Mong, and Kowloon City, families, elderly people and the unemployed are crammed into living quarters that are barely bigger than a toilet cubicle in some cases. The combination of Hong Kong's huge population and sky-high rents - around HKD$90 (£8) per square foot a month - has led to a housing shortage that is affecting hundreds of thousands of the city's poorest people, SoCo said. Close-quarters: Washing can be seen hanging from the seemingly countless balconies of this towering Hong Kong apartment block . City dwellers: Hong Kong is home to a population of more than seven million people, squeezed into an area measuring just 424 square miles . Scale: Michael Wolf's photographs make the number of living spaces piled one on top of the other in this Hong Kong skyscraper seem never-ending . Neighbours: Despite being one of the world's richest cities, the high cost of renting in Hong Kong means many of its residents are forced to set up home in incredibly cramped living spaces . Tableau: This giant patchwork is made up of individual shots of soaring tower blocks joined to form a giant tableau . Perspective: This photograph may appear baffling at first glance, but closer inspection reveals it is a shot of dozens of windows and balconies in another Hong Kong apartment block . Dilapidated: The photographer documents some less than idyllic living quarters in Hong Kong, where charities have highlighted the plight of underprivileged residents trying to afford a home in a place where space is at a premium . Hong Kong: Laundry hangs from the barred windows of this tower block, the walls of which are painted pastel pink . Claustrophobic: A close up view of cramped flats in a Hong Kong high rise, left, and right, a cluster of the densely populated city's many tower blocks . Pile them high: Hong Kong is one of the world's richest cities, but lurking beneath the prosperity is a housing problem affecting hundreds of thousands of its underprivileged residents . Construction: The photographer has documented more building work underway in Hong Kong as the city struggles to find space for its already cramped population . Grid: Seemingly endless windows and balconies in a another close-up of a Hong Kong apartment building . Architecture of Destiny: This image of a pink tower block soaring high into the skies above Hong Kong could almost be mistaken for a piece of abstract art . Night-life: Rent in Hong Kong costs around HKD$90 (£8) per square foot a month, and the waiting list for public housing is so long that urban slums have sprung up around the city . Over-population: These photographs of Hong Kong's apartment buildings appear to reflect a city bursting at the seams . Shoulder to shoulder: The thousands of residents of these Hong Kong apartment buildings go about their daily lives in extremely close proximity to their neighbours .

"'Psycho banker' Rurik Jutting is understood to be detained at notorious Stanley Prison while he awaits trail accused of butchering two women in his Hong Kong apartment. One of six maximum security jails in the territory, human rights groups consider Stanley among the toughest prisons in the world, with Jutting held alongside Triad gangsters, rapists and child killers. Having asked to be remanded in prison rather than police custody during a court appearance earlier this week, the 1,714 capacity hellhole jail where Jutting is thought to be incarcerated is a world away from his previous life as high-flying banker, reportedly earning a salary of £350,000 a year. Hard time: Hong Kong's Stanley Prison (pictured) is where 'psycho banker' Rurik Jutting is currently being held as he awaits trail accused of killing two women . It currently holds 1,714, although was only built to hold 1,500 . One of six maximum security jails in the territory, human rights groups consider Stanley among the toughest prisons in the world, with Jutting held alongside Triad gangsters, rapists and child killers . Out with the girls: The 1,714 capacity hellhole jail where Jutting is now incarcerated is a world about from his previous life as high-flying, hard-partying banker, reportedly earning a salary of £350,000 a year . Jutting is understood to have been transferred to Stanley Prison on Monday afternoon after a judge granted his request to be transferred there rather than continue to be held in police custody. Martyn Richmond, a temporary lawyer assigned to him, complained that police refused to let him contact a lawyer of his choice or the British Consulate while in custody. Mr Richmond said that if Jutting's requests were granted, he 'may well co-operate' with a police reconstruction at the crime scene, which is understood to be planned for Friday. As Jutting has been charged with murder but is yet to face trial, he is unlikely to be held in the main body of the prison where convicted rapists and killers are detained and where gang-related violence is commonplace. Housing both convicted and remand prisoners, Stanley Prison has a staff of more than 800 officers, wardens, medical professionals, canteen and maintenance staff. Welcome: Pictured is the green entrance gate to Hong Kong's Stanley Prison - one of the world's toughest jails . Past: During the Second World War Stanley Prison was used as a detention centre by Japanese forces after it was captured by the invading armies on Christmas Day, 1941 . Notorious: Stanley Prison houses thousands of prisoners, including Triad gangsters, rapists and child killers . Portions: Prisoners' food rations inside Stanley Prison are based on their physical fitness . Inside the prison, all adult prisoners are legally required to work six days a week. Their roles are determined by the crimes they have committed, their physical fitness and the security risk they pose . Built in 1937, Stanley Prison became the oldest active prison in Hong Kong after the ancient Victoria Prison ceased operation in 2005. It was originally designed to hold 1,500 prisoners but space has since been found for an extra 214. During the Second World War Stanley Prison was used as a detention centre by Japanese forces after it was captured by the invading armies on Christmas Day, 1941. From this period up until the early 1990s, the prison population is understood to have routinely topped 3,000 - twice the number it was built to house. As a prisoner of war camp it became notorious as a place of torture and execution, with Mateen Ahmed Ansari - an Indian army captain - posthumously awarded the George Cross after being beaten, starved and eventually executed by Japanese troops who unsuccessfully demanded that he renounce his allegiance to the British army and sow seeds of discontent among his comrades. Nearly 600 prisoners of war and civilians killed by the Japanese during the occupation are buried in the nearby Stanley War Cemetery. Both of the young women found murdered in the apartment of British 'psycho baker' Rurik Jutting came from impoverished families in Indonesia and arrived in Hong Kong as domestic workers. Like the hundreds of thousands of young Thai, Filipino and Indonesian women who flock there, both Sumarti Ningsih, and Seneng Mujiasih were mainly attracted by Hong Kong's higher wages. Sumarti Ningsih married young and worked as a nanny in her town of Cilacap, but the couple struggled to find enough to eat, according to Time. Victims: Like the hundreds of thousands of young Thai, Filipino and Indonesian women who flock there, both Sumarti Ningsih (left) and Seneng Mujiasih (right) were mainly attracted by Hong Kong's higher wages . After giving birth to a son at the age of 18 in 2009, she is understood to have travelled to Hong Kong, ending her marriage and leaving her child in the care of her farmer parents. She found work as a domestic worker and earned enough money to be able to send £150 back to her family every month - more than twice the total amount she was earning back home. Miss Ningsih soon moved on to work as a waitress in a restaurant and took a DJ course to help boost her income. All the while she continued sending large sums of money back to her family to help them pay for her son's education. However her frequent journeys between Hong Kong and her family home Indonesia had a negative impact. On her last visit to the territory she was only granted a tourist visa, forcing her to start working illegally. Despite media reports to the contrary her family insist she never resorted to prostitution and continued to find cash-in-hand employment as a waitress until her murder last week. Seneng Mujiasih's background was strikingly similar. She left her parents' home  of island of Sulawesi at some point in the mid-2000s but ran into difficulty when her then employer terminated her contract as a domestic worker in 2011. Fearing that her dream of saving enough money to buy a house for her parents would lie in tatters if she returned to low wages in Indonesia, Miss Mujiasih also embraced the world of illegal work. Living in a run-down boarding house just yards from Rurik Jutting's flashy apartment she, like so many other young foreign women in Hong Kong, began to seek cash in any way she could - including working as a part-time prostitute.

Grim: Although the death penalty was formally abolished in Hong Kong in 1993, Stanley Prison previously saw frequent executions. A total of 122 people were killed there between 1946 and the 1966 . Taste for the high life: Rurik Jutting, 29, drapes an arm around ex-girlfriend after moving to Hong Kong . Although the death penalty was formally abolished in Hong Kong in 1993, Stanley Prison previously saw frequent executions. A total of 122 people were killed there between 1946 and the 1966. While the death penalty is commonly used in China, Hong Kong continued to operate under a different set of laws after Britain handed the territory over to China in July 1997. Inside the prison, all adult prisoners are legally required to work six days a week. Their roles are determined by the crimes they have committed, their physical fitness and the security risk they pose. The quality of the work is then assessed and the prisoners rewarded with a payment system that allows them to buy rewards such as library books, television viewing time and newspapers. Despite the brutal history of the prison, the Stanley peninsula on which it sits - known locally as Chek Chue - is one of the territory's most popular tourist locations, particularly around Stanley Market. A picturesque home for many wealthy Western expats, Stanley is lined with expensive Victorian-era properties, many of which overlook St Stephen's Bay - considered among the best beaches in China.

"U.S. and Arab warplanes have killed 464 Islamic State militants in Syria since they began targeting the terror group with airstrikes last month. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a total of 553 people have been killed in bombing raids since September 23 - 32 of them civilians, including six children and five women. The group said it has documented the deaths of 464 fighters with the Islamic State group, adding that the real number could be much higher. Another 57 fighters with the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front were killed in airstrikes on the northern province of Aleppo and Idlib, the Observatory said. Scroll down for video . Blast: An American airstrike hits ISIS targets in Kobane this morning. A total of 553 people have been killed in the raids - 464 ISIS militants, 57 Al Qaeda militants and 32 civilians, including six children and five women . Threat: An American warplane is seen flying over Kobane during another evening of airstrikes on ISIS targets . Tracer rounds lit up the sky over  Kobane last night as American warplanes continued to hit Islamic State targets. The vast majority of ISIS fighters killed in Syria since September have died in the besieged town . Many of the Islamic State fighters have been killed in or near the northern Syrian town of Kobane, the target of a massive jihadi offensive since mid-September. ISIS fighters have captured dozens of Kurdish villages and forced more than 200,000 people to flee for safety in neighboring Turkey. News of the deaths came as coalition warplanes targeted an ISIS-held oil field in the eastern Deir el-Zour province near Iraq this morning. Earlier this week, The U.S. Central Command said its forces have conducted more than 135 airstrikes against Islamic State militants in and around Kobane, killing hundreds of fighters. 'Combined with continued resistance to ISIL on the ground, indications are that these strikes have slowed ISIL advances into the city, killed hundreds of their fighters and destroyed or damaged scores of pieces of ISIL combat equipment and fighting positions,' Central Command said in a statement. Life goes on: A shepherd tends his flock in the outskirts of the Syrian town of Kobane this morning as fighting between Islamic State militants and Kurdish YPG fighters continues to rage . Turkish tanks and armoured vehicles hold their positions as they watch the Syrian town of Kobane from near the Turkish-Syrian border . A Kurdish fighters' position is seen in the outskirts of the besieged Syrian town of Kobane this afternoon . Journalist on the Turkish side of the border said heavy machine gun fire could be heard from the town this morning.  The Observatory meanwhile reported four coalition airstrikes on oil wells in the Jafra field in Deir el-Zour late last night. The Local Coordination Committees, an activist group, also reported the airstrikes in areas held by the Islamic State group. The U.S.-led coalition has aggressively targeted IS-held oil facilities in Syria, which provide a key source of income for the militants. But such strikes also endanger civilians, which could undermine long-term efforts to destroy the militant group. The attacks on the oil industry, including refineries, have also led to a sharp rise in the price of oil products in rebel-held areas of Syria. The chilling sight of the Islamic State's black jihadist flag is still visible in  Kobane - despite Kurdish territorial gains and  weeks of sustained airstrikes by American and Arab warplanes. The terrorist group was thought to have been pushed out of the centre of the besieged Syrian city after hundreds of brave Kurdish resistance fighters coordinated fierce street battles with coalition bombing raids - forcing the well-equipped jihadis to retreat into the outskirts of Kobane. But this morning the group's black jihadist flag could clearly still be seen inside city, raised over a multi-storey building just a few hundred feet away from where the yellow, triangular flag of the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG) could be seen fluttering above a largely destroyed housing complex. Chilling: ISIS' black jihadist flag (circled, background) was still visible in Kobane this morning - despite weeks of sustained airstrikes by U.S. and Arab warplanes. The flag is just streets from where the yellow flag of the Kurdish People's Protection Unit can be seen  (circled, foreground) The image emerged as American and Arab jets launched fresh attacks on ISIS positions in the north of Kobane - with pyrotechnic tracer ammunition lighting up the night sky and coalition warplanes destroying ISIS-held buildings with a barrage of air-to-surface missiles. This morning lawmakers in Iraq's largely autonomous Kurdish region authorized peshmerga forces to cross into neighboring Syria to help fellow Kurds combat Islamic State militants in the city, providing much-needed boots on the ground. The unprecedented deployment will almost certainly depend on the support of Turkey, whose president criticized a U.S. airdrop of arms to Kurdish fighters after some of the weapons wound up in the hands of the extremists.","U.S. and Arab warplanes have killed hundreds of militants since September .

"Thousands of pro-democracy protesters clashed with police tonight as they tried to surround the Hong Kong government headquarters.

The scenes have become familiar since the pro-democracy movement began in late September. Student leaders told a big crowd tonight at the main protest site outside the government headquarters that they would escalate their campaign. Then, hundreds of protesters pushed past police lines on the other side of the complex from the protest site. They blocked traffic on a main road, but were stopped by police barricades from going down a side road to Chief Executive Leung Chun-Ying's office. The protesters, many wearing surgical masks, hard hats and safety goggles, were chanting ‘I want true democracy'. They said they wanted to occupy the road to prevent Mr Leung and other government officials from getting to work in the morning.

Police Senior Superintendent Tsui Wai-hung said 40 protesters had been arrested, adding that authorities would not let the road, a major thoroughfare, remain blocked. ‘We will open up this road,’ he told reporters. Protesters said they were taking action to force a response from Hong Kong's government, which has made little effort to address their demands that it scrap a plan by China's Communist leaders to use a panel of Beijing-friendly elites to screen candidates for Hong Kong's leader in inaugural 2017 elections.

"The Queen has reportedly agreed to allow the charity of her former daughter-in-law, the Duchess of York, hold a party at Windsor Castle. Sarah Ferguson, the former wife of Prince Andrew, will be a key figure at the £50,000 party for 200 guests at Windsor's State Apartments on Wednesday, held to mark the 21st anniversary of her charity Children In Crisis . The move marks a return to the fold for Fergie, after brushes with scandal left her reportedly ostracised by senior members of the royal family - in particular, Prince Philip, who has not spoken to her for years. Scroll down for video . The Queen has reportedly agreed to allow the charity of her former daughter-in-law, the Duchess of York, hold a party at Windsor Castle . A source told the Sunday Express that the Duchess of York was 'over the moon' that the Queen had allowed her to hold the party at Windsor. But reports that the Duke of York is throwing a 55th birthday party for his ex-wife,are 'totally incorrect', it was claimed today. A spokesman for the Duchess told Mail Online that while a dinner is being held at the royal residence on Wednesday, it is to mark the 21st anniversary of her charity Children In Crisis and no mention of her birthday is being made. James Henderson, who is also a trustee of the charity, said: 'There is an event being held on Wednesday night at Windsor Castle, but it is to mark the 21st anniversary of the Duchess's charity Children In Crisis. 'More than 200 receptions are held at the castle each year and this is one of them. 'It is being thrown by the Duke of York in honour of the milestone and the work his ex-wife and their children do for the charity. 'The invitations went out in the Duke's name and very much bore the charity's logo. There is no mention or acknowledgement of the Duchess of York's birthday and nor does she want there to be. This is all about this remarkable charity. The fact that it is her birthday is just a coincidence. 'Some two hundred people will attend the dinner, all of whom are supporters of Children in Crisis.' A source close to the Duchess also quashed suggestions that Prince Harry would be there but said it was more than likely that his on-off girlfriend, Cressida Bonas, would be as she is Princess Eugenie's best friend and is very close to the Duchess. She also attended a Children In Crisis event thrown by the princess over the summer. Sarah Ferguson, the former wife of Prince Andrew, will be a key figure at the £50,000 party for 200 guests at Windsor's State Apartments on Wednesday, held to mark the 21st anniversary of her charity Children In Crisis . Sir Elton John and partner David Furnish have also been invited alongside Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson and children Sam and Holly. Kate Moss and fellow supermodel Naomi Campbell are also said to have received an invite as well as Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone. Downton Abbey creator Lord Julian Fellowes, and Stephen Fry are also expected to attend. While the Queen has long been said to have remained fond of her former daughter-in-law, Prince Philip is said to be baffled by Fergie and Prince Andrew's relationship.

"South Korean officials have banned Asiana Airlines from flying to San Francisco for 45 days as punishment for a deadly crash last year. Three people were killed and 200 were injured when the plane carrying 307 people crashed as it was landing at the California airport in July. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board concluded in June that the pilots were at fault and made errors as they touched down. Scroll down for video . Reaction: South Korean officials said Friday they will ban Asiana Airlines from flying to San Francisco for 45 days as punishment for a deadly crash in July last year. Three people were killed and 200 were injured . An official from Asiana Airlines said the company will appeal the decision by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport's disciplinary committee, and will consider legal measures if the committee rejects the appeal. She did not want to be named, citing company rules. A ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity citing office rules, said if the company does appeal, the ministry will make a final decision within one month. The official said the committee considered the number of deaths and injuries and the amount of property damage in deciding on the length of the flight ban. Probe: The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board concluded in June that the pilots were at fault and made errors as they touched down . If the appeal is rejected, the ministry will ask the company to choose a period in the next six months to serve the suspension, he said. Asiana said it sells about 170,000 tickets a year for its flights between Incheon and San Francisco, with 70 percent of the customers being non-South Koreans. San Francisco International Airport spokesman Doug Yakel said he could not comment on the suspension's effect because key details, such as the suspension start date, appeal process outcome, and whether other airlines would be increasing service, were not yet known.","Three passengers were killed and 200 injured in the San Francisco crash .

"Changes in cloud patterns could reveal the final resting place of missing Malaysian flight MH370, according to an Australian scientist. Hydrometeorologist Aron Gingis says that MH370's path could be revealed by analysing satellite images of clouds, as their patterns are changed by planes' 'contrails' – or condensation trails - interacting with them. In other words, every plane leaves breadcrumbs. Scroll down for video . An image released by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau that speculates the final path of the flight, west of Australia, using satellite ping data. Mr Gingis' expertise with cloud patterns is yet to be used in the hunt for MH370 . Despite a massive multi-national search operation, not even 'a seat cushion' from the jet has been found . It comes as British satellite company Inmarsat admitted that there is still 'significant doubt' over the location of MH370. Mr Gingis, who's head of the Australian environmental consultancy company Management Consolidated, wrote to the Malaysian High Commissioner Eldeen Husaini at the beginning of April and offered to help with the search effort, according to Au News. He said: 'I believe that we have a realistic chance to follow the flight path of Malaysia Airlines MH370 and follow its flight direction, possibly identifying its landing or crash site. 'I believe that we will be able to utilise our expertise and identify the flight pass of MH370 and then to direct the search and rescue authorities to save or recover MH370 passengers.' However, he was told 'thanks, but no thanks' by the Malaysian authorities, so instead sent his proposal to the Australian Transport and Safety Bureau (ATSB). They were more interested but the two sides reached an impasse. The ATSB had several questions about Mr Gingis's techniques that Mr Gingis refused to answer for fear of his commercial interests being compromised. As a result, no trajectories for MH370 have been produced by Mr Gingis. Hydrometeorologist Aron Gingis says that MH370's path could be revealed by analysing satellite images of clouds. Pictured is the same model of 777 as the doomed flight . The Fugro Discovery search vessel, pictured, will spend a further year searching for the aircraft's wreckage . Inmarsat, meanwhile, which has been at the heart of the search for MH370, produced a report recently that left a question mark over whether the plane is even in the ocean. Writing in The Journal of Navigation, it said that while it believes 'MH370 changed course and… travelled in a southerly direction until it ran out of fuel in the southern Indian Ocean, west of Australia', it stressed that 'the sensitivity of the reconstructed ﬂight path to frequency errors is such that there remains significant uncertainty in the final location'. The Beijing-bound Boeing 777 lost contact with air traffic controllers after taking off with 239 on board from Kuala Lumpur on March 8. However, it transmitted signals to Inmarsat's Indian Ocean Region satellite, leading the company's analysts to conclude that it continued to fly 'for several hours after loss of contact'. The ATSB said: 'All the evidence - based on independent analysis of satellite, radar and aircraft performance data from many international experts - indicates the aircraft entered the sea close to a long but narrow arc in the southern Indian Ocean.' The ship Discovery, provided by Dutch contractor Fugro, was scheduled to arrive in the search zone about 1,800 kilometers (1,100) miles west of Australia on Wednesday, the ATSB said in a statement. The GO Phoenix, a Malaysian ship that has been combing the area since early October, is in the Western Australian city of Fremantle getting fresh supplies. Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein, who was in Australia to greet the GO Phoenix during its return to port, said everything possible was being done to find the Boeing 777, which inexplicably disappeared on March 8 during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. 'We must continue to hope because sometimes hope is all we have,' he said. 'We will find MH370.' The search ships are dragging sonar devices called towfish through the water about 100 meters (330 feet) above the seabed to hunt for the wreckage. The towfish, which are also equipped with jet fuel sensors, transmit data in real-time to those on board the vessels. The underwater search resumed in early October after being on hold for four months while crews mapped the seabed in the 60,000-square kilometer (23,000-square mile) search zone. The GO Phoenix has searched over 1,200 square kilometers (460 square miles) so far. Despite a massive air and sea search, not a single piece of debris from the plane has been found. Australian officials are still receiving reports from people who believe they have found wreckage washed up along the Australian coastline, but all have been false alarms. Drift modeling by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority has shown any floating debris would likely have traveled west, away from Australia. Because of that, Australia asked Indonesian officials to be on the lookout for any wreckage, as it is possible some may have drifted to the island nation's coastline, the transport safety bureau said. Meanwhile, a third ship, the Fugro Equator, is still mapping areas of the search zone and will join the hunt once that is complete, likely in the next week or so. Emirates CEO and president Sir Tim Clark, pictured, said he believes MH370 was 'under control until the end' The search is expected to take up to a year. The chief executive of Emirates earlier claimed that 'control was taken of' Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 before it vanished. Sir Tim Clark said it was very important that the airline industry does not accept that the fate of MH370 is an 'unexplained mystery'. His airline, Emirates, operates almost 130 Boeing 777 aircraft, similar to the doomed jet. In an interview with German magazine Spiegel, Clark said: 'MH370 remains one of the great aviation mysteries. Personally, I have the concern that we will treat it as such and move on. At the most, it might then make an appearance on National Geographic as one of aviation's great mysteries. We mustn't allow this to happen. We must know what caused that airplane to disappear.' He added: 'MH 370 was, in my opinion, under control, probably until the very end.'","Cloud expert Aron Gingis says that MH370 can be traced using its 'contrail'

"With strong features cast in burnished gold, Tutankhamun’s burial mask projects an image of majestic beauty and royal power. But in the flesh, King Tut had buck teeth, a club foot and girlish hips, according to the most detailed examination ever of the ancient Egyptian pharaoh’s remains. And rather than being a boy king with a love of chariot racing, Tut relied on walking sticks to get around during his rule in the 14th century BC, researchers said. Scroll down for video . The boy king's burial mask - as the world knows him - and his face as revealed by the 'virtual autopsy' A ‘virtual autopsy’, composed of more than 2,000 computer scans, was carried out in tandem with a genetic analysis of Tutankhamun’s family, which supports evidence that his parents were brother and sister. The scientists believe that this left him with physical impairments triggered by hormonal imbalances. And his family history could also have led to his premature death in his late teens. Various myths suggest he was murdered or was involved in a chariot crash after fractures were found in his skull and other parts of his skeleton. Now scientists believe he may have died of an inherited illness because only one of the breaks occurred before he died, while his club foot would have made chariot racing impossible. In 1907, Lord Carnarvon George Herbert asked English archaeologist and Egyptologist Howard Carter to supervise excavations in the Valley of the Kings. Tutankhamun (illustrated) was reliant on a walking stick thanks to his club foot, which may have been due to the fact that his parents were brother and sister . In 1907, Lord Carnarvon George Herbert asked English archaeologist and Egyptologist Howard Carter to supervise excavations in the Valley of the Kings. On 4 November 1922, Carter's group found steps that led to Tutankhamun's tomb. He spent several months cataloguing the antechamber before opening the burial chamber and discovering the sarcophagus in February the following year. He recorded these movements in his journal, and this diary is just one of the items on display in the Ashmolean’s ‘Discovering Tutankhamun’ exhibit. Tutankhamun was an Egyptian pharaoh of the 18th dynasty, and ruled between 1332 BC and 1323 BC. He was the son of Akhenaten and took to the throne at the age of nine or ten.When he became king, he married his half-sister, Ankhesenpaaten. He died at around the age of 18 and the cause of death is unknown. On 4 November 1922, Carter's group found steps that led to Tutankhamun's tomb and spent several months cataloguing the antechamber. They opened the burial chamber and discovered the the sarcophagus in February the following year. The revelations are made in BBC One documentary Tutankhamun: The Truth Uncovered. Albert Zink, from the Institute for Mummies and the Iceman in Italy, deciphered the truth about the ruler’s parents by studying the royal family’s DNA. He found that Tut was born after his father Akhenaten – dubbed the heretic king – had a relationship with his sister. Incest was not frowned upon by the ancient Egyptians and they did not know about the health implications for any offspring. Hutan Ashrafian, a lecturer in surgery at Imperial College London, said that several members of the family appeared to have suffered from ailments which can be explained by hormonal imbalances. He said: ‘A lot of his family predecessors lived to a ripe old age. Only his immediate line were dying early, and they were dying earlier each generation.’ Egyptian radiologist Ashraf Selim: ‘The virtual autopsy shows the toes are divergent – in layman’s terms it’s club foot. He would have been heavily limping. ‘There is only one site where we can say a fracture happened before he died and that is the knee.’ Evidence of King Tut’s physical limitations were also backed up by 130 used walking canes found in his tomb. King Tutankhamun's tomb was found in the Valley of the Kings, a valley in Egypt where pharoahs and nobles from the 18th, 19th and 20th dynasties (known as the 'New Kingdom') in Ancient Egypt were buried from the 16th to 11th century BC (marked) In November 1922, Howard Carter found steps that led to Tutankhamun's tomb. He spent several months cataloguing the antechamber before opening the burial chamber and discovering the sarcophagus in February the following year. Carter and an unnamed assistant are shown inspecting Tutankhamun's inner-most coffin . Presenter Dallas Campbell, said: 'Trying to navigate through the intense speculation and politics that surround one of the most famous characters in history is both daunting and thrilling in equal measure. 'Foolhardy perhaps! But using solid science and a truly multi-disciplinary approach we’ve finally been able to put to bed some of the myths and pre-conceived ideas that have surrounded his life and death, and hopefully add a new chapter that will ensure the Tutankhamun story continues to fascinate.' Earlier this year, egyptologists from the American University in Cairo shed light on some of the bizarre burial rituals discovered in the tomb, including the fact the king’s penis was embalmed at a 90-degree angle – the only mummy to have ever been found with this feature. On the outside of the tomb, decorations depicted Tutankhamun as underworld god Osiris, while wall paintings (pictured) showed the king being embraced by the underworld god. It is believed that if Tutankhamun was shown to be this powerful god it would quash a religious revolution taking place in the 1320s BC . Earlier this year, egyptologists from the American University in Cairo shed light on some of the bizarre burial rituals discovered in the tomb, including the fact the king’s penis was embalmed at a 90-degree angle – the only mummy to have ever been found with this feature . Researchers from the American University in Cairo believe the king's appendage was embalmed at a 90-degree angle to make the young pharaoh appear as Osiris, the god of the underworld. The angling of the penis was a feature worn by 'corn-mummies', created in honour of Osiris. The mummy was also covered in black liquid to resemble Osiris' skin. Elsewhere, Tutankhamun's heart was missing when the tomb was discovered by Howard Carter in 1922. Religious texts claimed Osiris' heart was similarly removed by his brother Seth.On the outside of the tomb, decorations depicted Tutankhamun as Osiris. They claimed that this may have been carried out on purpose to make the king appear like Osiris, the god of the underworld, in an attempt to frighten religious revolutionaries. At the time of his death in 1323 BC, the father of the teenage Egyptian king was said to be leading a religious revolution in the country. It is believed Akhenaten wanted to destroy the belief in the Egyptian gods and instead worship a sun disc called the Aten. Tutanhkhamun was trying to tackle this revolution when he was believed to have broken his leg and died from an infection in the wound. DNA analysis in 2010 also found traces of malaria in his system. During mummification a decision was made to not only embalm the erect penis, but also to cover the king’s body in black liquid - similar in colour to the skin of Osiris - and remove his heart. These rituals, according to Professor Salima Ikram from the university, were done in order to make people think Tutankhamun was the underworld god.

Abandoned planes stand beside a terminal building scarred by shrapnel during the bitter conflict . The drone shows the crater-riddled fields around the battle-torn airport that has been held by both sides . Donetsk Airport has become a symbol of Ukraine's fight against separatists and the airport remains a scene of fierce fighting almost every day. There has been two major battles at the airport, in late May and September, and it has been in the control of both sides at various points during the bitter conflict. It is located on the northern edge of Donetsk, eastern Ukraine's biggest city and is locked between the Ukrainian and separatist-controlled zones. Renovated only a couple of years ago, ahead of the Euro 2012 football championships co-hosted by Ukraine and Poland, the airport is estimated to have cost almost £500m. But now the airport that welcomed travelling football fans from across the globe has been reduced to a heap of twisted metal, and its runway is filled with burnt-out tanks and abandoned airliners. The main terminal building and the control tower lie in ruins as a result of fighting early last month.

"It is a time-honored tradition - but Sasha and Malia would rather have been anywhere else than having to watch their dad crack lame jokes as he pardoned the National Thanksgiving Turkey. Shuffling awkwardly and rolling their eyes like any teenage girls would while their father laughed at his own - mildly controversial funnies- Malia and Sasha made no attempt to appear anything other than bored stiff. Indeed, after President Obama had pardoned four-month-old, 49-pound Cheese, he asked Malia if she wanted to pet the turkey. 'Nah', she replied without even smiling, summing up her and her sister's amusing indifference to the bizarre annual ceremony. Cracking asides about his recent hotly contested executive action on immigration, Obama's shtick left his daughters rigid and disinterested, despite the press corp laughing heartily at the president's jokes. No doubt the girls have heard it all before from their dad but as he relished in his solemn authority to 'spare the lives of two turkeys, Mac and Cheese', both their eyes veered from staring at the floor in embarrassment to barely concealed yawns. Obviously, like all dads, the president appeared oblivious, smiling and beaming throughout the ritual as he condemned the other turkey, Mac to its sad fate. 'Let’s face it, if you’re a turkey and you’re named after a side dish, your chances of escaping Thanksgiving dinner are pretty low!' said Obama. Scroll down for video . Could we BE anymore bored?

However, the two teenage girls appeared particularly underwhelmed by the affair . Is he finished? The girls appear to smile during the ceremony which took place at the White House today . Cheese - who will be rehomed at a country estate in Virginia instead of being eaten for dinner - was described as a 'grand champion' weighing 49lbs. His alluring gobble was defined as 'loud' and 'romantic' with a 'country ring.' This year the White House asked Twitter users to help decide which bird should receive the official pardon. Cheese was vying against his buddy, Mac. But his larger size and head-turning squawk saw him claim victory. Although only one bird was pardoned, both will be saved from the roasting tray and rehomed at Morven Park, the former home of a Virginia governor. Obama joked that he had spared Mac and Cheese 'from a terrible and delicious fate.' U.S. presidents have been pardoning turkeys since the 1800s as part of the country's national Thanksgiving holiday. The vote was extended to the public in 2012. Continuing a family tradition, Gary Cooper, the chairman of the National Turkey Federation, is responsible for raising the presidential turkey flock each year.

His brother previously raised one for the Clintons in 1996. This time around Cooper began raising 66 birds at his farm in Oakwood, Ohio, in July with his son Cole. The father-son team then selected two of their finest specimens - based on  coloring, size and temperament - and drove them to Washington D.C.this week.

"Would-be jihadi fighters are booking tickets on cruise ships to join extremists in battle zones in Syria and Iraq. The new tactic has been deployed by jihadists hoping to bypass the stepped-up efforts to thwart them in neighbouring Turkey. According to Interpol officials, the phenomenon is relatively new and has been used by would-be fighters in the last three months. Would-be jihadi fighters are travelling on cruise ships to try and join extremist groups in Syria and Iraq . Turkey, with its long and often porous border with Syria, has been a major thoroughfare for many of the thousands of foreign fighters seeking to join extremists like ISIS, which has captured territory across Iraq and Syria. Turkish authorities say they have set up teams to capture suspected foreign fighters in airports and bus stations, and have deported hundreds in recent months. As such, would-be jihadists have made alternative travel arrangements to reach battle zones. Pierre St. Hilaire, director of counterterrorism at Interpol, said: 'Because they know the airports are monitored more closely now, there's a use of cruise ships to travel to those areas. 'There is evidence that the individuals, especially in Europe, are traveling mostly to Izmit and other places to engage in this type of activity,' he said, referring to a Turkish coastal town. 'Originally, our concern about people on cruise ships - dangerous people on cruise ships - really focused on the classic sort of rapist, burglar, or violent criminal. 'But as we've gathered data, we've realised that there are more and more reports that people are using cruise ships in order to get to launch pads, if you will - sort of closer to the conflict zones - of Syria and Iraq.' The outgoing Interpol chief called on countries to step up screening at all transportation hubs to halt the advance of extreme groups such as ISIS . Cruise ships, which often make repeated stops, offer an added benefit by allowing would-be jihadis to hop off undetected at any number of ports - making efforts to track them more difficult. Mr St. Hilaire said it wasn't exactly clear yet how many would-be foreign fighters were travelling by cruise ship to reach Syria. He added that some people have driven all the way from their homes in Europe to the Syrian border to avoid passing through airports. He was quick to caution that Europe is by no means the only or even the main source of foreign fighters for Syria. 'It's a global threat - 15,000 fighters or more from 81 countries traveling to one specific conflict zone,' he said, noting that that there are some 300 from China alone. 'In order to prevent their travel and identify them, there needs to be greater information-sharing among the region, among national security agencies.' Speaking in Monaco, where Interpol is holding its general assembly this week, outgoing chief Ronald Noble confirmed that Turkey was a destination, but declined to identify any others. He also refused to indicate how many people might be involved, but called on countries to step up screening at all transportation hubs - 'airports and, more and more, cruise lines.' This is one of the reasons why the international police body is preparing to expand a pilot programme known as I-Checkit, where airlines share passenger information off Interpol's databases - in the hope that one day the system could expand to include cruise operators, banks, hotels and other private-sector partners. Many European governments have expressed concern that home-grown jihadis who self-radicalise online and then travel to Syria will return home with skills to carry out terror attacks. Frenchman Mehdi Nemmouche, who allegedly spent a year in Syria and fought with Islamic State, is the chief suspect in a May attack on the Jewish Museum of Brussels that killed four people.","Jihadists hoping to bypass efforts to thwart them in neighbouring Turkey .

"An Egyptian sarcophagus that once held the mummified body of a woman 3,000 years ago has been found on display in a pensioner's living room. Auctioneers discovered the wooden artefact during a routine valuation of items in the house in Essex owned by a woman who had recently moved into a nursing home. But they did not expect to come across the 6ft tall sarcophagus, which has carved hieroglyphics inside. It is thought to have once housed a noblewoman and to have been placed in an Egyptian burial chamber in 1,000 BC. The 3,000 year old sarcophagus was found during a routine search to value items at a pensioner's Essex home . Mark Stacey, the expert from Reeman Dansie auctioneers in Colchester, Essex, who discovered the sarcophagus said: 'The hairs went up on the back of my neck when I walked into the drawing room. It stood out like a sore thumb. 'It was stood up against a wall and was being used as a decorative item. It's the sort of thing you would expect to see in the home of the Addams Family. 'It is certainly the oldest item I have been asked to look at in my career and probably one of the most exciting. 'It would have been used as a coffin for a mummified woman and placed in something like a burial chamber. The face of the coffin has been carved out of the wood, covered in plaster and painted to show the features . 'She would have been a noble person but nothing like a pharaoh.' The once colourful exterior of the coffin is faded but there are clear facial features that have been carved out of the wood. Experts believe the face was then covered in a type of plaster and painted. It is believed to have been given to the woman, who has not been identified, about 60 years ago and is likely to have been purchased by a museum that closed down. Gina Vince (left) is a cataloguer at Reeman Dansie Auction House that will sell the ancient sarcophagus (right) The coffin, believed to have held an Ancient Egyptian noblewoman, was found standing against a wall . The find comes as an ancient 2,300-year-old Egyptian coffin sold for £12,000 last month after it was found in a house in Bradwell-on-sea in Essex. It was sold despite Egyptian officials tried to block the sale suggesting it had been illegally removed from Egypt. The event which started the collection of Egyptian artefacts in Britain was the invasion of Egypt by the French in 1798, led by Napoleon. After Napoleon was defeated in 1801 Egyptian artefacts collected in Cairo were confiscated by the British army. They were brought back to Britain and presented to the British museum. Among the spoils were a huge breccia royal sarcophagus, which belonged to King Nectanebo II of the Thirtieth Dynasty. The most important artefact was the Rosetta Stone, inscribed with three bands of text, written in different scripts, hieroglyphic, demotic and Greek. It was once thought to be the key to deciphering Ancient Egyptian texts. The Rosetta Stone at the British Museum . After the defeat of the French, Turkish Mohammed Ali Pasha became the ruler of the land and opened it up to diplomats, businessmen and tourists - leading to a huge scramble for Egyptian artefacts. The coffin also had a painted face and hieroglyphics and was found standing upright in a room only accessible through a hole an outside wall. The latest sarcophagus was among a number of Egyptian things in the house, but was the oldest one found by auctioneers. Little is known about its history but it is thought the coffin was brought over from Egypt following the Napoleonic wars of the early 19th century. James Grinter, managing director of Reeman Dansie, said: 'In the 19th Century it was very common for people to collect ancient Egyptian objects. The fascination began after Napoleon invaded Egypt around 1800. 'British people were inspired and many items ended up being brought back. People used to have parties where they would unwrap mummies for entertainment. 'The mummy that was once inside this coffin is long gone but the coffin itself has survived. Somehow it found its way into a museum. He added: 'We often come across small ancient Egyptian items but coffins are extremely rare to find in private hands - we weren't expecting it at all. 'It's quite an eerie thing but absolutely stunning - it takes your breath away. The sarcophagus is tipped to sell for £6,000 at the auction being held on November 24.","Experts stumbled across 6ft tall sarcophagus during routine valuation .

"A British couple are taking legal action against a hotel in the popular Sharm el Sheikh resort in Egypt, after they were left severely ill during their stay. Ann Smith, from Chapeltown in Sheffield, claims she fell sick with serious gastric problems  at the Jaz Mirabel Beach resort in June. She said her husband - who didn't want to be named - was so poorly that he had to be admitted to hospital when he returned home, where it was discovered he had contracted Salmonella. Not so idyllic: Ann Smith claims she fell sick with gastric problems at the Jaz Mirabel Beach resort in June . Lawyers have now stepped in to investigate the cause of their sickness at the resort. Ms Smith, a 54-year-old nurse, who booked the holiday with tour operator Thomson, said: 'The illness really knocked us for six and we suffered Diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pains. 'It was awful and we were both so lethargic, which meant we just couldn't enjoy the rest of the holiday. 'As the break went on, we noticed how on occasions some food appeared to be left out for long periods of time, and we saw what looked like new food being added to trays with existing food. Casing point: Lawyers have now stepped in to investigate the cause of their sickness at the resort . Ill: Ms Smith and her husband say they were both signed off work for several weeks following their ordeal . 'We also saw the same utensils being used to handle different foods and we sometimes saw birds in and around the restaurant area at the beach bar. 'I visited the resort's clinic for treatment, but both my husband and I needed to see our GP when we got home - he even had to spend a few days in hospital where it was confirmed he had contracted Salmonella.' The couple were both signed off work for several weeks following their ordeal. Ann added: 'Being a nurse, there was simply no way I could have gone into work considering what we had been through. Nightmare: Ms Smith's husband was so poorly that he had to be admitted to hospital when he returned home . 'This was supposed to be a relaxing break but just ended being an absolute nightmare. 'You simply do not expect to fall ill when you go on holiday. 'We have instructed Irwin Mitchell to investigate the cause of our illness and to help us get the answers we want about what caused us both to be so ill.' Expert illness lawyers from Irwin Mitchell have started investigating what happened. Clare Comiskey, from the firm's international personal injury team, said: 'The first-hand accounts we have heard have raised a number of concerns and also highlight the significant impact that illness of this nature can have on victims – in some cases leading them to develop long-term symptoms which can cause disruption to their work and personal life. Picturesque: The Jaz Mirabel Beach hotel is situated in the popular Sharm el Sheikh in Egypt . The couple claim they fell ill while staying at the Jaz Mirabel Beach hotel in Egypt . 'We have successfully represented many British holidaymakers with claims for damages for illness following stays at the Jaz Mirabel Beach hotel over recent years.

"Nearly a century before the first high-rise made its mark on Hong Kong's skyline, a Scottish photographer took these amazing photos of the Far East city. John Thomson, from Edinburgh, was one of the first Western photographers to travel to the region, documenting the people, landscapes and artefacts of eastern cultures in the 1860s. An album of his incredible pictures, which he took around 150 years ago, sold at auction today for nearly £50,000. An album of photographs of Hong Kong taken in the 1860s, which show the country's famous waterfront before dozens of high-rises were built, has sold for nearly £50,000 . Modern Hong Kong: The now-booming financial hub looks like another world compared to how it appeared in the 1860s . A picture of the Happy Valley race course was part of the 38-image set, taken by Scottish photographer John Thomson, which sold at Christie's in London today . Mr Thomson gave the album to William Thomas Mercer, who had retired as Hong Kong's Colonial Secretary, and the photographs have been passed down through his family since . The pioneering photographer presented the album to fellow Scot William Thomas Mercer, of Gorthie, Perth, who had retired from his position as Hong Kong's Colonial Secretary, in 1868. Among the 38 prints are images of the Happy Valley race course, Victoria Peak, street and garden views, Chinese shop fronts, villagers and the famous dragon procession as well as portraits of Mr Mercer's pony, named Tommy. The album, which has been passed through Mr Mercer's family, went under the hammer at Christie's in London, where it was snapped up by an anonymous bidder for £47,500. Nick Lambourn, head of topographical pictures at Christie's, said: 'John Thomson was the most important pioneer photographer in Asia, and is celebrated in Hong Kong. 'This rare presentation album was a gift to commemorate the end of Mercer's service in Hong Kong. 'Thomson has captured some of the first pictures of these landscapes and people, and a glimpse of a Hong Kong mostly unseen by modern visitors - a long gone world.' The incredible photo album sold for £47,500 today after spending nearly 150 years in the Mercer family . The pictures give a rare insight into what life in Hong Kong was like before it became a global financial hub . The album was sold alongside a scrapbook (pictured), which shows Mr Mercer (right, standing next to his wife), who was Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong from 1854 to 1868 . Mr Mercer travelled to Hong Kong in the 1840s before working his way up to the position of Administrator of the colony . He added: 'Thomson is important internationally in the history of photography. He was among the first to travel to the Far East when he went to Singapore, then Penang (in Malaysia) and Hong Kong. 'Around the same time, his fellow Scot Mercer retired as colonial secretary. An album was the perfect souvenir.' The Thomson album, accompanied by Mr Mercer's family scrapbook, was one of two sold at Christie's by descendants of the family. Another, including early photographs of India, where both Mr Mercer's father George Dempster Mercer and younger brother Charles McWhirter Mercer served, fetched £6,875. Hong Kong was occupied by the British Empire in 1841, during the First Opium War between the Brits and the Chinese. After the Chinese lost the war, Hong Kong was handed over as part of the Treaty of Nanking - officially making it a British colony. The end of the Opium War allowed Hong Kong to blossom as a port for the rest of the world to trade with China. Opium dealers and merchants would travel from Europe and the Americas to do business with liberalised Chinese traders. There were only around 8,000 people on Hong Kong island at this point, but within 25 years this had surged to 125,000 as thousands fled a bloody civil war in China. Further treaties throughout the 19th century saw hundreds of nearby islands and inland territory ceded to the British Empire, including the 1898 convention which gave Britain rule over Hong Kong until 1997. It also included early views of Penang and Singapore also by John Thomson, who had established his first studios in the east in Penang in 1862, and Singapore in 1863. Hong Kong had been captured from the Chinese by the British earlier in the 1800s and had established itself as a crucial trading station for British colonial and commercial interests in east Asia. The period in the 19th century saw Hong Kong and its population grow considerably, and Scots were quick to realise the commercial and social opportunities to be had. While Thomson, the son of an Edinburgh tobacco spinner, went on to become a portrait photographer in London. The Mercers were distinguished by their service in British colonial history in the 18th and 19th centuries. Members of the family were prominent in military campaigns, civil administration and commerce in the Americas, Australia, India and the Far East. Mr Mercer arrived in Hong Kong in 1844 as private secretary to his uncle, Sir John Davis, the second governor of Hong Kong (1844-48), and was Colonial Treasurer from 1845-48, Colonial Secretary 1854-68 and Administrator 1865-66. Mr Lambourn added: 'The Mercer family were emblematic of the Scots who built the Empire. Several members were very distinguished characters in the history of the colonies and Empire. 'They were in Asia, south-east Asia and India. Other members of the family were in Australia in the very early days, and negotiating land purchases in Tasmania. 'While another, Colonel James Mercer, was commander of the British forces at Oswego in the French and Indian Wars in America during the 1750s, and was killed by the French defending that fort. 'These albums give a glimpse in to their activities.'","An album of photographs of Hong Kong in the 1860s has sold at auction .

Obama also wrote the U.S. is 'already providing significant humanitarian efforts' and is ready to further assist the Philippine government.

President Barack Obama, seen here on November 8, said 'I know the incredible resiliency of the Philippine people, and I am confident that the spirit of Bayanihan will see you through this tragedy' To aid in the recovery effort, a team of approximately 90 U.S. Marines and sailors headed to the Philippines on Sunday. They were part of the first wave of promised U.S. military assistance. The order was made this weekend by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. Hagel ordered U.S. military's Pacific Command to assist with search and rescue operations and provide air support in the wake of super typhoon Haiyan. One of the most powerful storms ever recorded, Haiyan was a maximum category-five storm with ground winds of up to 235mph. Authorities say the death toll could be 10,000 in the city of Tacloban, Leyte alone and  approximately four million people are said to have been affected, according to the the country's national disaster agency.

In December 2012 U.S. Marines and Philippine Army personnel work together to unload relief goods to be transported to regions affected by Typhoon Bopha from the Marine Corps KC-130J Hercules millitary aircraft inside the International Airport in Davao, Mindanao. Typhoon Haiyan is estimated to have killed at least 10,000 people in the central Philippines. Most of the deaths appear to have been caused by surging sea water strewn with debris that many said resembled a tsunami, leveling houses and drowning its victims. The typhoon is the 30th to hit China this year. As well as the massive numbers feared dead in Tacloban, there are concerns hundreds more have been killed in remote coastal areas.The typhoon is now making its way towards Vietnam and mainland China - with locals bracing themselves for the deadly storm.

The deadliest riot in Egypt football history came during a 2012 match when Port Said's Al-Masry team hosted Cairo's Al-Ahly. That riot - at the time the deadliest worldwide since 1996 - killed 74 people, mostly Al-Ahly fans. The Zamalek supporters claimed on their Facebook page they were tear gassed as they scrambled to get in . Zamalek fans said the only gate opened for them was a tiny metal fence surrounded by barbed wire . Two police officers later received 15-year prison sentences for gross negligence and failure to stop the Port Said killings, a rare incident of security officials being held responsible for deaths in the country. Seven other officers were acquitted, angering soccer fans who wanted more police officers to be held accountable for the incident and other episodes of violence. In response, angry fans burned down the headquarters of Egypt's Football Association later that year, protesting its decision to resume matches before bringing those behind that 2012 riot to justice. The clashes broke out after police tried to stop fans entering the stadium which they had capped at 10,000 .

"The radicals of ISIS fighting in Syria and Iraq are believed to be profiting from shipments of Red Bull energy drinks from Turkey. Truck loads of the Austrian-produced brew beloved of teenage clubbers are shipped daily across the border from Turkey into Syria. ISIS commanders may be making a profit on the trades, according to data published in Ankara last week that shows firms based in NATO member Turkey are shipping billions of dollars worth of goods into the war zone. ISIS militants (right) in Syria are believed to be profiting from shipments of Red Bull, the energy drink. A Turkish haulage company claims to ship five truckloads a day into the warzone. File pictures . ISIS militants control many border crossing points between the two countries. State control by the Damascus government is now non-existent is and transporters pay tolls and fees to whoever controls the crossing. While Turkey imposed sanctions on Assad three years ago, the cross-border trade is legal and shows up in Turkish customs data, reports Bloomberg. More than £163million in goods this year crossed via the the Turkish border towns of Cilvegozu and Oncupinar, the figures show. They are close to towns which are controlled by the Islamic Front, a coalition of militants fighting both the Assad regime and ISIS. Meanwhile, £201million in goods crossed into Syria from nearby Gaziantep. Cement, vegetable oil, bulgur wheat, flour, salt and tinned fruit are popular goods, as is Red Bull. 'Every day we have four or five trucks carrying Red Bulls to Syria,'  Mustafa Yilmaz, owner of Turkish trucking company Cem-Ay Transport told Bloomberg. He added that buyers on the Syrian side don’t identify themselves to the transporters. A man holds up a knife as he rides on the back of a motorcycle touring the streets of Tabqa city with others in celebration after Islamic State militants took over Tabqa air base, in nearby Raqqa cit, Syria . In September alone the Red Bull consignments made up, along with the other goods, trade with Syria worth an estimated £800million. America and European NATO allies of Turkey are putting increasing pressure on the Ankara government to do more to squeeze the financial arteries of ISIS but so far the Turkish state has done little except allow in some Kurdish fighters into the besieged border town of Kobane. There is evidence to suggest ISIS fighters take speed to heighten their combat skills and stave off exhaustion, while the drug khat is used by jihadists in Yemen and Somalia.","A Turkish haulage company claims to ship five truckloads a day to Syria .

"An expensive family holiday to Egypt turned into a ‘nightmare’ for a father when he was falsely accused of stealing his own sunglasses. Thomas Greenhalgh, 33, was lounging by the pool at a four-star hotel in popular resort Sharm el Sheikh when a fellow guest accused him of theft. The call centre worker initially treated the accusation as a joke because the glasses were £3 Ralph Lauren fakes which he had bought on a previous holiday. Wrongly accused: Thomas Greenhalgh was jailed for two nights for stealing sunglasses in Sharm El Sheikh . The 33-year-old from Lundwood was detained for stealing sunglasses that were in fact his own . However, the situation soon spiralled out of control as Mr Greenhalgh’s passport was seized, he was taken to court and then locked up in prison for two days and two nights. The family man from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, endured ‘awful’ conditions with 30 other inmates in a cockroach-infested cell which had no beds or windows. Mr Greenhalgh said: ‘It was a complete nightmare. ‘I was really scared. I thought that was it, I thought I was never going to see my family again.’ His wife Lyndsey, 28, was left bewildered on her own with their children Skye, five, and Summer, 18 months. The false accusation could have been resolved quickly because the Egyptian man who claimed his sunglasses had been stolen returned home to Cairo and found them. However, police believed he had been bribed by Mrs Greenhalgh and wouldn’t take his word for it unless he returned to give a personal statement. Mr Greenhalgh with his partner Lyndsey, wearing the sunglasses he was accused of stealing . Mrs Greenhalgh was forced to find £2,000 in cash to hire an English-speaking lawyer and Mr Greenhalgh was brought back to court. Photographs taken on his mobile phone of him previously wearing the sunglasses were then presented and he was freed. The couple, who paid £5,000 for the holiday, had to rely on their family to buy new plane tickets as the drama meant they missed their scheduled one home and the extra cost came to £1,500. Mr Greenhalgh said the guest who accused him seemed to initially accept his denial by the pool at Aqua Blu Hotel but three days later police arrived to arrest him. He said: ‘I thought it was a joke and actually started laughing. I was taken to the police station where no one spoke English. He was on holiday with his partner Lyndsey, 28, and their children Summer, 18 months, and Skye, five . Mr Greenhalgh was released when his partner Lyndsey secured the services of an English-speaking lawyer . ‘I didn’t know what they were saying and there were no English reps with me. The police officers were nasty. It was horrible. I didn’t get a phone call or access to an English lawyer.’ Once in jail, his ordeal worsened. The cell’s toilet was ‘a hole in the wall’. ‘I was terrified because as soon as I walked in a man asked if I was American, and made me promise I wasn’t, or he would cut me from head to toe,’ he said. Mr Greenhalgh was threatened, sexually propositioned by inmates and forced to crawl on his knees past prison officers. The holidaymaker said he knew he was in trouble when police seized his passport . He credited his wife’s determination for getting him out. The family’s lawyer said he was set free only ‘because he looked like a good man who had children’. Mr Greenhalgh, who returned home ten days ago, said: ‘I was just so relieved to get home. I’m never going back there again.’ Mrs Greenhalgh, also a call centre worker, described the experience as ‘the worst holiday of her life’. She said: ‘I don’t know how we got through it. I didn’t eat, I didn’t sleep. I was scared of what was going to happen to Tommy.’ A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the arrest of a British national and consular assistance was provided.’ The call-centre worker holding his 18-month-old daughter summer, feared he'd never see his family again .","Thomas Greenhalgh was arrested and jailed for two nights in Egypt .

"Morgan Schneiderlin has claimed that he is happy at Southampton 'for now', but refused to commit his future to Southampton amid a summer of transfer speculation. The Frenchman scored twice for the Saints as they beat West Ham 3-1 at Upton Park on Saturday, and when asked about his future after the game, Schneiderlin said he was focused on Southampton. 'It was a long summer, but now I'm focused on my team. For now, it is Southampton. I will keep playing and doing my best,' he told BBC Sport. Scroll down for videos... Brace: Morgan Schneiderlin netted twice for Southampton as they beat West Ham 3-1 at Upton Park . Happy: Despite a summer of unrest, the Frenchman claims he is conent at St. Mary's...for now . Form: The midfielder has started the season well, and is pictured scoring the first of his two goals on Saturday . This summer has seen an exodus at St. Mary's, with Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Luke Shaw, Calum Chambers and Dejan Lovren all leaving the club for pastures new. Schneiderlin himself had been linked with a move away, but the club insisted that he was not for sale. Upon hearing this news in July, Schneiderlin remarked on Twitter: '6 years of an amazing journey #saintsfc DESTROYED in one hour!' When pressed on this summer's speculation, the midfielder was quick to admit that it has been a difficult few months. 'I'm not going to hide the fact that it has been a long summer with a lot of speculation and a lot of thinking on my side to know if I have to make a big step.' 'The club showed that they wanted to keep me. I always had respect for the fans and club. I always give my best and I was just thinking about my future. 'Today it is clear and I just have to concentrate on my football now.' Outplayed: Despite links to Spurs and Arsenal, Schneiderlin helped Southampton to their first win this weekend . It was widely reported in July that Tottenham were interested in the 24-year-old's services, a move that would have seen the Saints midfielder link up with former boss Mauricio Pochettino at White Hart Lane.

"Angel di Maria's imminent £59.7million deal to join Manchester United will help improve Juan Mata, according to Gary Neville. The former Red Devils defender believes that the signing of Di Maria will help get the best out of Mata, with the Argentine's movement off-the-ball proving beneficial to the playmaker. It's been a sluggish start for Mata and United this season but Neville believes the addition of Di Maria will help the Spaniard flourish in new boss Louis van Gaal's 3-5-2 formation. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Angel di Maria's career highlights . Welcome addition: Angel di Maria will help Juan Mata improve at Manchester United says Gary Neville . Dynamic: Neville believes Di Maria's pace and movement will help get the best out of Mata . Sluggish: Mata (right) and Manchester United have gained just one point from a possible six so far this term . 'I think that he (Di Maria) will improve Juan Mata,' he told Sky Sports show Monday Night Football. 'Mata relies on people running past him. He manipulates the ball, shifts it from side to side but then he relies upon the runs and the fact that United are playing without great pace in the team at the moment isn't helping him at all. 'His goal record from central positions has been good. He's scored seven goals in 10 central appearances. That's a good reward. Hotly-anticipated: Di Maria (left) is set to join United in a £59.7million deal . 'He isn't any good out wide, that's why he left Chelsea, he had assurances that he was going to play in central areas, that's part of the reason why Louis van Gaal is playing the system that he's playing - to get Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata in the team. We'll now see how he integrates Di Maria into the team. 'Don't worry about the fact that you have too many important players that you might not be able to fit in. You'll need them in a season of 40-050 games.' Despite the deal to bring Di Maria to Old Trafford, Neville believes United need to strengthen in other areas if they are to improve on last season's disappointing seventh place finish. Club legend: Neville enjoyed a trophy-laden spell at Manchester United as a player . The deposed Premier League champions are depleted in defence and midfield at present, and Neville has cited these two areas as must for the club to improve on before the transfer window closes on September 1. 'United need a central midfield player - a robust central midfield player - and they also need a centre back of real stature,' he added. Ajax utility player Daley Blind, AC Milan's Nigel de Jong and Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal are among those linked with the club before the window expires.

"Fernando Torres has ended three-and-a-half disappointing years at Chelsea by agreeing a move to AC Milan.

After a difficult start at the Bridge following his move from Liverpool, Torres' form never really picked up for Chelsea. He managed just 45 goals in 172 appearances - equating to a staggering £1.1million per strike. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho was keen to offload Torres before the transfer window closes on Monday in order to bring in an alternative forward - with Loic Remy now close to completing a move from West London rivals Queens Park Rangers.

Hours before student leaders and officials were due to meet, embattled chief executive Leung Chun-ying said free elections were impossible.

"The 25-year-old man who sparked an Australian medical marijuana legalisation crusade has lost his battle with cancer. Daniel Haslam passed away on Tuesday, after suffering from an aggressive form of bowel cancer for over four years. He was surrounded by his family and friends in Tamworth, regional New South Wales. After the impact of his powerful national campaign to legalise medical marijuana, Daniel's mother Lucy has vowed she will continue carry on with his bid to legalise medical marijuana in Australia. Scroll down for video . Lucy Haslam said her son Daniel, who lost his battle to cancer on Monday, he has left a legacy for the medical marijuana legalisation cause . Daniel Haslam suffered from an aggressive bowl cancer for over four years, durinh which he was an advocate of using medicinal cannabis to relieve  the side effects of chemotherapy . The 'Dans Story' campaign led to the New South Wales Government decriminalising small amounts of medical cannabis for cancer patients . The 'Dans Story' campaign led to the New South Wales Government decriminalising small amounts of medical cannabis for cancer patients. Mrs Haslam, a retired nurse who is also a fervent medical marijuana activist, told Daily Mail Australia about Daniel’s final days. ‘He kept fighting until the end, but it was extremely tough. His final days were spent in sheer exhaustion.’ ‘I will continue working with NSW premier Mike Baird and will diligently work in the cross party parliamentary drug law reform group in Canberra.’ Mrs Haslam revealed to Daily Mail Australia she is also working with a prominent Australian journalist on a documentary on Dan’s plight called ‘A Life of its Own’. The project hopes to ‘educate and dispel the many myths surrounding medicinal cannabis.’ Lucy said Daniel was inspiring in his final days and didn't stop fighting until the end . The Haslam family are overwhelmed with the support they have been shown on an international scale . Mrs Harlamhas vowed to continue fighting for legalising medicinal marijuana for those who need it . She said the Haslam family are overwhelmed with the support they have been shown on an international scale. ‘He wasn’t seeking attention or glory, just the truth. Because of this Dan’s story touched thousands of people.’ She urged anyone who could benefit from medical cannabis to speak up and join the cause. ‘Tell your doctors and politicians this is just a medicine. They need to open their eyes to the truth and enable what is an accepted form of treatment throughout the developed world to be available to sick Australian’s,’ she said. Daniel had battled cancer for over four years, and found the effects of chemotherapy were devastating. Cannabis had provided solace for Daniel, unlike others such as antiemetic drugs which are supposed to relieve him from nausea and vomiting induced by cancer treatment. 'As parents of three sons, Lou and I have always been opposed to recreational drug use,' Mrs Harlam said in a parliamentary speech in June. A documentary on Dan's life is under production which hopes to ‘educate and dispel the many myths surrounding medicinal cannabis’ One of Australia's largest nursing unions has taken the significant and potentially controversial step of supporting the use and possession of medical cannabis . 'I resent that in a country where we can provide heroin injecting rooms and needle exchanges, where our government collects taxes from cancer causing tobacco and the biggest killer of all, alcohol, we are forced into criminality because our son is unlucky enough to be one of the thousands who has, through no fault of his own, contracted a life threatening disease,' she said. Mrs Harlam had previously gained support from the NSW Nurses and Midwives' Association.The union, which has 59,000 members, collectively agreed that the drug could benefit patients suffering from constant chronic pain. In September the NSW government announced their support for a medical marijuana trial. Premier Mike Baird also declared his personal approval in parliament, and said he was moved by the story of Haslam. 'Why not take a stance to say to the rest of the country, this matters. It's time we did something about it,' Mr Baird said inparliament. 'So I say at the same time, we want to give the terminally ill and those around them, their carers, their family, greater peace of mind.' In December, Mr Baird announced $9 million would be spent on  three trials of cannabis-derived medicines to test the benefits on patients suffering a range of debilitating illnesses. He said hundreds of patients are set to take part in the trials.","Daniel Haslam passed away with his family and friends on Tuesday .

"David Cameron has told fellow Nato leaders not to pay ransoms for hostages as it only increases kidnappings and funds further terrorism. The Prime Minister used the military alliance's two-day summit in Wales to hit out at countries who hand over multi-million pound sums to Islamist jihadis. His warning came as a Syrian translator for the charity employing British hostage David Haines described the moment when ISIS fighters sprang from two cars to kidnap the Briton last year. Scroll down for video . Speaking at the Nato summit in Wales, David Cameron today hit out at countries who pay multi-million pound ransoms to Islamic militants, insisting the payments only fund more terror . The UK has a policy of not paying ransoms to terrorists, but France and Italy are believed to have handed over large amounts to the groups for the release of their nationals . Mr Cameron used an address at the lavish official dinner in Cardiff Castle to remind fellow leaders of commitments signed up to at last year's G8 summit not to pay ransoms to terror groups. While the UK Government has always said it will not pay ransoms for British nationals, hostages from other countries - such as France and Italy - have been released after large sums were reportedly paid out. Speaking ahead of the dinner, Mr Cameron described such payments as 'deeply regrettable' and warned: 'It is utterly self-defeating. It is worse than self-defeating, it is actually a risk to us back at home. 'All those people who signed these declarations know that what matters is not your signature on a declaration but not letting money be paid to terrorist kidnappers because that money goes into arms, it goes into weapons, it goes into terror plots, it goes into more kidnaps.' His comments came as an eyewitness told how British aid worker David Haines - and Italian colleague Federico Motka, who was released in May - were kidnapped by 'professional' gunmen who targeted his vehicle to take Western hostages. The unnamed translator said his group were driving back to Turkey via Aleppo from the nearby Atmeh refugee camp when the gunmen appeared. Nato leaders gathered in Cardiff as the West faces increased threats from Islamist militants in the Middle East . The man told the Independent: 'Two very fast cars came up behind – one overtook and the other stayed behind. They shouted at us to get out of the car in formal Arabic. They were wearing black masks and were so professional. 'They knew that two of us were Syrians and they knew who else was in the car. One of them put a gun to my head and threatened me not to tell anyone what I had seen. 'They put [Mr Haines and Mr Motka] in the boot of their car and shot out the tyres of our car.' The translator said the kidnapping took place 'in seconds' and the gunmen included at least one foreigner who appeared to be of African origin. Aid worker David Haines, pictured with his second child, who is now four, is being held by ISIS militants, who have already killed two US journalists . He added: 'No-one thought that would happen so close to the border. All of us were just looking forward to getting back to Turkey.' The translator praised Mr Haines for his warmth and humanity towards the Syrian refugees. He said: 'I remember he was really worried for the people [in one camp] because they didn't have toilets. He stopped by every child though and made a joke with them. 'He was always smiling and listening to the refugees. Those three days, I was with the best guy in aid work.' The Prime Minister is to personally brief a member of the Haines family on the latest developments in a case that has caused outrage around the world. On Tuesday, the 44-year-old Briton was shown kneeling in the sand wearing an orange jumpsuit on a video of the beheading of a US hostage. Military commanders have been asked to draw up plans for a special forces rescue. The Prime Minister, who is coming under growing pressure to unleash a military response, said Britain would use 'everything we have in our armoury' to squeeze the terror group out of existence, and repeatedly refused to rule out joining the US in air strikes - even leaving the door open to attacking ISIS in Syria without the approval of President Bashar Assad. But he appeared to indicate that such action was not imminent, stressing that his immediate priority was offering support to legitimate regional forces already confronting ISIS on the ground, such as the Iraqi government in Baghdad and the Kurdish authorities in the north of the country. 'I think sometimes people think that there is no strategy unless it simply consists of air strikes,' said Mr Cameron. 'That is not the case. What it needs is a fully-formed strategy to squeeze this from every angle. That is what you are getting from this conference.' Government sources said that, in a one-to-one meeting with US president Barack Obama, the two leaders discussed 'broad strategy' for dealing with the terrorist threat, rather than specific action. Mr Cameron said ministers were now 'actively' considering whether to supply arms to the Kurdish peshmerga militias fighting ISIS in northern Iraq or to provide them with military training. A witness to the kidnapping of Mr Haines - pictured with his younger daugther - has told how 'professional' gunmen seized him in northern Syria last year . Mr Haines is now being held by ISIS militants, who released a film of him on his knees in an orange boiler suit earlier this week . Lieutenant General Sir Simon Mayall, the Government's senior defence adviser in the Middle East, has been in discussions with leaders of the Kurdish administration in Irbil about how best the UK could assist. So far Britain has supplied only non-lethal equipment - such as helmets and body armour - although RAF transport planes have flown in ammunition supplied from Albania for the Kurds' Soviet-era weaponry. Leader of the Commons William Hague has told MPs that ministers will seek Parliament's support for any British air strikes against Islamic extremists if 'there is time to do so', though he added that the Government is not proposing military action 'at the moment'. Asked whether the UK could join with the US in air strikes, Mr Cameron told ITV1's Good Morning Britain (GMB): 'I'm certainly not ruling anything out and I will always act in the British national interest.' He added: 'We need to show real resolve and determination, we need to use every power and everything in our armoury with our allies, with those on the ground, to make sure we do everything we can to squeeze this dreadful organisation out of existence.' He also stressed the urgent need for the establishment of an inclusive and stable government in Baghdad, which Iraqi prime minister-designate Haider Abadi has said he hopes to form by around September 11.","Cameron tells fellow leaders not to give huge sums to terror groups .

Thanking the media for . covering the event, the woman chastised reporters for showing 'strong . bias against supporters of Officer Wilson.' To . large cheers, the woman said that she believes it is this that has . 'intensified the destruction of Ferguson' and declared that Wilson's . supporters 'have no desire to engage with the negativity and hate which . has stopped....the pursuit of justice.'

Several . community activists walked side-by-side with police officers in uniform . as they walked down one of the main streets in Ferguson that had been . filled with armored vehicles and officers in riot gear less than a week . ago. By late Saturday night, just a few dozen peaceful protesters remained, with an even more sparse police presence along the three-block stretch of West Florissant Avenue that had been the site of the heaviest unrest. Unlike other nights, the street remained open to traffic. 'I think some of the frustration is . dying down because more information is coming out,' said Alana Ramey, . 25, a St. Louis resident who joined the afternoon march. 'I think there . is more action going on. People are being more organized and that is . helping.' The protesters included a dozen students and recent graduates of Harvard University who arrived in Ferguson after a 20-hour drive. The Harvard contingent chatted amicably with Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who commended their passion and encouraged them to remain civically active. 'When we go back to our communities, there's a Ferguson near us,' said the Rev. Willie Bodrick II, 26, of Roxbury, Massachusetts, a youth minister and recent graduate of Harvard Divinity School.

The student's family says they believe the hike was a hazing ritual. 'The boys were left out there without shoes and water to kind of find their way out,' Villa's aunt Maria Casteneda told KTLA. She said that her nephew was left in the forest with no shoes, very little water and no cell phone. His feet and back were blistered. 'How do you leave somebody out there without shoes in 100-degree weather?' asked one of Villa's distraught cousins.

"A mother poisoned herself and her two young daughters by drinking acid after falling out with her live-in mother and father-in-law, an inquest has heard. Heena Solanki, 34, was found dead in her bed alongside Jasmine, nine, and Prisha, four, by her widower at their home in Ruislip, west London, in April last year. The biochemist had forced her two girls to drink the toxic substance and had strangled them before taking the poison and strangling herself, West London Coroner's Court heard. Heena Solanki (centre), 34, was found dead in her bed alongside Jasmine (left), nine, and Prisha (right), four . Mrs Solanki, pictured, poisoned herself and her two young daughters by drinking acid after falling out with her live-in mother and father-in-law, an inquest has heard . The inquest was told how police and paramedics who went to the scene were forced back by the fumes from the substance, which  Mrs Solanki had taken from a locked cupboard at the school where she worked as a lab technician. None of her family attended the hearing but a statement was read out from her widower, Kalpesh Solanki, in which he spoke of his surprise at his wife's actions. 'Prior to her death I believed that Heena was happy and content,' he said. 'We lived a nice life with our two children, Jasmine and Prisha. 'The only thing that I was aware of that made her unhappy was that we lived with my parents. This issue got her down at times but it's the only issue I can think of.' He added that they had decided to move out but had not yet told his parents. The biochemist had forced her two girls to drink the toxic substance and had strangled them before taking the poison and strangling herself, West London Coroner's Court heard . Mrs Solanki's bereaved husband said that his wife had never seemed depressed despite the family arguments . Mr Solanki said his Indian-born wife had not shown signs of depression and had never talked of taking her own life. He added: 'There were obviously things she didn't talk to me about which I didn't know. I'm aware of that now.' But he added that there was 'no indication to me or anyone else that I'm aware of that Henna was so unhappy that this would be her solution'. The inquest heard from Mrs Solanki's friend, Branali Chambhare, who said she had confided in her that 'her father-in-law was a bit cranky and a bit problematic'. She added that she had cried about her problems with him on one occasion but did not think she was depressed. Mrs Chambhare said her friend had also clashed with her husband and his parents about their daughters' studies as 'she pressurised her children'. 'I think her in-laws and husband didn't like it at all,' she added. The scene outside the family home in Ruislip after the bodies of Mrs Solanki and her daughters were found . An investigating officer taking away objects from the house during the probe into the deaths . She said Mrs Solanki never spoke of being depressed or harming herself but used to say she wanted to go and live in India with her children. Detective Sergeant Simon Rogers, of the Metropolitan Police's homicide assessment team said officers were called on the evening of April 12 last year with initial reports that a third party might have been involved. 'Because of the chemicals that were present staff were overcome with fumes,' he added. Only firefighters wearing specialist breathing equipment were allowed on the scene, where medicine bottles with residual liquid were found on a bedside table along with a suicide note, the contents of which were not detailed in court. Post-mortem examinations found all three died of substance intoxication in association with ligature compression. Coroner Chinyere Inyama said paperwork had also been found in the boot of Mrs Solanki's car about chemicals. He concluded that Mrs Solanki took her own life while Jasmine and Prisha were both unlawfully killed. A statement from the girls' schools described Jasmine as a 'normal, healthy, happy child' while Prisha was said to be 'very happy', with no indications of any troubles at home for either. Asked to comment as she left the inquest, Mrs Chambhare said: 'They were a happy family and it's a sad thing.'","Heena Solanki found dead in bed alongside daughters Jasmine and Prisha .

"Joachim Low has been lying low in recent weeks. After the triumph of Rio de Janeiro, the Germany coach retreated to his home in the Black Forest. On Tuesday, he emerged, taking the trip north to Dusseldorf for his first public appearance since the victory parade in July. He emerged with a message. 'After the World Cup Final in Rio, our goal should be, and must be, the European Championship final in Paris,' Low declared. A statement of intent. While players such as Thomas Muller had teased the press in recent weeks, talking of how important it was not to lose motivation, Low was clear. His Germany side may have already won the biggest prize, but they are not done yet. VIDEO Scroll down for World Champions Germany entertain crowds with open training . All gold: Germany coach Joachim Low shows the World Cup to fans during a public training session . Mastermind: Joachim Low was the brains behind Germany's rise and World Cup triumph . At full stretch: Mario Goetze shoots to score for Germany against Argentina in the World Cup final . Glory boys: Germany celebrate winning the World Cup in Brazil earlier this summer . Wednesday night will see the side play their first game since the World Cup final, a twist of fate pitting them against the beaten finalists Argentina. It is already being billed as the first step on the road to Paris, and Low hopes that even the meaningless friendly can help his side 'reawaken the World Cup feeling', before they start their European Championship qualifying campaign against Scotland on Sunday. Nonetheless, it is a very different team which Low will now attempt to lead to glory in 2016. In Philipp Lahm, Miroslav Klose and Per Mertesacker, Germany have lost their captain, their finest goalscorer and a hugely experienced defender to retirement since the World Cup. If the World Cup title was the crowning of a golden generation, the next two years will be the foundation years for a new era. Low has selected Bastian Schweinsteiger as the captain to lead that new era. In many ways, the Bayern player is the obvious choice. As vice captain under Lahm, he was always an inspirational figure for the rest of the squad. During the World Cup, he took Kevin Grosskreutz under his wing, and his determined performance in the final is already the stuff of legend. Schweinsteiger is, however, already 30. It is highly likely he will retire after Euro 2016. He is also infamously injury prone, having only played one friendly for Germany in the last two years. His current knee injury even rules him out of the Argentina game, with Manuel Neuer taking over the armband. A long term replacement for Lahm, Schweinsteiger is not. Captain fantastic: Philipp Lahm celebrates winning the World Cup but has since retired . Prolific: Germany will have to replace the goals of Miroslav Klose who has retired from international football . Big loss: Per Mertesacker (centre) has also retired from playing for Germany since the World Cup . Rather, Low has chosen him to bridge a gap. Schweinsteiger's captaincy, along with the reshuffled 'team council' of Manuel Neuer, Thomas Muller, Sami Khedira and Mats Hummels, will ensure that this Germany side is still led by experienced players. The coach articulated this policy very openly on Tuesday, saying that Germany's famous team spirit relied on a sense of hierarchy, where experienced players lead, allowing Low himself the freedom to bring in young talents. Some of those young talents will appear in the squad for the first time on Wednesday night. Defenders Antonio Rudiger and Sebastian Rudy have been drafted in, while other young players such as Erik Durm, Matthias Ginter and Christoph Kramer now appear to be established members of the squad, having warmed the bench at the World Cup. Stepping up: Bastian Schweinsteiger will now captain Germany after Philipp's Lahm's retirement . Kicking on: Joachim Low shows his ball skills off during a break in training on Tuesday . Young guns (from left): Goetze, Gomez, Reus, Kroos, Schuerrle and Mueller will spearhead Germany now . Motivated: Joachim Low (centre) wants his team to reach the European Championship final in 2016 . Talking tactics: Joachim Low conveys his message to young star Erik Durm during training . Moving forward: The next two years will be a fresh era for World Cup winners Germany . All smiles: Arsenal striker Lukas Podolski was in high spirits during a training session on Tuesday . This week will also see the return of Marco Reus and Mario Gomez to international football. Reus missed the World Cup through injury, while Gomez was left out of the squad by Low. With Klose gone, however, the latter is hugely important once more, not only as Germany's only out and out striker, but also as another injection of experience. Gomez's selection also indicates that little about Low's tactical philosophy will change. The Fiorentina player replaces Klose, and will be used as a poacher when Low's more flexible, strikerless attacking system is being thwarted. Gomez is another who is unlikely to last more than two more years, and may soon be sacrificed in favour of a younger striker such as Hoffenheim's Kevin Volland. Brains trust: Keeper Manuel Neuer will be part of a senior group of players expected to help lead Germany . Back in action: Marco Reus will play for Germany against Argentina on Wednesday . Full of tricks: Marco Reus was in high spirits as he trained with his team-mates on Tuesday . As with every position, however, Low is embarking on a careful balancing act. His resources are almost endless; Germany have a host of established talent and a relentless supply of talented youth. Low and his new assistant manager Thomas Schneider now have the task of ensuring that the team neither becomes too stale, nor too inexperienced. The basics will remain the same. When announcing Schneider as the successor to former assistant coach Hansi Flick, Low spoke of a man whose 'view of how football should be played is the same as mine'. That means attacking, it means goals, and it means youthful fervour. The new Germany will be made very much in the image of the old.","Lahm, Klose and Mertesacker have all retired from international football .

"Just two days after Tim Cook was accidentally outed on live TV, the Apple CEO showed up to San Francisco's 44th annual Gay Pride Parade to cheer on the crowds and pose for photos with his beaming employees. Thousands of Apple workers showed up for the event on Sunday wearing special Apple Pride t-shirts, but Cook's appearance came as a surprise. 'Congrats to 5000 Apple employees/families who attended today’s Pride parade,' Cook would later tweet. 'Inclusion inspires innovation.' Nod and a wink? Apple CEO Tim Cook surprised many when he showed up to San Francisco's gay pride parade to cheer on his 5,000 employees who participated on Sunday . Pride: Like the employees and their family members who attended, Cook donned a special Apple Pride t-shirt that featured a rainbow-hued rendering of their logo . Outed? Apple recently came out against an Arizona bill that would permit businesses to refuse service on religious grounds, a measure that critics said could allow discrimination against gay people and Cook himself has been outspoken about gay rights but he's never publicly addressed his own sexual preference . Cook did not march in the parade itself, but many of the selfies he was sure to take with many of his employees quickly showed up on social media. Thousands of Apple employees donned specially designed T shirts at the festival and marched in unison. This year's turnout was largest in the company's history, several Apple employees told Reuters. Apple has a long history of supporting the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. The company recently came out against an Arizona bill that would permit businesses to refuse service on religious grounds, a measure that critics said could allow discrimination against gay people. Silicon Valley Pride: Apple's 5,000 marchers weren't alone in representing Silicon Valley's biggest companies at the pride festivities. Also in attendance were employees from Google and Facebook . 'Congrats': Cook did not personally march but did send well-wishes to those who did . In an unusual step for the sometimes secretive Apple, the company has spoken out about its support for the Pride festival. To help attendees navigate the packed event, the company set up a dedicated LGBT station on iTunes Radio and featured several apps on its App Store, including the Find My Friends app. Company employees also handed out iTunes gift cards to bystanders. 'Apple believes equality and diversity make us stronger, and we're proud to support our employees and their friends and families in this weekend's celebration,' Apple spokeswoman Michaela Wilkinson said. Fellow tech firms Google Inc and Facebook also spent several days planning their festival debuts. Hundreds of employees showed up at this year's parade. Faux pas: Simon Hobbs commented that Apple CEO Tim Cook is openly gay - something that has never been confirmed nor denied by Cook . Crickets: Hobbs's comment was met with dead silence from the other panelists before Jim Stewart (far left), shaking his head, said that Cook is not openly gay . It was a panelist . on a CNBC current affairs show accidentally outed Cook . live on-air, to the embarrassment of his co-hosts. Simon . Hobbs was one of several co-hosts when New York Times columnist Jim . Stewart appeared on CNBC's Friday edition of Squawk on the Street to . talk about an article he's written that explores the dearth of openly . gay CEOs. Speaking . about how former CEO of BP Lord Browne became the first person at a . Fortune 500 company to publicly acknowledge that he is gay, Stewart said . there's a 'corporate culture that prevents powerful gay men from going . public.' 'You’d think CEOs especially are measured by objective criteria, financial performance,' Stewart said. He went on to say that he had contacted a number of CEOs for a comment  for his story and received a 'very cool reception'. Then co-host Simon Hobbs piped up, saying, 'I think Tim Cook is fairly open about the fact he’s gay at the head of Apple, isn’t he?' Speculation: Despite his sexuality being the subject of much speculation in the tech industry, Apple CEO Tim Cook has never confirmed that he is gay . For a moment, a deafening silence filled the studio as the hosts look awkwardly from one to the other before Stewart, shaking his head in disapproval, responds with a succinct, 'No.' Hobbs tried to recover, 'Oh, dear, was that an error? I thought he was open about it.' The panel mentioned a recent New York Times article that all but outed the CEO, but Stewart declined to comment. 'I don’t want to comment about anybody who might or might not be. I’m not going to out anybody,' he said. Despite much speculation about his sexuality, Cook has never commented about whether or not he is gay. He's been an advocate for the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, which would make it illegal for employers to fire staff based on their sexual orientation, and mentioned in a speech he gave last year that he has been discriminated against. 'Since these early days, I have seen and have experienced many types of discrimination and all of them were rooted in the fear of people that were different than the majority,' he said.","Cook showed up to greet the 5,000 Apple employees who showed up for the event Sunday .

"Payout: Former Blackberry manager Glen Hill, 54, has won a £400,000 payout from the mobile phone company . A Blackberry mobile phone manager who claimed he was left feeling suicidal after being bullied by his bosses has won a £400,000 payout. Glen Hill, a former global strategic accounts manager who earned £88,000-a-year, claimed he was insulted before being subjected to 'long silences'. The 54-year-old told his employment tribunal in Reading, Berkshire, that he suffered a nervous breakdown as a result of the abuse. Mr Hill said he even rewrote his will as he was haunted by senior managers at the firm and wondered what life would be like for his son if he ended it all. He said bosses ignored his pleas to move to another job within the firm and blocked him when he applied for vacancies. The senior manager, from Richmond, Surrey, had initially been seeking £5.7million in loss of earnings he would have received if he had stayed with the company until he was 70. Employment Judge John Warren ruled that Mr Hill was entitled to three years of his £88,000 annual salary plus a proportion of the annual bonuses he would have been received. He was also granted £22,000 in compensation for injury caused to his feelings by Research In Motion who own Blackberry, £5,000 in aggravated damages and a further £21,000 car allowance. A judgement on whether Blackberry must pay Mr Hill’s legal fees, which exceed £250,000, is yet to be made. During the tribunal hearing in July 2012, the panel heard that Mr Hill was left waking up at night screaming, trembling with fear and over-eating. The final straw came during a row over the salesman's weekly reports in May 2010. Mr Hill called a halt to the meeting after a barrage of shouting. The following day he realised he was 'cracking up' and visited a doctor who advised him not to go back to work, beginning a long period of sickness. During the remuneration hearing to decide his compensation last September, Mr Hill said that the seven-day employment hearing had been 'incredibly stressful' and at one point he genuinely believed he 'wouldn’t make it through'. Worker: Mr Hill was employed by Research in Motion who make Blackberry phones. They have offices in Slough, Berkshire . During the hearing he said that he . had been left with a mixture of 'incredulity and fear' after RIM, who have offices in Slough, Berkshire, had . said it would love to see him back and would take good care of him. 'It is now three-and-a-half years since I last worked at RIM and it never needed to have been that way. 'All I ever asked of RIM was to move me away from the environment that was, in my opinion, abusive and damaging to my health.' He explained that at the end of the first week of the original hearing his therapist, so concerned that he could not be reached, had the police break down his door. A spokesman for Blackberry declined to comment today. Mr Hill could also not be reached for comment.

"Louis van Gaal has moved in for 16-year-old Ajax defender Timothy Fosu Mensah. The highly-rated Dutch prospect was at United’s Carrington training ground on Thursday ahead of a move which will cost an initial £300,000 in compensation. United scouts were impressed by Fosu Mensah during Ajax’s AEGON Future Cup tournament win in April. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Andy Cole on Manchester United's slow start and transfers . Transfer: Manchester United are close to a deal for 16-year-old defender Timothy Fosu Mensah . Manchester City and Inter Milan have also expressed an interest but him, who can play in a range of defensive positions, has opted for United. Mensah is comfortable at centre-half but can also play at left-back and in defensive midfield, that versatility essential to Louis van Gaal's 3-5-2 formation. He is physically imposing, but also comfortable on the ball, with pace a major asset - particularly in a left-wing back role.

"Ross County chairman Roy MacGregor confirmed on Saturday that legendary Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert has applied to become the next manager of the Highland club. Speaking before the 4-0 defeat to Hamilton Accies which left his side very much rooted to the foot of the Premiership table, MacGregor revealed the Champions League winner is among the list of candidates to succeed Derek Adams, who was sacked earlier this week along with his director of football father, George. ‘I cannot believe the quality of applicants,’ MacGregor said. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Patrick Kluivert play no look beach tennis with Robin van Persie . In contention: Former Holland striker Patrick Kluivert (right) has applied to become Ross County manager . Gone: Derek Adams (pictured) was sacked this week along with his father and director of football, George . ‘We have had a really good response. That response, five years ago, would never have happened and it wouldn’t have happened two years ago. ‘The credit for putting Ross County on the map goes back to George and Derek and I’d like to thank them for that. The calibre of applicant has been really good.’ Kluivert is a managerial rookie but the former Ajax and Barcelona striker helped Louis van Gaal for Holland in this summer’s World Cup and is keen to get involved in management in Britain. Former St Mirren manager Danny Lennon has also been linked with the post, as has one-time Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Hibs boss Terry Butcher. ‘Terry certainly was a motivator (at Inverness), he did a wonderful job there,’ added MacGregor. ‘He has an affiliation with the Highlands. Experience: Kluivert (centre) has never managed but he has worked alongside Louis van Gaal (left) at Holland . ‘An affiliation with the Highlands is really important and that they understand what our area is about.’ Meanwhile, County’s caretaker boss Steve Ferguson, who was Derek Adams’ assistant, admitted the sacking of the man who guided the Highlanders to the Scottish Cup Final in 2010 had taken its toll on the players as they were humbled by Hamilton. After a Martin Canning header, a Mickael Antoine-Curier double and Jason Scotland’s strike had consigned his side to defeat, . Ferguson said: ‘It’s not been an easy week for anyone involved with the club and its not ended any better. ‘You have to give credit to Hamilton, they were the better team. Interested: Former St Mirren manager Danny Lennon (left) and ex-Inverness boss Terry Butcher have applied . ‘A difficult week took its toll. The players have shown me great respect in the last two days and prepared for this as well as they could. 'They all gave 100 per cent, but we got well beaten. It’s very different to replace a manager who has done as much for a club like ours. I don’t know who is coming in to replace Derek. That is up to the chairman.’ Antoine-Curier, who netted both goals from the spot, revealed he fancies his chances against any goalkeeper from 12 yards - because he gets tips from Hamilton No 1 Michael McGovern, who himself saved a penalty from Richard Brittain at 3-0. Antoine-Curier said: ‘I practice penalties with Michael and we can take tips from each other.’ Spell in England: Kluivert played for Newcastle United for a year during an illustrious career for club and country .","Ex-Holland striker Patrick Kluivert has applied to become Ross County boss .

Outside court he then vented his frustrations to the crowd, adding: 'I'm not pleased how this turned out tonight, but at least I'm not going to prison.' He plead guilty in exchange for a conditional discharge which requires 50 hours of community service. The court heard how he was stopped near Schodack, New York, by the town police officer named Tom Jones - who was unaware of his Welsh namesake. When the officer revealed his name, Cassidy joked: 'What's new pussycat?' While Cassidy was famous for his role in The Partridge Family and subsequent singing career, he made appearances in dozens of other TV series, including The Love Boat, Mod Squad and Fantasy Island.

"PR porblem: NSA Director Michael Rogers spoke about the agency's bad image at a conference in California held by the think-tank RAND Corportation . The newly appointed director of the beleaguered National Security Agency has excoriated critics for vilifying the department while insisting that the NSA is not keeping tabs on Americans. NSA Director Michael Rogers delivered his remarks Friday while giving an address at the Politics Aside conference, which is hosted twice a year in Santa Monica, California, by RAND Corporation - a non-profit global policy think tank. 'We don't monitor the behaviors of American citizens,' Rogers declared. 'That's not what we're about. That's not our mission. That's not what we're here to do. So we've got to work our way through this.' Rogers, who is a US Navy admiral, took over the NSA in April following the departure of the agency's previous director, Keith Alexander. Following explosive revelations made by former NSA and CIA contractor Edward Snowden that the agency has been eavesdropping on Americans, Alexander famously lied during a congressional hearing in March 2012, denying data collection on US citizens. It was not until July 2013 that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper publicly admitted that the NSA does collect metadata on millions of American phone calls. On Friday, Michael Rogers hit out at Snowden, accusing the controversial whistleblower, who has been living in exile in Russia for more than a year now, of damaging America's counterintelligence efforts, reported Yahoo News. ‘For those who would argue that the media leaks have had no impact, I would argue you don't know what you're talking about,’ Rogers said. ‘I'm watching groups change their behavior. I'm watching groups talk about the disclosures and say,”'Look, we can't use this because the Americans are onto it.” That's not a laughing matter to me.’ While Rogers would not go into detail, he noted that ISIS has been 'shutting the NSA out' as of late. Rogers repeatedly lamented that the ongoing national debate over NSA's activities has been 'one-sided and simplistic.' Bete noire: Rogers said because of Edward Snowden's leaks, groups like ISIS have been 'shutting the NSA out' Whistleblower: The former NSA and CIA contractor has been living in Russia for more than a year now . He also asserted that the agency he's heading fully complies with the law. The director vehemently defended his staff, saying that the people employed by the NSA are American citizens who come to work every day to carry out an 'important mission.' ‘They do not, do not, come to work and say to themselves, “Hey, how can I systematically override the laws and the authorities that I've been granted?""’ he stated. At one point during his address, a member of the audience stood up and told Rogers point-blank: 'I'm afraid of you.' Rogers retorted: ‘You just don't know much about us.' The admiral addressed the question of NSA's transparency, or lack thereof, saying that the agency tasked with gathering intelligence cannot be expected to broadcast all of its activities to the world because terrorists groups are listening. Loyal to his staff: Rogers has come to the defense of NSA employees, saying that their goal is not to break the law, but to carry out an important mission . ‘The level of privacy versus secrecy, and the role of the government versus the role of the private person — we have watched that change over time, and it will continue to change,’ he mused. ‘We've got to sit down as a nation and have a true discussion about what privacy means in the digital age.’ Rogers concluded his impassioned, often confrontational, speech with a quip, saying that the NSA lures new recruits by promising them that they'll be able to do 'some really neat stuff' that 'you can't legally do anywhere else.'","NSA Director Michael Rogers delivered his remarks Friday while giving an address at the Politics Aside conference .

"In an age where we're busier than ever and bombarded with information 24/7, many of us complain we don't get enough sleep. But getting too much shut-eye could actually be bad for your health, an expert has warned. 'The lowest mortality and morbidity is . with seven hours,' says Shawn Youngstedt, a professor at Arizona State University Phoenix who studies sleep duration. Rest: Seven hours of sleep is the best amount for your health - and more could be harmful, a sleep expert has declared . 'But eight hours or more has consistently been shown to be hazardous,' he told the Wall Street Journal. Just last month a study of almost 9,000 people found those aged 50 to 64 who slept for less than six hours a night - or more than eight - had worse memories and decision-making abilities. But brain power was only reduced for older adults of 65 to 89 if they slept too long, say the University of Warwick researchers. Recent research published in the Journal . of Clinical Sleep Medicine adds to the argument we may not need as much sleep as we think, writes WSJ journalist Sumathi Reddy. When five adults lived for two months in 'Stone Age-like conditions' - no clocks, electricity or running water - they got on average 1.5 hours extra sleep than usual and fell asleep two hours earlier. But they still only averaged 7.2 hours a night, he writes. Despite many of us believing we are chronically sleep deprived, most of us are getting 'more than we strictly need' And most of us are probably getting more sleep than we strictly . need - we've just convinced ourselves we're sleep deprived, says sleep neuroscientist Professor Jim Horne, of Loughborough University. He believes that far from us all being exhausted, 'things have never been better'. Unlike . the typical worker from 150 years ago, who toiled for 14 hours a day, . six days a week and went home to a crowded, flea-infested bed, most of . us sleep perfectly adequately. There have been several large . studies over the past 40 years into how much sleep people actually get. The findings show that the average healthy adult sleeps for seven to . seven-and-a-half hours a night. Professor Horne, author of the book 'Sleepfaring  -  A Journey Through The Science Of Sleep', adds the much-repeated 'fact' that our ancestors used to sleep around nine hours is a myth. He says it 1913 study by researchers in California, which . found that children aged eight to 17 slept for this amount of time. 'There is a lot of fear-mongering about . the so-called dangers of lack of sleep  -  but, in fact, the biggest . danger of not having adequate sleep is having an accident, such as . falling asleep at the wheel of a car.' And which sex needs more sleep? Women - because their brains need more time to recover from the wealth of multi-tasking they do each day. The Duke University scientists, in . North Carolina, found women who are sleep deprived often suffer from . depression and become angry.","'Lowest mortality and morbidity is .

"The terrorist ex-husband of a 19-year-old Dutch jihadist rescued from Syria by her mother says she lived a happy life among Islamic extremists, cooking, going to tea parties and doing 'girl stuff'. The girl, who has only been named as Aicha, was arrested after her mother brought her back to the Netherlands and is suspected of joining a terrorist organisation, meaning she could face up to 30 years in prison if convicted. Her mother, Monique Verbert, rescued her daughter from Syria after reports that she had been treated 'like a slave' by the jihadists, but Aicha's former husband Omar Yilmaz painted a very different picture. Terrorist Omar Yilmaz said the Dutch jihadist girl, known only as Aicha, lived a happy life doing 'girl stuff' while living in Syria . Aicha was rescued from Syria by her mother and brought back to the Netherlands, where she has was arrested . Yilmaz, who married Aicha after she became infatuated with him, told the Sunday Times that she lived a pleasant life as a housewife in Syria. He said: 'She would spend most of the day either at home or with our neighbours. Cooking food, tea parties ... girl stuff.' He said the pair split up amicably after a few months together. 'We both knew it wasn't going to work,' he said. 'I have her her dues ... and went on with my jihad. 'I never harmed her. When she was married to me ... she had contact with her family daily.' But Aicha is reported to have told Turkish media that Yilmaz, who is said to have served in the Dutch military, used her 'like a slave and threw me away'. Yilmaz is said to have been a member of the Dutch military before going to Syria to fight with Islamic extremists . Yilmaz, chatting on an instant messaging app, did not mention why he and the 19-year-old split up, but said he thought she had remarried a Tunisian fighter since they divorced. Aicha fled to Syria in February last year after months of chatting with Yilmaz online. Ms Verbert said Aicha changed her name and started wearing a niqab after converting to Islam. Ms Verbert travelled to Syria to rescue her daughter, Aicha, from life with jihadists . The teenager first contacted Yilmaz after she was 'completely impressed' by a video he posted on the internet. Ms Verbert, speaking on Dutch television in September, said: 'She basically saw him as a sort of Robin Hood ... that he was a nice man and fought against [Syrian President] Assad. 'She said again and again: ""Mum, look at that guy - isn't it good what he does?"" 'She's a very sweet, sensitive girl.' Aicha is being held in solitary confinement, but Dutch journalist Johan van Beek said the teenager may have 'experienced things that might have traumatic effects'. He said: 'If that is the case they will send in experts to deprogramme her. If it is clear she's a victim, which is very possible, she'll have psychological help to help get back into society.' About 130 Dutch jihadists have gone to fight in Syria. Around 30 have since returned and 14 have been killed.","Dutch jihadist bride enjoyed doing 'girl stuff' while married to a terrorist .

"Once upon a time, seeing Manchester United next up in the fixture list would send a shiver down the spine. For certain clubs, the prospect of facing the Red Devils was such a daunting prospect that the possibility of gaining three points was never even considered. It would be backs-to-the-wall and all hands to the pump, especially at Old Trafford. Jamie Vardy and Leonardo Ulloa (left) were inspired as Leicester City beat Man United 5-3 on Sunday . Louis van Gaal and Ryan Giggs endured a nightmare afternoon as United threw away 2-0 and 3-1 leads . Few teams would get the better of Man United during Sir Alex Ferguson time in charge . The club's aura of invincibility started to slip under David Moyes last season, with several clubs recording their first wins over United in many years . How times have changed. Since the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson, clubs who were previously cowed by the United fear factor have been making gains. Leicester City became the latest on Sunday with their memorable 5-3 win at the King Power Stadium, a result that continued Louis van Gaal's poor start as manager. It's fair to say this probably wouldn't have happened under Ferguson - Leicester lost 13 of 19 meetings in all competitions during the Scot's long tenure at Old Trafford. But they are just the latest club to right the wrongs of the past when facing United. Defeat was the usual story for Leicester when they came up against United. Here, Ruud van Nistelrooy scores in a 4-1 win at Leicester in September 2003 . Teddy Sheringham scores for United in a 3-0 win at Filbert Street in October 2000 . Last season, as David Moyes grappled with the pressure of managing the biggest club in the world, West Brom, Everton, Newcastle, Swansea and Sunderland all took advantage. Prior to 2013, these were clubs who would consider a point against United a success. With Ferguson gone, they were suddenly unafraid. In late September last year, West Brom won 2-1 at Old Trafford, inflicting a third league defeat on Moyes even at such an early stage of the season. Under Ferguson, the Baggies had only won one of 16 meetings in all competitions, losing 12 of them. Saido Berahino celebrates scoring West Brom's winner at Old Trafford in September last season . Wayne Rooney scores United's first goal against the Baggies in March 2012 . In the first week of December, both Everton and Newcastle claimed 1-0 wins at United, boosting wretched records dating back years. Everton had been regular adversaries for United during Ferguson's reign but they seldom tasted success - losing 35 of 57 meetings and conceding 97 goals overall. Likewise Newcastle, who had won a mere six of 48 meetings in league and cups during Ferguson's quarter-century at the helm. Among these dreadful results had been 6-0, 6-2 and 5-1 thrashings. Of course, the poor record made results like the 5-0 win at St James Park in 1996 all the more famous but the general trend was miserable. West Bromwich Albion .

"Thousands of people have been evacuated from across the central Philippines today with what is expected to be the year's strongest typhoon set to strike the region in the early hours of tomorrow morning. Typhoon Haiyan has intensified and accelerated as it moves closer to the country with sustained winds of 225kph (140 mph) and ferocious gusts of 260 kph (162 mph). One of the areas expected to be hit is the province of Bohol which was devastated by an earthquake last month. Incoming: Typhoon Haiyan gather momentum as it moves towards the Philippines. The U.S. Navy believes it is the strongest typhoon so far this year . Preparation: Filipino fishermen haul a wooden boat ashore in in Ormoc city in the island of Leyte as Typhoon Haiyan approaches . Impact: The Typhoon is expected to hit the coast of the Philippines at 9am on Friday morning . Haiyan could further strengthen and pick up speed as it moves over the Pacific Ocean before slamming into the eastern province of Samar early Friday, government forecaster Buddy Javier said. As of 9pm the eye of the typhoon was 338 kilometers (211 miles) southeast of Eastern Samar province's Guiuan township. The storm was moving at 39kph (24mph), up from its earlier speed of 33 kph (20mph). The storm was not expected to directly hit Manila further north. The lowest alert in a four-level typhoon warning system was issued in the flood-prone capital area, meaning it could experience winds of up to 60 kph (37 mph) and rain. The U.S. Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Hawaii said it was the strongest tropical cyclone in the world this year. Cyclone Phailin, which hit eastern India on Oct. 12, packed sustained winds of up to 222 kph (138 mph) and stronger gusts. President Benigno Aquino III warned people to leave high-risk areas, including 100 coastal communities where forecasters said the storm surge could reach up to seven meters (23 feet). He urged seafarers to stay in port. Authorities warned more than 12 million people were at risk from Haiyan which is more powerful than the typhoon which hit India last month . President Benigno Aquino III warned people to leave high-risk areas, including 100 coastal communities where forecasters said the storm surge could reach up to 7 meters . Thousands have been evacuated from across the central Philippines wiith Typhoon Haiyan expected to bring   ferocious gusts of 260kph . Aquino also assured the public of war-like preparations: three C-130 air force cargo planes and 32 military helicopters and planes on standby, along with 20 navy ships. 'No typhoon can bring Filipinos to their knees if we'll be united,' he said in a televised address. Governors and mayors supervised the evacuation of landslide- and flood-prone communities in several provinces where the typhoon is expected to pass, said Eduardo del Rosario, head of the government's main disaster-response agency. School classes and plane flights were canceled in many areas. Aquino ordered officials to aim for zero casualties, a goal often not met in an archipelago lashed by about 20 tropical storms each year, most of them deadly and destructive. Haiyan is the 24th such storm to hit the Philippines this year. Edgardo Chatto, governor of Bohol island province in the central Philippines, where an earthquake in October killed more than 200 people, said soldiers, police and rescue units were helping displaced residents, including thousands staying in small tents, move to shelters. Bohol is not forecast to receive a direct hit but is expected to be battered by strong winds and rain, government forecaster Jori Loiz said. 'My worst fear is that the eye of this typhoon will hit us. I hope we will be spared,' Chatto told The Associated Press by telephone. One of the areas expected to be hit is the province of Bohol which was devastated by an earthquake last month . Gov. Roger Mercado of landslide-prone Southern Leyte province said more than 6,000 residents had been evacuated to shelters, government and emergency personnel had been put on alert, and relief goods have been packed for distribution. 'All we are doing now is we are praying, praying hard,' he told ABS-CBN News Channel. Mayor Emiliana Villacarillo of Eastern Samar's Dolores township said residents of her town did not want to be evacuated because the weather was fine on . Thursday but 'we forced them and hauled them to evacuation centers.' Haiyan is forecast to barrel through the country's central region Friday and Saturday before blowing toward the South China Sea over the weekend, heading toward Vietnam.","Typhoon Haiyan expected to bring ferocious gusts of up to 162mph .

"Neymar scored two goals to take his international record to an astonishing 42 in 59 appearances as Brazil beat Turkey 4-0 in a friendly on Wednesday. The Brazil superstar broke the deadlock in the 21st minute and rounded off the scoring in the 60th as Brazil recorded their fifth win in a row under Dunga. Turkey defender Semih Kaya scored an own goal in the 25th and Chelsea midfielder Willian found the net in the 44th after a pass by Neymar - whose name was chanted by the home crowd.

I never imagined something like this.' Brazil have won every game since Dunga took over after their disappointing home World Cup, previously beating Colombia, Ecuador, Argentina and Japan and have now outscored their opponents 12-0. 'The team played well from the beginning, defending well, controlling ball possession and capitalizing on the scoring chances that we created,' Chelsea midfielder Willian said. They will play their final match of the year on Tuesday against Austria in Vienna. 'We need to keep improving day after day,' Paris Saint-Germain defender David Luiz said. 'We need to have our feet on the ground and try to improve in all areas all the time.' Turkey have made a slow start in qualifying for the European Championship and are last in their group with only one point from three matches. Neymar opened the scoring after a perfect 40-yard pass by midfielder Fernandinho. The Barcelona striker controlled the ball with his chest before breaking into the penalty area unmarked and tapping the ball into the corner. His second goal followed a one-two with Willian that allowed him to make a run inside the area for another easy finish. It leaves Neymar six goals short of the 48 scored by Zico, Brazil's fourth-leading scorer of all time. 'I think I'm going through the best moment of my career,' Neymar said. 'But I don't want to stop here. I want to keep getting better and better.'

"UEFA has announced it will prohibit clubs in the disputed territory of the Crimea playing matches in the Russian league. Russia annexed the peninsular in March, following a controversial referendum in Crimea which backed breaking away from Ukraine.

"Shocking new pictures have emerged showing Donetsk airport lying in ruins despite a ceasefire being agreed between Ukraine and pro-Russia rebels last month. The truce between the two sides began on September 5, but despite the agreement, hostilities have continued in Donetsk, with the UN confirming today that 331 people had been killed since the ceasefire began at a rate of 10 a day. One of the main battlegrounds in Donetsk has been the city's Sergey Prokofiev Airport, which has been hit by shelling during fighting between pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian forces. Scroll down for video . The ruins of what is left of the main terminal building at Sergey Prokofiev International Airport in Donetsk, which has been a battleground between Ukraine and pro-Russian rebels . Smoke rises close to the airport's air traffic control tower, which has been the scene of an artillery battle between the two sides . New pictures, which have emerged today, have shown smoke rising from the main terminal building at the airport, which lies in tatters. The airport's air traffic control tower can also be seen completely gutted as the result of an artillery battle. Donetsk airport has been the focus of much of the fighting but has no immediate tactical significance for separatist forces who are devoid of any air power. In addition, hostilities are said to be persisting in the towns around Donetsk including Debaltseve and Schastye. Pro-Russian separatists are pictured firing mortars towards Ukrainian positions close to the airport in Donetsk . Shelling has continued in the eastern Ukraine city of Donetsk, even though a ceasefire was agreed between the two sides last month . It was revealed today that 331 people have been killed since the truce was agreed at a rate of 10 per day . It pictures come after the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein released a statement today saying that the security crisis needed to be tackled so residents of east Ukraine could reclaim their rights. The organisation estimates that some five million people are being deprived of education, adequate health care, housing and employment in the area. Mr Zeid said: 'While the cease-fire is a very welcome step toward ending the fighting in eastern Ukraine, I call on all parties to genuinely respect and uphold it, and to halt the attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure.' Two young people sit in an ambulance waiting to be treated after a rocket slammed into a shopping mall in Donetsk's Kubishevski district . The grad rockets hit the shopping centre, where it is believed that two people were killed and five were injured . A pro-Russian separatist soldier makes his way through the shopping centre picking up parts of a missile after a rocket attack . Rebels and government officials regularly blame each other for the civilian deaths. Separatist fighters have been observed firing artillery from residential areas, eliciting hasty responses from Ukrainian troops that often miss their mark and hit houses. A separate U.N. report cites the Ukrainian government as saying more than 4,500 residential buildings have been damaged or destroyed in the fighting. At least 22 settlements remain without running water, while 93 settlements have no electricity, the report said. Donetsk's Kalinina hospital has also been hit by shelling during the conflict with mortuary workers struggling to cope with the bodies piling up . Servicemen from pro-Ukrainian forces take part in a drill near the eastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol today . The training drill came as the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said that the security crisis needed to be tackled so residents of east Ukraine could reclaim their rights . Rebels and government officials regularly blame each other for the civilian deaths in the east of Ukraine . Lack of proper housing is becoming particularly acute with the approach of winter, when temperatures can drop below freezing for weeks on end. According to government information from mid-September, some 25,500 displaced people were living in shelters unsuited for winter habitation, the U.N. said. In a separate statement, Zeid called on both sides in the fighting - largely around the industrial and coal mining cities of Donetsk and Lugansk - to ""halt the attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure once and for all."" Among the dead in the conflict, at least 1,078 were Ukrainian servicemen and volunteers, according to the report, although it noted that 'the reporting of Ukrainian military casualties is imprecise and contradictory.' Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro has blasted NATO for plotting a 'war of extermination' against Russia in a stark return to Cold War rhetoric. He alleged that the military bloc was 'more extremist than even Islamic State fanatics'. The retired leader's attack came as the UN revealed that 331 people have perished since a ceasefire was signed in Ukraine a month ago. Castro denounced the 'hatred' towards Russia of new NATO leader Jens Stoltenberg, the former Norwegian premier, seen by others as more sympathetic than his predecessor towards Moscow. 'I was listening to statements by NATO's new secretary general', said the former Cuban leader. 'Such hatred in his face. What an incredible effort he is undertaking against the Russian Federation.' Revolutionary Castro, 88, who left office in 2006 suffering from ill health, was reacting against Stoltenberg's claim that the Alliance wanted a constructive relationship with Moscow, but Vladimir Putin must reverse course in Ukraine and abide by international law. His words came in an article entitled 'An Uncertain Future'. Cuba is now run by his younger brother Raul. Castro senior spoke amid fears of new anarchy in Ukraine with the ceasefire teetering on the brink of collapse.","Images show the terminal building and control tower lying in ruins .

"Pieter Grimminck and Mandy Brander quit their stable jobs, sold their possessions, packed up their belongings and embarked on the road trip of a lifetime. Departing from their home in the Netherlands in March, the couple journeyed first through Eastern Europe, across Asia to Mongolia on two motorbikes, covering 16 countries in three months. Mandy, a photographer, has been documenting their adventures in Turkey, Armenia, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and more, capturing breathtaking images along the way and documenting them on their blog, WeWantAdventure.com. Riding off into the sunset: Pieter Grimminck (pictured in Kazakhstan) and Mandy Brander are on an epic road trip . An extraordinary adventure: The couple initially rode from Amsterdam to Mongolia, covering 16 countries in three months . Spectacular: Pieter and Mandy journeyed through Eastern Europe across Asia taking pictures like this, in Tajikistan, along the way . The adventure did not end there, though. Falling head over heels for their new lifestyle, Pieter, 33, and Mandy, 27, have no plans to go 'home' anytime soon. They have been based in Nepal since June and this week depart for a new adventure in India. The couple's nomadic lifestyle has come with its challenges. They tell MailOnline Travel of going a week without any shower or toilet facilities, off-roading from daybreak to nightfall in remote regions, and facing sandstorms, freezing temperatures and long stretches without encountering another soul. 'In Armenia we were stuck because of heavy snow and a lovely family let us stay in their house for days,' Pieter and Mandy say. 'We felt so welcome, and even though these people are quite poor they welcome you as their own family.' The great outdoors: They faced sandstorms, freezing temperatures,  and no showers or toilets for days in Mongolia (pictured) Jaw-dropping: They have encountered incredible scenery, such as the 'Gate to Hell' in Turkmenistan . Remote: The adventurers followed the river border between Afghanistan and Tajikistan (pictured) for two days . But the real adventure began, they say, in Tajikistan. 'We already had a lot of bad roads, but Tajikistan was hard. No shower or toilet for a week, sleeping at people's homes on the ground, high altitude, snow, only soup with potato for dinner and eggs in the morning. The couple spent two days following the Afghanistan border, only separated by a small river. And Mongolia was even harder. 'Almost no asphalt, just a lot of small sandy paths or washboard roads,' say Pieter and Mandy, remembering days where they only managed to travel 150km, calling it 'mentally and physically challenging'. 'At some points it felt like there was no ending. Our navigation didn’t work, we didn’t know where we were and the roads were really bad that sometimes we could only drive 10 to 20 km per hour.' The road ahead: Pieter, 33, and Mandy, 27, sold their possessions and left their lives in Amsterdam behind . Nomadic life: Both of them had stable, secure jobs before embarking on their adventure . Isolated: The couple went long stretches without encountering other people. Pictured setting up camp in Kazakhstan . In Mongolia, the couple encountered British adventurer Ash Dykes, who made headlines in August when he became the first person to walk solo from the country's border with China to its Russian boundary, camping together for three days. Turkey, the reveal, felt like a 'summer holiday', in which they enjoyed 'nice people, the best food, good roads and beautiful nature. 'We noticed that right after every border you directly notice you’re in another country. Even though the change is slower than travelling by plane, every country has its own uniqueness.' Above the clouds: One of their bikes pictured at the highest pass at 4,600 metres in Tajikistan . 'Open to new opportunities': The couple marvel at the welcoming people they met along their way. Pictured: Oezbekistan . While there have bumps along the road, the couple say their incredible journey has only strengthened their three and a half-year relationship, insisting that, remarkably, they 'never fight' while on the road and don't irritate each other... except for when Mandy is slow to get going in the mornings. They say: 'We've formed a really good team. Pieter is calm and never afraid. Mandy is more impulsive, but also good in finding information. In difficult situations we always were on the same page. 'Travelling changes your view on life, and it is great to share this. It’s a completely new lifestyle we were experiencing. Being with each other 24 hours a day is not easy, and we had to get to know each other in this new lifestyle.' The couple say that travelling has always been a conversation since they met, but that it wasn't until last year that the idea of a motorbike road trip formed. Committed: They say their journey has only strengthened their three and a half year relationship . Changing scenes: It hasn't been all remote roads for Pieter and Mandy, who also travelled through cities like this in Turkmenistan . It was during a motoring trip in Germany last summer that the fantasy of the epic journey arose. 'We talked about our lives and what we really wanted to do,' they say. 'We knew that we had to do something drastic to be happy with our lives. Unsatisfied with their jobs and with no children on the immediate agenda, they made the decision at Christmas that they were ready for change. 'We wanted more adventure and less security. To get the most out of ourselves and be open for new opportunities.' The duo plan to purchase a new bike in Delhi and 'just drive', with a indefinite plan to ride from the Ganges to the sea - undoubtedly capturing beautiful pictures along the way. Endless journey: The couple (right) are departing for India this week, and hope to continue their adventure for the foreseeable future .","Pieter Grimminck and Mandy Brander sold their possessions, quit their jobs and embarked on an epic adventure .

"The chief executive of Emirates believes information on missing aircraft MH370 is being withheld by authorities. This was revealed in a formerly unpublished full transcript of an interview conducted by well-known aviation journalist Andreas Spaeth, which has been made available on the Sydney Morning Herald. Sir Tim Clark further questioned the role of the Malaysian military after the Malaysian Airlines flight disappeared on March 8 this year carrying 239 people, including six Australians, while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The chief executive of Emirates Sir Tim Clark believes information on missing aircraft MH370 is being withheld by Malaysian authorities . A Malaysian Airlines flight disappeared on March 8 2014 carrying 239 people, including six Australians, while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing . 'I think we will know more if there is full transparency of everything that everybody knows. I do not believe that the information held by some is on the table,' he said in the interview. 'Who actually disabled ACARS [the plane's Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System], who knew how to do it? 'If you eliminate the pilot on a suicide mission, I'm sure you could have put the aircraft in the South China Sea, rather than fly it for seven hours. So if he was on a suicide mission, he would have done it then. Who then took control of the aircraft? Who then knew how to disable ACARS and turn the transponder off? That is a huge challenge.' When asked whether he can comprehend the mysterious disappearance of a plane in this day and age, Sir Clark responded: . 'Therein lies this huge question mark in my mind. I know this did not have to happen, there is technology to track these aircraft and everybody will say that, Boeing or Airbus. 'That is where the conundrum is of mystery, that is where we must be more forthright and candid as to what went on, it is not good enough for the Malaysian military to say: ""On a prime radar we identified it as 'friendly'"".' Sir Tim, who's airline Emirates operates almost 130 Boeing 777 aircraft - similar to the doomed jet, added the role of the Malaysian military has been 'bizarre'. 'This is a very busy part of Southeast Asia, the notion that we should not be able to identify if it is friend or foe, or we can on primary radar and do nothing about it, is bizarre,' he said. 'What would have happened if the aircraft would have turned back to fly into the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur? But we identified it as ""friendly""? Friendly with intent, or friendly without intent? But what was done? These are the questions that need to be asked of the people and the entities that were involved in all of this. Full transparency of that will help us to find out what went on.' In Spaeth's article, which was published for German magazine Spiege last month, Sir Tim also claimed that 'control was taken of' Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 before it vanished. Sir Tim said it was very important that the airline industry does not accept that the fate of MH370 is an 'unexplained mystery'. 'MH370 remains one of the great aviation mysteries. Personally, I have the concern that we will treat it as such and move on. At the most, it might then make an appearance on National Geographic as one of aviation's great mysteries. We mustn't allow this to happen. We must know what caused that airplane to disappear,' Sir Tim said. The chief executive of Emirates - one of the world's largest international airlines - said the industry must not accept MH370's a 'mystery' Earlier this week, the government created a video to explain to the heartbroken families of MH370 victims why their loved ones have still not been found after eight months. In the four-minute video, posted by the Joint Agency Coordination Centre on YouTube, authorities attempt to explain why the search mission has taken so long and why the search area continues to be based along the seventh arc in the southern Indian Ocean, an area with incredibly deep water and rough conditions. The arc is described as 'a thin long line that identifies all the possible points the last communication between the aircraft and the communication satellite could have taken place'. Trying to calm recent fears that the Australian-led search operation in the southern Indian Ocean off the coast of Perth in Western Australia could be stopped, the video says: 'The expert satellite working group is continually refining analysis of the available data to identify the areas of the highest priority for the search.' Relatives of MH370 passengers were outraged last week after a senior Malaysia Airlines representative allegedly said the beleaguered carrier is planning on officially declaring the plane 'lost', which would call off the search.","A full transcript of Sir Tim Clark's interview has been made public .

"The lead agency behind the search for the missing MH370 flight has warned it will be forced to undertake fewer investigations after cutting 12 percent of its staff due to $2 million budget cuts. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau's annual report  detailed losing more than 200 years of combined corporate and investigative experience in the same year as the disappearance of MH370 and the shooting down of MH17.

The Australian Transport Safety Bureau who are the lead agency in the search for MH370 warns investigations may be hampered due to budget cuts . ATSB's Chief Commissioner Martin Dolan said investigating the missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 was the 'greatest challenge' the bureau had faced to date. 'We have more than 12 per cent fewer staff and we have been required to task some of our investigation and administration staff to the major and ongoing investigations into the two Malaysia Airlines disasters,' Mr Dolan said. 'For the foreseeable future, we will be able to undertake fewer investigations and we will need to carefully consider and constrain the scope of investigations initiated.' The Malaysia Airlines plane disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March with 239 people on board, including six Australians.

Ten transport investigators are among those to go from the transport safety regulator after cutting its staff from 116 to 104 since July 2013 . While the safety body was given additional funding from the Federal Government for the extensive search, Mr Dolan said there would continue to be pressure on ATSB resources. '(MH370) is the most serious aviation occurrence ever to involve the ATSB and its precursors, and is arguably the most mystifying, expansive and difficult search operation ever undertaken in the history of commercial aircraft,' Mr Dolan said. 'At the same time as we were required to undertake difficult decisions in relation to our staffing and resources, we received the news of the loss of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and of its possible location in the Southern Indian Ocean, in Australia’s Search and Rescue Zone. While the safety body was given additional funding from the Federal Government for the extensive MH370 search, the ATSB said there would continue to be pressure on ATSB resources . 'The decision to reduce our staff numbers was particularly difficult as it was made in the knowledge that there is no contingent workforce of highly skilled transport safety investigators available in the marketplace to be deployed at short notice in the event of a new crisis. 'It was indeed sobering to see more than 200 years of combined corporate and investigation experience leaving the ATSB.' The ATSB also deployed two investigators to the Ukraine in July after Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 was shot down by a missile with a number of Australians on-board.","Australian Transport Safety Bureau has lost 12 percent of staff due to $2 million budget cuts .

Coming here for all those years and watching them, and seeing that Newmarket Road End...so to score there was special.’ Chadwick’s passion for his home-town club refused to fade during a career which took him from Old Trafford to Burnley, Reading, West Ham, Stoke, Norwich and Milton Keynes. Wife Hayley would buy him the new Cambridge United shirt each Christmas and once, during his spell of more than 200 games for MK Dons, she decorated one of the rooms in their house with a black-and-amber design featuring the club badge. ‘I really didn’t want that to come out,’ he laughed. ‘It makes me look a bit strange. ‘She did a similar thing when my son was born, with a Winnie the Pooh mural on one of the walls in his bedroom, and it was incredible. ‘I said: “You could do a Cambridge one”, just mucking about. 10 years after leaving Old Trafford, Chadwick again found himself centre of attention this week . A sketch of Chadwick in Cambridge United colours drawn by club director Colin Proctor . Chadwick (right) helps move a goal during Cambridge United training this week . 'I went away at pre-season, came back and there it was. The wall was painted yellow and black and the badge was in the middle. It was really good, a nice thing to do. Romantic.’ Chadwick’s affections run deep for a team he first watched in the late Eighties before they climbed from the fourth tier to fifth place in the second in 1992, losing in the play-offs and missing promotion to the inaugural Premier League. ‘The original team I came to see was people like Lindsay Smith, George Reilly and Keith Branagan,’ he said. ‘The club really started taking off with Chris Turner in charge and John Beck, with Dion Dublin, John Taylor, John Vaughan, Phil Chapple and Michael Cheatham. ‘I could name one to 11. We went to Wembley when big Dion scored the winner. That was a great occasion. ‘My favourite was Gary Clayton. My dad got me a framed picture of him, signed, and he came to do my club team’s presentation. Great early memories. 'I can’t find the picture now and it is one thing I’m always looking for. My mum must’ve thrown it out. I’d love to get it back.’ Chadwick in action for his home town team Cambridge in their FA Cup third round tie against Luton . Chadwick joined West Ham in 2004 and is pictured with former Man United star Teddy Sheringham . He spent a season on loan with Reading in Division One during 2002-03 . Before joining Cambridge, Chadwick spent six seasons with Milton Keynes Dons . Despite his devotion, Cambridge showed no interest in signing young Chadwick. He went to trials at Bottisham Village College but they didn’t ask him back. So he went to Arsenal where he played with Ashley Cole before Manchester United spotted him playing for Cambridgeshire Schools and a bit of Fergie charm tempted him north. ‘We’d played Nottingham Forest and my old man brought me back,’ said Chadwick. ‘My mum let us in the house and she said: “I’ve just had a call from Alex Ferguson.” It was incredible. 'She thought it was someone mucking about. I felt like a million dollars. He knew every player by name from the Under 12s to the first team. He was just an incredible man.’ Chadwick overcame homesickness and progressed to the fringes of an illustrious first-team. Roy Keane was ‘a fantastic man’, he said, David Beckham was ‘a really good guy’, the Nevilles were ‘enthusiastic’, Ryan Giggs was ‘something special’ but Paul Scholes was the best player. A comparison of the costs between the Cambridge United and Manchester United line-ups . Louis van Gaal knows his United team will have to be on top of their game to avoid a Cup shock . ‘Scholes could do everything,’ he said. ‘His vision, awareness and ability to play the right pass every time was incredible. The man was a genius. ‘I really enjoyed my time there. I just don’t think I really wanted it as much as you should. I wasn’t sure I was 100 per cent happy living in Manchester. I was always happier living at home.’ He once picked up a £10,000 bonus from a brief appearance as a substitute against Bayern Munich in a Champions League quarter-final. ‘You’re getting paid a lot of money to play football,’ he said. ‘I don’t know if I wanted that life. I just want to play football. I don’t want to be famous. It’s a great thing to do but happiness is more important, to be comfortable, living a life I want.’ Chadwick’s move from MK Dons to Cambridge last year completed his circle, adding great personal satisfaction to a long career. The Abbey Stadium has been Cambridge's home since 1932 but has witnessed few occasions like this . The ground will be full to its 8,000-capacity for the visit of Manchester United on Friday night .

His sons Louis (11) and Liam (nine), both play at the club’s academy and on Friday night his past and present collide at the R Costings Abbey Stadium in the FA Cup fourth round. His fondest United memory was a goal against Bradford in 2001, after he was released by a pass from Beckham, and he still has his Premier League winner’s medal in a drawer with the medal from last year’s Conference play-off final, when Cambridge beat Gateshead. ‘It was a massive thing to get back into the Football League,’ said Chadwick. ‘I don’t really cry but when we won at Wembley, I couldn't stop. It was so emotional. I felt crazy. Why am I crying? I’m not an emotional person. It felt so good.’","Cambridge United host Manchester United in FA Cup fourth round .

"The assassination of Sir Alex Ferguson’s character has been brutal in its execution, Roy Keane performing for the television cameras in a manner that must have even had his ghost-writer Roddy Doyle wondering if he could have drawn more of that anger from his subject. The words fly like verbal bullets towards their target. Ferguson’s ‘statue’; the ‘millions’ he has made on the back of players whom, in Keane’s view, he has now betrayed. If Carlsberg did book launches. But away from the many microphones, in a private room at the Aviva Stadium, Keane is now offered the opportunity to reflect in more detail on the breakdown of a special relationship he once enjoyed with his former manager. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Keane say he may never forgive Sir Alex Ferguson . Sir Alex Ferguson and Roy Keane celebrate in the dressing room after winning an FA Cup semi-final match against Arsenal in April 2004 . Ferguson and his then-captain Keane's departure from Manchester United in 2005 . Keane is now assistant boss at Aston Villa and the Republic of Ireland . I suggest it is a little sad that it has ended in such bitter divorce. ‘I don’t,’ he quickly replies. ‘Why is it sad? Did you think we were going to be pals? Did you speak to Bryan Robson? Did you ever speak to Steve Bruce? Did you ever speak privately to them when they left? Do you think it was a pals’ act for them? ‘I knew what was coming. Brucie at the cup final. Robbo at the Cup final. Speak to their wives about what happened to them at the end of their careers. ‘So I don’t think I ever thought it would be any different because that’s what happens with him. Do you think Ruud van Nistelrooy left well? Do you think Becks left well? To be fair, Becks and Ruud did have moves lined up. But I didn’t. I was leaving with a broken foot.’ There are two sides to every story and the publication of two books, first Ferguson’s last year and now The Second Half by Keane, has given us the opportunity to draw our own conclusions. In the view of this observer, Keane’s grievances are more justified. But as manager and captain they were a formidable team, with a mutual respect unique to that particular United dressing room. Keane was seen as an extension of his manager on the pitch. Does Keane think Ferguson will regret the way things have turned out? Does he believe, even now, that Ferguson would take some pleasure in seeing a former player like Keane do well? Keane thinks I’m naive even to float such an idea. ‘Do me a favour,’ he says of a man he never once refers to as ‘Sir’ in the book. ‘Not a chance. He doesn’t work that way. If Darren [Ferguson’s son] is doing well, that’s all that matters. If anything, he doesn’t want people to do well. Brucie, Robbo. Ask them about loan players. Do you think he did them favours? Brucie got more favours off Arsene Wenger.’ Keane and Sir Alex on the Old Trafford touchline as opposition managers in 2007 .

In the same position, would Keane be more generous? ‘I hope so,’ he says. ‘Although it wouldn’t be hard.’ He said he was being generous when he raised his concerns about the controversy over racehorse Rock Of Gibraltar with Ferguson all those years ago. Foremost in his mind was the impact a dispute between the manager and the club’s Irish owners might have on team performances. But he was also worried it might not end well for a boss he cared about back then. ‘I brought it up in a friendly way,’ he says. ‘I was in to see about my last book. I think I’d given him a chapter or something like that. And I said, “Oh by the way, I’ve been told you are not going to win this”. But he said, “Nobody does that to me” and all that. And I said, “OK, go ahead”. I was just trying to be friendly with him. I was warning him that these were serious people, which he obviously later found out.’ Keane saw it as an unwelcome distraction and blamed Ferguson for that. He considered it unprofessional, the manager putting a personal issue before the club. ‘If anyone thinks all that stuff was good for Manchester United, they are living in cuckoo land,’ he says. ‘How it can be helpful? He would go on about distractions with player contracts or whatever. I think that was a distraction. All the negative media. They were saying that when I left. A lot of negativity saying all this on MUTV. But that’s all I did. What happened with the horse was not good for the club. ‘I was like “knock it on the head”. The situation wasn’t helping anyone. I wouldn’t say it was draining us in the dressing room but it wasn’t helping us. He needed to get rid of that environment.’ Ferguson attempts to embrace Keane ahead of extra-time during the 2005 FA Cup final . Keane, Ferguson, David Beckham and Ryan Giggs at a press conference in Tokyo in November 1999 . Ferguson poses at the launch of his autobiography in October of last year . The fact that he could even discuss the matter with Ferguson remains a measure of the relationship they had. But he is dismissive even when I mention that line in Ferguson’s first book about feeling privileged to work with him. ‘Never read it,’ he says. ‘The only thing I remember is the quote about how he’d enter me to win the Grand National. But that was all nonsense. ‘When I joined United I remember Robbo, Brucie and Palli [Gary Pallister] being upstairs at The Cliff [United’s former training ground] having a cup of tea with the manager. I never wanted that, even when I was captain. Don’t think I was going into the manager’s office every week saying we need to do this or that. I went into his office on four or five occasions in all the years I was there. People think we had this cosy relationship. It wasn’t the case.’ Beyond his family and closest friends, Keane does not seem to do cosy relationships with anyone. In his first book, 12 years ago, he wrote, in that collaboration with Eamon Dunphy, that a visit he received from Mick McCarthy made him more uncomfortable because he never enjoyed having visitors at his house. He claims to have mellowed, although not much. ‘When I was a kid in Ireland we didn’t have many visitors to our house,’ he says. ‘That’s where you draw that line. This is my professional life and this is my home life. Of course people have been in my house but not every Tom, Dick and Harry.’ The book does offer a more vulnerable, human side of Keane we have not really seen and there are some wonderful lines. He reveals how he started to read The Chimp Paradox by Dr Steve Peters. ‘The chimp is running the show,’ writes Keane. ‘I tried to read it — I’m open-minded — but my chimp wouldn’t let me.’ Keane and Ferguson celebrate winning the FA Cup on May 22 in 1999 after beating Newcastle . The duo in talks in training in 2005, just before Keane left Old Trafford after a 12-year career at the club . Is he comfortable with the fact he has been so candid? ‘That was not my intention,’ he says. ‘I was not saying to Roddy I want to show another side of myself. But Roddy’s clever; he softens you up. I only got the book last week. I’d seen chapters but until you see the final draft version you don’t realise. I was thinking, “oh right, there may be too much of that”. But it’s done now. There’s no going back.’ In a discussion with the Sunday newspapers, he was asked why he had made so little mention of his relationship with alcohol. 'The beauty of the book is I don’t have to explain everything to you,’ he says. ‘People have asked me over the years. I just gave it up. I’d had enough. Particularly when I did my cruciate [knee injury]. I’m thinking I want to play a little bit longer. Ferguson with a young Keane and former United legend Eric Cantona in 1993 . ‘If I have regrets, I suppose I could have been more professional when I was younger. But some of that is just being young. You’re 19 or 20. What are you going to do after a game? Go home and watch Downton Abbey? You’re going to go out.’ The book, as he said to the TV cameras, was a chance to respond to ‘the nonsense and the lies’. Not least because of the impact the stories might have on his coaching career. ‘It doesn’t help, these stories constantly coming out about me,’ he says. ‘If you were looking at it from the outside, you’re going to be thinking “I wouldn’t touch him”.’ After seeing his Sunderland side lose 7-1 to Everton in 2007, Keane admitted in his book to spending 48 hours in bed. ‘There was nothing wrong with that because people wouldn’t have wanted to see me,’ he says. He probably stays away because a grumpy Keane can be an intimidating presence. I ask if he realises he sometimes makes people uneasy. ‘I don’t mean to,’ he says, again with a smile. ‘But then there’s some people I see I mightn’t like.’","Keane discusses the breakdown of his relationship with Ferguson .

"Paul Scholes has criticised Jose Mourinho's touchline behaviour and believes the Chelsea manager's antics are counter-productive to his team's ambitions. Citing Mourinho's constant berating of officials in the Capital One Cup semi-final win over Liverpool, Scholes argued that Sir Alex Ferguson was far better at managing games from his technical area. The United legend, who spent his entire club career playing for Ferguson, argues in his Independent column that Mourinho is doing himself and his team no favours. Jose Mourinho (right) has a word in fourth official Phil Dowd's ear during Chelsea's win over Liverpool . Mourinho argues with referee Michael Oliver as the two teams head in to extra-time on Tuesday night . Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson shouts at linesman Andy Garrett back in 2012 . Scholes writes: 'There were many games over my career for Manchester United when Sir Alex Ferguson would get out his seat and come into the technical area to have his say if he believed that an intervention needed to be made, or a point expressed to a referee. 'People like to think it happened all the time but, believe me, in 19 years playing for him you recognised that he knew how to pick his moment. 'Watching Chelsea against Liverpool on Tuesday night, my feeling was not so much that Jose Mourinho was looking for the opportune moments to appeal against a decision or make his presence felt. Rather for most of that 90 minutes, and the 30 minutes of extra-time that followed, Mourinho seemed to be under the impression that it was him who was refereeing the game. Paul Scholes (centre) gets a pat on the shoulder from Ferguson during his playing days . 'The funny thing is, that the more Mourinho does it, the more that referees will be inclined to ignore him. If you spend an entire game jabbering away at an official you will very soon acquire a reputation as an annoyance best ignored. The whole process is counter-productive.' Scholes added: 'No-one doubts that Mourinho has a fine record as a coach, with two Champions League titles and the possibility of winning a third Premier League with Chelsea this season. The refereeing of matches he can safely leave to someone else.'

"Darren Fletcher has revealed he took advice from Sir Alex Ferguson before making the decision to leave Manchester United. The West Brom midfielder asked his former boss at Old Trafford for guidance as he weighed up moves to the Baggies and West Ham. A switch to the Hammers fell through and he completed a free transfer to The Hawthorns on Monday after 340 games at United since making his debut in 2003. Darren Fletcher poses with the West Brom shirt after signing for the Baggies on deadline day . The Scotland international revealed he spoke to former manager Alex Ferguson ahead of the move . Fletcher is in line for his Baggies bow at Burnley on Sunday and admitted legendary United boss Ferguson's help was invaluable. 'Yes, I spoke to him, why wouldn't you? When I was making my decision, I bounced a few things off him,' said the 31-year-old, who won five Barclays Premier League titles under Ferguson. 'When someone has been such an influence on you and has given you great advice on and off the pitch all through your career you have to use these people. 'We had a fantastic chat and I know he has great relationship with Tony Pulis, as he has with lots of managers throughout the league. Fletcher was also wanted by West Ham but the deal fell through before he headed to the Hawthorns . 'He didn't necessarily recommend Albion but we spoke about the pros and cons of different clubs around country and he couldn't speak highly enough of Albion. 'I've spoken before about him in these situations, not only from a football point of view but a personal point of view and how he cared for me more in that situation than actual football side of things and that speaks volumes about him.' Fletcher said current Old Trafford chief Louis van Gaal did not want him to leave but the Scotland international knows he had to move for the good of his career. 'When you don't play for a number of weeks you start thinking about it and I spoke with the manager, he didn't really want me to leave but he respected my decision and did everything he could to help me,' he said, after just five starts this term. Baggies manager Tony Pulis revealed that he tried to sign Fletcher while he was Crystal Palace . 'I have to thank him for that. Edward (Woodward) and the club have been fantastic, they have cared for my wishes and I can't speak highly enough of both of them. 'I wish that club all the success but for me my focus now is on West Brom.' Baggies boss Pulis also admitted he tried to sign Fletcher at Crystal Palace last year and spoke to Ferguson about him. He added: 'I actually asked Sir Alex about Darren when I was at Crystal Palace. He said he was first class.

"The policeman who shot teenager Michael Brown dead in Ferguson, Missouri, won't be charged over the death, hacker group Anonymous claim, citing government sources. If true, the decision will almost certainly inflame racial tensions in the United States. The killing of the unarmed black teenager by the white police officer Darren Wilson sparked weeks of angry protests in Ferguson and has become a flashpoint across America. Wilson hasn't been seen in public since Brown's August 9 killing. Scroll down for video . Michael Brown, left, was shot dead by police officer Darren Wilson, right. Anonymous cites unnamed sources as saying Wilson will not face charges over the shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9 . An autopsy leaked online last week revealed Brown had been shot six times at close range, and had cannabis in his system . Anymous, claiming it had information leaked to them by two sources, reported via Twiitter that Wilson will not be charged . The group tweeted the decision would be made public in an 'imminent announcement.' In subsequent tweets the group said a government source with 'access to police information' was the source of the information. Authorities have made no official decision on whether Wilson will be charged and a grand jury is not set to decide until January 7, but according to Anonymous, a decision may now come within two weeks. According to the sources speaking to Anonymous and reported by the International Business Times, 'virtually every local police agency as well as the National Guard and all local jails are on high alert' ahead of the announcement. Last week, an official autopsy report into Brown's death was leaked online and revealed Wilson shot the teenager six times at close range as he ran towards him. The killing by a white police officer of the unarmed teenager Brown triggered a storm of protest. Anonymous reported that 'virtually every local police agency as well as the National Guard and all local jails are on high alert' ahead of the announcement about whether Wilson will be charged . A decision on charges was not expected until January . A toxicology report revealed that Brown was under the influence of marijuana at the time. Meanwhile, it has been revealed that five criminal cases have been dismissed because Wilson has not shown up at court to give evidence. Details of the dropped cases have not been released, but the latest involved Christopher A. Brooks, 28, having a charge of marijuana possession dropped. The judge had agreed to put the case on hold after Wilson missed a late September preliminary hearing. Wilson also didn't appear before a grand jury in the Brooks case, an alternative that Associate Circuit Judge Mary Bruntrager Schroder signed off on at the previous hearing. Prosecutors have said they won't take any action against Wilson, who received a Ferguson City Council commendation in February for his role in Brooks' arrest, over his failure to appear to give evidence.","Hacker group cite government source when making announcement .

"Islamic State's barbaric uprising in Iraq and Syria is gaining  traction in North Africa where extremists are now 'mimicking its rhetoric and brutality', security experts have warned. Rebel networks in Libya and Egypt have been pledging allegiance to ISIS in recent weeks and are even being helped to set up new terror cells. The opening of a new front is concerning officials in Washington because the expansion is taking hold in two countries which have struggled to quash extremism in recent years. ISIS executioner Jihadi John (in black) and his henchmen prepare to behead Syrian soldiers in a sickening propaganda video. Analysts fear the terror group's 'rhetoric and brutality' is gaining traction in North Africa . Creeping influence: Two extremist groups have pledged allegiance to ISIS  in the Libyan town of Darna and the Sinai Peninsula in recent weeks raising fears they could be expanding their caliphate in North Africa . A U.S intelligence official, who spoke anonymously, said: 'ISIL's (ISIS) stated goal of expanding its caliphate and its adherence to a strict form of Shariah has definitely resonated with a collection of extremists across North Africa, who appear to be mimicking ISIL's rhetoric and brutality.' In Darna, north-eastern Libya, a group of young militants reportedly from the Islamic Youth Shura Council who claim to control the town, declared its allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi earlier this month. The terror chief, who has long tried to recruit militants from Al Qaeda, responded by dispatching one of his henchmen to the town to become the group's 'emir' or commander. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the group's reclusive leader, made his first video appearance in Mosul in July to announce his vision for a self-styled caliphate, a form of Islamic state. Meanwhile, another extremist group, this time on the Sinai Peninsula, has also pledged allegiance to ISIS, it was reported by the Washington Times. ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi outlined his vision for a caliphate, a form of Islamic state, in July . Members of Ansar Beit al-Maqdis  (above) on the Sinai Peninsula reportedly circulated a video that bore all the hallmarks of Islamic State's slick propaganda wing after pledging allegiance in recent weeks . The paper says U.S. officials have shown particular concern after members of Ansar Beit al-Maqdis (ABM) reportedly circulated a video that bore all the hallmarks of Islamic State's slick propaganda wing. There are fears that Ansar Beit al-Maqdis may prove the biggest threat to Cairo after regional reports hinted that ISIS is helping them to create new terror cells in Egypt's heartland. Thomas Joscelyn, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington, said: 'I don't think there's any doubt that the Islamic State is going to commit and claim responsibility for an increasing number of attacks in North Africa, both in Libya and the Sinai during the year ahead.' However, he says that while ISIS's insurgency has become popular with a younger generation of militants, there are older factions which are resisting . 'It's pretty clear there's actually been a split within ABM on the issue of joining al-Baghdadi's group,' he added.

"Shakhtar Donetsk will play the 'home' leg of their Champions League last 16 tie with Bayern Munich on Tuesday night. Except it isn't at home, nor is it even close to home for the Ukrainian champions. The match will be played at the Arena Lviv, a colossal 750 miles (1,200km) from their abandoned Donbass Arena, the glistening monument to the team's success now caught up in a warzone. Smashed windows at Shakhtar Donetsk's Donbass Arena following an artillery attack by pro-Russian separatists last October. The team are to play Bayern Munich on Tuesday 750 miles away in Lviv . Shakhtar players train at the Arena Lviv, their temporary home, ahead of the Champions League last 16 tie . Shakhtar's star player, Luiz Adriano in action - he is the top scorer in the Champions League with nine goals . Seem fanciful? Not if you saw the chilling footage of the Donbass Arena, which less than three years ago witnessed scenes of such joy and celebration at Euro 2012, being shelled by rebel forces back in October. Security cameras pick up the sound of artillery fire crashing into the exterior of the stadium, then a large panel of glass coming crashing down just inches away from a small child walking past. The game of football caught up in the cross-fire of conflict. There was simply no way Shakhtar could stay at home - imagine if that shell had struck while a match was taking place. And, despite the cease-fire between Ukraine and Russia brokered last week by German chancellor Angela Merkel, there seems little realistic hope of Shakhtar's nomadic existence ending soon. They recently extended their tenancy at Lviv until the end of the year, knowing it is sufficiently out of the way in the west of the country for UEFA to allow them to play their matches on Ukrainian soil. The Arena Lviv - capacity 34,915 - where Shakhtar's match with Bayern Munich will take place . The magnificent Donbass Arena - the club's home - before it was abandoned because of the conflict . Not that Bayern are taking any chances this week - they did not travel to Lviv (a flight of just 560 miles from Munich) until Monday afternoon and will return straight after the game. 'It's hard to grasp and it's a unique experience to be playing against a team that is based in a crisis area,' said German striker Thomas Muller. 'Somehow, it's a surreal situation. You know there is this terrible war out there, but you don't really realise it because you don't really know such a situation personally.' The 34,900-capacity Arena Lviv, home of Karpaty Lviv, is expected to be sold-out but mainly with local who have come to gain a glimpse of the outstanding football played by Pep Guardiola's German champions rather than any assumed loyalty to Shakhtar. A small knot of devoted fans will take the internal flight from Donetsk to Lviv but the costs of doing this every other week soon add up. Shakhtar's Douglas Costa, who has been linked to Chelsea, trains ahead of the match with Bayern . Shakhtar captain Darijo Srna controls the ball as the team prepare for their last 16, first leg match . Shakhtar coach Mircea Lucescu has done his best to keep the team going through the crisis . There has been no violence between fans of Shakhtar and Karpaty though some locals have protested at this bigger, brasher, more successful club pitching up to play in their backyard. But there's no doubt the exile is affecting a team chasing their sixth consecutive Ukrainian league title and seeking to better their previous best in the Champions League, a quarter-final exit to Barcelona in 2010-11. Their players have been forced to leave their homes and set up camp in Lviv but their results have been better on the road than in their temporary accommodation. Some of the club's South American players were reluctant to return from their winter training camp in Spain, concerned about the security situation, but they were persuaded to carry on.

The Donbass Arena is something special - it's our stadium, it's our fans, it's our city.' Indeed, given these extraordinary circumstances, it is remarkable Mircea Lucescu's team are five points behind Dinamo Kiev and still in with a shout of retaining their league crown. The prospect of facing Bayern, the runaway Bundesliga leaders who stuffed eight goals past Hamburg at the weekend, is something completely different, however.","Shakhtar will play German champions in Lviv, 750 miles from their home .

"A new report into the shooting down of flight MH17 has concluded that the Russian military did supply separatists with a Buk missile launcher and their evidence also shows rebels were most likely to have been responsible for the atrocity. An online report called the Bellingcat Investigation, which combines citizen journalist and social media accounts, used publicly available published and broadcast material plus eyewitness material, including satellite images. 'There is strong evidence indicating that the Russian military provided separatists in eastern Ukraine with the Buk missile launcher filmed and photographed in eastern Ukraine on July 17,' the on-line report states. 'There is undeniable evidence that separatists in Ukraine were in control of a Buk missile launcher on July 17th and transported it from Donetsk to Snizhne on a transporter. Scroll down for video . 'MH17: Source of the Separatists' Buk' was put together by the Bellingcat group using all publicly available material since the July tragedy in which 298 people on MH17 were killed . Bellingcat has been joining the dots and the dates. The same transporter with missile launcher is spotted on June 23 and then again July 19 . 'The Buk missile launcher was unloaded in Snizhne approximately three hours before the downing of MH17 and was later filmed minus one missile driving through separatist-controlled Luhansk.' The report from the team, led by UK journalist Eliot Higgins, states that 'in the aftermath of the downing of MH17, photographs and videos were posted on social media sites claiming to show a Buk missile launcher in areas close to the MH17 crash site'. 'Using a variety of tools and techniques, the Bellingcat MH17 investigation team has been able to establish the exact location at which these images were recorded and the approximate time that many of the images were recorded. 'Based on this information, the investigation team has mapped the route of the Buk missile launcher through separatist-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine on July 17th.'

Dutch investigators gathered more human remains at the site in eastern Ukraine when they were allowed access once more on October 31 . Investigators from the Netherlands examine the site of the ill-fated Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 that was brought down near the village of Hrabove on July 17 . The authors said that 'our investigation was made possible by the examination of open source material overlooked by other organisations'. It comes as Dutch investigators reported that more human remains at the MH17 crash site in Ukraine almost four months after the airliner was shot down over the war-torn country. An official from separatist authorities in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, made the announcement but it's unclear if they were of passengers on the doomed flight or of combatants who died in fighting that has taken place in the same area. The Malaysia Airlines flight from Amsterdam en-route to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down over Ukraine on July 17. The author of the Bellingcat report said that 'our investigation was made possible by the examination of open source material overlooked by other organisations'. Russia has repeatedly denied the claim and pointed the finger at Kiev over the disaster. The Netherlands is leading the official probe into the downing of the Malaysia Airlines jet, in which all 298 on board, including 193 Dutch nationals and 38 Australians, were killed. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has admitted it's unlikely all the victims' remains will be recovered from the impact zone of flight MH17 .

'Some of these vehicles returned to the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade base in Kursk and joined the July 19th convoy from the base, while at least one other, a Buk missile loader, appears to have left the main convoy and towards the Ukrainian border, close to a separatist-held crossing. 'As yet, it has not been possible to establish when the June 23rd convoy returned to the 53rd Anti-aircraft Missile Brigade base in Kursk, or how many units were in the convoy. 'However, it is clear that at least one Buk missile launcher (3x2) from the June 23rd convoy was inside separatist-controlled territory on July 17th, and 3 days later a video was uploaded showing that the Buk system loader unit was very close to the Ukrainian border. 'Considering the established time frames, logical routes, and photographic evidence, it is possible that this Buk missile launcher was part of the same June 23rd convoy as “Buk 3x2” and supported it. 'In the opinion of the Bellingcat MH17 investigation team, the Buk missile launcher filmed and photographed travelling through separatist-held territory on July 17th is the same vehicle seen in the convoy travelling through Russia towards to the Ukrainian border in late June 2014.' In the opinion of the Bellingcat MH17 investigation team, the Buk missile launcher filmed and photographed travelling through separatist-held territory on July 17th 'is the same vehicle seen in the convoy travelling through Russia towards to the Ukrainian border in late June 2014' Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte stated that the Netherlands-led investigation will do all in its power to retrieve all the remains but conceded that was it was now unlikely all victims would be recovered. A Dutch Safety Board report into MH17 found, in September, that a 'large number of high-energy objects' penetrated its fuselage. Prosecutors are still working establish exactly where the missile was fired from with a view to taking action against the perpetrators.","The Bellingcat Investigation has charted the lead-up and aftermath to the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines MH17 .

"Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho's attempt to influence football's decision-makers is not working, according to former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes. Mourinho has been left fuming by a series of decisions that he considers to have gone against his side this season, leading to his appearance on Goals on Sunday last weekend to air his grievances. But Scholes, writing in The Independent, believes some of the Chelsea manager's actions have backfired, and that he doesn't possess the same level of influence as his former manager at Old Trafford, Sir Alex Ferguson.

Mourinho asked specifically to be a guest on television show Goals on Sunday to air his grievances . Paul Scholes and Ferguson in training ahead of the 2011 Champions League final at Wembley . 'There is no campaign against Mourinho but there is clearly an unwillingness by referees, and the FA, to be pushed around,' said Scholes. 'There is no doubt that my former manager Sir Alex exerted an influence over some referees. He was the master of dropping a comment into his Friday press conference – for instance, how long it had been since we had been given a penalty, or the treatment meted out to a player like Cristiano Ronaldo. It was always calculated and delivered calmly. He added: 'I think some of them wanted to please him (Ferguson). I don’t mean that they did us favours. It was more that they were very keen not to make mistakes in our games. That when they came to Old Trafford they wanted to be on top of their game and get everything right.'

"The captain of missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 received a two-minute call shortly before take-off from a mystery woman using a mobile phone number obtained under a false identity. It was one of the last calls made to or from the mobile of Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah in the hours before his Boeing 777 left Kuala Lumpur 16 days ago. Investigators are treating it as potentially significant because anyone buying a pay-as-you-go SIM card in Malaysia has to fill out a form giving their identity card or passport number. Scroll down for video . Family man: Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah with his wife Faizah Khan and two of their three children . Introduced as an anti-terrorism measure following 9/11, this ensures that every number is registered to a traceable person. But . in this case police traced the number to a shop selling SIM cards in . Kuala Lumpur. They found that it had been bought ‘very recently’ by . someone who gave a woman’s name – but was using a false identity. The . discovery raises fears of a possible link between Captain Zaharie, 53, . and terror groups whose members routinely use untraceable SIM cards. Everyone else who spoke to the pilot on his phone in the hours before . the flight took off has already been interviewed. Hunt: The mystery object in a Chinese satellite image, inset, some 80 miles from the previous search zone . Today, . planes and ships were scrambled to find a pallet and other debris . in a remote patch of the southern Indian Ocean as the search resumed . for the missing jet. The . pallet was spotted by a search plane yesterday, but has not been closely . examined. Wooden pallets are commonly used in shipping, but can also be . used in cargo containers carried on planes. It . was the latest in a series of clues experts and searchers are trying to . pin down to solve the mystery of what happened to Flight 370 when it . disappeared on March 8 with 239 people on board. In . a separate development, The Mail on Sunday has learned that . investigators are now poised to question Captain Shah’s estranged wife . in detail. They have waited two weeks out of respect, but will now begin formally interviewing Faizah Khan following pressure from FBI agents assisting the inquiry. Searching: Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss (right) and Dan Gillis, senior search and rescue officer involved in the search, look at monitors at the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's centre in Canberra . Although the couple – who have three children – were separated, they had been living under the same roof. A source said: ‘Faizah has been spoken to gently by officers but she has not been questioned in detail to establish her husband’s behaviour and state of mind in the days leading to the incident. The latest release of a war-themed computer game – centred on a passenger plane that crashes on to a desert island in the South China Sea – has been delayed as the search for missing flight MH370 continues. Battlefield 4 Naval Strike, an update for the Battlefield 4 game which has sold millions of copies worldwide, was due for release last week – but has now been put back until Tuesday. ‘This is partly for cultural reasons. It is not considered appropriate in Malaysia to subject people in situations of terrible bereavement to the stress of intensive questioning.’ The softly-softly approach has been challenged by the team of FBI agents working with Malaysian police. They have pointed out that she may hold ‘vital clues and information’ to Zaharie’s mental state. ‘The whole world is looking for this missing plane and the person who arguably knows most about the state of mind of the man who captained the plane is being left alone,’ said a source close to the FBI team. The source added: ‘If we want to eliminate the chief pilot from the inquiry, we must interview her in detail to find out what his state of mind was.’ The mystery caller emerged when Malaysian investigators examined the phone records of both Zaharie and his co-pilot, 27-year-old Fariq Abdul Hamid. Investigators were keen to trace the caller and interview them, although they have stressed that the fact the SIM card was registered to a non-existent ID card does not necessarily indicate a criminal or terrorist connection. Political activists in Malaysia sometimes use SIM cards bought with bogus identity cards if they fear that their phones may be bugged by the country’s authoritarian ruling party. Up and away: A Royal Australian Air Force AP-3C Orion takes off at RAAF Pearce Base to join the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 in Perth, Australia . Looking: Crew on board a Royal Australian Air Force AP-3C Orion, searching for the missing flight in the southern Indian Ocean . The Mail on Sunday revealed last week that Zaharie is an avid supporter of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, a distant relative, and may have attended a controversial court hearing where Anwar was jailed for five years. It took place only a few hours before the flight. 'The whole world is looking for this missing plane and the person who arguably knows most about the state of mind of the man who captained the plane is being left alone' Source close to FBI team . The timing of the call has intensified scrutiny on Zaharie as investigators struggle to establish whether the cockpit crew, a catastrophic accident or hijackers are to blame for Flight MH370’s disappearance. Meanwhile FBI experts in the US are continuing to examine the hard drive of a flight simulator seized from Zaharie’s home after it emerged that programs he used on it had been deleted. Zaharie used the home flight simulator to practise extreme landings, including on remote Indian Ocean islands such as the US air base in Diego Garcia, investigators have revealed. Good luck: Ground crew members wave to a Japanese Maritime Defense Force P3C patrol plane as it leaves the Royal Malaysian Air Force base in Subang heading for Australia to join the search and rescue operation . Looking: This graphic shows the approximate position of the objects seen floating in a Chinese satellite image in the southern Indian Ocean on which the AMSA is concentrating its search . The hard drive was flown to the FBI laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, at the end of last week after Malaysian investigators failed to retrieve the deleted files, which they suspect may have been ‘buried’ in an elaborate process to cover  the user’s tracks. The delay in handing the computer hard drive to the FBI has proved to be a source of friction between the Malaysian and US investigators, the source close to the FBI said, adding: ‘We have the technology to do this work quickly and effectively and they simply don’t.’ Malaysia’s acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein yesterday said investigators are coming under increasing pressure as they are aware that time is running out  – the black box voice and data recorder only transmits an electronic signal for about 30 days before its battery runs out. But he claimed a thorough investigation of the plane’s cargo manifest had not shown ‘any link to anything that may have contribution to the plane’s disappearance’. By IAN GALLAGHER . A mystery object has been spotted in the Indian Ocean search zone – 80 miles from an earlier sighting of debris. Measuring 74ft by 42ft, the  object appears in a new image taken by a Chinese satellite.Ships have been sent to investigate but a ferocious cyclone was yesterday hampering efforts to locate the possible wreckage. The news came two days after debris was detected 1,550 miles south-west of Perth in Australia. An Australian Orion aircraft was sent to scour area where satellite imagery pinpointed possible debris . The satellite picture of the possible debris was handed over by China and given a new focal point for search . Since the announcement, Australian search teams scouring the remote area reported seeing  a number of small objects including a wooden pallet. Malaysia¿s acting transport minister, Hishammuddin Hussein revealed the image at a press conference . A Royal New Zealand Air Force P3 Orion plane with specialist electro-optic observation equipment was diverted to the location, arriving after the first aircraft left, but reported sighting only clumps of seaweed. The Chinese satellite discovery was revealed yesterday by Malaysia’s acting transport minister, Hishammuddin Hussein at a press conference. He made the announcement after being handed a handwritten note. He said: ‘The Chinese ambassador has received satellite images of floating objects in the southern corridor and they will be sending ships to investigate.’ China is one of 26 nations involved in the search for flight MH370. Most of those on board the aircraft were Chinese nationals. The Xinhua state news agency said the latest image was taken by China’s Gaofen-1 satellite at about 4am GMT on March 18 and showed objects some 80 miles ‘south by west’ from the first site. The announcement came after the first Australian Orion aircraft to make a sortie over the target zone returned without success. Flying Officer Peter Moore, the Orion’s captain, said a combination of ‘less than ideal’ weather and sea conditions had closed in on the flight. He said they covered their entire search area but had not seen any evidence of wreckage.","Call was made to Captain Shah just hours before he took off in MH370 .

The circus must move between Portuguese towns. Children play inside the big top and are oblivious to the hard work of their parents as the tent is slowly taken down for the move . Due to moving between towns a lot it is common for children to sleep over at different circuses because all of their friends live there.

Islamic State released a slickly-edited propaganda video showing young boys being indoctrinated at a military-style training camp for 'cubs' In the nine-minute video, children in camouflage are seen being trained at the Farouk Institute for Cubs, in the Raqqa province in Syria . The footage, which was posted online today, shows a teacher barking orders and the children mimicing the exercises he performs . Set to Arabic music, the film shows young boys, who wear black bandanas bearing insignia associated with the group, performing drills . Set to Arabic music, the film shows several rows of young boys, who all wear black bandanas bearing insignia associated with the group, performing drills. As they bend and stand to attention as instructed, others stand behind them holding up flags. The 'teacher' - also in camouflage - asks questions and the children shout the answer in unison. The boys are also seen as they pray in rows - but chillingly, they are led by a teacher who prays in front of a pair of guns. Boys, some of whom appear to be as young as five up are also seen sat in a circle reciting verses and listening to a teacher speak . Chillingly, the video also shows rows of young boys are seen performing prayers led by a militant who prays before a pair of guns . A young boy is seen performing ablution, a ritual process required before prayer, in the latest propaganda video from Islamic State . While the recruitment of child soldiers is a war crime, Islamic State have long groomed children to take part in jihad - in a similar way to how Nazi Germany preyed on impressionable youngsters with the creation of the Hitler Youth. Pictures posted on ISIS-linked social media accounts have included babies posing with guns and young children holding up the heads of beheading victims. The terror group has reportedly been recruiting children under 15 to special camps established specifically to brainwash minors with their extremist ideology. Children are said to be taught how to use weapons and even show how to behead using dolls. 'They teach them how to use AK-47s,' an Iraqi security official told NBC News. 'They use dolls to teach them how to behead people, then they make them watch a beheading, and sometimes they force them to carry the heads in order to cast the fear away from their hearts.' Since ISIS made Raqqa its de facto capital, reports have told of many of the area's citizens fleeing their homes due to forced conscription. A father said his life was threatened when he opposed his 13-year-old son's attendance at a training camp. Syria Deeply reported the man describe the process as 'brainwashing the children'. When his son returned home, his mother found a blond, blue-eyed doll as well as a large knife given to her son by militants.

"Making furious accusations of a campaign against his team, mastering mind games and ramping up pressure on referees – is Jose Mourinho the new Sir Alex Ferguson? Last week the two former adversaries broke bread in a Paris hotel and if recent behaviour is anything to go to, Mourinho may well have been picking up tips from the man he calls 'the boss'. Here Sportsmail looks at why the Chelsea supremo is stepping into the Scotsman's shoes... Jose Mourinho (right) has similar characteristics to former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson . Mourinho's antics at Chelsea are resembling that of Ferguson's Premier League period of dominance at United . Dark Arts . The rules, Fergie believed, were there to be stretched. His teams became infamous for surrounding referees at the drop of a hat. Any minor detail to gain an advantage was forensically explored. Early in his first stint at Chelsea, Mourinho asked Graham Poll if he needed anything. The official jokingly replied that the referee's room was not up to much. When he returned to Stamford Bridge he found a flat-screen TV, freshly-tiled new showers and complimentary expensive toiletries. United became infamous for surrounding referees under Ferguson when decisions went against them . Media masters . If Fergie wanted to lob a hand grenade he would often tell the press to ask him questions about certain issues and then stand back and admire the carnage. When Mourinho wanted to get something off his chest this weekend he took it a step further – using the sofa on Sky's Goals on Sunday as his soapbox. On a different settee a couple of hundred miles north, Ferguson may well have nodded his approval. Mourinho asked specifically to be a guest on Sky Sports' show Goals on Sunday to air his recent grievances . The Chelsea manager was not happy with several decisions during Saturday's 1-1 draw at home to Burnley . Nemanja Matic (centre) was sent off after reacting to a challenge from Burnley's Ashley Barnes on Saturday . The studs-up tackle from  Barnes (centre) infuriated Chelsea star Matic and his manager  Mourinho . John Terry and Kurt Zouma restrain a furious Matic after he shown the red card for reacting to Ashley Barnes . Matic was given his marching orders by referee Martin Atkinson and is  set to miss the Capital One Cup final . ABC (Anyone but Chelsea) Sir Alex was the master at creating a siege mentality. He often referred to the ABU (Anyone but United) brigade and was resolute in his belief that everyone who was not a United fan wanted to see them fail. Mourinho is doing similar at Stamford Bridge. The Happy One? Not so much. Even Sky are against them, having the audacity to use the word 'crimes' when examining Diego Costa's various misdemeanours. Ferguson was brilliant at creating a siege mentality within his squad as they competed for numerous titles . Ruthless . Relationships and loyalty went out of the window with Fergie when old father time caught up with his soldiers. When you're time's up, your time's up. Just ask the likes of Roy Keane, unceremoniously jettisoned out of the club to make way for fresh legs. Mourinho is not afraid of doing the same and wasted no time in shipping out the old guard when he arrived for his second stint at the Bridge. Roma defender Ashley Cole (left) was allowed to leave Chelsea on a free transfer by Mourinho last summer . Pressure on referees . Fergie was the undisputed master of manipulating the man in the middle (and his assistants). Never shy of having a word in the fourth official's ear, Fergie time became legendary. If he felt harshly done to, he would make sure the referee would know about it the next time he took charge of a United match. Mourinho's attack on Martin Atkinson was straight out of the Fergie playbook. It will be interesting to see the official's performance next time he is in charge of a Chelsea match. Ferguson (left) vents his frustration at fourth official Alan Wiley during their 2009 FA Cup semi-final vs Everton . Mind Games . Ferguson was known as the king of mind games. Who can forget his winding up of Kevin Keegan that led to the former Newcastle manager's memorable meltdown on live television? Mourinho can be less subtle but his attacks on 'specialist in failure' Arsene Wenger and attempts to unsettle title rival Manuel 'Pellegrino' are pure Fergie. Mourinho (right) has an explosive relationship with Arsenal adversary Arsene Wenger . Agenda . Time and time again Fergie complained of a media-driven agenda against his team of angelic Red Devils. One of his last blasts was over a perceived witch hunt against David de Gea who endured a shaky start following his move from Atletico Madrid. In January, Mourinho was fined £25,000 by the FA after concocting the idea that some kind of 'campaign' was being led against his own team. Sound familiar? It should. Ferguson launched a staunch defence of goalkeeper David de Gea (centre) upon his shaky start at United . Winners . Put simply, both are winners. Both crave success. Both are driven and will do what they can to ensure they are the ones celebrating come full-time. Much has been made of Fergie's decision to single out David Moyes, rather than Mourinho, as his successor. Perhaps that desire to remain top of the pile followed him into retirement.

"Sir Alex Ferguson paid a visit to Altrincham on Monday to officially unveil their eye-catching new community sports hall. The former Manchester United manager - one of the most respected figures in world football - took time out from his busy schedule to open the new facility at the J.Davidson Stadium, with the Robins chairman Grahame Rowley labelling it an 'entirely fitting' way of launching the sports hall. In a press release Rowley said: 'There was much debate about who should conduct the opening ceremony, but you simply cannot get a bigger name anywhere in football than Sir Alex Ferguson. Sir Alex Ferguson (middle) officially opened the new community sports hall at Altrincham on Monday . Former Manchester United manager Ferguson (right) was in good spirits as he gave a speech on Monday . 'We couldn't possibly have wished for anything or anyone better.' Ferguson had originally agreed to officially open the hall last month, but due to business commitments out of the country was unable to do so. However, the 73-year-old stuck to his word and rearranged a later date with the club to open the sports hall. Speaking at the event Ferguson said: 'This new community sports hall at Altrincham F.C. is going to be an invaluable resource for the club and community for years to come. Ferguson (far left) is pictured alongside a group of childen and Altrincham chairman Grahame Rowley (second far right) at the unveiling . The 73-year-old (left) was shown around the new facility by Robins chairman Rowley (middle) 'It will provide opportunities for children and adults to get involved in sport regardless of the weather. 'The hall also doubles to cater for match day hospitality, which will act as a springboard for the club to grow commercially. 'The money to make all this possible has come from the Premier League & The FA Facilities Fund, which is delivered by the Football Foundation and funded by the Premier League, The F.A. and the Government, through Sport England. 'That is a strong and important partnership as every footballer ultimately starts out at the grassroots. Ferguson is again pictured with a group of children as he attended the unveiling of the new community hall . 'This sort of project is the perfect example of how the Football Foundation is working with its Funders to provide football clubs with facilities that get more people playing sport, support football clubs' excellent community outreach work and create talent pathways through which promising youngsters can progress.' The impressive, multi-purpose single-storey building will provide a platform for a range of activities to be hosted including after-school clubs, disabled groups and ballroom dancing to yoga, martial arts, indoor bowls and badminton. As well as that it will be used as a community hub which can be used throughout the week, as well as on match days.","Altrincham officially unveiled their new community sports hall on Monday .

"Simon Grayson was still basking in the afterglow of Leeds’ famous FA Cup win over Manchester United in 2010 when Sir Alex Ferguson asked him a question. ‘He said to me in his strong Scottish accent “Do you ken pressure?”,’ recalled Grayson of the upset at Old Trafford, the only time Ferguson’s United went out in the third round during his 27 years at the club. ‘I asked him what ken meant and he said, “Do you understand what pressure is?”. I told him as a manager I do. '""No,"" he said. ""Pressure is to go and get promoted because I backed you at the start of the season!"" It was a nice little line from him and I remembered that when we were 1-0 down with 10 men on the last day of the season.’ Simon Grayson's Preston host Manchester United in the FA Cup fifth-round on Monday at Deepdale . Leeds did win promotion from League One to the Championship that year and Grayson hopes history is about to repeat itself as he prepares for United’s visit to Preston on Monday night. Jermaine Beckford, the scorer of the only goal for Leeds that day, has since joined Grayson at Deepdale but is unlikely to play after suffering an ear infection. But the similarities are obvious for the 45-year-old Preston boss. ‘I still don’t have to buy a drink in Leeds,’ says Grayson. ‘Hopefully it’s an omen that we play United and then get promoted. ‘Our players might never get another opportunity to play against Falcao, Rooney and the like. The one thing I’ll say to them is to have no regrets. They need to wake up the morning after knowing they’ve done themselves justice.’ Veteran striker Kevin Davies has already promised to target United’s soft centre and Grayson believes Louis van Gaal’s side will have their hands full with his 14-goal top-scorer Joe Garner. Grayson on the touchline during his time at Leeds with Sir Alex Ferguson in the Manchester United dugout . He added: ‘Falcao probably earns more in a week than Joe earns in 18 months but he knows where the back of the net is. ‘He’s our talisman. If the United players aren’t aware of him, I’m sure they will be because he ruffles a few feathers. ‘They’ve got everything to lose. If we play to our maximum and they have an off day, the magic of the Cup is there for everyone to see.’ Jermaine Beckford scored the goal in a famous 1-0 victory for Leed at Old Trafford  back in 2010 . Beckford celebrates his famous 2010 winner as Leeds shocked Manchester United in the FA Cup . United have still only lost once in 18 games. ‘There are certain things you look at where you think we can cause them problems,’ says Grayson. ‘But you’ve got to look at their front five or six and realise it’s the best you can imagine in world football. ‘They don’t seem to be gelling but what you find with those players is they can produce a bit of magic. ‘One of them can go past four players and smash one in from 35 yards. Our players don’t do that very often.’ This is the first game between the two clubs since they met in the FA Cup 43 years ago and United won 2-0.

"In England, it is former Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein who is remembered as the man who discovered Arsene Wenger. In Monaco, though, they recall former club president Jean-Louis Campora taking a 37-year-old coach who had been relegated with Nancy and installing him with a multi-million budget. Jean Petit was Wenger’s assistant when Mark Hateley and Glenn Hoddle were at the club. ‘I remember the president asking me whether I knew Arsene,’ said Petit, who is still a coach at Monaco. Arsene Wenger took Hateley and Hoddle to the south of France and won the Ligue 1 title in their first year . There were plenty of smiles when Hoddle and Hateley were reunited with club stalwart Jean Petit . The Prince and his players: Glenn Hoddle and Mark Hateley return to Monaco 27 years after they won the title . If Arsene Wenger wins the Champions League I don't think Tottenham fans will ever forgive me... I told Arsenal to sign him, says  Hoddle . ‘I had a friend, Jean-Marc Guillou [former France and Nice player], who knew him, and he said to me: “He will become one of the best managers in the world.” And when he came, you could see he would be someone important. He knew football. He was an intelligent young man who had a certain idea of football, tactically. ‘He came here with new methods, he made Monaco more professional. In training methods, in making sure our trips to and from games were done in private planes, those kind of things. Arsene was the start of the modern Monaco.’ But there is one feature of Wenger’s personality in those years which comes as a surprise. ‘He could get really angry in the dressing room,’ said Hoddle. Hateley added: ‘The veins used to pop out of his head! He was an absolute firebomb in the dressing room if he wasn’t getting what he wanted.’ Arsene Wenger was capable of the odd explosion in the dressing room, the English duo say . Sir Alex Ferguson was famed for his explosions and the Glaswegian's dreaded hairdryer treatment . Hoddle said: ‘I remember talking to Tony Adams about him when he was at Arsenal. He told me he was very passive and never really got annoyed. And I thought: “Well he’s changed then. Because he did with us!”’ Wenger would leave Monaco in 1994. ‘It wasn’t the results, though,’ said Petit. ‘It was more to do with the relationship with the president. The marriage was over.’","Wenger managed the English pair in Monaco, taking them to the Principality in 1987 .

"Former Manchester United midfielder David Beckham has claimed Sir Alex Ferguson forced him to shave off his mohawk shortly before competing at Wembley Stadium. Beckham, who famously changed his hairstyle on numerous occasions during his prestigious career, has admitted the fiery Scotsman made him cut his hair in the dressing room ahead of a match at Wembley Stadium. However Beckham may have got his dates or the venue wrong as Beckham had a shaved head just two days before his side's Charity Shield match against Chelsea during the 2000-2001 season. David Beckham has claimed Sir Alex Ferguson made his cut his hair before appearing at Wembley, however he appeared to have a shaved head just two days before his Charity Shield appearance . Beckham shakes hands with The Duke of York ahead of United's August 2000 clash against Chelsea . The former Manchester United midfielder also had a shaved head during the 2001 Charity Shield . His only other final appearance during that time period came against Liverpool at the Millennium Stadium as Wembley was in the process of being rebuilt. The then Manchester United ace initially refused to adhere to Ferguson's request but then changed his mind after Ferguson's 'strict' request. Speaking on the Graham Norton Show, which will be screened on BBC One on February 27, Beckham said: 'I was in the dressing room with an hour to go before kick off when Sir Alex Ferguson saw it and made me shave it off. 'I said no at first and then I saw his face change very quickly so I went and shaved it off in the toilet. He was very strict. Beckham, pictured alongside Hugh Jackman,  was speaking to BBC presenter Graham Norton . Beckham has admitted his cornbraids, which he had in 2003, were a 'bad decision' 'It was the reputation of the club, he wanted all the players to look professional and he felt it wasn't the right look. We were playing at Wembley too, so he kind of had a point! 'Some of them have been really bad – I hadn't thought them through. 'The topknot wasn't too bad but the cornbraids were a bad decision. It was bad timing as well as I was going to South Africa at the time with England and ended up meeting Nelson Mandela so that's why I regret that one.' Beckham also played down reports suggesting he no longer sees eye-to-eye with Ferguson by insisting 'we get on'. Beckham, pictured with Ferguson during Chelsea's match in PSG, insists his former boss 'was a father figure' Former England captain Beckham played under Ferguson before his departure to Real Madrid in 2003 . 'We get on,' added Beckham. 'It was made worse than it actually was. He was a father figure for me for so many years. 'He brought me to the club that I loved as a kid and I was successful at the club, so he gave me everything in my career. 'He will always be a man that I look up to because he gave me the dream of playing for Man United. 'The was no olive branch. We just bumped into each other at certain occasions after I left Manchester United. 'We never discussed the falling out. There were things that upset me and there were definitely things that upset him about me, but I have so much respect for him as a manager and as a man and he gave me my dream.'","Sir Alex Ferguson was not a fan of David Beckham's famous hairstyle .

"I’m ready for the challenge, so I’ve officially applied for the job. I want to be the next manager of Peterborough United. But Darren Ferguson’s sacking at the ABAX Stadium at the weekend shows how incredibly difficult it is to make it in football management in this country. Less than a year after winning a trophy at Wembley, with three promotions under his belt, Ferguson was axed. Darren Ferguson left Peterborough at the weekend following their 3-0 defeat at MK Dons . Ferguson with the Johnstone's Paint Trophy after Peterborough's Wembley win in March 2014 . He’s had to sell top players, but still sustain a challenge in those circumstances. This season results have been terrible since October, but three of his key signings – Jon Taylor, Marcus Maddison and Jack Baldwin – have been injured for large chunks of the campaign. Peterborough is not a football hotbed. Attendances at London Road, the home of Peterborough United, are awful. Under 6,000 was the average last season, and in the Championship the previous season it was just over 8,200. That income isn’t enough so Posh have to make their own money by signing players on the cheap, and selling them for big profit. If this is successful, the policy works, and the club flourishes. Ferguson’s sacking is unfathomable when you put it into the wider context, when you take time to look beyond a run of shocking results since October, and indeed examine the reasons behind that poor form. His success at making players better, making them worth large sums of money, helping them develop the talent and mentality to play for bigger clubs at a higher level, has proved his undoing. In the last 24 months Ferguson has lost players like George Boyd, Dwight Gayle, Lee Tomlin, Tommy Rowe, Mark Little, Craig Alcock and Britt Assombalonga. That lists includes two captains, well over 100 goals, and several promotions. Boyd is the classic example: he produced his best-ever performance for Posh at Millwall in a 5-1 win in February 2013. A few days later he joined Hull City and Posh were relegated. Now-Burnley winger George Boyd celebrates scoring against Manchester City earlier in the season . Tomlin scored a hat-trick as Posh completely outplayed Reading in a 6-0 win in August 2013. Four days later, he refused to play for the club in a home defeat by Crawley and demanded they let him leave. He eventually joined Middlesbrough the following January. Posh flopped in the play-offs. Striker Assombalonga had a brilliant first season at Posh bagging goals galore. Last summer he was with the squad for the pre-season training camp in Portugal. Fans were told he wouldn’t be leaving, the manager was under the same impression. Yet hours before the start of the season he joined Nottingham Forest for a record fee. Posh have never recovered and struggle to score. Key summer signings Taylor and Maddison were brought in to provide and score goals – both have been injured for huge chunks of the season. In one of the rare games they played together, Posh absolutely destroyed Crawley 4-1 away from home to go second in the table. I was there that day and Posh could have scored 10. Under Ferguson this season one of the club’s talents from the academy Joe Newell has blossomed, and proved many of his noisy doubters wrong. Credit to the manager for sticking by his player when most of the fans thought he was a no-hoper. Ferguson has made mistakes: he cannot spot a good goalkeeper; he trusted the wrong man – Jack Payne - to be captain of the club this season – he’s not a leader and his game crumbled under the pressure; he discarded a club legend Grant McCann brutally and unnecessarily; and his ability to change a game that’s hurtling towards defeat has consistently been woeful. This is about how incredibly difficult it is to succeed at unfashionable clubs in the lower leagues. Last season's top scorer Britt Assombalonga left for Nottingham Forest back in August . Posh are a small club in the Fens with a loyal but tiny fanbase. If I get the job I'll bring 24-hour energy, expertise drawn from 40 years watching football and over 25 years reporting on it, picking the brains of some of the best and worst coaches and players in the game worldwide. I’ll play old-style wingers, overlapping full backs, I’ll ask my centre halves to be beasts, I’ll ask my two central midfielders to be creative and destructive at the same time. Hit the wingers as often as possible. Get forward!!! My policy will be to score more goals than the opposition: it might not always work, but when those players come off the pitch win, lose or draw, the fans will know they tried to entertain and went for the win. Wives, partners and families of players and staff will be well looked after, with the aim of providing a network of friendship and support within the Posh family. Ferguson with Peterborough chairman Darragh MacAnthony back in August 2012 . My only foreseeable problem is winning the trust of the players, a sceptical bunch who are falling over themselves to apologise to Ferguson for getting him and his staff the sack. I’ll do a deal with every single one of them individually, the terms of that deal will remain private, it won’t involve money, but it will involve an incredible amount of support and goodwill both ways. I’ll expect them to run through brick walls for me - because they know I’ll do the same for them. It’s a tough place to succeed in the lower leagues. I get on with chairman Darragh MacAnthony, which is a bonus, and I have a love/hate relationship with director of football Barry Fry which I think will work out perfectly. He’ll be pulling one way, I’ll be pulling the other, but I know how to get round Barry, no problem. Give me the job, because if you don’t you’ll never know how brilliant it could have been.","Darren Ferguson was sacked by Peterborough United at the weekend .

"Xabi Alonso saw his 100th Champions League appearance ended prematurely, although his red card did not cost Bayern Munich as they secured a goalless draw against Shakhtar Donetsk. The first leg of this last-16 tie was a tetchy affair and one which Pep Guardiola's side managed to get nowhere near the level of performance reached in their 8-0 Bundesliga drubbing of Hamburg at the weekend. Shakhtar looked rusty - no surprise given they have not played a competitive game since matchday six - and failed to capitalise on Alonso's dismissal.

BAYERN MUNICH (3-4-3): Neuer; Rafinha, Boateng, Alaba; Alonso, Schweinsteiger, Bernat, Götze (Lewandowski 74); Robben, Müller (Badstuber 69), Ribery. Subs not used: Dante, Rode, Starke, Reina, Weiser . Booked: Rafinha, Alonso,  Boateng, Schweinsteiger . Sent off: Alonso . Referee: Alberto Undiano Mallenco . The former Liverpool and Real Madrid star was given his marching orders for a second bookable offence - a foul on Taison - with 25 minutes remaining  having earlier been cautioned for bringing down Alex Teixeira. But it did little to change the match played out in sub-zero temperatures at the Arena Lviv. Shakhtar are having to play more than 750 miles from Donetsk due to the ongoing political troubles in the region, weakening their chances of recording a first 'home' win against Bundesliga visitors since 1980. They exited the competition at this stage to Borussia Dortmund two years ago and early on it looked like a similar fate would await, with Rafinha forcing Andriy Pyatov into a save inside the opening minute. The Shakhtar goalkeeper could only watch on helplessly shortly after when Bastian Schweinsteiger met a lovely, clipped ball from Arjen Robben, although the strike flew just wide. Robben was squeezed out after being the beneficiary of a free-kick routine, before the Dutchman playing in Thomas Muller to hit a cross-shot that Olexandr Kucher cleared from danger. Shakhtar were struggling to get a grip of their visitors and tempers soon began to fray, with Darijo Srna fortunate not to be sent off for moving his head towards Jerome Boateng's after Alonso was booked for a poor challenge on Teixeira. From that, Manuel Neuer only managed to gather Yaroslav Rakitskiy's driven strike at the second attempt - a rare moment of respite for the hosts, who were soon back on the defence as Muller turned over a Franck Ribery cut-back.

Schweinsteiger was unhappy with the close attention of Kucher as half-time approached, but referee Alberto Undiano Mallenco ignored the penalty appeals as the opening period ended sloppily. The Spanish official was having a lot to deal with in what was becoming an increasingly tetchy match, with Douglas Costa perhaps fortunate just to receive a yellow card after catching Ribery with his elbow. There was a break in play after a challenge between Luiz Adriano and Alonso - a collision both recovered from, albeit the latter was soon exiting the field. The midfielder was adjudged to have brought down Taison and received a second yellow card, reducing Munich to 10 men for the final 25 minutes. It was one of 35 fouls on the night, with the sides sharing eight bookings and Alonso's red in a forgettable first leg to a last-16 tie which resumes at the Allianz Arena on March 11.

"A 26-year-old mother who ran away to Syria with her baby son after she became fascinated with extremist propaganda was last night arrested at Heathrow airport. Tareena Shakil was on a flight back from Turkey with her 17-month-old son Zaheem. She had secretly travelled to Syria last year to join Islamic State but had dramatically escaped from the extremist group after refusing to become a ‘jihadi bride’. Tareena Shakil (left), who fled her home in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, with her 17-month-old son Zaheem (together right) to join ISIS last year, has been arrested at London's Heathrow after flying back to the UK . Shakil escaped ISIS and fled back across the Turkish border with her son after ISIS tried to force her into marriage, she claims. She fled to Syria in secret in November after telling family she was going on holiday . The former school prefect and fan of ITV show The Only Way Is Essex, begged border guards not to shoot her as she fled the fanatical terror group and crossed back into Turkey, she has told her moderate Muslim family. Her father and ex-husband flew out in a bid to persuade the Turkish and British authorities to allow her and her toddler son to come back. But last night, West Midlands police arrested the young mother on suspicion of Syria-related terror offences, child neglect and child abduction. Her arrest by officers from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit was pre-planned and intelligence-led. Police said there was no threat to the safety of the flight or the airport. Her child is the subject of a police protection order. Single mum Miss Shakil, originally from Burton-on-Trent in Staffordshire, is a psychology graduate who previously lived a Western lifestyle, listening to pop music like the Spice Girls, according to her family. But last year she began calling herself Tameena al Amirah on Facebook, posting extremist messages including photographs of Islamist fighters and the ISIS black flag and describing herself as a ‘Slave to Allah’. The former school prefect and fan of ITV show The Only Way Is Essex was arrested at Heathrow airport (pictured) by West Midlands Police on suspicion of Syria-related terror offences, child neglect and abduction . Shakil, a fan of The Only Way Is Essex, said she 'didn't know if she was going to live or die' during her time in Syria. Pictured: The residential street she lived on in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, before she fled to ISIS . However once in Syria, she soon realised she had fallen victim to ‘false propaganda’, a friend told The Sun. ‘They tried to force her to marry a man and when she refused he attacked her,’ the friend said. ‘She decided she couldn’t take it any more, broke into a property and stole her passport.’ According to one human rights group, the fanatics have already executed more than 100 foreign fighters for wanting to quit jihad and leave Syria. But despite the risk to her life, she decided to ‘go it alone’ the friend said, and set off for Turkey. After bribing a taxi driver to take them to the border, she braved armed guards on the Syrian side to scale a barbed wire fence with her son in her arms while shouting out ‘I’m desperate!’ in Arabic. ‘The border guards didn’t fire for some reason - maybe because she was carrying her son,’ the friend told the paper. ‘Her hands were hurt and her feet cut to ribbons climbing the fence.’ Miss Shakil then ran across a stretch of ‘no man’s land’ before she was met by Turkish guards who took her into detention.

"Police in Rotterdam are tightening security and drafting in reinforcements ahead of a highly charged second leg of the Europa League match between Feyenoord and Roma. Feyenoord fans rioted in Rome before the first leg last week, damaging a recently renovated fountain, and leaving part of the city's historic center strewn with beer cans and smashed bottles. Fearing that visiting Roma fans may want to take revenge before Thursday's return leg, Rotterdam police spokesman Gijs van Nimwegen said on Wednesday officers will, if necessary, be given emergency powers to eject trouble-making fans from the city. A Feyenoord fan stands in the fountain that was originally made in 1627 but had been recently restored . Rome's riot squads are called and clash with Feyenoord supporters around the Barcaccia fountain . One supporter picks up a bottle to throw at police during the shocking scenes in the Italian capital . Meanwhile, Dutch authorities say they are supporting private fundraising initiatives aiming to help pay for the repair of the 400-year-old Fountain of the Barcaccia that was damaged last week in Rome. The damage to the Baroque fountain by Pietro Bernini, a sculptor responsible for many of Rome's greatest works, was serious, Anna Maria Ceroni, a local official responsible for restorations, told the Corriere della Sera newspaper. 'The extent of the damage still needs to be determined, but it's permanent,' she said. Mayor Ignazio Marino told La Repubblica daily: 'These crooks, these fake fans, hardened hooligans' had 'violated, dirtied and damaged' the fountain. Feyenoord's general director, Eric Gudde, said he was ashamed by the 'behaviour of a group of brainless people who Feyenoord distances itself from completely and who fill every normal thinking Dutch person with horror'. The Dutch embassy pledged to cooperate with Italy to catch the perpetrators. Fans fall to the ground as riot police weight in with batons in violent clashes between fans and police .

"A third student at Torrington High School has been charged with sexually assaulting at least one 13-year-old girl, as police warned the disturbed Connecticut community to brace for more arrests. Mirroring the Steubenville, Ohio, rape case, which wrapped up this week, two hot-shot football players, Edgar Gonzalez and Joan Toribio, are facing charges of sexual assault and risk of injury to a minor after each allegedly had sex with a separate 13-year-old girl on February 10. The pair were arrested late last month, but detectives revealed yesterday that another boy, a 17-year-old, was arrested on March 4, in connection with an incident last fall that involved the same underage girls. Hazing: Gonzalez, pictured center, was charged in a March 2012 alleged felony robbery that Toribio, left, wasn't embroiled in it appears . All three boys have been suspended from school, pending expulsion. The alleged victims, however, . continue to attend classes while being the subject of horrific social . media slurs from fellow students since the allegations against the . footballers were made public. The girls have been labeled 'whores,' 'hoes,' and 'snitches' in tweets, that have been reposted by scores of . teenagers. One Twitter user excused the shocking alleged rape as . boys 'acting like boys' and said he'd tweet the 'exact same thing about . what happened in Ohio.' Torrington police revealed yesterday . at a press conference that family members reported the . alleged abuse the day after it is believed to have taken place. The 17-year-old suspect is considered . a minor and his case was referred to juvenile court. No details of the allegations have been released. Lt. Michael Emanuel said there were 'possibly' more arrests coming. 'It's very complex, but (the case is) under control,' Emanuel said. Insisting that he was 'not minimizing this,' he stressed that the 13-year-olds knew the accused. He said the incidents are being investigated as sexual assaults because of the significant age gap between the alleged victims and the older boys. Accused: Torrington High School football players . Edgar Gonzalez, pictured left, and Joan Toribio, right. both 18, are . accused of felony second-degree sexual assault and other crimes . 'It was consensual in the sense that it was not an attack but not consensual in the eyes of the law,' Emanuel said at the news conference. Toribio was initially charged last month with three felonies including . second-degree sexual assault, risk of injury to a child, and risk of . injury to a minor (sexual contact). But on March 4 he was charged again . with second-degree sexual assault and risk of injury to a child in . connection with an incident that took place earlier that same day. He has pleaded not guilty and has posted $100,000 bail. His friend, Gonzalez, who was named . Most Valuable Player, was charged with second-degree sexual assault, . risk of injury to a child, and risk of injury to a child (sexual . contact) in the February 10 incidents. He has also pleaded not guilty . and remains on $65,000 bail at the New Haven Correctional Center. Torrington High School athletics . director Mike McKenna has been criticized for minimizing the alleged . assaults, suggesting they are the type of thing that happen 'anywhere.' 'Much like anywhere, there are kids . that get in trouble, kids that do dumb things and get in trouble, . sometimes bad trouble,' he said yesterday, according to the Hartford . Courant. Valuable: Edgar Gonzalez, pictured, was voted Most Valuable Player . Isolated: Torrington athletics director has . insisted the incidents are isolated and not indicative of a sordid . culture within the football team . The Register Citizen, . which broke the story, named and shamed the classmates who bullied the . alleged victims on social media. Today the newspaper defended this decision, . claiming that publishing their identities gave the country a taste of how . 'horrifying and uncomfortable' the past few weeks have been for the . 13-year-old girls. 'Vaguely summarizing this kind of . bullying, identities protected, would have allowed the school district . to continue to ignore the problem and the community to assume that it . was 'someone else's kid,' group editor Matt DeRienzo said in an editorial. 'But the fact is that ""good kids,"" from ""good homes,"" honor roll students, athletes, male, female, . participated in this stuff, and showed a fundamental and staggeringly . dangerous misunderstanding about rape, consent and how to treat other . people.' Many of the bullies had made their Twitter accounts private or deleted them by mid morning. Police said at the conference that they weren't aware of the nasty tweets until detectives read them in the Citizen on Wednesday but would investigate them. 'We don't have any information on that (bullying),' Emanuel said. 'Of course if there is any information we'd like to bring it forward and our detectives would like to take a look at that.' The news of the alleged sexual . assault yesterday came just days after two star football players in . Steubenville were convicted of rape in a case that shook the nation. As well as being called a 'whore' and criticized for 'snitching'  the 13-year-olds have been blamed for 'ruining' the lives of the popular players. Bullying: The victim has been called a 'whore,' criticized for 'snitching' and blamed her for 'ruining' the players' lives . Twitter: The 13-year-old has been targeted by dozens of Torrington classmates who are angry about the allegations . Ohio: The case mirrors one in Steubenville, where two football players were convicted this week of raping a girl who was later threatened online . One Twitter user wrote: 'Young girls . acting like whores there's no punishment for that young boys acting like . boys is a sentence.' After The Citizen . published his tweet, the same user wrote multiple tweets blaming the . girls for getting themselves in that situation before insisting that he . 'would tweet the same exact thing about what happened in Ohio.' Another . bully tweeted: 'Even if it was all his fault, what was a 13-year-old . girl doing hanging around 18 year old guys..' The tweet was reposted 11 . times and received six favorites. A . judge has ordered details of the Connecticut allegations to be sealed . from public view. This tends to happen in the state when a case is still . under investigation, and when a young victim is involved. The . warrants will remain sealed for 15 days at which point a hearing will . be held to decide whether the details will be made public, according to . the Citizen. The truly disturbing case echoes the . one in Steubenville, where two football players were convicted this week . of raping a girl who was later threatened online. Gonzalez . and three other Torrington football players were also embroiled in a . hazing scandal last year but police now say the investigation is closed. Coach: Athletic Director Mike McKenna said the incidents were not reflective of the culture of the football team . Culture: Both this and the Ohio rape case have raised questions about the football culture in local high schools . Gonzalez . was charged in a March 2012 alleged felony robbery after he and three . others allegedly jumped three 14-year-olds in search of money. Jeffrey . Holder, 19, a former Torrington High School football player, was also . charged but the other two co-conspirators were not identified because of . their age. Gonzalez pleaded not guilty in that case. Former Head Coach Dan Dunaj, who resigned in December, allowed Gonzalez to play in 2012, despite the charges. He . told the Citizen yesterday that he 'reeled the kid in' when he became . aware of the pending robbery charges against Gonzalez 'and he walked the . line. As a coach I was doing something right.' Dunaj said, however, that sexual . assault charges are a different matter, insisting he would kick the . 18-year-old off the team if he were still in the role and Gonzalez had . another season ahead of him. 'My . process has always been like this, and I learned this from my high . school coach, and I never got into any big trouble, thank God, but if . you didn't give the kid a chance then who's going to,' Dunaj told the . newspaper. McKenna insisted the incidents are isolated and not indicative of a sordid . culture within the football team. Bullying: The victim has been bullied on social media after the allegations against Toribio, pictured, and Gonzalez . Sealed: Details of the allegations against the two friends have been sealed from public view . 'If you think there's some wild . band of athletes that are wandering around then I think you're . mistaken,' he told the Citizen. According to McKenna, a student . athlete would be suspended from play for a 'serious infraction.' However, he couldn't say whether a felony or a misdemeanor would be . enough. He told the newspaper that he personally considered a violent felony worthy of a suspension. In Steubenville, head coach Reno Saccoccia may face charges for his failure to report the shocking rape by quarterback Trent Mays, 17, and wide receiver Ma'lik Richmond, 16. He allegedly told the two star players that he'd 'make it go away,' referring to the allegations, rather than telling police. Both cases have raised questions about the football culture in local high schools. A comment on the Citizen's story reads: 'The power of the football team. Be a good athlete and you can do no wrong.' Scores of MailOnline readers voiced similar opinions after our original story was published yesterday. The victim in the Ohio case has been viciously tormented on social media by other teens. Yesterday it emerged that two girls, aged 15 and 16, who are facing charges for allegedly issuing death threats to the girl will stay in custody pending trial to protect the victim. Toribio is scheduled to be in court April 23. Gonzalez is scheduled to be back in court on April 2.","A 17-year-old Torrington High School student was charged on March 4 with sexually assaulting at least one 13-year-old girl last fall .

"The wife of Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling says that they have been estranged for the past year and has debated formally filing the divorce papers. 'I don't love him. I pity him and I feel sorry for him,' Shelly Sterling said in an interview with ABC's Barbara Walters that will air in full Monday evening. The timeline of their relationship remains murky, because while the 79-year-old said that she and her 81-year-old husband have only been estranged for a year, she has been thinking about divorce for much longer. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Shocked: Shelley Sterling says she could not believe what she was hearing the first time she listened to the recordings . 'For the last 20 years, I've been seeing attorneys for a divorce,' she said during the Walters interview. 'In fact, I have here- I just filed- I was going to file the petition. I signed the petition for a divorce. And it came to almost being filed. And then, my financial advisor and my attorney said to me, ""Not now.""' She went on to say that the formal act of divorce has a lot to do with 'financial arrangements' but added that 'eventually, I'm going to do it'. Donald Sterling's net worth is estimated to be somewhere around $1.9billion and he bought the LA Clippers in 1981 but now Shelly legally owns half of the team. 'I've been with the team for 33 years, through the good times and the bad times. And it's my passion and I love it,' she said. One legal action that Shelly has launched into is a formal suit against V. Stiviano, her husband's alleged mistress who is the other voice on the now-infamous racist recording. Mrs Sterling said that Stiviano had been given three luxury cars- a Ferrari and two Bentleys- as well as other gifts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Shelly is fighting for half of those gifts. In spite of their troubled 60-year marriage, Shelly Sterling maintains that she does not believe Donald is racist. 'I - in my opinion, I think he - it's the onset of dementia,'  she said during a Sunday interview with ABC News. 'I don't remember saying that. I don't remember ever saying those things,' she recalled him saying after hearing the now-infamous tapes. Sit down: Shelly Sterling (left) revealed that she plans to formally divorce her husband of more than 60 years . 'I said, 'Well, this is the tape.' And . he says, 'Hmm. I don't remember it,' she told Barbara Walters. 'That's . when I thought he had dementia. The interview came almost two weeks . after NBA commissioner Adam Silver announced he had banned Donald . Sterling from the league for life after recordings of his racist ranting . at presumed mistress V Stiviano were made public. Silver . urged owners to move quickly to force Donald Sterling to sell the team, . and the league has since even installed a former Time Warner . executive to oversee the team's operations - but it was soon revealed . that Shelley Sterling legally owns half of the team. And she has repeatedly said she will . fight to retain her stake, adding an unwanted twist to the NBA's plan to . force new ownership on the franchise. 'I will fight that decision,' she said, adding the team is her 'passion,' and 'a legacy to my family. 'I've been with the team for 33 years, through the good times and the bad times,' said Shelly Sterling. Shelly Sterling also asked if there had even been an instance where an owner was forced to sell his stake in a sports franchise after his wife had spoken inappropriately. She then suggested she 'would love him to' transfer his ownership stake in the team to her, but said she hadn't yet broached the possibility with him or his attorneys. Splitsville: Shelly Sterling (left) has admitted she will 'eventually' divorce disgraced husband Donald Sterling (right) Her steadfast refusal to part with her . stake in the Clippers was first reported earlier this week when her . attorney Pierce O'Donnell, said his client 'will not agree to a forced . or involuntary seizure of her interest. 'As her lawyers, we will fight vigorously to defend her property rights,' he said. O'Donnell said Mrs. Sterling has no . interest in managing the Clippers and wants a new investor group to come . in with a professional management team. O'Donnell . also said that Shelly Sterling has been separated from her husband for . the last year and is considering divorce. There is no record of legal . separation documents being filed, though O'Donnell said the couple is . living apart. Last month, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Donald Sterling from the NBA for life and urged league owners to force him to sell the team. The move came after a recording surfaced in which Sterling made racist comments, telling friend V. Stiviano that he didn't want her to bring black people to Clippers games. At a news conference announcing the bann, Silver said no decision had been made regarding whether she or any other Sterling family member will be allowed to retain an ownership position. O'Donnell said he spoke with NBA officials Thursday morning but declined to elaborate. He said his client has been working cooperatively with Silver and his staff and supported his announcement seeking a new chief executive officer for the team and the NBA's decision to place longtime team President Andy Roeser on leave. NBA spokesman Mike Bass said the league wouldn't comment on its discussions. O'Donnell said Shelly Sterling 'abhors' her husband's comments and that 'the Sterlings may share the same last name, but she does not share his values on race.' The Sterlings have been married 57 years, O'Donnell said. 'We abhor guilt by association in America,' O'Donnell said. 'The sins of the husband cannot be imputed to the wife or children.' The happy couple: Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, left, and his wife Rochelle watch during the second half in Game 3 of a the 2012 Western Conference semifinals against the San Antonio Spurs in Los Angeles . Shelly and Donald Sterling faced allegations that they discriminated against tenants based on race in Los Angeles according to a lawsuit filed by U.S. Department of Justice in 2006. The Sterlings, who at the time owned and managed about 119 apartment buildings or 5,000 apartments throughout Los Angeles County, agreed to settle the suit for $2.725 million. The settlement also included two suits filed by former tenants at one of the properties, including an African-American family and an interracial married couple with biracial children, who alleged the Sterlings demolished their private yards among other actions because of their race, according to the Justice Department. 'The charges against her by former tenants are false, unfounded and were never ever determined to be valid in a court of law,' O'Donnell said. He said the case was settled without any admission of liability. 'She doesn't have a racist bone in her body,' O'Donnell said. Clippers coach Doc Rivers said Thursday at the team's training facility that 'it would be a very hard situation' if Mrs. Sterling retained her portion of ownership in the team. 'I guarantee you every person wouldn't be on board with that,' Rivers said. 'Whether I would or not, I'm not going to say.'

The story of loyal dog Schoep, from Wisconsin, became an . international sensation when the picture of Unger wading in Lake . Superior with him was viewed by millions last year. Since then, their story has served as the inspiration for a charity called the Schoep Legacy Foundation which has raised more than $25,000 to help low-income families care for their aging dogs thanks to donations from people as far away as Saudi Arabia and Japan. Mr Unger's photographer friend Hannah Stonehouse Hudson captured the heartbreaking moment between the man and his aging rescue dog in Wisconsin when Mr Unger realised his best friend was at the end of his life.

So much money came in, Mr Unger and Schoep's veterinarian, Erik Haukass, decided to put the excess cash to good use. Dr Haukass said: 'I've never seen anything like this before,' he said. 'We realized we had received more money than we would reasonably spend on Schoep's care.' Dip: Thanks to the generosity of strangers, Schoep received top-notch care in the last few weeks of his life . Schoep's owner John Unger took his beloved pet into the lake so that the water could sooth his arthritic pain . Owner Mr Unger, photographer Mrs Hudson, and veterinarian Dr Haukass formed Schoep's Legacy Foundation . Together with Mr Unger and Mrs Hudson, the three formed Schoep's Legacy Foundation. 'The idea is to pay it forward; give it to other organizations, to help out other animals in the area and use the money in the spirit it was given,' Dr Haukass said. The elderly dog that touched millions of hearts around the world has died aged 20 . The $25,000 will be used in a variety of ways to help low-income families care for their animals, both in the care of older pets and the spaying and neutering of new pets. 'It could help another 30 or 40 Schoeps,' Dr Haukass said. 'It's incredible to be in a position to help others,' Mr Unger said. Mr Unger also said that he'd found himself counseling people who have had to deal with a devastating loss in their lives. Along with donations, people have been sending Mr Unger their personal stories of woe. 'They're going through some depression of their own. They're very deep and emotional letters. Those are the ones that hit home a lot,' Mr Unger said. 'But they look at the picture that Hannah took and it helps them have a better time with it. That's pretty extraordinary.' Mr Unger said he credited his dog with getting him through a difficult period of his life. He and his ex-fiancée adopted Schoep 19 years ago, but when the relationship ended, Mr Unger was on the brink of suicide. 'To be honest with you, I don’t think I’d be here if I didn’t have Schoep with me (that night). He just snapped me out of it. I don’t know how to explain it. He just snapped me out of it. … I just want to do whatever I can for this dog because he basically saved my ass,' he said last month.

He and his ex-fiancée had been searching for a rescue dog for a year, going to dozens of humane societies. 'We wanted every single dog,' Mr Unger said to the MailOnline. 'We just hadn't found the right one.' His then-fiancée they spotted the pup at the Ozaukee Animal Shelter 19 years ago. 'We fell in love with her immediately,' Mr Unger told the MailOnline. Schoep . was in a cage with another dog, possibly his mother, crouched in the . back quietly staring at the corner with his back to Mr Unger. 'I knew - that's him,' Mr Unger said. At the time Schoep was named Tramp by the shelter staff and showed signs of abuse. 'He didn't even know what toys were,' Mr Unger said. 'I really wanted this dog because I wanted him to enjoy life.' The couple worked hard to establish the trust of the dog and eventually brought out its 'full potential'.

Adopted: Schoep was in a cage with another dog, possibly his mother, crouched in the back quietly staring at the corner with his back to Mr Unger . Vintage: At the time Schoep was named Tramp by the shelter staff and showed signs of abuse . When Schoep was in so much pain, it is Mr Unger's time to return the favor. Suffering from excruciating arthritis, the animal was not sleeping through the night and could barely walk. ‘Schoep falls asleep every night when he is carried into the lake. The buoyancy of the water soothes his arthritic bones. Lake Superior is very warm right now, so the temp of the water is perfect,' Mrs Hudson explained. Mr Unger could not afford the costly treatments, which at $200 dollars a session, would ease Schoep's pain. But after Mrs Hudson's photograph traveled across the world, thousands of dollars came pouring in. Treatment: Schoep has been getting joint laser treatments, which reduce pain and swelling while healing the animal's limbs, as well as pain medication from the Bay Area Animal Hospital . Gift: 'He's walking so much faster,' Mr Unger said. 'His stride, his gait, is longer. It's unbelievable' Friends: 'He sleeps through the night. He's interested in going for more walks during the day,' Dr Haukass said. 'He walks with less of a limp. His ears are standing up and his tail is wagging better' 'We didn't expect any of this,' Mr Unger said. 'Then, when the donations did start coming in for his care, they didn't stop.' Schoep has been getting joint laser treatments, which reduce pain and swelling while healing the animal's limbs, as well as pain medication from the Bay Area Animal Hospital. 'He's walking so much faster,' Mr Unger said. 'His stride, his gait, is longer. It's unbelievable.' Dr Haukass has also seen a change in the animal. 'He sleeps through the night. He's interested in going for more walks during the day,' Dr Haukass said. 'He walks with less of a limp. His ears are standing up and his tail is wagging better.' 'I took Schoep in for a check up because he was limping,' Mr Unger said. The doctor recommend pain medication, but said that it may be temporary or not help at all. Inspired: This image has touched thousands . Then, Mr Unger said, the doctor told him, ' ""If there isn't any improvement, we should probably..."" a good vet wont say ""put him down,"" but he said at that point I may start to want to think about it.' Faced with the possibility of losing his best friend, he called up Mrs Hudson for an impromptu session. She met the pair at sunset on Lake Superior, because Schoep's cataracts prevent him from seeing in sunlight. 'She couldn't believe he fell asleep in my arms,' Mr Unger said. Mrs Hudson watched the man and his dog float around the lake for maybe five minutes before Schoep began to get cold and shake. Mr Unger said he had to take him out of the water to let him warm up and was worried she hadn't had the chance to snap an image. 'I didn't think she even took one picture,' he said. 'But then she told me she got what she wanted.'","Arthritic German Shepherd has died a month after his 20th birthday .

"Can you pass me the melly before you make the chupley? If this sounds like gibberish to you, you’re now in the minority, according to experts. Linguists have published a list of new list of ‘domestic’ slang words which they say are now commonplace in British homes. Unlike some other slang, these words are used by people of all generations and are often used as a way to bond with other family members. According to researchers, people are now more than likely to ask for 'splosh', 'chupley' or 'blish' when they fancy a cup of tea . According to the research, people are now more than likely to ask for ‘splosh’, ‘chupley’ or ‘blish’ when they fancy a cup of tea. And among the 57 new words identified meaning television remote control are ‘blabber’, ‘zapper’, ‘melly’ and ‘dawicki’. The new words were published this week in the Dictionary of Contemporary Slang, which examines the changing language of today’s society. Author Tony Thorne, an academic at King’s College London, said domestic slang was now being used in the many British households. He added: ‘Once associated with enclosed communities such as the prison, the army barracks, the factory floor and the older public schools, more recently slang has escaped its boundaries and is running wild.’ Other household slang used by families include ‘grooglums’, the bits of food left in the sink after washing up, and ‘slabby-gangaroot’, the dried ketchup left around the mouth of the bottle. Researchers at Winchester University referred to the new household language as 'kitchen-table lingo', and say it is used to bond with family members . The personal possessions of a grandparent are now referred to as ‘trunklements’, while underpants are known as ‘gruds’. And in less well-mannered households, there is a new word for the act of scratching one’s backside - ‘frarping’. Researchers at Winchester University referred to the new household language as ‘kitchen-table lingo’. They said that while slang is often used . by young people as a way of excluding adults, these words were used as a . way of collaborating between the generations. Chupley tea . Melly television remote . Slabby-gangaroot dried up ketchup . Gruds underpants . Frarping scratching one’s backside . Trunklements grandparents’ belongings . Choong attractive . Merk humiliate . Hubz husband . YOLO you only live once . Bill Lucas, professor of learning and a trustee of the English Project at Winchester University, which catalogued the family slang words, told the Sunday Times: ‘A lot of these words are inspired by the sound or the look of a thing, or are driven by an emotional response to that being described.’ The dictionary also contained sections on new youth slang, which experts say is changing more rapidly because of immigration. Many of the words used by today’s teenagers can be traced to the street jargon of the Caribbean, according to the research. Examples include ‘choong’ and ‘peng’, meaning attractive, and ‘blud’ for friend. The word ‘merk’ has evolved to mean ‘to humiliate’ among west London teenagers, but originates from American street gangs where it is used as a verb to describe murder. Other words and phrases used by teenagers, such as ‘totes’ - or totally - and ‘amazeballs’ - meaning amazing - also feature in the new dictionary. There is also ‘nim-nimnim’, describing boring adult conversation, and ‘meh’, a verbal shrug of indifference. Internet-savvy mothers have also emerged as slang artists with words such as ‘boyf’ for boyfriend, ‘hubz’ for husband and ‘soz’ for sorry now in common use. Texters are using abbreviations such as ‘YOLO’ (you only live once), ‘LMAO’ (laughing my ass off) and ‘CBA’ (can’t be arsed). Teenagers are also adopting old-fashioned words picked up from grandparents as ‘gran slang’. Thorne said he found teenagers using old-fashioned words such as ‘reek’, ‘trek’, ‘luka’ (from lucre), ‘galavanting’ and ‘rapscallion’ as new slang. But some critics say slang lowers educational standards and damages the career prospects of youngsters. Professor Mark Pagel, an evolutionary biologist at Reading University, said: ‘There is nothing inherently inferior about slang but it doesn’t cross boundaries very well. ‘So if you want to get on then you have to behave like the majority group or those in power who are setting and marking the exams or providing the employment.’","Linguists say slang is used by all generations to bond with family members .

"Vodquila is making waves in the drinks industry . Embarrassment levels following a very drunken office party could be about to get even worse. Two of the spirits most likely to make us dance on a table and attempt Britney Spears on karaoke have been combined into one lethal drink. Vodka and tequila are now available together in one bottle. That's right, Vodquila is here and it's coming to the UK on Amazon soon. The next time you find yourself hugging the porcelain bowl, the people responsible could be  American Chander Arora and his daughter Nina. The pair came across the idea when Chander was mixing one of his evening cocktails at home in Birmingham, Alabama. His daughter Nina asked why he had never tried to combine his two favourite drinks - vodka and tequila - and the booze revolution was born. The drink tasted good enough for them to take the idea seriously. First of all, Nina developed it as a project during college, then afterwards her brother Romie joined the team and they started to look at is as a serious business plan that could do well in the American drinks market. Chander Aurora and his daughter Nina came up with the idea to mix tequila and vodka into one hybrid when he spent an evening making cocktails at their Alabama home. They put the mix through a proper distilling process that resulted in a product good enough for USA brand Red Eye Louie’s to place on supermarket shelves. The vodka is distilled six times, while the tequila is made from Pure Blue Agave Plants, the two drinks are then blended together in small vats, macerated together at a high temperature to achieve a smooth blend. And while it possibly won't do much for your stomach the following morning, the tipple is making waves in the drinks industry - it won a silver medal at this year's prestigious International Wine and Spirit Competition. The International Wine and Spirit Competition is seen as a very prestigious event in the world of alcohol tasting . Co-Founder of Vodquila, Romie Arora said: 'It was actually my sister who came up with the vodka and tequila idea. 'My dad and I thought there was definitely a space in the market for a new spirit and so we decided to pursue it - it sure has taken off from there! Ewan Lacey, General Manager of the International Wine and Spirit Competition was impressed the by taste of Vodquila . 'I believe Red Eye Louie’s Vodquila has had so much success because it gives you the best of both worlds. 'It’s a huge achievement for us to have won an award in this year’s International Wine and Spirit Competition as it is recognised as one of the oldest and most prestigious spirit and wine competitions in the world.' The combination made such a stir at the awards that they are now seriously considering a new section of the competition just for hybrid alcohols. Ewan Lacey, General Manager of the International Wine and Spirit Competition said: 'Vodquila initially intrigued the IWSC judges in the blind tasting, but the spirit proved it’s no gimmick when it was awarded a Silver Medal. 'This is a whole new world of innovation in the spirits industry. 'It's outstanding that something initially created for a college project can make such an impact on the spirits market by creating a new category of its own. 'It’s affordable too, great for mixing in both classic tequila & vodka cocktails.'","Father and daughter from US came up with the idea to mix liquors .

"Google will pay a $7 million fine to settle a multistate US investigation into a software snooping program that the firm admitted was on its Street View mapping cars. The software enabled the search giant to intercept emails, passwords and other sensitive information sent over unprotected wireless networks in neighborhoods across the world. The agreement covers 38 states and the District of Columbia, part of the area where households and local merchants unwittingly had some of their communications on Wi-Fi networks snatched by Google from early 2008 until the spring 0f 2010. A Google street view car pictured in Stoneybatter, Dublin: The firm is now being forced to pay $7m for intercepting emails and other information from open wifi networks the cars drove past . A Google Street View camera fastened on top of a car in Amsterdam on March 19, 2009 . The fine works out to roughly the same amount of revenue that Google makes per hour, and campaigners say it is not enough. 'The . penalty won't be enough to prevent Google from continuing to be a . 'serial privacy violator,' according to John Simpson, privacy project . director for Consumer Watchdog. The company brings in an average of $7 million per hour, based on its projected revenue of $61 billion this year. 'It's clear the Internet giant sees fines like this as just the cost of doing business and not a very big cost at that,' said Simpson. Google stopped the data collection in May 2010, shortly before the company revealed cars taking street-level photos for its online mapping service also had been grabbing information transmitted over Wi-Fi networks that had been set up in homes and businesses without requiring a password to gain access. The company blamed the intrusion on a rogue engineer who rigged a data-collection program into equipment that was supposed to only detect basic information about local Wi-Fi networks to help plot the locations of people using its mapping service and other products. After concluding its own investigation, the Federal Communications Commission last year asserted that some of Google's managers knew about the engineer's plan to vacuum information being transmitted over the Wi-Fi networks. Google hasn't identified the engineer who set up the data-collection program. The surveillance triggered outrage among privacy watchdogs and government investigations in more than a dozen countries. The backlash so far has been more of a public relations blow than a financial setback for Google, which has embraced 'Don't Be Evil' as its corporate motto. Even as it repeatedly apologized for a breach of online etiquette, Google insisted that it didn't break any laws in the U.S. The company is maintaining that position in the multistate investigation by entering into a settlement that doesn't include any admission of wrongdoing. Google, based in Mountain View, California, released another contrite statement Tuesday. 'We work hard to get privacy right at Google,' the company said. 'But in this case we didn't, which is why we quickly tightened up our systems to address the issue.' How Google's Street View works . The multistate agreement requires Google to destroy the personal data that it collected from the Wi-FI networks, unless a lawsuit or other legal action requires the information to be preserved. A series of class-action lawsuits are still being appealed in San Francisco federal court. Google says it never looked at the data, although regulators in other countries have reviewed the information as part of their investigations. Canadian regulators said Google had obtained the full names, telephone numbers and address of some people using the unprotected Wi-Fi networks. In France regulators found that Google had grabbed an email exchange between a married man and woman discussing a possible affair and other information about sexual preferences. The Wi-Fi snooping is just the latest of several incidents that have raised questions about Google's commitment to privacy. Google's street view cars have become a common sight on roads around the world - however, for a time they were also found to be snooping on open wifi networks as they drove by . In the past three years, Google also has been reprimanded by U.S. regulators for exposing the personal contact lists of its email accountholders when it started a service called Buzz in 2010 and for secretly tracking the online activities of Web surfers using Apple Inc.'s Safari Web browser last year. The Safari surveillance resulted in the Federal Trade Commission fining Google $22.5 million last year. The FCC also fined Google $25,000 last year for obstructing its investigation into the Wi-Fi spying. The $7 million fine that Google is paying the states and District of Columbia is the biggest U.S. penalty imposed on Google so far for Wi-Fi spying. Connecticut, the lead state in the Wi-Fi investigation, will get the largest cut from the fine - nearly $521,000. Other states getting a share are: . Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware Florida, . Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, . Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, . Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, . Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, . Vermont, Virginia and Washington. The multistate agreement also requires Google to create an instructional video for its YouTube site to help people learn to protect their Wi-Fi networks from interlopers. The video will be promoted with daily online ads for the next two years. Wi-Fi privacy tips also will be provided in print ads that Google must buy in major newspapers in all the states covered by the settlement. Google also will host an annual ""privacy week"" for its employees for the next decade. 'Consumers have a reasonable expectation of privacy,' said Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen. 'This agreement recognizes those rights and ensures that Google will not use similar tactics in the future.'","Campaigners say fine is not enough - as Google makes $7m in an HOUR .

"The former Russian figure skater that lit the Olympic flame during the Sochi opening ceremony has deleted a racist photo of President and Mrs Obama that she had previously posted. Irina Rodnina is a triple Olympic champion figure skater and is close with Russian President Vladimir Putin so it came as little surprise that she was chosen to be one of the two athletes to have the key role in the opening ceremony. A scouring of her Twitter account by The Guardian found that she had posted a photo of Mr and Mrs Obama looking at someone who was holding up a banana, which has racist implications. Starting a firestorm: Irina Rodnina lit the Olympic flame alongside Vladislav Tretyak at the Sochi ceremony Friday . Doctored: She posted the image in September and took it down Friday but did not apologize for it . After being questioned about the photo, the 65-year-old former politician said that there was nothing wrong with the image and refused to apologize for posting it. She said that she had been sent the photo from friends in America, and used their rights as a reason to justify her use of the photo. 'Freedom of speech is freedom of speech, and you should answer for your own hang-ups,' she wrote according to The Guardian. The American government didn't see it the same way, as the outgoing American ambassador to Russia posted to his own Twitter account, saying that Ms Rodnina's 'outrageous behaviour... only brings shame to her parliament and country'. The tweet no longer appears on his account. Neither of the Obamas are attending the Russian games, which is largely understood to be a reflection of the frosty tensions between the two countries. Taunting black people with bananas is a racist ploy that has been reported in other parts of Russia by visiting athletes through the years. This was just one of the controversies surrounding the opening ceremony that took place Friday night in Russia. The Sochi games have been mired in debate over the country's anti-homosexuality laws, yet two of the lead singers that were featured were the former girl pop group T.A.T.u who first shot to fame for pretending to be lesbian lovers and regularly kissing during performances. And one of the Olympic rings failed to open on the display screen at the beginning of the show, which was seen as an embarrassment to organizers. Central role: Rodnina is a 3-time Olympian .","Irina Rodnina, 65, posted a photo of the Obama with a banana and has since deleted it but did not apologize for the racist implications .

"For 42 years, she has reigned supreme in the world of lookalikes. But now, after a globe-trotting career that has seen her appear in Hollywood films and mix with showbusiness royalty, Jeannette Charles is finally hanging up her crown. Before she waves her last regal wave and retires, however, the 86-year-old wants to share some treasured memories of her life impersonating Her Majesty. Jeanette Charles, posing with a toy corgi, is giving up her 40-year career as a royal impersonator . Flicking through her photo albums during an audience with her at her home is a bizarre experience. There she is with Mohammed Ali, playfully landing a punch on ‘the greatest’s’ chin. Turn the page, and there’s George Hamilton next to her. Who’s next? David Bailey. And look, that’s Mike Myers of Austin Powers fame. No one, it seems, could resist the opportunity to pose for a snap with ‘the Queen’. Wayne Rooney, Gary Lineker and Noel Edmonds also got in on the act. Mrs Charles lands a punch on the chin of Muhammad Ali - floating like a butterfly and stinging like a bee . For Mrs Charles was the doyenne of the double-take brigade, the greatest pretender of them all. She was the first woman to turn her striking resemblance to the monarch into a career, and in her heyday the most famous lookalike in the world. It all began when she had a portrait of herself painted to give to her late husband Kenneth as a birthday present in 1971. She spotted an advert placed in her local newspaper by an artist, who by coincidence also wrote a column in the paper and remarked in it at the similarity between mother-of-three Mrs Charles and the Queen. ‘The next thing I knew, the phone was ringing from media across the world all wanting to interview me,’ said Mrs Charles, of Danbury, near Chelmsford, Essex. ‘I thought it’d be a nine-day wonder, but then I was interviewed by Russell Harty on his TV chat show and it snowballed.’ She was invited to open shops, appeared on children’s programmes and began appearing in comedy sketches, including the Two Ronnies. Her movie credits include The Rutles: All You Need Is Cash (1978) with Eric Idle, The Naked Gun (1988) with Leslie Nielsen and Priscilla Presley, and Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002) with Mike Myers, Beyonce and Michael Caine. Fern Britton and Phillip Schofield with Mrs Charles when she appeared on their show in July 2008 . Jeanette Charles with photographer David Bailey. Who's he? ‘I never knew that some of the people I worked with on films were so well known,’ she said. ‘When I met Mike Myers I thought he was an electrician on the set. Of course, I knew who Michael Caine was and was excited when he watched me perform one day.’ Once she was invited to Las Vegas by Liberace to the opening of his restaurant. ‘He hugged me and said he enjoyed royalty,’ she said. ‘I couldn’t believe it.’ Despite the comedic value of her appearances, Mrs Charles has a deep respect for the Royal Family. She said: ‘The Queen is absolutely amazing and I have nothing but respect and admiration for her and the Royal Family. They are the heart of this country.’ Asked if she has ever met the Queen, she said: ‘I never talk about that,’ but added: ‘The Queen is funny too, she has got a sense of humour.’ Mrs Charles turned down roles which she felt were disrespectful – including, she claims, one in the Ali G movie with Sacha Baron Cohen. ‘He wanted the Queen’s knickers to fall down as she got in a limo, but I drew the line at that,’ she said. Two years younger than the real Queen, she is withdrawing from the limelight after a battle with arthritis. Reflecting on her career, Mrs Charles said: ‘I really will miss it. People always ask me what the highlight has been, but honestly every time I did something, that was the highlight at the time.’","It began in 1971 when Jeanette Charles had a portrait of herself painted for her late husband Kenneth .

"The Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee claimed Wednesday that his Democratic counterpart secretly colluded with the Internal Revenue Service to bring about the targeting of conservatives that has gripped politics-watchers for nearly a year. If true, it would mark the first involvement of an elected politician in a nearly year-long scandal that involved the IRS breaking the law and playing political favorites. California Rep. Darrell Issa charged in a letter that Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings put a nonprofit tea party group called True the Vote on the IRS's radar by asking the tax agency for information about the organization's activities and its growing corps of volunteers. When the IRS later targeted the tea party-linked group and its founder, Catherine Engelbrecht, for years of special scrutiny – as it did with hundreds of other right-leaning groups that sought exemptions from federal income taxes – its letters employed language nearly identical to what Cummings' staff had written the IRS. Liberal groups, generally sailed through the application process quickly. Scroll down for video . Emails the House Oversight Committee got just last week show Maryland Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings appearing to plant questions for the IRS to ask a conservative group that applied for tax-exempt status . Catherine Engelbrecht, founder of True the Vote and other tea party-linked groups, has told Congress she was targeted by several government agencies -- and the timeline now looks connected to Rep. Cummings' inquiries . True the Vote has attracted barbs from liberal politicians for demanding that states purge dead and ineligible voters from election rolls. The group also supports a national voter-ID requirement, a deal-breaker among all but a handful of Democrats. Cummings' requests were disclosed in emails that Issa said came to the attention of House investigators only last week, following a GOP grilling of IRS Commissioner John Koskinen. The IRS has only grudgingly provided documents that Issa's committee has demanded, and has stonewalled on thousands more pages that are the subject of subpoenas. 'The IRS and the Oversight Minority' Issa said in a statement, referring to Cummings, 'made numerous requests for virtually identical information from True the Vote, raising concerns that the IRS improperly shared protected taxpayer information with Rep. Cummings’ staff.' Other emails indicate that Lois Lerner, the former IRS official who now faces a likely Contempt of Congress vote and possible criminal prosecution for allegedly violating the 'equal protection' rights of conservatives, shared copies of True the Vote's tax returns with Cummings' office. The Maryland Democrat, said Issa, demanded that True the Vote send 'copies of all training materials used for volunteers, affiliates, or other entities.' Tax headache: Lois Lerner risks being criminally prosecuted and held in Contempt of Congress for her role in IRS abuses linked to anti-conservative bias . Five days later the IRS sent the Texas conservative group an email requesting 'a copy of yours volunteer registration form ... the process you use to assign volunteers ... how you keep your volunteers in teams,' and 'how your volunteers are deployed ... following the training they receive by you.' Lerner became personally involved with Cummings' requests in January 2013 when she asked Holly Paz, an underling, 'Did we find anything?' Getting a negative response, Lerner told Paz to 'check tomorrow please.' Three days after that exchange, Cummings received the tax return copies. He never shared them with Republicans on the committee, something Issa says he had an obligation to do. A year later, the Democrat denied during a committee hearing that he had worked with the IRS to target True the Vote. 'We want to get to the bottom of how these coincidences happened,' the group's attorney Cleta Mitchell testified in February, 'and we’re going to try to figure out whether ... there was any staff of this committee that might have been involved in putting True the Vote on the radar screen of some of these federal agencies.' Cummings leapt up and asked for permission to interrupt. 'What she just said,' he insisted, 'is absolutely incorrect and not true.' He will likely clash again with Issa on Thursday, when the Oversight Committee meets to consider a measure calling on the entire House to declare that Lerner is in Contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions about the targeting scheme. In two hearings she has invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination; Republicans secured a party-line vote this year declaring that Lerner waived that right by offering a self-serving opening statement before saying she was done talking. Oversight sheriff: Rep. Darrell Issa is demanding answers from his counterpart Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the Oversight Committee that Issa chairs . Lerner, who has refused to testify about her role in the IRS's political favoritism, is accused of taking her cues from Cummings in a bid to hobble a tea party group that focuses on voting fairness . In addition to written IRS demands from Lerner and other IRS officials, Engelbrecht found herself hectored with sudden on-site visits from several other government agencies after her organization filed its application for so-called 501(c)(4) status, a designation that would allow it to operate tax-free while providing a benefit to the public. One by one the FBI; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the Occupational Health and Safety Administration; and the Texas Commission on Environment Quality – an partner organization of the federal Environmental Protection Agency – descended on her with written demands and licenses to inspect her property. ATF demanded to see her family's firearms. The Obama administration has pledged that it would pursue its own aggressive investigation of the IRS's politically motivated activities. Barbara Bosserman, a trial attorney within the IRS's civil-rights enforcement division, has been appointed to lead that probe. Conservatives point out that Bosserman may not be an impartial sleuth since she 'maxed out' on her legal eligibility to donate to President Obama's successful political campaigns.","Emails show Maryland Democratic Rep.

"Listening in: UK spy agencies want to install . 'black box' surveillance devices to . monitor citizens' use of online services. Picture posed by model . UK spy agencies want to install 'black box' surveillance devices across the country's communications networks to monitor internet use, it emerged today. A report by an influential committee of MPs tells how spooks are keen to implement a nationwide surveillance regime aimed at logging nearly everything Britons do and say online. The spy network will rely on a technology known as Deep Packet Inspection to log data from communications ranging from online services like Facebook and Twitter, Skype calls with family members and visits to pornographic websites. But civil liberties and privacy campaigners have reacted with outrage, saying that the technology will give the government a greater surveillance capability than has ever been seen. The report by Parliament's . Intelligence and Security Committee, published on Tuesday, gives UK . intelligence agencies' perspective on the government's draft . Communications Data Bill, which is intended to update surveillance . powers. The government . argues that swift access to communications data is critical to the fight . against terrorism and other high-level crime, but it has been delayed . after the Liberal Democrats dropped support for the bill. MI5 . chief Jonathan Evans told the committee: 'Access to communications data . of one sort or another is very important indeed. It’s part of the . backbone of the way in which we would approach investigations. 'I . think I would be accurate in saying there are no significant . investigations that we undertake across the service that don’t use . communications data because of its ability to tell you the who and the . when and the where of your target’s activities.' The Bill has encountered stiff . opposition, but authorities have been at pains to stress that they're . not seeking unfettered access to the content of emails or recordings of . phone calls. Instead, they . claim, what they are after is what many have described as 'outside of . the envelope' information: Who sends a message, where and how it is . sent, and who receives it. For . example, while the email addresses of senders and recipients would be . available to agencies, they would still need to obtain a court order for . access to the contents of the emails. A . similar situation would apply in the case of mobile phone calls, with . the callers' identities and locations available to agencies, along with . the time of the call and its duration, but agents restricted from listening without authorisation from the courts. The Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ) on the west of Cheltenham: Spooks say swift access to communications data is critical to the fight . against terrorism and other high-level crimes . Critics have said that in effect . there is no way to reliably separate such communications data from the . content of messages and calls, and that giving easy access to the former . would also open the way to access of the latter. Campaigners also challenged the . government over how it could criticise totalitarian regimes overseas which . may be using similar systems to crack down on dissent. Spymaster: MI5 Director General Jonathan Evans said access to communications data is 'very important indeed' to UK security . Emma Carr, deputy director of privacy . and civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'Using . highly intrusive technology to monitor how people use the internet is . not something that a civil society should be using on every citizen. 'The danger is that the whole . communication, including content, is inspected and potentially stored, . intruding on people’s privacy in a dangerous and unprecedented way. 'This sends a highly dangerous signal . to regimes around the world who are looking for justification to use . similar equipment on their populations. 'The fact that at no point does the . Government need court approval, either to install, use or look at data . gathered is a major concern and if it is to be used as a last resort . should only be done so on the highest judicial authority.' Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, which campaigns for freedom online, said the real threat was posed by the addition of what the report calls the 'filter' to the surveillance system. He explained that this would work as a kind of search engine for everyone's private data, linking it together from the various online and telecoms accounts people use to communicate. 'The really worrying part of this is the ""filter"" the government wants to build,' he told MailOnline. 'This would put data from your mobile phone, email, web history and phones together, so the police can tell who your friends are, what your opinions are, where you've been and with who. 'It could make instant surveillance of everything you do possible at the click of a button.' A key challenge for the government . has been extracting that information from overseas service providers - . companies based in Silicon Valley or elsewhere that might not feel . obliged to comply with a British spy agency's request. While the government has insisted that it will not invade the privacy of citizens' communications without a court order, there are fears that installing deep packet inspection across the UK will nevertheless give them the capability. Luckily, there is a range of software for both computers and mobile devices, much of it free, that can encrypt communications to keep it secure. 1) iSafeguard Freeware 6.2: This program will secure emails and files using strong encryption and syncs with most popular email clients. 2) HushMail: This web-based email service uses a Java applet to encode emails with 1024bit public key encryption. 3) GnuPG: This Linux-only application is an open-source replacement for PGP (Pretty Good Privacy). PGP was one of the first military-grade encryption products available to the general public. It was in those cases, the committee's report  said, that the surveillance devices would come in handy. 'It . is important for the agencies that there is some means of accessing . communications data from uncooperative overseas communications service . providers,' the report said. The report said the probes would . work using 'deep packet inspection,' so-called because it allows those . intercepting packets of data to comb through their content. The . services that might be targeted by the probes weren't identified, . although Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail, and Google Chat are all popular in . Britain and were among the services named elsewhere in the report. Britain's surveillance plans remain in draft form, and the report carried several critiques of the government's proposals. But in general it rejected opponents' claims that the surveillance regime was unworkable or oppressive, warning that the pace of technological change would soon 'have a serious impact on the intelligence and security agencies' unless the new surveillance powers were introduced. The report also appeared to reject suggestions that encryption might allow those trying to maintain the privacy of their communications to baffle government monitoring. 'We have heard that the government has (redacted) options in dealing with the challenge encryption poses,' the report said. The next two paragraphs were completely blanked out. Mr Killock of the Open Rights Group said it was unlikely that the government had the capability to crack advanced digital encryption.","MPs' report outlines spooks' take on the draft Communications Data Bill .

"Scientists hope to be able to beat obesity within years by 'rewiring' brains to reduce appetites after researchers made a significant breakthrough. They hope to develop drugs that can control the amount we eat from infancy, or later in life for those who are overweight. It is hoped the findings could lead to a 'permanent solution' for tackling obesity within years. Obesity battle: Scientists hope to develop a pill which can stop obesity within years after a breakthrough by researchers at the University of East Anglia . Scientists had thought nerve cells in . the brain associated with appetite control were produced in the womb and could not be changed. But new research has identified a group of stem cells capable of triggering new appetite-regulating neurons in mice in an area of the brain known as the hypothalmus. The University of East Anglia scientists hope to apply their findings to humans within five to 10 years. Dr Mohammad Hajihosseini said: 'Unlike dieting, translation of this discovery could eventually offer a permanent solution for tackling obesity. 'Loss or malfunctioning of neurons in the hypothalamus is the prime cause of eating disorders such as obesity. 'Until recently we thought all of . these nerve cells were generated during the embryonic period and so the . circuitry that controls appetite was fixed. 'But . this study has shown the neural circuitry that controls appetite is not . fixed in number and could possibly be manipulated numerically to tackle . eating disorders. Weight battle: Children with obese mothers could be given medicine to control their appetite at birth . 'Our hope is that drugs could effect these stem cells in such a way that more appetite suppressing neurons are produced, or even appetite suppressing ones. This means babies, for instance, with obese mothers could be primed from infancy to eat less. 'But although our main objective is to combat obesity with this, it could also work at the other end of the spectrum. Anorexics could be made to produce more appetite promoting neurons, so they eat more.' The findings were published in the Journal of Neuroscience. Obesity has reached epidemic proportions globally causing rising rates of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, arthritis and cancer. The economic burden on the NHS in the UK is estimated to be more than £5billion annually. In the US, the healthcare cost tops $60billion. The researchers say their findings could help develop drugs that could one day lead to a permanent intervention in infancy for those predisposed to obesity, or later in life as the disease becomes apparent. More than 1.4billion adults worldwide are overweight and more than half a billion are obese. And at least 2.8million people die each year as a result of being overweight or obese. The hypothalamus section of the brain regulates sleep and wake cycles, energy expenditure, appetite, thirst, hormone release and many other critical biological functions. Looking specifically at the nerve cells that regulate appetite, the researchers used a genetic mapping technique tracking the development of stem cells and cells derived from them, at desired time points during the life of an animal. They established a population of brain cells called 'tanycytes' behave like stem cells and add new neurons to the appetite-regulating circuitry of the mouse brain after birth and into adulthood. Dr Mohammad Hajihosseini said: 'The next step is to define the group of genes and cellular processes that regulate the behaviour and activity of tanycytes. 'This information will further our understanding of brain stem cells and could be exploited to develop drugs that can modulate the number or functioning of appetite-regulating neurons. 'Our long term goal of course is to translate this work to humans, which could take up to five or ten years. It could lead to a permanent intervention in infancy for those predisposed to obesity, or later in life as the disease becomes apparent.'","Stem cells in the brain trigger neurons that control our appetites .

"A fraudster nicknamed 'Fizzy' because of his love of champagne has been jailed for eight years for conning vulnerable pensioners out of their life savings. Frank Onyeachonam ran the UK end of global lottery scam that was orchestrated from his native Nigeria for seven years to fund his lavish millionaire’s lifestyle. It  involved hundreds of perpetrators in several countries, detectives say. In the UK, 38-year-old Onyeachonam conned pensioners out of sums from £2,000 to £600,000, deliberately targeting his victims because they were potentially vulnerable to his tactics. Fraudster Frank Onyeachonam who has been jailed for eight years  after he conned vulnerable pensioners out of their life savings with a bogus lottery scam to fund his millionaire's lifestyle . Ill-gotten gains: Onyeachonam, of Canning Town, east London, had so much cash he once spelled his name out in it and posted a picture of it on Facebook . While he bled them of their life savings, Onyeachonam  enjoyed a life of fast cars, champagne and designer clothes. Pictures he posted on Facebook show he spent the cash on Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Armani designer clothes, Rolex watches, Porsches and Maseratis. He even stuck wads of what look like £50 notes in his Buzz Lightyear toy. Onyeachonam, of Canning Town, east London, was found guilty at the Old Bailey of conspiracy to defraud following a three-week trial. Lawrencia Emenyonu, 38, and Bernard Armah, 51, both of Wood Green, north London, were also found guilty of money laundering. All three denied the charges. Emenyonu was jailed for 18 months while her partner Armah received an eight-month term. Judge Rebecca Poulet QC, said there had been 'some very serious outcomes' for the victims caught up in the scam. She told married father-of-two Onyeachonam: 'I judge your culpability to be very high. This was a very well thought out operation, sophisticated in both its planning and its operation. 'Mr Onyeachonam, you targeted these individuals because they were elderly and likely to agree and be tricked by this scam.' This was demonstrated in the fraudster’s own notes in which he described them as 'crippled, old or poor', she said. One of the Rolex watches Onyeachonam spent his ill-gotten gains on . Lavish lifestyle: A property in  Nigeria belonging to fraudster Frank Onyeachonam who has been jailed for eight years at the Old Bailey . A regular in members' clubs Onyeachonam's favourite drink was Ace of Spades champagne (pictured in the door) costing between £300 and £500 a bottle. His fridge was also stacked with Dom Pérignon (top shelf left) and Moët & Chandon (middle shelf) The harm that was caused to these people could not just be calculated in financial terms but also on the 'dreadful impact ' on their lives, mental capacity and relationships with loved-ones. The judge went on: 'You contested the case in the face of powerful evidence. You demonstrated the arrogance that you must have carried with you throughout this fraud by continuing after you knew that the police had raided your premises.' The ruse - known as an 'advance fee' fraud - saw Onyeachonam send victims emails claiming they had won millions of pounds on a non-existent Australian lottery and requesting a charge to release their winnings. He even stuck wads of what look like £50 notes in his Buzz Lightyear toy . Onyeachonam spent the cash on Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Armani designer clothes, Rolex watches,  Porches and Maseratis . Onyeachonam was seen as the key figure in the UK but police suspect a criminal network was in place in several countries around the world . When they raided his luxury apartment in Canary Wharf police discovered an 'Aladdin’s cave' of evidence pointing to an advanced fee scam . Investigators traced 14 victims - mainly from the U.S. but including one from Britain - who were defrauded of a total of around £900,000. But detectives believe this is the 'tip of the iceberg' with evidence suggesting there may have been as many as 400 victims and the sum may be as high as £30 million. Onyeachonam was seen as the key figure in the UK but police suspect a criminal network was in place in several countries around the world. Authorities found an alleged co-conspirator abroad had an email containing the details of more than 100,000 potential victims. Detectives believe this is the 'tip of the iceberg' with evidence suggesting there may have been as many as 400 victims and the sum may be as high as £30 million . The defendant was thought to have started working on the scam almost immediately after he arrived in the UK from Nigeria in 2005, and was said to have carried on into 2012 while he was on bail following his arrest the year before. His crimes were uncovered in a three-year operation led by the National Crime Agency with assistance from the Postal Inspection Service and Internal Revenue Service in the US. When they raided his luxury apartment in Canary Wharf police discovered an 'Aladdin’s cave' of evidence pointing to an advanced fee scam. Among 200 exhibits were notebooks containing the names, addresses, cash tallies and other personal details relating to 406 people. Police estimate that the fraud is likely to have run to at least £5 million and possibly as high as £30 million if all those in the notebooks suffered losses. Onyeachonam, at his London apartment in Canary Wharf, overlooking the Millennium Dome . Partners in crime: Bernard Armah and Lawrencia Emenyonu who were jailed  for their part in a scam involving fraudster Frank Onyeachonam . Steve Brown, senior officer in the NCA’s cyber crime unit, said the majority of Onyeachonam’s victims were from America. He is thought to have selected his targets from a database known among fraudsters as a 'suckers list', which includes people who are believed to be susceptible to the tactics. Mr Brown said: 'Victims were sent an email from an alias used by Onyeachonam saying they had won an Australian lottery. They would be directed to ring him and he would say ‘if you send me money I will then release your lottery funds’.' The lottery ‘winnings’ ranged from £2 million to £9 million and once they sent on cash victims were 'hooked' into the 'unrelenting' scam, he said. He added: 'Once they’ve got their claws into someone they won’t stop. As long as they keep sending them money they will keep going until there’s nothing left.' Onyeachonam, 38, of Canning Town, east London, was found guilty at the Old Bailey of conspiracy to defraud . Using the alias Dr Jeff Lloyds, Onyeachonam built up a rapport with his victims and continued extracting money from some for as long as seven years. In order to make the required payments several victims took out high interest loans, forcing them to come out of retirement to repay the debts. Some of those exploited by Onyeachonam suffered the added trauma of falling under suspicion themselves as they were used as 'pawns' in the criminal network to launder the proceeds of the fraud by sending on money from other victims or setting up business accounts. Mr Brown said the scam had made a 'mental wreck' of victims, 'hammering' their life’s savings, forcing them to lose their homes and leaving them isolated from their friends and families. Emails showed victims pleaded with Onyeachonam to send them money to pay for healthcare, while some died before he could be brought to justice. The British victim was left with debts of £90,000 and was forced to sell her home, move into rented accommodation and return to work in an attempt to stave off bankruptcy. An American victim lost her dream home and she no longer speaks to her sister or friend. She described how the scam made her feel like she had been 'raped over and over again'. While he left a trail of destitution and devastation in his wake, Onyeachonam enjoyed the high life from the fruits of his deception. Mr Brown said he lived a 'cash rich' lifestyle, earning the nickname 'Fizzy' for his taste for expensive champagne. Photographs show him surrounded by cash and bubbly in nightclubs. His car collection included Porsches and Maseratis while his Thames-side flat was full of luxury brands such as Gucci and Louis Vuitton when it was searched by police. Onyeachonam was the key figure as far as the 'UK nexus' was concerned but detectives believe this was part of an international enterprise. The alleged mastermind or 'chairman' of the network is based in Nigerian capital Lagos and he is currently under investigation by authorities there. Asked how many people were working on the global scam, Mr Brown said: 'Name a country and there seems to be a connection. It’s been almost impossible for us to track everybody down. They’ve all got responsibility for their own country.' The prosecution has moved for a confiscation hearing for Onyeachonam.","Frank Onyeachonam, from London, ran the UK end of global lottery scam .

"Lance Armstrong has pleaded guilty to hitting two parked cars with his SUV in Aspen and then leaving the scene without reporting the incident. Armstrong's girlfriend, Anna Hansen, originally told police she was behind the wheel in the December 28 accident in icy conditions but later confessed that she lied to avoid media attention. She said it was a 'joint decision' between them for her to take responsibility for the crash. The cyclist entered his plea by mail on Friday under a plea agreement with prosecutors, closing the case and avoiding a court appearance. Lance Armstrong reached a plea deal with prosecutors and will now avoid a court date after crashing into two parked cars and fleeing the scene in December . Hansen (left) eventually admitted that Armstrong was driving when the accident took place, which police confirmed with a valet at the Aspen Art Museum where the two had attended an event . Armstrong was due to appear in court on March 17. Court records show Armstrong paid $238.50 to cover court fees and a $150 fine. Deputy District Attorney Andrea Bryan said that it is fairly common for people to reach plea deals in such cases and to enter pleas by mail. Careless driving can be punished by up to 90 days in jail but Bryan says jail time is rare. Hansen was initially cited, having told officers that, while driving the couple back home from an Aspen Art Museum party and going too fast for the snowy conditions. She said she lost control of her vehicle and struck two parked cars before speaking to the owner and offering to pay for the damage. Armstrong crashed into two parked vehicles in Aspen and fled the scene before police arrived . Armstrong's own vehicle was also badly damaged in the collision . One of the officers involved said due to suspicions over this story, he then spoke to a valet for the art museum party, who told him it had been Armstrong who had driven away from the event. The report added that Hansen subsequently admitted she had been the passenger and that Armstrong had been the driver. Hansen is quoted in the report as saying that her taking the blame had been 'a joint decision' between her and Armstrong made in a bid to avoid negative headlines. The charges were transferred to the 43-year-old former cyclist. Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France victories and banned for life from racing in 2012 after he admitted using performance-enhancing drugs.

"Iain Duncan Smith, pictured, has waded into the tax row engulfing Ed Miliband by saying the Labour leader ‘seems to have managed to have avoided tax’ Iain Duncan Smith has waded into the tax row engulfing Ed Miliband by saying the Labour leader ‘seems to have managed to have avoided tax’. The Work and Pensions Secretary stood by his comments last night despite a furious response from Mr Miliband’s office. A Labour spokesman said that unless Mr Duncan Smith retracted his comment he would face being known ‘for his dishonesty as well as his incompetence’. But a source close to the minister said he had no intention of apologising. The intervention comes a week after Mr Miliband was accused of benefiting from a controversial tax avoidance scheme. The Labour leader and his family used a ‘deed of variation’ to divide up ownership of the family home in North London. The deed – which changes the terms of someone’s will – is used almost exclusively to reduce death duty bills in a legal form of tax avoidance. Mr Miliband – who has spent the past fortnight attacking corporate tax dodgers – denies the charges, saying he has never made any money from the arrangement. Mr Duncan Smith made his comments during an interview with BBC News. He said: ‘Labour are completely at odds with each other and can’t seem to get their lines right, whether it’s on the Health Service or whether it’s on people who pay tax, let alone the man who runs the Labour Party, who seems to have managed to have avoided tax as well.’ Mr Miliband’s spokesman called on the Work and Pensions Secretary to retract his comment. ‘Iain Duncan Smith brings politics into disrepute by repeating what is a straightforward lie,’ the spokesman said. ‘Ed Miliband has made sure all taxes due have been paid. ‘The people admitting to avoiding tax are Tory donors and the people refusing to act to tackle tax avoidance are Iain Duncan Smith, George Osborne and David Cameron. Mr Duncan Smith should retract and apologise today. If he does not, he will be known for his dishonesty as well as his incompetence.’ Last week, Mr Miliband vociferously denied any claims that the deed of variation could have saved him and his brother David thousands of pounds. Both deny any wrongdoing and say they have paid all the tax owed. The Labour leader said: ‘The deed of variation is something that my mother did 20 years ago. That was just a decision she made. I paid tax as a result of that transaction, I’ve avoided no tax in that. No doubt the Conservative Party wants to smear mud but frankly it’s not going to work.’ The row erupted with Mr Miliband, left, facing another headache with the re-emergence of former Labour candidate Karie Murphy, right, who was embroiled in a vote-rigging scandal . The row erupted with Mr Miliband facing another headache with the re-emergence of a former Labour candidate who was embroiled in a vote-rigging scandal. Karie Murphy was suspended from Labour along with a Unite official amid accusations that the union signed up local people to the party to ensure her selection as the candidate for the Falkirk seat. They were both reported to police before being reinstated in the party after being cleared of wrongdoing in subsequent inquiries. Miss Murphy, who is a close friend of Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, is now understood to be in the running for the marginal Halifax seat. The union has donated more than £10million to the party under the leadership of Mr Miliband, who has consistently refused to publish Labour’s secret report into the Falkirk affair. Top Tories swapped emails discussing how to smear Labour MPs with paedophile allegations, it was claimed yesterday. A series of the messages between staff at Conservative Campaign Headquarters were allegedly sent to a national newspaper journalist by accident. Labour MP Tom Watson made the extraordinary claim in an online blog. He said he was told that the journalist was mistakenly copied in on emails in which Tory officials speculated about which Labour MPs were paedophiles. The MP claimed the alleged messages meant that senior Conservative officers were either withholding ‘vital intelligence’ from the police or engaging in a ‘smear campaign’ against their opponents. Mr Watson, former Labour Party deputy chairman and general election co-ordinator, wrote to David Cameron about the alleged emails last month. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps replied to Mr Watson saying he had looked into the claims and found no evidence to back them up. Separately, a senior executive at the newspaper told Mr Watson the emails in fact related to well-established links between senior Labour politicians and notorious campaign group, the Paedophile Information Exchange. A Tory Party spokesman said last night that Mr Watson’s allegations were ‘completely false and without foundation’.","IDS said the Labour leader 'seems to have managed to have avoided tax'

"A white teenager who pleaded guilty to murder and a hate crime for killing a black man by running him over in his pick-up truck, apologised to his victim's family in court today. Deryl Dedmon, 19, spoke of his remorse before he received two life sentences for the June 26 death of James Craig Anderson, a 47-year-old car plant worker. The judge called the horrific killing a 'stain on the state of Mississippi'  and Dedmon's shackles rattled as he turned and faced the Anderson family. 'I . am sincerely sorry. I do take full responsibility for my actions on . that night. I pray for y'all's family every day... and that God will . soften your hearts to forgive me,' said Dedmon. Remorse: Deryl Dedmon, 19,  apologized James Craig Anderson's family for his murder and said . 'I was young. I was dumb. I was ignorant ...I do not ask y'all to forget, but I do ask y'all to forgive' Charged: Deryl Dedmon, received two life sentences for the murder of James Anderson in the attack on June 26 . Members of both families, sitting on opposite sides of a wooden court bench, wiped away tears. 'I . was young. I was dumb. I was ignorant... I was not raised the way that I . acted that night. I was raised in a godly house. As I stand before you . today, I am a changed man. I am a godly man. God has showed me to see no . colors. God showed me that we are all made in the image of God so we . are all based on the same thing... I do not ask y'all to forget, but I . do ask y'all to forgive.' Dedmon admitted that he and a group of white teens were partying in Puckett, a small town outside the capital city, when he suggested they find a black man to harass and went to Jackson because of its majority-black population. They found Anderson before dawn outside a hotel. He was beaten before Dedmon ran over him. Prosecutors said Dedmon and others had targeted blacks for harassment before, usually homeless or drunk people who weren't likely to report it to police. Dedmon, a slight, blonde man wearing a blue jumpsuit, looked down as prosecutors described the killing. The victim's sister, Barbara Anderson Young, fought back tears when she addressed the court. 'My brother Craig would give you the shirt off of his back. Because of my brother, James Craig Anderson, our lives were richer, with love, respect and a love of God,' she said.

'We, the Anderson family, are praying . for racial reconciliation not just in Mississippi but all over this . land and country. We are praying for the defendant, Dedmon, and his . family that they find peace.' Anderson was described as someone who loved to sing in his church choir and was remembered for his sense of humour. Hinds County Circuit Judge Jeff Weill Sr. had the last word. 'Your prejudice has brought shame upon you and placed a great stain on the state of Mississippi. Whatever excuse you may offer for what you have done, forget that. There's no excuse that you can offer for the family of Mr. Anderson or to your fellow Mississippians who have to try to reconcile the horrible damage you have caused,' Weill said. Savage attack: CCTV footage shows the pick-up truck driven by Deryl Dedmon, 18, charging towards 49-year-old James Anderson, circled, in a parking lot in Jackson, Mississippi . On a mission: Dedmon allegedly told friends at a party, 'let's got f**k some n*****s', according to police . Dead: Mr Anderson was killed instantly after being struck by the green pick-up truck in the Jackson parking lot . Weill recalled the 1964 killings of three civil rights workers who were murdered and buried in an earthen dam in a rural area in what became known as 'Mississippi Burning.' 'All the hard work we have done to move our state forward from that earthen dam in Neshoba County to here has been stained by you. A stain that will take years to fade,' the judge said. Senseless: A second teenager, John Rice, has been charged with simple assault for his part in the attack, and is free on a $5,000 bond . The case received widespread attention after a video of Anderson's death was obtained by news organisations. The video, taken by a hotel surveillance camera, shows a green Ford truck back up in the hotel parking lot, then lunge forward. Anderson's shirt is illuminated in the headlights before he disappears under the vehicle. Police said Dedmon was driving the truck and later bragged that he ran over Anderson, using a racial slur to describe him. Dedmon was indicted for capital murder, which in Mississippi carries a sentence of death or life in prison without parole, but District Attorney Robert Shuler Smith said prosecutors couldn't have gotten a conviction. For capital murder, there must be an underlying offense, which had been robbery. Smith said that the investigation revealed that the group did not take Anderson's wallet, as investigators first believed. Anderson's family also asked prosecutors not to pursue the death penalty, saying they oppose it. They have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against seven teens, including two young girls who were allegedly in the truck with Dedmon. One of the teens, John Aaron Rice, is charged with simple assault in the case. Authorities said he left the scene in another vehicle before Anderson was killed. Rice has pleaded not guilty and is free on a $5,000 bond. The FBI has been investigating the case, too, and the judge told Dedmon that his guilty plea in state court would not prevent him from facing federal charges. Smith said after the hearing there may be additional arrests and promised more details at a news conference later today.

"A father left his two-year-old daughter in a hot locked car in the parking lot of a  Long Island shopping center while he indulged in some retail therapy inside. Melvin Marroquin, 30, was shopping with his parents on Thursday afternoon while his toddler daughter sweltered inside his Nissan Frontier pick where the temperature reached 120 degrees. A shopper heard her cries and noticed the little girl locked in the car with the windows wound up and called police to rescue her around 12:40pm. Near tragedy: Melvin Marroquin admitted to police that he left his toddler daughter in his locked pickup at the height of Thursday's heat for 25 minutes . Upsetting: Police officers Aaron Klein and Derek Mangi smashed the car window and pulled the toddler from the car. They said she was extremely hot to the touch and her hair was plastered to her head and shoulders with sweat . When police arrived, the girl was suffering serious heat exhaustion. 'She was beet red, and there were drips of sweat just coming off of her face and she looked to be in a lot of pain and agony at that time,' police officer Aaron Klein told NBC New York. 'It was beyond hot inside that car.' Officers had to break the window to get her out of the car, by which time she was lethargic and couldn't speak. Officer . Derek Mangi said it was 'very upsetting holding her and feeling hot how . she was. It was scary,' adding that the child would almost certainly . have died if they hadn't rescued her. They rushed her to an air-conditioned store nearby and gave her water to drink. Shopping spree: Marroquin and his parents shopped at Marshall's in Huntington as his little girl was sitting in her car-seat in his locked pickup in 120-degree heat . Facing the heat: Melvin Marroquin faced a judge Friday morning and was charged with reckless endangerment and child endangerment charges . Marroquin emerged from the store laden with shopping bags 10 minutes after police had rescued his daughter from the heat. He and his family are visiting Long Island from their home in Maryland and had spent the day with various family members and five children, he told police. Marroquin initially told the officers that he had forgotten his daughter was in the car, before admitting that he'd left the girl there for 25 minutes while he shopped. Marroquin has been arrested for child endangerment and reckless endangerment. It's unclear if his parents, the little girl's grandparents, were aware that she was in the car. She was taken to Huntington Hospital with heat exhaustion before being released into the custody of her mother.","Melvin Marroquin, 30, left his two-year-old daughter in a locked car Thursday .

"The former star player of a Texas university basketball team has received the devastating news that he will not be able to pursue a career in the NBA. Baylor University center Isaiah Austin, a former standout at Grace Prep in Arlington, has been forced to end his playing career after being diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder. Austin was found to have Marfan syndrome, a disorder that affects the body’s connective tissue. Scroll down for video . Devastating blow: Isaiah Austin spoke to ESPN after doctors recommended he stop playing basketball immediately when he was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome . Baylor coach Scott Drew said Sunday in a news release that the discovery means Austin will not be able to play in the NBA. The seven-foot-one Austin averaged 12.1 points and 6.9 rebounds this season and announced in April that he would leave Baylor after his sophomore season. The NBA draft is Thursday. According to the Mayo Clinic, complications from Marfan syndrome can weaken the aorta, the artery that supplies blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Drew says he hopes Austin will return to school and finish his degree. Major talent: Austin was projected as a first-round pick in the NBA draft, which is just days away . Obstacles: He overcame becoming blind in one eye to play center at Baylor University and had his sights set on an NBA career . 'This is devastating news, but Isaiah . has the best support system anyone could ask for, and he knows that all . of Baylor Nation is behind him,' Baylor head coach Scott Drew said. 'His . health is the most important thing, and while it's extremely sad that . he won't be able to play in the NBA, our hope is that he'll return to . Baylor to complete his degree and serve as a coach in our program.' Austin had already overcome the odds when he became blind in his right eye during middle school, a disability he kept quiet about until earlier this year. A clearly emotional Austin spoke to ESPN after his mother drove though the night Thursday from Kansas to Dallas to deliver the news to her son in person. 'They said I wouldn't be able to play basketball anymore,' he said in a shaking voice. 'They found the gene in my blood sample and they told me that my arteries and my heart are enlarged, and that if I overwork myself or push to hard that...my heart could rupture.' Brave: Still coming to terms with the news, Austin was visibly upset but told his supporters his diagnosis is not the end for him, 'It's only the beginning' Medical professionals recommended that Austin stop playing immediately. 'The draft is four days away and you know, I had a dream that my name was going to be called. But uh...I'm sorry (inaudible),' Austin broke off, unable to speak. The brave young athlete managed to pull himself together, and had a message for his fans. 'For all my supporters, I just want to tell them sorry. Sorry they couldn't see me play in the NBA. But it's not the end, you know. It's only the beginning.'","Isaiah Austin, 20, was days away from his NBA dreams coming true when he received devastating news .

"Searched: Tim Lambrinos, pictured, had his home in the northwest of the city searched by police on April 24, 2013 . A well-known Toronto City Hall lobbyist had his home raided in connection with the same police probe into embattled Mayor Rob Ford which resulted in the seizure of the now infamous video of him smoking crack cocaine. According to newly-released court documents Tim Lambrinos, former executive assistant to Councillor Giorgio Mammoliti who also lobbied local government on behalf of several exotic dance firms, had his home in the northwest of the city searched by police on April 24, 2013. But Lambrinos on Friday told the Toronto Star that the raid was simply a case of surveillance gone wrong . 'It's still a mystery,' said Lambrinos. He said officers used a battering ram to smash through his front door and aimed guns at him and his brother, Chris, while they were watching TV. 'They were there for two-and-a-half hours, came out, apologized,' said Lambrinos. 'In the end they didn't take anything.' He claimed that when he asked the police officers to show a warrant, the officers refused, according to the Star. The search warrant documents, released on Friday, detail police surveillance leading them to the area of Lambrinos’ home. The police monitored a red car they allege had picked up firearms in Windsor, a town to the south west of Toronto near the US border at Detroit. The vehicle had parked across the street from Lambrinos’ home. The document states that officers did not witness the occupants leaving the vehicle. Details of the raid emerged in amongst a series of documents related to search warrants executed as part of Project Traveller, a guns and gangs investigation that netted the infamous video of Ford. More than 50 people were arrested in several raids who now face charges of smuggling guns and drugs, and being a part of the Dixon City Bloods gang.

"AB de Villiers hit a sensational unbeaten 162 off just 66 balls as South Africa inflicted the joint-heaviest ever World Cup loss on the West Indies, defeating them by 257 runs. The 31-year-old smashed 17 fours and eight sixes, and plundered 68 runs from the last 3.2 overs, as South Africa made 408 - the second-highest score in a World Cup. The West Indies response never came to fruition as they were bowled out for a paltry 151, despite an impressive half-century from captain Jason Holder, with Imran Tahir claiming his maiden one-day five-for. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cricket World Cup: South Africa hit West Indies with 408-5 . AB de Villiers celebrates his 150 against West Indies at the 2015 Cricket World Cup - the fastest in ODI history . De Villiers plays a shot during his impressive innings, which helped South Africa to 405 runs . The South Africa fans who had made the trip to Sydney had plenty to celebrate as they watched their side win . 12.122..1111212114114411116442.2.444114411226.4114624442641266266 . De Villiers, the No 1 ranked ODI batsman in the world, provided a stunning show of skill, power, precision and ingenuity. He reached his century off 52 balls as he smashed a six back over Holder’s head. Only Kevin O’Brien (50 balls against England in 2011) has scored a quicker World Cup hundred. The South African captain then hit the fastest 150 in a World Cup, off 64 balls, and celebrated reaching the landmark by finishing off the innings with back-to-back sixes. South Africa’s decision to bat first had seemed a poor one initially as they struggled to free the shackles of the opening bowling pair of Jerome Taylor and Holder. The latter dismissed the horribly out-of-form Quinton de Kock for just 12 who, looking to release the building pressure, went after a short ball and could only pick out Andre Russell at point. De Villiers carries a look of focus as he plays a shot on his way to 162 runs from 66 balls for South Africa . De Villiers is congratulated by his team-mate Farhaan Behardien - who himself scored 10 runs not out . As South Africa leave the field after their batting innings, De Villiers (right) is congratulated by Chris Gayle . 413-5 - INDIA vs. Bermuda                         Port-of-Spain, 2007 . 408-5 - SOUTH AFRICA vs. West Indies Sydney, 2015 . 398-5 - SRI LANKA vs. Kenya               Kandy, 1996 . 377-6 - AUSTRALIA vs. South Africa Basseterre, 2007 . 373-6 - INDIA vs. Sri Lanka                 Taunton, 1999 . 372-2 - WEST INDIES vs. Zimbabwe Canberra, 2015 . 370-4 - INDIA vs. Bangladesh                 Dhaka, 2011 . It brought Faf de Plessis to the crease and his century stand with Hashim Amla, who seemed intent on ensuring he batted throughout, helped rebuild their side's innings. Chris Gayle, fresh from his record-breaking 215 against Zimbabwe, first had Du Plessis caught behind for 62, before Amla was trapped plumb in front for 65 two balls later. That was perhaps the worst thing that could have happened, as the destructive De Villiers strode out on to the SCG pitch in the 30th over. Just six boundaries had been hit at that point, five fours and a six, but after 96 runs were thumped off the final five overs, the boundary count stood at 30 fours and 11 sixes. Holder took the brunt of the attack as he conceded 75 runs off his last three overs, having previously had respectable figures of 1-29 from seven. Rilee Rossouw celebrates his 50; he went on to score 61, surprisingly only the fourth highest total . West Indies batsman Marlon Samuels endured a torrid time at the crease, and was dismissed for a duck . Rilee Rossouw made an impressive 61 as he shared a 134-run fourth wicket partnership with De Villiers, while David Miller made a quick-fire 20 and Farhann Behardien an unbeaten 10 as South Africa set a mammoth target of 409. In order to come anywhere close to the target, Gayle, the West Indies’ enigmatic talisman, was going to need replicate his innings against Zimbabwe. But with his last century against South Africa in one-day cricket coming in November 2006, the omens were not good. Kyle Abbott, brought in for the injured Vernon Philander, immediately repaid the faith shown in him as he bowled Gayle for just three in his first over before having Marlon Samuels caught behind for a duck. Imnran Tahir (third right) celebrates with his team-mates after taking the wicket of Lendl Simmons . Tahir (centre) celebrates after West Indies batsman Darren Sammy is stumped by Quinton de Kock . It should have gone from bad to worse as Dwayne Smith was twice dropped, first by Dale Steyn off his own bowling and then by Imran Tahir at mid-on off Abbott. It was the kind of luck the West Indies desperately needed but the slightly controversial dismissal of Jonathan Carter showed that luck was certainly not on their side under the SCG floodlights. Morne Morkel looked to have overstepped his mark by about six inches the ball before Carter picked out the effervescent De Villiers at mid-on, a ball he was convinced should have been a free hit. And Smith’s luck came to an end the very next ball as he holed out to a superb overhead catch from Miller at long-on off Tahir for 31. Kyle Abbott (left) jumps for joy after taking the wicket of Samuels, leaving West Indies 16-2 . Gayle (left) looks dejected, while Jonathan Carter (right) reacts more violently with his bat . It induced another collapse that is becoming the mark of a side that continues to blow hot and cold, as Tahir, the leg spinner with roots in Pakistan, removed Lendl Simmons and Andre Russell for ducks and Darren Sammy for just five, reducing the West Indies to 63-7. Tahir claimed his all-important fifth wicket as Dinesh Ramdin was bowled for 22 by a flighted googly that evaded his defence. Holder refused to be so easily dismissed, despite suffering from what looked like a hip injury and severe cramp that hindered his running. The 23-year-old made 56 before sending a Steyn delivery high into the night sky to be caught by Amla. Sulieman Benn managed to pull Steyn for a single off his last delivery before being caught in the slips by Amla off Morkel. That run ensured the West Indies avoided the heaviest defeat in a World Cup match, a record they now share with Bermuda.

A vet accidentally shot a tranquiliser dart at a zoo employee dressed as a gorilla after mistaking him for the primate. The 35-year-old zoo employee was shot on Monday at Tenerife's Loro Parque Zoo . But the vet had not been informed of the training exercise, and fearing that there was a gorilla on the loose he sprang into action, according to La Opinión de Tenerife. The vet fired the shot - designed for a 400lb gorilla - at the man and hit him in the leg (file photo) The vet fired the shot - designed for a 400lb gorilla - at the man and hit him in the leg. According to the newspaper when the man was located he was in his underwear. He was taken to the University Hospital of the Canary Islands. The zoo said in a statement to MailOnline: Last Monday, Loro Parque simulated the escape of an animal from its enclosure in the gorilla park. 'As part of the procedure, which took place in the security zone of the area and was only attended by authorised personnel of the park, they set off the emergency alarm used in this type of situation. 'Once the various activities and communications were carried out according to protocol, a keeper from the wild mammals team was struck by a tranquiliser shot that the vets use in this kind of situation using a cerbatana.' 'As a result, he was quickly seen by paramedics and immediately taken to Hospital Universitario Canarias, where he was treated and then discharged. 'He has recovered well and is now in good health and is grateful for all the messages of concern he has received. 'As a matter of course, Loro Parque, like all zoos and animal parks, regularly carries out this kind of emergency drill. Zoos around the world carry out animal escape drills - and often they use a human dressed in a gorilla suit as seen here in a Tokyo zoo in 2007 . 'These simulations are designed to guarantee security, emergency measures, and to train people who work in these enclosures.

"Britain's biggest bank HSBC has been dragged into yet another potential scandal over claims  that it set up offshore accounts in Jersey for suspected drug-dealers and fraudsters. HM Revenue & Customs launched an investigation after a whistleblower leaked details of £700million allegedly held in more than 4,000 accounts hidden in the island tax haven. Many of the account-holders are now being probed for tax evasion, while HSBC could face sanctions from regulators if it is found not to have flagged up suspicious deposits to the Jersey authorities. Scandal: HSBC is accused of setting up thousands of accounts in Jersey for clients that include drugs and arms dealers . The latest revelations come just . months after it emerged that HSBC allowed rogue states and drug cartels . to launder billions of pounds through subsidiaries in the US and Mexico. It is expected to face fines of up to £1billion over the affair. Tax accountant Richard Murphy, a . long-time campaigner against Jersey’s tax haven status, said the leaked . HSBC accounts could be the tip of the iceberg, claiming: ‘I don’t see . any reason why HSBC is worse than any other bank in Jersey.’ But he added of HSBC: ‘This bank was . clearly out of control. It confirms what we’ve begun to realise, that . this is a bank that was, during the period that the Reverend Lord . Stephen Green was in charge, the world’s biggest money-launderer.’ Former chairman Lord Green, an ordained priest in the Church of England, is now a trade minister in the Coalition government. Idyllic: Jersey serves as a tax haven where thousands of HSBC customers have their cash. James Blunt is alleged to have deposited more than £2 million in an account there . Those whose account details were . leaked to HMRC are said to include Daniel Bayes, a suspected drug-dealer . now living in Venezuela. Mr Bayes refused to return from South America, . allowing his father, Brian Bayes, to be tried and convicted alone after . police found £500,000 of cannabis at his farm in 2006. HSBC was founded as the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in 1865 to help finance trade links between Europe, India and China. The inspiration came from Scot Thomas Sutherland, who worked for shipping giant P&O and saw the demand in Far East banking facilities. It began building up branches in Asia and printed Thailand's first banknotes after being the first bank to open there in 1888. Recession and political turmoil in the 1930s caused uncertainty and most of the bank's staff became prisoners of the Japanese during the Second World War. But out of the ashes it rebuilt itself on large reserves built up in peace time and was central to rebuilding Hong Kong's economy. In the 1970s it began to focus more on strategies for the UK, buying Midland Bank in 1992 and then making them HSBC in 1999 with a huge re-branding. As the world's second largest bank it serves around 89 million customers in 85 countries  and territories with 7,200 offices and branches worldwide. The list also includes a man convicted . of owning 300 weapons at a property in Devon, three bankers facing . fraud allegations, and a man known as London’s ‘number two computer . crook’, according to the Daily Telegraph. While most of the accounts are held by . rich City bankers and professionals, others were said to have been . opened by people with no obvious legal source of wealth. John Harris, Jersey’s chief of . financial regulation, said he would ‘robustly’ investigate whether rules . had been breached but said tax evasion was ‘ultimately a police . matter’. He insisted that Jersey co-operates . with other nations but said it had no plans to adopt the system used by . most European countries, who automatically pass on financial data about . non-residents to their home tax authority. But Mr Murphy said: ‘What’s the only . reason to offer someone the chance not to tell the tax authorities what . they’re earning? It’s because you know the person you’re dealing with is . a tax evader.’ HSBC said of the leaked list: ‘We are . investigating the reports of an alleged loss of certain client data in . Jersey as a matter of urgency. ‘We have not been notified of any . investigation in relation to this matter by HMRC or any other authority . but, should we receive notification, we will co-operate fully with the . authorities. HSBC remains fully committed to adoption of the highest . global standards including the procedures for the acceptance of . clients.’ HMRC said: ‘We can confirm we have . received the data and we  are studying it. Where we uncover evidence of . tax evasion we will crack down on it.’ Under-fire: HSBC CEO Stuart Gulliver is under huge pressure to clean up his bank's act after scandals at home and abroad .","List of thousands of accounts leaked to HMRC who are now probing individuals for tax evasion and money laundering .

"TV favourite Bob the Builder has had a refurbishment of his own - with a fresh look and a new voice for the next series . TV favourite Bob the Builder has had a refurbishment of his own - with a fresh look and a new voice. Actor Lee Ingleby, who is starring in BBC1 drama Our Zoo, takes over from Neil Morrissey, who voiced the handyman from his launch a decade and a half ago. Also joining the series when it airs next year will be Downton Abbey's Joanne Froggatt - as Bob's business partner Wendy - and Inbetweeners star Blake Harrison, who voices the digger Scoop. Ingleby - also known for his role as Stan Shunpike in Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban - said: 'I was very excited to be given the opportunity to be the voice of such a well-loved character. 'My little nephew is such a huge fan of Bob that I had to jump at the chance. 'Capturing a child's imagination is so important, and I just wish I was half as good at DIY as Bob is.' Froggatt said: 'My godchildren are huge fans of the show so I'm looking forward to seeing their reactions when the new series begins. 'Wendy is a strong and positive female role model and I think it is important that children's television shows positive social values.'

Actor Lee Ingleby (left), who is starring in BBC1 drama Our Zoo, takes over from Neil Morrissey (right), who voiced the handyman from his launch a decade and a half ago . Harrison joked that the show was more family-friendly than his appearances in E4's Inbetweeners, which has also led to a pair of hit spin-off films. 'I'm really excited to be a part of such a long-running, successful series. I'm even more excited to be involved in a project that my daughter can watch before she's 30. 'Working on an animation is completely new to me, but as a method actor I know only one way to prepare for a role, so I've painted myself yellow and am now offering to dig up anything you may need.' Christopher Kennan, executive producer of HIT Entertainment, the firm behind Bob, said: 'While the new series retains the emotional warmth that has always given Bob The Builder a firm place in the hearts of young viewers, it's now packed with more humour than ever before.' Also joining the series when it airs next year will be Downton Abbey's Joanne Froggatt - as Bob's business partner Wendy - and Inbetweeners star Blake Harrison, who voices the digger Scoop .

"Roy Keane's and Sir Alex Ferguson's frosty relationship doesn't appear to have melted after the duo blanked each on a flight home from Paris to Manchester on Wednesday afternoon. The pair both boarded the flight AF1068, departing from Charles de Gaulle airport at 12.55pm, but failed to acknowledge each other throughout the duration of the one-hour-or-so journey. Keane and Ferguson had both been in the French capital to watch Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League last 16 first leg 1-1 draw at home to Chelsea on Tuesday night.

According to the Guardian, Keane sat impassively by the window with former United team-mate, and ITV pundit, Paul Scholes on one side as Ferguson sat three rows back on the other. The publication notes that Ferguson was the first to board the plane with his wife Cathy. As Keane eventually took his seat, it is reported that Mrs Ferguson gave her husband a nudge to indicate who had walked past.

Both Keane and Ferguson have reported their version of events differently at how the former left the Old Trafford outfit in subsequent well-documented autobiographies - to the disdain of each. Prior to that the pair enjoyed a trophy-laden 12-and-a-half-seasons period as manager and player at Manchester United which included seven Premier League titles, four FA Cups and a Champions League crown.

"When toned Daniel Craig stepped out of the sea in his blue trunks in Quantum of Solace, women around the world swooned. But while they may admire the actor's physique as James Bond, it seems they wouldn't want to date such a muscular man in real life. According to a new study, three quarters of British women find buff bodies a turn-off and say they prefer their partner to have a bit of flab. Dr No: British women say they prefer the body of Mr Darcy actor Colin Firth, right, to that of muscular Daniel Craig as James Bond . Similarly, 58 per cent say they would choose a man with love handles over one with a six pack. Celebrities women would choose ahead of hunky 007 actor Craig include Mr Darcy actor Colin Firth, pop star Robbie Williams and Wolf of Wall Street star Leonardo DiCaprio. An overwhelming 96 per cent of women think a dinner date with an abs-obsessed man would be dull. Almost three quarters - 72 per cent - would rather the date was with a chubbier fella so that they would feel more able to indulge in dessert. Of those in a relationship, 94 per cent say they love their man just as he is even if he has piled on a few extra pounds. Again, the vast majority - 91 per cent - of women would rather their man spent 'couple' time with them than pumped iron. Almost as many - 82 per cent - would never nag their other half to work out or diet to improve their physique. Exactly three quarters would rather be hugged by a flabby fella than a gym-hardened muscleman. And 74 per cent admit they would feel self-conscious taking their clothes off in front of a perfectly toned man. Just desserts: Many women said they would rather date a man who wasn't obsessed with working out so they wouldn't feel guilty about tucking into pudding . Nationally, 72 per cent of women have an appetite for an 'Average Joe' while being turned off by men with muscles. But that figure rises to 80 per cent of ladies in the North East and Northern Ireland. Over three quarters - 77 per cent - of women say their ideal man would not have a chiselled torso like James Bond actor Daniel Craig or Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington. Instead, their dream date - cited by 33 per cent - is more likely to be Colin Firth, who memorably emerging from a lake in a wet shirt as Pride and Prejudice's dashing Mr Darcy. Next come Williams (20 per cent), DiCaprio (18 per cent), followed by funnyman James Corden and Twilight movie star Robert Pattinson (each nine per cent). Opposite sides of the fence: The survey was carried out to celebrate the release of Bad Neighbours on DVD, which sees beer-bellied Seth Rogen pitted against toned Zac Efron . Other popular celebrities not renowned for rippling muscles include comic Ricky Gervais, TOWIE's James 'Arg' Argent and The Inbetweeners' James Buckley. Only women aged under 25 tend to be attracted to muscly hunks with 49 per cent of them fancying a man with a six pack compared to just 18 per cent of over 55s. The survey of 1,000 women was carried out to mark the release on DVD and Blu-ray of film Bad Neighbours, which pits buff college boy Zac Efron against beer-bellied family man Seth Rogen. Relationship expert Tracey Cox, who writes the blog Pillow Talk for MailOnline commented: 'Eye candy is never a bad thing but when it comes to choosing a partner, in reality, buff-bodied men are just not what most women want for real-life partners. 'Most women worry about their bodies, so we know the hard work and dedication that goes into getting a buff, toned body. 'A man with a perfect body has probably restricted his diet and alcohol intake and spends hours in the gym. All this suggests he's not going to be much fun as a partner. 'We feel more comfortable with a bit of flab over super toned abs. Women are already under extreme pressure to look a certain way and we figure that a man who appears less critical of his own appearance and obsessed with looks will be less critical of ours.'","Three quarters of British women find buff bodies a turn-off .

"A healthy three-year-old boy died from meningitis four hours after being rushed to hospital just days after his younger brother was given the all-clear from the disease. Shae Button was rushed to the same hospital where eight-monght-old Harvey had been treated for suspected meningitis five days earlier. But despite frantic efforts to save him, Shae tragically succumbed to Meningitis B, meningococcal sceptecimia four hours later. His devastated mother Connie, 21, said: 'What happened to us feels like a cruel joke. Shae Button died of meningitis just four hours after being rushed to the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport after his mother Connie Button noticed he had developed a purple rash on his arm . Shae, three, fell ill just five days after his baby brother Harvey (pictured left with Shae) was given the all-clear by doctors, after being rushed to hospital by his mother Connie (right with Shae) with suspected meningitis . 'I thought I was going to lose my youngest son yet it turned out I would lose the other one instead. 'I felt so happy when doctors told me Harvey was OK and obviously had no idea what was going to happen next. 'I keep thinking was there something I missed? Could I have prevented what happened to Shae?' Harvey, who was born premature and suffered chronic lung disease, was rushed to hospital on April 8 after developing a high temperature. His mother said she became concerned when the eight-month-old lost all interest in his food. She left Shae with his grandparents and took Harvey to the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport where he was given blood tests, and was kept in for observations for 12 hours before doctors gave him the all-clear. Ms Button, from Cwmbran in Wales, said she was overcome with relief as doctors revealed Harvey was fine. 'I had all these images in my head of Harvey in the hospital on drips fighting for his life and I thought, ""Thank god we all don't have to go through this"".' But five days later, on April 13, Shae began to feel unwell. By 6am the next morning the three-year-old had developed a tell-tale purple rash on his arms. He was rushed by ambulance to the Royal Gwent Hospital and diagnosed with meningitis immediately. Shae's mother Connie, said: 'When I was told he had passed away, everything was like a blur. I thought he would pull through. I had prepared myself for a long haul at hospital but didn't expect not to have him' Connie Button has raised more than £10,000 for the charity Meningitis Now, in memory of three-year-old Shae . His mother . said: 'One minute doctors would tell me he was stabilised the next they . rallying around him and they were trying to revive him. 'When . I was told he had passed away, everything was like a blur. I thought he would pull through. I . had prepared myself for a long haul at hospital but didn't expect not to . have him.' She . added: 'Shae had been absolutely fine and was a healthy boy. 'He was always so energetic and full of pop, only had a cold a few times and had always been a bubbly little boy. I just . can’t understand it. 'The shock still hasn’t sunk in, how can he be alive and playing with his toys one moment and dead the next?' 'If I can help at least one family in Shae's name, I will be happy. My son has died but he could end up helping save the lives of hundreds of other children' - Shae's mother Connie Button . She said she is heartbroken that Harvey will grow up never having known his older brother. Ms Button has set up a fund in Shae's memory, raising more than £10,000 for the charity Meningitis Now, in her son's memory to help beat the disease that claimed his life. 'People need to realise that meningitis can affect anyone no matter how healthy you are,' she said. 'If I can help at least one family in Shae’s name I will be happy. My son has died but he could end up helping save the lives of hundreds of other children. 'With Shae there were no warning signs, he wasn’t ill in the days leading up to his death and he wasn’t acting odd or different. 'I think parents need to be more aware when it comes to meningitis. It could save more lives and no one would have to go through what I am having to live with every day. 'There is nothing worse than losing a child and I would not want any mother, or family, or parent, to go through what I have been through, it is absolutely horrendous. 'Things will never be the same again. I don’t think I will ever get over it.' To find out more and donate in Shae's memory visit Ms Button's Facebook page R.I.P Shae Brynley Button. The Meningitis Research Foundation estimates that there are around 3,400 cases of bacterial meningitis and septicaemia every year in the UK and Ireland. This means that every day nine people become ill with the disease. With one in ten people dying, a death will occur almost every day. A further two people will be left with life-altering after effects as severe as brain damage, deafness and multiple amputations. Meningitis vaccines offer excellent protection, but they are not yet available for all forms. So it's vital to know meningitis symptoms and what to do if you suspect someone has meningitis or septicemia. Symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia: . Other signs in babies: .

"When Baloo sung about the 'Bare Necessities' in the 1967 film The Jungle Book, few would have thought that he might have been referring to equipment such as a camera, car and piano. But a photographer from the US has snapped four families of black bear, who have been visiting his Presque Isle garden for the past three years, enjoying the modern trappings of everyday life. And Paul Cyr's hilarious images demonstrate just how inquisitive the often feared creatures can be. Enticed: Mr Cyr placed food in the props to encourage the bears to take up human poses, such as this cub, which he snapped as he appeared to line up his own shot . Name that tune: A musical bear cub takes his seat at the piano and starts to hammer out his favourite melody, which is presumably Bare Necessities . No job too small: The bonnet is lifted as this adult bear looks as if he is about to start trying to find out what has gone wrong with his engine . Here's looking at you kid: It appears that it is not just human teenagers that are obsessed with their looks, as this bear catches a glimpse of itself in the mirror . Paws for thought: After a hard day investigating every nook and cranny of Mr Cyr's garden, this cub decided to put his feet up on the reclining armchair . Get your wagons rolling: Two bears clamber aboard the vehicle ready for the off, while two more check the tyres and suspension . In one, a bear cub acts like a professional as he peers into a camera viewfinder as if he is about to take the perfect photograph himself. Mr Cyr set up props in areas of his garden and waited in a camouflaged hyde to capture the visiting animals in a variety of comical situations. All one young bear needed, as he took his seat at an old rundown piano, was a 'pork-pie' hat and smoking cigarette, to complete the look as a jazz musician. In another image, an adolescent bear appears to be checking its reflection in the mirror. Roll out the barrel: This cub can 'bearly' contain his excitement as he tips the wooden cask towards him in his search of food . Screensaver: Many-a-human choses to save an image of their loved ones to their desktop and judging by this photograph it seems bears are no different . Paul Cyr: The man behind the project, which has taken three years and involved countless props, poses with his camera and a black bear in the background . Don't be scared: Bears have a fearsome reputation, but this squirrel does not seem to be particularly afraid of the bear behind him, despite his obvious size disadvantage . Beautiful: While many of the pictures are unquestionably funny, Mr Cyr managed to capture the true  magnificence of the North American creatures . And one shows an adult bear tinkering under the bonnet of his car like an every day mechanic. Mr Cyr used strategically placed food such as seeds and jam to get the bears to take up the right position for his shots. He said: 'The bear cub looked like he had handled a camera before. 'I wedged some plexiglass between the camera and tripod and put a blob of jam on it. 'When the cub arrived, he just put his hands in the perfect position. We all laughed. 'For the piano shots, I used sunflower seeds. The bears love them but they are so small, it's hard for them to pick them up, but his paws looked great scraping over the piano keys.' Chores: The bear takes a seat in the trailer of a tractor, presumably enticed by the promise of an easy snack, cunningly hidden somewhere in the vehicle . Big beast: The adult in the background demonstrates his size as he stands up on his hind paws, while a cub sniffs the ground . Environment: Mr Cyr's garden in Presque Isle provided a perfect haven for capturing the bears on film. In total he filmed four families over three years .

"Alexis Sanchez's arrival has left the Arsenal squad 'buzzing' ahead of the new campaign, according to defender Carl Jenkinson - with more new signings expected before the Community Shield against Manchester City at Wembley. Arsene Wenger is set to return from his media duties at the World Cup this week, as the Gunners step up pre-season preparations which will see many players rejoin the group following international duty ahead of the friendly against the New York Red Bulls at the end of the month. German trio Per Mertesacker, Lukas Podolski and Mesut Ozil, however, will be given some extra-time off following their success in Rio, with a full three weeks' break scheduled. Scroll down for video . Optimistic: Carl Jenkinson is excited by the arrival of Alexis Sanchez and is looking forward to the new season . Arsenal are also intent on bringing in Sami Khedira from Real Madrid, while compatriot Lars Bender, who missed the World Cup through injury, is another reported target. Arsenal, though, did move swiftly to close out the transfer of Chile forward Sanchez in what is said to be a £30million deal from Barcelona. Sanchez arrives with a reputation as a top quality striker and Jenkinson believes he can help the FA Cup winners target more success. 'He is world class and they are the sort of players you want to see at the club. The squad are buzzing as much as the fans, because if you are going to push on as a club and really compete for things, you need to sign top players,' Jenkinson said on www.Arsenal.com. Statement: Arsenal splashed £30million to bring Sanchez to north London from Barcelona . Bow: The Chile international could make his first Arsenal appearance in the Emirates Cup on August 2/3 . 'We have done that with him for sure - it is a fantastic addition. He's quick and direct, he can play up front and on the wing, and he is very dynamic. He will definitely fit the Arsenal style of play.' Jenkinson added: 'Once you have got one (trophy), you want to experience it again, so fingers crossed we can compete on all fronts this season. We have the squad and we are signing players like Sanchez, so I don't see why we can't.' Arsenal are expected to confirm the arrival of France defender Mathieu Debuchy once Newcastle have been able to bring in a replacement, with Holland full-back Daryl Janmaat said to be in talks over a move from Feyenoord to Tyneside. Target: Arsenal are closing in on a £23million deal for Real Madrid's German international Sami Khedira . VIDEO One trophy not enough - Arteta . Atletico Madrid right-back Javi Manquillo is another player on Wenger's radar, along with 19-year-old Southampton right-back Calum Chambers as Arsenal look to cover off the departure of Bacary Sagna, who earlier this summer joined Manchester City on a lucrative free transfer. Egypt international centre-back Ahmed Fathi has, meanwhile, travelled to London for a trial, the defender's club Al Ahly announced. Arsenal also need a goalkeeper, and have been linked with Norwich's John Ruddy, the England international. The Gunners will take a select side to Boreham Wood on Saturday, where Jenkinson and others who were not involved at the World Cup could get a first run-out in a side likely to include goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, Mikel Arteta and Wales midfielder Aaron Ramsey. Run out: Both Jenkinson and Aaron Ramsey (right) could feature in the upcoming friendly at Boreham Wood . England midfielder Jack Wilshere, meanwhile, may find himself with some explaining to do when he returns to London after photos were posted online of the 22-year-old appearing to smoke while on holiday in Las Vegas. In October last year, Wilshere issued an apology after being photographed smoking outside a London nightclub. Nine months ago, he said: 'I made a mistake. Players make mistakes. I am not a smoker, so I think that will be my last one.' Follwing their trip to the United States, Arsenal host the Emirates Cup on August 2/3, which is likely to present a debut for Sanchez.

"Papiss Cisse has accepted a Football Association charge of violent conduct following his elbow on Everton’s Seamus Coleman. The Newcastle striker will now await confirmation of a three-game ban from the FA. Cisse lashed out at Coleman during Newcastle's 3-2 victory over Everton on Sunday. Papiss Cisse leaves the Newcastle  training ground on Tuesday after accepting his charge . Cisse departs the training ground on a day when boss Alan Pardew took a step closer to joining Crystal Palace . Newcastle forward Papiss Cisse (circled) has accepted a charge for elbowing Everton's Seamus Coleman . The Newcastle striker had been charged by the FA on Monday following Sunday's incident at St James' Park . Cisse could now miss up to seven Newcastle games through suspension and international duty . Cisse is the sharpest striker in the Premier League this season, with his nine goals coming from just 633 minutes of playing time. That’s a goal every 70.3 minutes. He later scored his ninth of the season to make it 1-1 and Everton boss Roberto Martinez fumed that Cisse should not have been on the pitch. A Newcastle statement read: 'Newcastle United striker Papiss Cisse has accepted a charge of violent conduct from the Football Association. 'Cisse was involved in an incident involving Everton's Seamus Coleman during the Barclays Premier League fixture at St James' Park on Sunday December 28. 'Cisse has accepted the charge and will now serve a three-match suspension, which starts with immediate effect.' Coleman reacts by holding the side of his head following Cisse's elbow . Everton players gather round the referee as Cisse looks on at Coleman after the incident . The Everton full back appeals to the match official as Toffees keeper Joel Robles attends to his team-mate . The striker is now likely to miss Newcastle’s next seven fixtures – three because of suspension and four because of his involvement with Senegal at the Africa Cup of Nations. Those games include the New Year’s Day visit of Burnley, the FA Cup tie at Leicester, a trip to Chelsea, home match with Southampton, away at Hull, at home to Stoke and possibly a visit to Crystal Palace. Cisse was charged with violent conduct by the FA on Monday after Sky Sports cameras picked up the striker swinging his elbow in to Coleman's face on three occasions, connecting at least once. He is due to fly out to Equatorial Guinea with Senegal for the Africa Cup of Nations next month. Cisse and Coleman clash after the incident which the Newcastle striker was not punished for at the time . Coleman confronts Cisse after the incident which knocked him to the floor . Burnley (H), Jan 1 - Premier League . Leicester (A), Jan 3 - FA Cup . Chelsea (A), Jan 10 - Premier League . Southampton (H), Jan 17 - Premier League . Hull (A), Jan 31 - Premier League . Stoke (H), Feb 8 - Premier League . Crystal Palace (A), Feb 11 - Premier League . AFCON runs from January 17 until February 8, meaning Cisse will miss Newcastle's home fixture against Southampton on January 17 and their trip to Hull on January 31. Should much-fancied Senegal progress to the latter stages then Cisse will also miss the St James' Park clash against Stoke on February 8 and probably the trip to Crystal Palace on February 11. With the club set to lose manager Alan Pardew to Palace, Cisse's unavailability is a blow they cannot afford. The forward scored his ninth of the season in the 3-2 win over Everton on Sunday but his elbow on Coleman looks like it will have more significance than that strike come the end of the season. Cisse celebrates with Jack Colback after he scored in Newcastle's 3-2 win on Sunday .","Papiss Cisse charged with violent conduct after Seamus Coleman elbow .

"At first sight it would appear to be a contradiction of the most bizarre kind. On the one hand, we have women all over the Western world lining up to enjoy the story of a powerful man and his sex slave, whom he treats with savage abandon. References to rough sex are everywhere: the world is aflame with what are usually considered the seediest of practices. On the other hand, at precisely the same moment that Fifty Shades Of Grey is storming the box office, there’s another story in the news — about a powerful man said to have used not one but several disempowered women as his paid sex slaves. In this case, the world is outraged. Scroll down for video . Dakota Johnson (pictured in the film) plays Anastasia Steele in the big screen adaptation of EL James' hit erotic novel, Fifty Shades of Grey . The coincidence between the release of the film of E.L. James’s S&M blockbuster Fifty Shades Of Grey last week and the court case involving the sex ring allegedly co-ordinated by former International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn makes a curious and disturbing conjunction. Why, in one case, should violent sex have become such a collective female fantasy, drawing millions to the cinema and making a cool £161.6 million in its opening weekend, while in the other, it should be a cause of international condemnation? Even though Strauss-Kahn’s trial may end soon — his lawyers have asked for an acquittal after four prostitutes dropped their civil actions against him — the details to emerge from the hearing have nevertheless been stomach-churning. From 2007, DSK was one of the world’s most influential decision-makers. His career ended abruptly in May 2011 when he was taken into custody, following accusations of sexual assault by a New York hotel maid. These claims were eventually dropped. However, what we learned last week is that this key global figure viewed women as nothing more than objects, and despised objects at that. Lawyers for the 65-year-old concede that he took part in sex parties between 2008 and 2011, but argue that he did so without knowing that the women were professionals (in France, it is against the law to solicit or run a prostitution operation). They also deny that he organised the parties. Dominique Strauss-Kahn and his partner Myriam L'Aouffir pictured in 2013. Strauss-Kahn is alleged to have co-ordinated a sex ring . Regardless, the manner in which he treated these women was brutish. He is accused not only of being a pimp, but a violent pimp who routinely and barbarically abused the women in his employ. In one chilling account, a witness told the court that she was ‘forced into’ certain sex acts against her will, while Strauss-Kahn gazed on ‘smiling’. He is accused of having engaged in anal rape. Meanwhile, his orgies were described in terms of the most extreme violence as both ‘a massacre’ and ‘slaughterhouse’ with a ‘mishmash’ of writhing bodies. Despite holding the fate of the world in his hands during the financial crisis, he evidently viewed half its population in terms only of their sexual function. ‘I dare you to distinguish between a prostitute and a naked socialite,’ he taunted the court. Swaggering and self-assured, he was robustly unrepentant. ‘I was one of the world’s most powerful men,’ he bragged. ‘Many people wanted to please me. Women have offered themselves to me ten times. It is nothing unusual to me.’ He styled himself not as a rapacious monster, but a ‘libertine who likes to party’, noting merely: ‘I have a rougher sexuality than the average man.’ Few would not recoil from his words. But as one man asked me this week: ‘If this is what sadism looks like in the sagging flesh, then what the hell are so many women doing fantasising about being tied up and beaten?’ ‘And why,’ he demanded, ‘is this happening at a time when they have never been more empowered?’ Former IMF boss, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, was once one of the world’s most influential decision-makers but his career ended in May 2011 when he was taken into custody, following accusations of sexual assault . It is easy to understand the disbelief. There may still be a massive amount of work to be done in preventing women being subjected to discrimination and harassment. Nevertheless, most of us consider ourselves if not as strong as men, then considerably stronger. Historically, we can be more sure of ourselves than ever before. Girls beat boys hands down at school. A review of 308 studies involving 1.1 million children and published by the University of New Brunswick in 2013 found that boys have performed worse than girls at every single subject over the past 100 years across the globe. Meanwhile, male students are outnumbered by females at most British universities, despite the fact there are actually more young men than women in the UK. In adult life, women become Herculean multi-taskers, juggling workplace and family demands in a way than makes the majority of men look like amateurs. We are exhorted to aim for nothing less than a seat at the boardroom table by campaigners such as Facebook boss Sheryl Sandberg. The IMF itself is now headed by the formidable Christine Lagarde. For today’s superwomen, submitting to Fifty Shades-type behaviour might seem utterly incongruous — but the appeal is clearly strong. A friend’s nine-year-old daughter mused over spaghetti hoops: ‘Lucy’s mother is having a handcuff party to celebrate this new film.’ Cue parental jaws dropping about the kitchen table. Apparently, the hostess in question (sassy, assertive in her job) views this as being innocuous: a celebration of herself, her friends, and a manifestation of what used to be referred to as ‘girl power’. And that’s the strange logic at the heart of this sexual conundrum: now that women find themselves increasingly empowered, many seem to be finding more enjoyment from being playfully disempowered in the bedroom. And though this is a long way from the brutality of Christian Grey and the allegations facing Dominique Strauss-Kahn, if there is one area of life in which women can take a break from being in control in a loving relationship, while men try their hand at reclaiming it, it may just be here. As one senior female executive of my acquaintance tells me: ‘Obviously, it goes without saying that none of us wants real violence in our lives. ‘However, I am in charge in every aspect of my existence: my work, my family, my relationship. Just occasionally, I want to surrender this control and enjoy not being the decision maker. ‘I feel like an idiot admitting it, but exploring these fantasies makes me feel feminine. This is one area in which I don’t always have to be calling the shots.’ The same — in reverse — may apply for what we now refer to as ‘new men’. Fifty Shades Of Grey's main character, Christian Grey, is a sadist who treats women as objects, but he is also deemed a ‘safe’ sadist women can control . A lawyer friend, who boasts a predilection for bondage, insists: ‘My husband needs this vent, too. In his public life, he is the ultimate new man: kind, caring, a good father and colleague. He’s so good, it becomes exhausting. The bedroom is a safe space in which he can try on traditionally masculine roles without compromising his personality.’ Even women who maintain more traditional roles insist they, too, require escapism. A full-time mother-of-three told me: ‘I may not be ball-breaking in the boardroom, but I still need some sort of release, not least on days when I feel more of a feeding machine than a female. ‘I think of this sort of sex as a healthier take on “wine o’clock” — that moment when everything else can be shut out. I can stop running a one-woman show and switch off.’ In other words, it is not so much rough sex as an opportunity for imaginative escapism that these women truly want. Besides, Christian Grey is a sadist recreated in Mills & Boon form. He may treat women as objects, but the right woman will be an object hotly and tenderly adored. He will dominate only her, a faithful tormentor. A ‘safe’ sadist women can control. The answer, then, to the paradox as to why so many modern women appear to be seeking to cede power in the bedroom is that they are still in control; crucially, they have given their consent. Where the problems, as evidenced all too horrifically in the DSK trial, emerge is when consent is not granted. It is then that the grisly reality of what can happen when such fantasies veer out of control is brutally exposed.","Women all over the world have been queuing up to see 50 Shades of Grey .

"They’ve supported the Queen as she goes about her royal duties for almost 50 years, looking decorous yet never detracting attention from their sovereign, and accompanying her everywhere from prison visits to her Diamond Jubilee pageant. And these valuable servants? Not equerries or other royal minions, but her trusty patent leather shoes, the unsung heroes of the Royal household. It takes a team of four — not including the junior member of Buckingham Palace staff, dubbed ‘Cinders’, who has the job of wearing in her Majesty’s shoes — to produce the classic black numbers (she has other colours in the same style) which cost about £1,000. Yet the Queen certainly gets value for money out of them, wearing the same pair for years and re-heeling them when they wear out. Scroll down for videos . Shoes of a monarch: The Queen has opted for the same simple design for 50 years - but it's surprisingly complex . From the Diamond Jubilee pageant to this week's prison visit in Northern Ireland, the shoes are a firm favourite . When she stepped out in Northern Ireland with Prince Philip this week, she was wearing shoes identical to those she first sported five decades ago. Politics change, and so, gradually, does the monarch’s style of dress. The coats have become narrower, the hemlines slightly longer. Only her Majesty’s shoes remain emphatically the same. At 88, the Queen relies on her shoes to be less glass slipper, more steadfast slip-on. Comfort and support are key. As a young woman she often wore shoes with a thinner, higher heel, but for nearly 50 years the same low style has kept her sure-footed and age-defyingly nimble. Known as her ‘work’ shoes, they are handmade for her by shoemaker Anello & Davide of Kensington, West London, from the finest calf leather, usually in black patent with a brass clasp or a small bow. The team works from a wooden ‘last’ made from measurements of the Queen’s foot, and include a pattern cutter; a clicker, who selects the leather; a closer, who sews the upper part and adds stiffeners; and, finally, a maker, who adds the sole and heel on the last. Left: These Rayne shoes worn in 1969 are brown, with a short tongue - but the pattern had been set. In 1975 (right) the Queen was feeling summery in Jamaica - the style she'd keep for years, seen here in white . Left: The dress worn in 1984 is from another era, but the black patent shoes are becoming a fixture. Then in 1987 (right) the Queen was elegant in Spain - and her shoes have since survived the reign of King Juan Carlos . Then there’ll be a fitting at the Palace, and  — after any final adjustments, including a clean and polish — they’re ready. The Queen’s selection — she has worked her way through hundreds of almost identical pairs over the years but circulates about ten pairs at any one time — includes plain black leather, black patent, white leather and beige leather, and three designs of evening shoe in satin, silver and gold. They are all hand-dyed and water-repellent. The heel is always reassuringly chunky and 2¼ in high, with a raised insole to give the royal size 4s an added lift in the arch. If she is likely to be walking on uneven surfaces, the heel will be lower. But even having them handmade isn’t quite enough to get them fit for a Queen. Stewart Parvin, who has designed dresses for her for 11 years says that the shoes have to be immediately comfortable and that to achieve this, a member of staff with the same size feet will trot up and down palatial corridors for her until they are suitably broken in. Derby Day in 1990, and the Queen is being blown about (left) — but the shoes keep her steady. Then in 1993, (left) glancing down at her feet — yes, the shoes are still the same— at Sandringham at Christmas time . Left: In Russia, in fur, in 1994. The Soviet Union has collapsed, but the trusty slip-on is eternal. By 1996 (right) She has long since dispensed with boxy jackets, but the patent leather remains on a visit to a criminal court . Parvin says: ‘The Queen can never say: “I’m uncomfortable, I can’t walk any more.” ’ Once she has taken delivery, her dressers Kate or Beverley might also use wooden shoe stretchers to make them more comfortable. Her shoes have occasionally been ‘worn in’ by Angela Kelly, her devoted personal assistant, as they have almost the same size feet. But now there is the aforementioned junior staff member ‘Cinders’, who is the same size exactly. She wears beige cotton ankle socks when testing the Queen’s shoes, and is only allowed to walk on carpets. The shoes then get one trial run outside to ensure there is no slippage. Footmen Ian and William are responsible for everyday care, including polishing and storage. After the Queen has worn them, they are aired on shoe trees then stored individually in silk or cotton drawstring bags. Originally the Queen’s shoes were made by Rayne, a British family firm founded in 1885 to make theatrical shoes for actresses such as Lillie Langtry (Edward VII’s mistress).

In 2008, right, the shoes of Christmas past enjoy yet another festive outing at Sandringham . The Queen came to Rayne in the early Sixties, recommended by the Queen Mother, who had followed in the footsteps of another impeccable royal dresser, her mother-in-law Queen Mary, who issued the company with a Royal Warrant in 1936. At the height of its success the company made the shoes for Elizabeth Taylor in her role as Cleopatra. Roger Vivier and Mary Quant designed shoes for them, and Princess Margaret and Princess Anne got married in Rayne creations; as did the Queen herself: a pair (there were actually three identical pairs in case of disasters) of beige silk sling-back sandals with a medium heel and a small platform sole. (She is almost a foot shorter than Philip, who is 6ft 1in.) Margaret Thatcher was also a fan. A pair of her favourite black Rayne satin stilettos were put up at auction last year for £150. Wallis Simpson and Princess Diana wore Rayne, too. The company’s shoes were all the rage for a time, and had nearly 70 stores and four factories when run by the founder’s grandson Edward Rayne. But on a trip to New York he accidentally revealed the Queen’s shoe size to a journalist at a cocktail party and the unknown fact was splashed across newspapers on both sides of the Atlantic. Rayne was summoned to the Palace by courtiers and was eventually forgiven. In 2009, pictured, Her Majesty added contrast to the blaze of red to greet wellwishers in Newmarket . Another day, another decade — an elegant ensemble for  the Diamond Jubilee in 2012 (left). Fast forward to now and the trusty £1,000 shoes were still going strong this week as the Queen visited Belfast (right) He would visit Buckingham Palace six times a year. A royal source said: ‘Occasionally, the Queen would produce a pair with a chewed heel, asking Mr Rayne if he could repair the damage caused by a playful corgi.’ Twenty years ago, like most of the British shoe-making industry, Rayne went out of fashion — and production. Ever loyal, the Queen knighted Eddie Rayne. But she was said to be so distraught at losing her beloved shoemaker that courtiers tracked down a former employee of Rayne, David Hyatt, who, by then, was working for another shoemaker, Anello & Davide. With help from the Palace, Hyatt recovered the Queen’s old lasts from the liquidators. Anello & Davide, founded in 1922, still make dance and theatre shoes, just like Rayne in the early days. In the Sixties, they were on the feet of every star, from the The Beatles to Marilyn Monroe. But the Queen is one of their most enduring customers. According to David Hyatt: ‘We supply one or two pairs a year and occasionally renew the tops and re-heel them. The Queen doesn’t waste money.

"The Army psychiatrist charged in the 2009 Fort Hood mass shooting has spoken to the American media for the first time and said that the U.S. government is at war with Islam. In the past, Major Nidal Hasan has only spoken via telephone with Al-Jazeera, the transcript of which is evidence in his upcoming trial. 'My complicity was on behalf of a government that openly acknowledges that it would hate for the law of Almighty Allah to be the supreme law of the land,' Hasan said in the lengthy statement released to Fox News on Saturday. Impending trial: Hasan, charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder, is due to go on trial on August 6 . He then says in reference to a war on Islam, 'I participated in it.' Hasan, 42, is charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder in the November 2009 attack at the Texas Army post. His trial is scheduled to start Aug. 6. He faces the death penalty if convicted. The American-born Muslim is serving as his own attorney and has made similar declarations during pre-trial hearings and jury selection. Major Nidal Hasan has previously only spoken via telephone with Al-Jazeera, video footage, right, shows him shopping at a 7-11 store just outside Fort Hood seven hours before he shot 13 people dead . Hasan didn't directly address the shooting in his statement, which it said is more than six pages long. He also said in the statement that he regrets serving in the Army. 'I would like to begin by repenting to Almighty Allah and apologize to the Mujahideen, the believers, and the innocent. ... I ask for their forgiveness for participating in the illegal and immoral aggression against Muslims, their religion and their lands,' he said in the statement. Hasan also has objected to the judge's denial of his 'defense of others' strategy, which must show that killing was necessary to prevent the immediate harm or death of others. Col. Tara Osborn has barred him from telling jurors that he shot U.S. troops because they were an imminent threat to Taliban leaders in Afghanistan. At a hearing earlier this month, Hasan, who is paralyzed from the abdomen down after being shot by police the day of the Fort Hood shooting, said he wanted jurors to know that he was being forced to wear a camouflage uniform that he believes represents 'an enemy of Islam.' Thirteen people were killed and 32 injured in the November 2009 shooting at Fort Hood military base in Texas .","Major Nidal Hasan has spoken to the U.S. media for the first time, previously he had only spoken with Al-Jazeera .

"A summer she will never forget for all sorts of reasons could take another remarkable turn for Caroline Wozniacki with a serious run at the US Open title. Just as her high profile split from the Northern Irishman has ignited his golf the same could be said – albeit on a slightly lower plane – for her tennis, and last night she scored one of the best wins of her career. In steaming humidity on the Arthur Ashe Stadium she overcame fifth seed Maria Sharapova 6-4 2-6 6-2 to score a hugely popular victory that puts her through to the last eight. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mike Dickson look ahead to Andy Murray's fourth-round tie . Victory: Caroline Wozniacki can hardly believe it as she beats Maria Sharapova . Determination: Wozniacki puts everything into a backhand shot . Not her day: Sharapova gave her all but it was not her day at Flushing Meadows . As one of only four surviving top ten players in the women’s draw there is every opportunity to reach the final, and now she will play the number 13 Sara Errani of Italy. Wozniacki is training to run the New York Marathon in November, and her increased levels of stamina helped in the hostile conditions as she warded off one of Sharapova’s trademark fightbacks with some scintillating tennis. Energy: Wozniacki munches on a banana between games . False dawn: Sharapova celebrates winning a point but Wozniacki had the last laugh . Going through: Wozniacki clenches her fists after winning the decisive point . She also had to contend with the Russian’s usual stalling tactics and early in the third set implored umpire Marija Cicak to try and speed up the pace of play from the other end. Sharapova had already been given a code violation for taking too long in the permitted ten-minute break after two sets which the women are allowed in searing heat. Wozniacki, a former world number one, went into a slump during her relationship with McIlroy as trying to keep it going across the world took its toll on the pair of them, and this is her first Grand Slam quarter final since January 2012 in Australia. After he dumped her by phone in May when the wedding invitations had gone out she regrouped and has played steadily better since, actually winning an event in Istanbul the day he claimed the British Open. Winner: Rory McIlroy's career has gone from strength to strength after he ended his relationship with Wozniacki . Wozniacki afterwards brushed off questions about whether the split from McIlroy had re-energised her saying: 'I don’t think that’s really relevant here.' She was more open about her marathon training, explaining that she was told this highly unusual form of preparation for a tennis player should not be over-damaging on her joints: 'To be honest, tennis is tough on your body. 'I think all of us wake up every morning and something is hurting. You know, we play on hard courts so much and it takes a beating. But at the same time, I have done a lot of running. I do a lot of running in my training anyway. 'So I think my team looked and said, Look, she's so excited about this. She's doing it for charity. She's so pumped about it. So they just said, Go for it. You only live once. You know, tick off as many things on your bucket list as possible. They're happy for me.' She denied questioning her ability to return to the top of the game after a prolonged dip, adding: 'I never doubt myself. I work hard every day. I know I have the levels to compete against anybody, and I can beat anyone on a good day. But as I said, the women's game is really evolving and it gets tougher and tougher. 'The season for me has been a little bit up and down, and it's so nice to kind of start feeling like I'm playing the way I want to. You know, this hard court season has been amazing for me. 'I actually started already feeling really good on court since Eastbourne. I have just been building on my game since then. 'Today I just kept thinking to myself, Just stay in there. Try and take the initiative. It was really hard. 'The wind was blowing a lot from one side of the court.

"A suicide bomber who reportedly blew himself up in Syria was a U.S. citizen who grew up in Florida, it emerged today. According to internet postings, the man - who called himself 'Abu Hurayra Al-Amriki' - carried out one of four suicide attacks on May 25 in Syria's Idlib province. He is believed to have been fighting on behalf of Jabhat al-Nusra, Al Qaeda's affiliate attempting to oust the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Two U.S. officials have now confirmed to CNN that the bomber was an American jihadi who grew up in Florida and went to school there. Scroll down for video . An American suicide bomber calling himself 'Abu Hurayra al-Amriki' allegedly carried out one of four suicide bombings on May 25 in Syria's Idlib province . However, the unnamed officials have not revealed the bomber's real name or any other details that would shed light on his identity. His assumed name does not offer many clues, either. Abu Hurayra was a companion of the prophet Mohammed, while Al-Amriki translates as 'the American' in Arabic. Earlier this week it was revealed that U.S. government agencies are examining social media postings . purporting to show how the American blew himself up in northern . Syria. The . officials, who declined to be identified, said U.S. agencies assessed . that the postings were likely authentic. One said some investigators . believed they knew the 'U.S. person's' true identity, but declined to . give further details. If . his identity is officially confirmed, he would be the first American known to have . committed a suicide bombing in Syria on behalf of Al Qaeda, said Laith .

Should the bomber's identity be confirmed, he would be the first American known to have committed a suicide bombing in Syria on behalf of Al-Qaida . Alkhouri . said social media postings, including Twitter messages and a video . posted on YouTube, showed Abu Hurayra posing in a still picture with . three other suicide bombers, one of whom was Syrian. The other two were . foreigners. The . video shows a truck-sized vehicle being loaded with explosives and then . cuts to a long-shot of a fortress-like structure on top of a hill being . blown up.

The . teaser, which opens with a graphic of a burning American flag and an . exhortation to 'Join the Caravan of Jihad and Martyrdom,' promotes a . longer video featuring 'The story of an American Muhajir (visitor) in . Sham (Syria).' The . short video includes a brief sound bite in which a man with an American . or Canadian accent, whose face is blurred, declares: 'It is huq (right) on you to fight.' Maher, . whose think tank has studied the role of social media in recruiting . foreigners to join militant groups in Syria, said he had spoken to a .

Incredibly, however, the Barcelona forward - who was captain for the second match in a row - could only manage to rattle the crossbar with his finish after getting his foot too far under the ball. And Neymar's nightmare was not over then, either. As the ball rebounded towards him, Neymar was unable to sort his feet out in time and the ball was cleared by the Ecuadorian defence.

"An airliner that was coming in to land had a near miss in mid-air with a motorised parachutist at 2,000ft about the ground. The Airbus A319 missed the flying-machine by only 150ft, causing the pilot to see the parachute canopy flash by the cockpit of the plane. A source told the Sunday Mirror the pilot relayed the incident to air traffic control, saying: 'We've just had some kind of a paraglider passing very, very close to our left-hand side.' The EasyJet plane saw the parachute pass across its bow . The motorised parachutes can be bought as kits for around £1,500 and flown by people with no training . An investigation has been launched to crack down on the motorised parachutes and their pilots, which cannot be detected by radar systems because they travel too slowly. Kits to build the flying machines can be purchased online for around £1,500, and wannabe pilots can start taking to the skies without any training. Air traffic controllers were unable to warn the pilot who was flying the plane from Newquay, Cornwall. Experts said: 'He (the pilot) could not have taken avoiding action.' A recommendation to investigate the motorised parachutes was floated last July, when there had been another near miss between a plane and a glider. Steve Landells, of the British Association of Airline Pilots told the Sunday Mirror: 'Most general aviation pilots will do the sensible thing and get the right training. 'But there are some who launch into it without any thought.' Almost colliding with a plane while you're flying is one thing, but last year a pair of people filming on what they thought was a quiet runway had a near miss with a bi-plane. They were performing and filming some motorcycle stunts, when the light aircraft appeared to attempt to land, before swerving to the side. Footage showed the plane nearly hit the bike, swerving and avoiding it, almost hitting the woman filming, and taking off again. Flying: The man hardly has time to react as the speeding vehicle whizzes past him . Hold tight: After first missing the bike-rider the plane is on course to collide with the video camera operator . Inches: The footage reveals how close the plane comes to colliding with the unnamed woman . The plane reportedly missed the woman filming by only two feet, as she utters a startled 'oh my god...holy sh**.' Another near-miss saw saw a Heathrow-bound airliner carrying 232 passengers came within 200ft and seconds of a mid-air collision with a business jet over London, an official report revealed yesterday. The drama happened on July 27 last year after a German-owned Cessna Citation business jet with two crew and one passenger took off from London City Airport, initially heading west. The control tower told the pilot to climb to 3,000ft, but he replied that he would be going to 4,000ft. This so-called 'readback' mistake was not picked up by the London City controller. There was 'confusion between the two pilots' as the aircraft pitched nose-down before control was recovered in the skies west of Norwich, an AAIB report said. Meanwhile a Turkish Airlines Boeing 777 airliner carrying 232 passengers and 16 crew, with a trainee pilot at the controls, was heading south towards the Thames, having been cleared to descend from 4,900ft to 4,000ft as it prepared to land at Heathrow. It failed to follow commands from three automatic collision-avoidance warnings, which alert pilots to danger when other aircraft get too close. As a result, at 2.38pm the planes were flying almost head-on at a closing speed of around 700mph when they crossed paths with a difference in height of between 100ft and 200ft at 4,000ft above the 2012 Olympics site at Stratford. The business jet crew saw the airliner 'in time to take effective avoiding action'. But the pilot of the passenger jet did not see the other plane.","The Airbus A319 missed the flying-machine by only 150ft .

"Darren Clarke is making a concerted bid to be named the next European Ryder Cup captain for the 2016 contest in America at the Hazeltine National in Minnesota. This has required Clarke, who can be a moody presence, to mount a charm offensive before January’s decision. Clarke, Open champion in 2011, is becoming much more visible around events and during the past week he has been noticeably more agreeable with the media. Charm offensive: Darren Clarke is making a bid to be named the next European Ryder Cup captain . VIDEO The Open Chanpionship: Final Round highlights . And a new slim-line look - Clarke’s . fitness programme has seen him shed more than four stone - can only help . with his image building. The captaincy decision will be made by the . three most recent Ryder Cup leaders - Paul McGinley, Jose Maria Olazabal . and Colin Montgomerie - plus European tour chief George O’Grady and a . further committee member. Miguel Angel Jimenez is likely to be Clarke’s main rival and the Spaniard will have the vote of his compatriot Olazabal and probably that of McGinley, who is not close to Clarke, with whom he contested the 2014 Gleneagles captaincy. But Clarke has the more stellar Ryder Cup record, especially at K Club in 2006 when he won three points from three matches a month after the death of his wife, Heather. ......................................................................................................... Newcastle owner Mike Ashley may not have attended any major championship during the 10 years he has had £2million riding on the result as part of his ‘no win no fee’ Dunlop sponsorship of Lee Westwood, Darren Clarke and David Howell. However, Sports Direct tycoon Ashley has still taken a significant stake in online company GolfDirect, who sell equipment and clothing. ......................................................................................................... Paul Faulkner, departed chief executive of Aston Villa, took advantage of being between jobs to be at Hoylake. Faulkner, who declined to take an unspecified job in another part of Villa owner Randy  Lerner’s empire, would like to stay in football. But leaving Villa means he has to stand down from the FA Council and the FA board where he had reduced the average age significantly. ........................................................................................................ Supporters of Peter Alliss, who bombard Sports Agenda if they see any negative comments about their favourite, should know he is always quick to bite back himself. Like describing this columnist on the BBC as an ‘inky-fisted peasant scribe’ for mentioning the 83-year-old calling Open joint runner-up ‘Robbie’ Fowler, rather than Rickie. And as for ‘inky-fisted’, what about Alliss’s 1983 bonkbuster The Duke, a sex novel about ageing golfer Duke Denton’s desperate attempts to recapture past glories - now available second-hand on Amazon for 1p but, conspicuously, not included among books Alliss lists on his official website. Business: Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has taken a significant stake in online company GolfDirect . McGinley goes AWOL . It seems wrong that European Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley should be holidaying in Portugal during The Open. Especially when all his potential Gleneagles team have been at Hoylake - along with the Americans - playing in a tournament that best replicates the pressures of a Ryder Cup. In contrast, USA captain Tom Watson has played all four days in preparation for September’s clash. It is said that this is the only week when McGinley can fit in a break and missing The Open did not affect Bernhard Langer’s preparations for a European victory in the USA in 2004. AWOL: Paul McGinley is holidaying in Portugal during which his potential Gleneagles team were in Hoylake . Open champion Rory McIlroy will have the distraction - not that it proved to be one at Hoylake - of the court case over his representation agreement with estranged agents Horizon Sports Management dragging on until January after today’s discovery hearing in Dublin was postponed. A tactical error by the BBC has to be shelving an Open highlights show when Sky are going to be such strong challengers for the rights after 2016. The Beeb point to iPlayer and their website as places to catch up but a tailor-made programme used to be a key part of their coverage, at least until former head of sport Peter Salmon objected to there being ‘too many highlights in the highlights show’.","Darren Clarke bidding to be named next European Ryder Cup captain .

"Dozens of Hawaiians could be forced from their home by a scorching hot lava flow which has been oozing towards them for months. Officials are preparing to evacuate residents of Pahoa, on the Big Island of Hawaii, after the stream of molten rock came within a kilometer of the settlement. The flow, which is 230 yards wide, is now advancing at ten yards per hour, kicking up toxic fumes as it burns over an asphalt road. Scroll down for video . Burning ahead: The 2,000-degree lava flow, pictured burning its way down Apa'a Street, Pahoa, Hawaii, could hit homes in three to five days . Locals have been warned to expect an evacuation in the next three to five days as the 2,000-degree molten rock from Kilauea volcano draws closer. Kilauea erupts constantly, but the lava usually flows away from settlements. The current flow has been slowly approaching Pahoa since June. It's not clear exactly when it might reach the village road as the flow has been advancing erratically, said Matt Patrick, a geologist with the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. Danger: The flows could destroy homes and buildings, as well as kicking off toxic fumes as it burns down its trajectory. The molten rock can also cause dangerous methane explosions along its track . Usually lava from Kilauea, which started erupting in 1983, flows south, enveloping the Kalapana and Royal Garden residential subdivisions as it poured out to sea. For the past two years, however, the lava has been flowing to the northeast, bringing it to Pahoa's doorsteps. Officials were going door-to door to about 50 homes to keep residents informed of the lava's movement, said Darryl Oliveira, the director of civil defense for Hawaii County. 'This is all something we've been preparing for and hoping wouldn't have to happen,' Oliveira said. The county will issue a mandatory evacuation order if the flow begins advancing at such a rate that it would be difficult for people to move out of the way with little notice, Oliveira said. Burning asphalt was generating some smoke, but Oliveira said the wind dispersed the fumes over unpopulated areas and it didn't pose a health risk at the moment. Oliveira said the current situation differs from the flows of past decades because the lava is now approaching the center of a community. Pahoa is not only more densely populated, he said, but it also has commercial and industrial sites as well as residential homes. Route: The lava has oozed towards Pahoa since June, when flows from the Kilauea volcano changed path . Cooler: In the photograph above, geologists walk along a cooled lava flow higher up the stream . The current flow that has been threatening Pahoa began in June. It's been moving fitfully toward the town for weeks, speeding up and then slowing down. Sporadic suspensions in the lava's movement gave emergency crews time to work on building alternate routes to town in the event the flow covers the main road and highway. Crews near the leading edge have been wrapping power poles with concrete rings as a layer of protection from the lava's heat. The lava's pace picked up in recent days when it reached a gully, allowing it to move more efficiently like rain in a gutter. Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie on Friday asked for a presidential disaster declaration to enable federal help for local emergency crews.","Stream of molten rock is advancing on village of Pahoa on the Big Island .

"Classified footage of an out-of-control drone narrowly missing an Afghan passenger plane carrying 100 people has caused outrage in Germany. The video, filmed from onboard the unmanned German Luna drone as it flew over Afghanistan, shows it missing the plane by about two metres. It has caused fury in Germany as debate rages about the Government's new order of drones. Scroll down for video . Classified footage shows how the 88lb drone came to hitting the plane, risking the lives of its 100 passengers . The plane is just visible in the distance from the drone's onboard camera as it flies over Kabul . Last week German Defence Minister Thomas de Maiziere said Luna's successor would not be fitted with anti-collision technology because it is too expensive. Critics have seized on the dramatic footage taken nine years ago as proof of the dangers of unmanned drones and called for de Maiziere to reconsider. They say larger drones should be fitted with the technology as it could cause more damage if it crashed. Since then the footage has gained widespread attention, despite being nine years old. The 88lb German 'Luna' drone was caught . in air turbulence created by the Ariana passenger plane, before losing . control and crash landing near the Afghan capital, Kabul. The video shows the plane in the distance before it swiftly moves into shot. The drone passes under the left wing of the engine. The German Luna drone flies towards the Ariana passenger plane, carrying 100 people . The video was posted on YouTube despite it being strictly classified. Wreckage from the crash in 2004 was never recovered. German magazine Der Spiegel believe that the drone flew less than two metres away from the Airbus A300, putting 100 lives at risk. However, Germany is still going ahead with the purchase of a possible 16 armed aircraft for military use from 2016. The country has held talks with Israel over the Heron TO unmanned aerial vehicle and with the U.S. over the Reaper aircraft. A defence ministry spokesman said that he did not foresee combat-ready drones being deployed over Germany, for example in anti-terrorism operations. A Government spokesman told AFP: 'The intention is that we acquire 16 such devices in future and . that the armed forces have them at their disposal from 2016, three years from now.' The Euro Hawk (pictured) was scrapped by the German defence minister over spiralling costs . German Defence Minister Thomas de Maiziere standing next to a model of the Euro Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle is facing mounting pressure after scrapping the 500m Euro project . It comes as Defence Minister de Maiziere fights for his political career after abandoning a multi-million euro drone programme. Mr de Maiziere scrapped the 'Euro Hawk' surveillance drone project two weeks ago blaming spiralling costs. It had already cost €508 million (£432million) before Mr de Maiziere said on May 14 that he would 'pull the ripcord' on the plan to buy four more of the unmanned surveillance aircraft. He feared aviation authorities in Europe would not certify the controversial aircraft to fly over the continent because it lacks the anti-collision system. But he is under mounting pressure amid accusations at home that he already knew about possible problems with the anti-collision system but continued to plough money into the project. The Defence Minister is now expected to present a report to the German media on the so-called 'drone debacle'. Drones are controversial in Germany, both because of battlefield 'collateral damage', or civilian deaths, and because of their spying capabilities, which evoke dark memories from past fascist and communist regimes. The Ariana airline (similar to the one pictured) was carrying 100 passengers when it narrowly missed the drone .","Video filmed from Luna drone shows it flying towards passenger plane .

"It is sight rarely enjoyed... tiny polar bear cubs emerging from their den for the first to play in the snow. But wildlife photographer Thomas Kokta was in the right place at the right time, on hand to capture the rare moment, as three young cubs ventured out into the snow-covered plains of Canada, their mother in tow. It is thought less than 500 people have been lucky enough to witness baby polar bears as they emerge from their dens in the wild. Wildlife photographer Thomas Kokta travelled from his home in Washington state to Manitoba, Canada to capture these stunning images of a polar bear and her three cubs . Waiting on the snowy plains, where temperatures range from -15C to -50C, Mr Kokta was delighted when he spotted the rare sight of a mother emerging from her den, her tiny new cubs in tow . He is believed to be one of around 500 people who have seen polar bear cubs venturing out of their homes for the first time, first hand . Mr Kokta, who hails from Issaquah in Washington state, has been taking photos of polar bear families for the last few years, carefully learning their first moves. And his latest shoot in Manitoba, Canada proved a first for the experienced photographer, as he captured the extremely rare phenomenon of a mother bear who had given birth to surviving triplets. While polar bears in the wild frequently give birth to more than one cub, triplets are rare. With three young cubs battling for their mother's milk, it is common for the stronger youngsters to push the runt aside, leaving the smallest to starve to death in the early months. But Mr Kokta said the family he spotted appeared playful and healthy, as they posed for a family portrait-style shot with two of the cubs clambering on to their mother's back. And despite his vast experience, Mr Kokta's latest shoot proved a surprising first for the photographer, as he witnessed surviving triplets in the wild for the first time . While it is common for females to give birth to twin cubs in the wild, it is rare for triplets to survive. Competing for their mother's milk it is often the case that the stronger two cubs push the runt aside, leaving the smallest left to starve . But as Mr Kokta's images reveal, this family of polar bears appeared healthy and playful as the young cubs clambered over their mother and play fought with one another . While admitting he loves shooting the animal, capturing shots of polar bears comes with its challenges, not least the icy temperatures, plummeting to between -15C and -50C. And he added much of his travel tracking the bears has to be undertaken on foot, it being almost impossible for vehicles to get close without disturbing the animals. And in his quest to capture images of baby polar bears, Mr Kokta said he routinely faces the hurdle of their sleep patterns, with youngsters needing to sleep for long periods of time leaving him waiting around in the cold, putting himself at risk of frostbite. He said: 'I now have thousands of pictures of polar bears as I have spent more than six months photographing them. 'I've been fortunate enough to see triplets, babies climb trees and I have many, many pictures of the cubs pulling goofy poses. 'People always seem to think the baby pictures are cute, but it is hard to relate to how much effort goes into shooting these shots - it's cold, remote and there is a lot of waiting around.' Mr Kokta said: 'People always seem to think the baby pictures are cute, but it is hard to relate to how much effort goes into shooting these shots - it's cold, remote and there is a lot of waiting around' Capturing shots like this of a young cub seemingly planting a kiss on its mother's nose can be particularly challenging as photographers battle icy temperatures and are forced to travel on foot, as vehicles tend to scare the animals away .","Thomas Kokta travelled from his home in Washington state to capture the polar bear family in Manitoba, Canada .

"Her eyes shining with  anticipation, the young woman holds a balloon to . her lips. For all the world, it looks as if she's about to perform a . children's party trick. Yet a quick examination of her surroundings (an expensive London . nightclub) and her appearance (glossy hair, designer heels) tells you . that this is far from a  children's party. Indeed, the young woman is something of a celebrity — Coronation Street . actress Michelle Keegan. And far from performing a trick, she is . indulging in a fashionable — and potentially fatal — drug craze: . inhaling nitrous oxide, the 'legal high' du jour. Dangerous: Coronation Street actress Michelle Keegan indulging in a fashionable ¿ and potentially fatal ¿ drug craze: inhaling nitrous oxide, the 'legal high' known as 'hippy crack' Cheap, seemingly harmless and guaranteeing a night of raucous laughter, . so-called 'hippy crack' is increasingly popular with celebrities and . their well-heeled young fans alike. Even Prince Harry was seen indulging . two years ago. There is just one problem: nitrous oxide is no more legal than it is . innocuous. Despite being touted openly at music  festivals and in bars . and nightclubs across the country, sale of the gas for recreational use . is very much against the law. As for being innocuous, that is only true if one ignores the alarming . side-effects it can cause: strokes, hallucinations,  seizures, . blackouts, incontinence, stress on the heart, chronic depression and . even — in cases of prolonged use — depleted bone marrow. Few would tack . the word 'harmless' on to such a list. Now anti-drugs campaigners are calling for more to be done to tackle the . trend. Not that their voices are being heard, swamped as they are by . those of the enthusiasts. In the past month alone, several minor — yet . influential — celebrities have jumped on the bandwagon. As well as Keegan, James Argent and Maria Fowler, stars of The Only Way . Is Essex, have been pictured with a balloon between their lips. They are among tens of thousands of young people who have dabbled with . the drug. And, as it sells at the bargain price of £1.50 per balloon, . many indulge in it every weekend. Nitrous oxide — also known as laughing gas, N2O and sweet air — gives . users an intense euphoria which some have likened to the effects of . heroin and crack cocaine. Aficionados insist this is a huge exaggeration, and maintain that it is . far less harmful than other illegal drugs — indeed vastly preferable to . alcohol, as the effect recedes in minutes and there is no hangover. Ask the experts, however, and they tell a very different story. When . inhaled, nitrous oxide dissolves in the bloodstream, depleting the blood . of oxygen and reducing its flow to the brain and other vital organs. An . overdose can be fatal. Stephen Ream, director of  substance abuse charity Re-Solv, is . unequivocal: 'Every year, people die in this country from taking nitrous . oxide. You never hear about that when people are selling it in . nightclubs or at festivals, and I shouldn't imagine most of the users . even realise it's illegal. It's almost the acceptable face of drug . abuse. Problem: Ruby Deevoy says her overindulgence with nitrous oxide led her to suffer severe hallucinations . 'Young people see celebrities taking it and they think it must be OK, . but they should be looking at Demi Moore and what happened to her.' Unlike the British C-listers associated with the drug, Moore is a . bona-fide star, and her experience is very much a cautionary tale. Earlier this year, in the throes of a difficult separation from her . husband, Ashton Kutcher, the actress reportedly binged on nitrous oxide . to the extent that she suffered a seizure and had to be taken to . hospital. She then checked into a rehabilitation clinic. Yet little was reported about the drug — it was lost in the controversy . about Moore's romantic  travails and alarming weight loss. Small wonder, then, that the army of young enthusiasts marches on . undeterred. On the whole, these are not your average drug users. Nitrous . oxide's harmless reputation is attracting large numbers of middle-class . youths who otherwise would never dream of touching drugs. Ruby Deevoy was one such teenager when she first encountered the gas. She has not touched it for two years, but at 23 she still has a vivid . recollection of its effect on her.  'I first used it when I was about . 16, at a festival,' she says. 'I made friends with the guys on the . laughing gas stall and basically spent the whole weekend inhaling it. 'It didn't occur to me for a second that it might be illegal. They were selling it so openly. 'They showed festival-goers how to use it. You had to take it from a . balloon, never direct from the  dispenser, or you could freeze your . lungs. I absolutely loved it and from then on I did it whenever I . could.' The initial effect, Ruby says, was one of unalloyed pleasure. That . weekend at the festival, however, overindulgence led her to suffer . severe hallucinations. 'At the beginning, everything kind of goes a bit clouded and all you can . feel is the bassline of the music,' says Ruby. 'Then suddenly you burst . out laughing and just keep on laughing. It is a really nice feeling, . there's no denying that, but if I'd thought it was illegal I'd never . have done it. 'I must admit I was hallucinating quite badly by the end of my first weekend taking laughing gas. 'On one occasion I crawled into a tent and thought there were dozens of . people in there, but it was empty. Then I would blink — my eyes were . closed for no longer than that — but in my mind I'd been in a coma. 'I also remember being mesmerised by the flaming torches on the site to . the point where I very nearly walked face-first into them.' Ruby, now a children's author  living near Edinburgh, says she  simply 'grew out' of the drug. To this day, she remains uncertain about its legality, having been convinced it was a 'legal high'. The reality, however, is that while she did not commit any offence in . taking it, those who sold her the gas categorically did, as it's illegal . to sell it for recreational purposes. Those caught selling it without a licence can be jailed for up to two . years. But few are convicted, due in part to the difficulty of proving . the 'recreational purposes' aspect. Nick Spears of the Medicines and Healthcare  Products Regulatory Agency, . says: 'The gas is commonly used on dental patients and for women in . labour, but you don't go to the dentist every Friday night and you don't . give birth every Saturday. Old problem: As far back as the 18th century laughing gas was popular with the aristocracy. But so were opium and cocaine, pictured, and they have caused major issues in our society . 'It carries serious long-term health risks for people who use it for fun.' One of those risks is death. The International Centre For Drug Policy . charts deaths in the UK from volatile substance misuse, including the . gas. Their most recent report, from 2010, notes that 'in 2008 there were . two deaths (three in 2007) associated with the inhalation of nitrous . oxide, which had been obtained for non-medical purposes'. Finding more up-to-date  figures is problematic, as the report is not . currently active because of  Department Of Health belt-tightening. But . according to Stephen Ream, the indications are that the death toll has . carried on in the same vein. He adds: 'It's not just adults taking it. There is evidence that the users are getting younger, which is a real worry.' Police as far afield as South London and Somerset have been alerted to . children as young as 11 inhaling nitrous oxide. Discarded canisters — . used in the catering industry to pump whipped cream from dispensers — . are routinely found in parks and playgrounds, and the drug is readily . available on the internet. A pack of 24 canisters and a dispenser can be . purchased for just £20. Ruby Deevoy's mother Jacqui, a writer, was surprised to hear that the . drug's sale was illegal. She said: 'I took the photos of Ruby inhaling . laughing gas at that festival. At that point I had an idea it was some . kind of helium and that people were buying it to make their voices . squeaky. I couldn't see any harm in that. 'I told Ruby if she wanted to buy it, she could. It made her giggle for a . bit, then the effect wore off. I thought at that point that the N2O . must be like the gas and air I was given when I gave birth to Ruby. 'I loved that stuff — during the course of an eight-hour labour, I got through two canisters.' Such is the ease of availability that it has even infiltrated middle-class living rooms. Jacqui continues: 'I have two friends, both women my age, who use it on a . regular basis for recreational purposes. One of them likes to do it . just sitting at home, watching the TV. She says it relaxes her. Each to . their own. It's probably healthier than downing a bottle of wine every . evening — I know plenty of women my age who do that.' And there is the rub: like our old foe alcohol, laughing gas is nothing . new. As far back as the 18th century  it was popular with the . aristocracy. But so were opium and cocaine, and we all know the destruction wrought by those drugs once they seeped into our society.","Coronation Street actress Michelle Keegan has been spotted taking the drug .

"A retired teacher and her husband who posed as a wealthy couple to ‘squat’ in luxury properties are back in court. Hazel and Richard Jerome would make cash offers on expensive houses. Then they would spin lies to explain delays in the purchase, and ask to rent the property until the problems were resolved. They would move in but not pay any rent, and live free of charge until eventually evicted. They cost one vendor £167,000. Hazel and Richard Jerome who posed as a wealthy couple to 'squat' in luxury properties are back in court . In 2009 the couple were convicted of fraud and given jail sentences, but allegedly carried on as before, simply switching to a part of the country where they were not known. The Jeromes, of Chacombe, Oxfordshire, are now on trial at Exeter Crown Court where they have denied eight fraud charges. Prosecutor Peter Combe told the jury: ‘The two defendants are habitual confidence tricksters. They pose as a wealthy couple who are interested in buying expensive properties.’ He said the couple worked as a team. While 65-year-old Richard Jerome ‘takes the lead and does the talking’, making out that he has ‘substantial business interests abroad’, Hazel Jerome, 63, plays her part as they tell vendors about their ‘fantastic lifestyle’. In truth, the court heard, they never had more than £200 in their bank account and lived on Mrs Jerome’s pension. The Exeter jury has been told about their previous convictions at Huntingdon Crown Court in 2009, relating to two houses. One couple involved lost £167,000 on the value of their cottage in Buckinghamshire and on unpaid bills and rent. In the other case, it took 12 months to evict them from a property in Milton Keynes. Jerome, known as Rick, was jailed for 15 months after he admitted fraud and deception, and his wife was given a ten-month suspended term after admitting fraud. A property in Milton Keynes where the couple 'squatted for 12 months' Swan Cottage, Stoke Hammond. The Jeromes squatted here for six months . However, the current hearing was told, even while the couple were being investigated for those offences, they were turning their attention to the West Country. The court heard that the Jeromes made an offer of £310,000 on a house in East Looe, Cornwall, saying they wanted it as their UK base because they lived for six months each year in Barbados. They blamed delays in the deal on Jerome being seriously ill, and the ‘purchase’ was still going on when the couple admitted fraud at Huntingdon Crown Court. However the seller read newspaper reports about the case and was able to bale out without losing much money. Not long after Jerome was released from jail, the couple targeted a £750,000 clifftop house with stunning sea views in Sidmouth, Devon, using the false surname of Ausson, the jury heard. They made another series of excuses for delays in the purchase, blaming solicitors and illness, but a surveyor they failed to pay for his work discovered their real identities and contacted police. In interviews Jerome refused to comment. His wife denied any fraud and said she lived off her state and teacher’s pensions. She said they wanted to buy a retirement home in the West Country for £300,000 or more and was told by her husband that his offshore company would make the purchase. But the court heard that bank statements showed he never had more than £200 in his account. The trial continues.
