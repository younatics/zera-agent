"Madrid health authorities have put down Ebola patient Teresa Romero Ramos' dog, Excalibur, despite protests to save the animal's life. The dog was sedated before being euthanized, according to health authorities. Its body was moved, following protocol, to a place where it could be cremated. Excalibur's death comes despite a public push, including a Change.org petition signed by about 400,000 people. ""It would be much easier to isolate or quarantine the dog just as they have the victim's husband,"" the petition stated, rather than forcing Romero and her husband to lose ""one of the family."" Romero is a nurse's assistant at Madrid's Carlos III hospital, where she is believed to have gotten Ebola while caring for missionaries being treated for the virus there. She is in isolation at the same hospital. Her husband is also there under observation, though he hasn't shown any symptoms of Ebola. Hospital worker with Ebola 'doing better' Health authorities put down Excalibur because of concern it may have become infected with Ebola. That raised questions: Can dogs really get Ebola and spread it to humans? What about other animals? In Africa, Ebola infection ""has been documented through the handling of infected chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines,"" WHO says, though researchers think fruit bats are what they call the virus' ""natural host."" Studies on dogs transmitting the infection are not as conclusive. During the 2001-2002 Ebola outbreak in Gabon, scientists from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found signs of the virus in around 25% of dogs living in the affected area of the country. Yet none of the animals became symptomatic or died of the disease during the study period. ""The only conclusion that may be safely drawn from this study is that the animals encountered Ebola virus (and their immune systems responded),"" Margaret H. Gilbert, a clinical veterinarian and assistant professor of medicine at Tulane National Primate Research Center, wrote in an email to CNN. ""Whether or not dogs shed Ebola once their immune systems encounter it remains to be seen."" When other wild animals like chimpanzees are infected with the virus, ""the infection is highly lethal and causes huge outbreaks and massive population declines,"" the scientists wrote in their published paper. How did Spanish nurse catch Ebola? Dogs may excrete infectious Ebola particles in their urine, feces or drool, the scientists wrote, as has been observed with other animals. ""Asymptomatically infected dogs could be a potential source of human Ebola outbreaks,"" they wrote.","Madrid health authorities euthanize the dog, which will be cremated .

"I fell in love on a Monday night. Now, many may say a teenage girl can't know about such things. But that night as I watched Dallas Cowboys running back Tony Dorsett roll downfield 99 yards for a touchdown, I fell head-over-heels in love with the NFL. It was January 3, 1983 -- Monday Night Football, Dallas vs. Minnesota.  I'd never seen anything so inspiring. Dorsett was so free, so graceful and so powerful to me. He was focused and determined. Watching him break free of his competitors, those who wanted to bring him down and stop him from reaching his goal, I was in awe. And I knew then that his run capsulized all that I wanted to accomplish in my life. That football game is one of my most cherished childhood memories. I have been a passionate NFL fan since that moment -- though I switched my loyalties to the Philadelphia Eagles, my hometown team. My family has never understood my love affair with the league. They have balked as play dates, family events, even church services have been rearranged or skipped to fit my football calendar.  I ended up spending much of my career in sports journalism, a dream job if ever there was one. But after 30 years, my love and respect for the game is fading. And I'm seriously considering giving up football completely.  I don't want to, but I am left with little choice. I've come to this pass because of a recent airing of ""League of Denial, The NFL's Concussion Crisis,"" the PBS documentary that details the hidden story of the NFL and brain injuries. Based on a book  by journalists Mark Fainaru-Wada and Steve Fainaru, the program examines the NFL's attempt to cover up medical science that has linked Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, called CTE, to concussions in NFL players. Players with CTE have battled depression, memory loss, and in some cases dementia. The NFL consistently has denied any connection. But many of the men who play the game feel differently. ""I think I'm just paranoid. But ... from their standpoint, I think they are looking forward to covering their own (butt) more than anything, more than player safety,"" Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl champion Terrell Suggs told the Baltimore Sun. Hall of Famer Troy Aikman, whose concussion in 1994 was featured in the documentary, told PBS: . ""I do not have a son; if I had a son, I wouldn't necessarily discourage him from playing football, but I don't know that I would encourage him to play, either. ... I don't know what the data show, but I haven't sensed there's been a reduction in head injuries. With that in mind, that's concerning. As long as we're having contact and as long as there are collisions, there's going to be head injuries."" The NFL, which did not participate in the documentary, agreed in late August to a $765 million settlement in a concussion lawsuit with more than 4,500 players and their families. The proposed settlement allows the NFL to avoid a public trial to fight accusations that the league concealed what it knew about the dangers of head injuries. Under the terms of the pending settlement, which is still awaiting approval by a judge, the NFL likely won't have to disclose internal files about what it knew, or when it knew of any links between concussions and permanent brain injury. When I watch the games today, the awe is gone. Instead, I thank God that my son never wanted to play football, that it was basketball that stole his heart. And I find it ironic and a bit disingenuous that the NFL, in an effort to make the game more attractive to its 44% female audience, adorns the players and the field in Breast Cancer pink. Imagine where breast cancer research would be today if the science around the cause of the disease was rejected, or covered up. Imagine if women were told to ignore the warning signs of this killer disease, or if we were denied access to lifesaving treatment. Today, instead of telling kids how football helped to inspire me to go after what I want in life, I advise them and their parents to avoid the game at all costs. It's not safe at any level. Play other sports. I'm not alone. The Hall of Fame Giants linebacker Harry Carson, who was a leading voice in the documentary, doesn't believe the game is safe for children today. ""I pray parents understand all they're getting into when they allow their kids to play football,"" he said. ""My oldest son luckily gravitated to basketball, and as a doctor he understands what concussions are about. My younger son didn't play, and to this day I'm grateful,"" said Carson, who begs his daughter not to let his grandson play. ""Because concussions happen all the time on every level of football, the long-term damage is terrible, and we're seeing evidence of it all the time."" I agree. I've worked with former NFLers who suffer blackouts in midsentence, after being diagnosed with numerous concussions over their careers. And many of us knew Junior Seau and other football players who have taken their own lives. Too many of us in the sports industry stood by and watched yesterday's heroes implode, or fall into depression in retirement. It's easy to sit back and pontificate about why so many players are violent, both on and off the field, or how they ended up with ruined lives. We often blamed the players themselves. ""They were irresponsible men, or had bad agents, girlfriends, wives who took advantage of them,"" we explained. We blamed everything but the game itself for so many ruined lives and serious psychological problems. Now I see that I have been an enabler, blindly protecting the game -- the game that afforded me a lucrative career at ESPN. How could I criticize any NFL commissioner for doing the same? We have all made a very comfortable living off the game and the backs of men like Harry Carson, Tony Dorsett and Junior Seau. I want to save my relationship with the league, but it needs to own up about CTE. Stop endlessly denying the findings of medical science that say playing football can cause permanent brain damage. End the lies. Just admit we have a problem. That is the first step. Stop the slick marketing campaigns to keep telling our children all they need is to learn a ""safe way to hit in football,"" while denying each hit comes with a dire consequence. This relationship is toxic. If my beloved NFL continues to lie and deny while men and boys are suffering and dying, then it's time for this fan to say good-bye.","Roxanne Jones says she fell in love with football 30 years ago; became a sports journalist .

"Two Iranian navy warships arrived Saturday morning in Port Sudan, in the second such visit to Sudan within two months, eyewitnesses and officials said. ""These visits by Iranian navy warships to Sudan come in the framework of routine exercises by navy forces of friendly nations,"" Col. Khaled Saad al-Sawarmy, the official spokesman for the Sudanese armed forces, told CNN. ""They aim to accomplish political and diplomatic goals in addition to securing and policing the ports and waters."" The two ships are a destroyer and a helicopter carrier, Iran's state-run news agency IRNA said. The commanders of the flotilla met with senior Sudanese naval commanders, the news agency said. Sudan's Commander Abdullah Al-Matari called for enhanced military ties with Iran and said the establishment of marine security was a priority for both nations, IRNA said. The last such visit came at the end of October, when a pair of Iranian warships spent four days docked in Port Sudan, according to Sudanese state media. They arrived less than a week after a weapons factory in Khartoum was bombed, killing two people, in what Sudanese officials said was an airstrike by Israel, Iran's foe. Israel declined to comment on the attack in the east African country.","Two Iranian warships dock in Port Sudan, officials and witnesses say .

"The rolling hills that surround the city of Erbil in northern Iraq once helped the bustling Kurdish capital earn its reputation as the Switzerland of the Middle East. Beneath the verdant greenery which dominates this ancient landscape, however, lies the source of the region's prosperity -- lots of oil and gas. These bountiful natural resources combined with the relative stability of northern Iraq have helped fuel a nascent luxury property boom in recent years -- no mean feat in a country that has been pummeled by three wars, brutal dictatorship and recurring sectarian tensions over the last three decades. See also: Where are the world's most expensive luxury properties? ""I don't know how to describe it but it is growing and it will still grow,"" explained Dean Michael, chairman of Atconz Group, a Iraqi company behind a series of developments in Erbil's luxury property sector. Michael is overseeing the construction of a vast neighborhood of four bedroom villas spread over 8 million square feet of land to the north of the city at an estimated cost of $550 million. A 200-square-meter villa in 2010 here sold for $350 per square meter ($32 per sq ft). That same unit in 2013 averaged $1,250 per square meter ($116 per sq ft), more than tripling in value over three years. ""I believe that we will be comparable to modern countries and cities in about 10 years time,"" Michael confidently stated. See also: Mumbai's new star on the rise . These ambitions are backed up by the figures. In the last six years alone, the Kurdish regional government says it has attracted $20 billion worth of foreign direct investment with some 2,000 companies either investing or setting up shop there. After three years of oil prices averaging more than $100 a barrel, meanwhile, Iraq's fourth largest city is now enjoying a second boom as it welcomes wealthy Syrians, Egyptians and Lebanese fleeing violence and uncertainty in their homelands. Many end up in the Rotana, Erbil's first five-star hotel. According to general manager, Thomas Touma, the Rotana is where local business deals have been sealed since the hotel opened its doors three years ago.

""Three years ago I remember we had in Erbil around 15 to 19 flights per week.  Today there are above 90."" But while business is booming for those at the higher end of the income spectrum,  not all is green and pleasant in Erbil. Complaints from old traders about being left behind can still be heard within the ancient walls of the old citadel.

"Syrian rebels and a Kurdish militia appear to be negotiating a cease-fire after clashes in the battle-scarred northern city of Aleppo on Saturday left at least 21 fighters dead and more than 100 people kidnapped. According to Ahmad Afash, a commander from the rebel Free Syrian Army, or FSA, at least 16 FSA fighters were killed when they clashed with armed members of the Kurdish Democratic Union Party, or PYD, on Saturday.  He said at least five Kurdish fighters were also killed in the battle. Read more: Kurds' ambitions add explosive element to Syria equation . The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that at least 30 people were killed in the battle. There were conflicting accounts of who started the fight. But the clash raises the specter of Syria turning into an anarchic battleground for competing ethnic and sectarian militias, as the civil war grinds on. The FSA is an armed movement fighting the Syrian government.  It is largely made up of Arabs from Syria's majority Sunni Muslim sect. The PYD says it represents Syria's long-oppressed ethnic Kurdish minority. It is also the Syrian offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, a pan-Kurdish nationalist movement better known internationally for the guerilla war it has fought for nearly three decades against the government of neighboring Turkey. Read more: Envoy to Syria meets with Russian minister after truce unravels . A PYD activist who asked only to be named Abu Mohammed for security reasons told CNN that ""the Free Syrian Army opened fire on a demonstration by the people who were demanding that the FSA leave their Kurdish majority neighborhood."" Abu Mohammed sent CNN a link to a video distributed by ""Ronahi TV,"" a representative of the PYD. Purportedly filmed in the Aleppo neighborhood of Ashrafiya on Saturday, it showed hundreds of Kurdish demonstrators chanting in Kurdish, ""long live our fighters"" and ""Kurdish unity."" Some of the men were armed with shotguns, and some activists also wore the red, yellow and green of the PYD and chanted ""Apo,"" the nickname of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is imprisoned on an island in Turkey. At one point in the video, gunfire rings out and demonstrators run for cover. The video later showed several wounded men being brought to hospital. It was not clear who injured them. Another member of the PYD, from the Syrian town of Afrin, who asked not to be named for security reasons, also accused FSA rebels of breaking a peace agreement with the Kurdish militia. ""There was an agreement between us and the FSA not to enter the Kurdish-dominated areas with their weapons,"" the Kurdish activist said in a phone call with CNN.  ""But then a group of FSA fighters just entered the neighborhood of Ashrafiya and set up checkpoints ... then we had to respond because it was a breach of the agreement."" Read more: Turkish government asks Kurdish prisoners to end hunger strike . But Ahmed Afash, the FSA commander based in the town of Anadan, directly north of Aleppo, said that ""PYD militants attacked an FSA checkpoint, killed a number of FSA fighters and kidnapped several others."" Kurdish and FSA activists agree, however, that the initial clash triggered a round of kidnapping, during which both militias grabbed members of each others' communities. Afash, who commands an FSA brigade that calls itself the ""Free Men of Syria,"" claimed responsibility for the capture of ""a number of civilian Kurds"" on Saturday in order ""to force the PYD to negotiations."" On Sunday, the Kurdish Taakhi Coordination Committee announced on its Facebook page that 120 Kurds who had been kidnapped by the FSA ""were released ... and negotiations are now being held by the PYD and the FSA to find a way out of this."" That account was echoed by the PYD member in Afrin, who told CNN that ""we have both released the people who got kidnapped and captured, and I think we will reach an agreement soon."" Read more: Report says Turkey's Kurdish conflict has turned more violent . The incident came as no surprise to a Syria expert. ""It was a matter of time before the PYD and opposition armed groups came to clash,"" Peter Harling, a Syria analyst with the nonprofit conflict mediation organization International Crisis Group, wrote in an e-mail to CNN.  He said that Kurdish militias and Syrian rebels have conflicting ideologies. ""The latter distrust the former's allegedly secessionist agenda, its secular outlook, and its relatively accommodating stance vis a vis the regime, while the PYD sees opposition armed groups as importing a hegemonic, pan-Islamic worldview,"" Harling added. ""For now none of these two sides has in interest in seeing this escalate, however. The armed opposition is focused on defeating the regime, and the PYD would rather stay on the sidelines as long as it can secure the areas where Kurds congregate."" Last summer, as anti-government rebels battled regime forces, PYD militants made a power grab in several Kurdish communities along Syria's northern border with Turkey. PYD activists raised the Kurdish flag over these towns and declared them autonomous from central government rule.  But they also refused join the armed rebellion against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, preferring to stay on the sidelines of Syria's bloody civil war.","Clashes in Aleppo on Saturday left at least 21 fighters dead, more than 100 people kidnapped .

"(CNN)As a proud pro-Israel American, I am grateful that an Israeli prime minister has been invited to address Congress for a third time -- a high honor shared only by Sir Winston Churchill. Yet in the middle of an Israeli election and with a congressional battle over Iran sanctions looming, sometimes an invitation is more political gamesmanship than diplomatic honor. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and House Speaker John Boehner's latest gambit -- arranging an address to a joint session of Congress by the Prime Minister just two weeks before the Israeli election -- is severely taxing our special relationship. With mixed emotions, I find myself empathizing with the Jewish leader who told Israeli columnist Chemi Shalev: ""I was literally sick to my stomach when I heard about it."" White House spokesman Josh Earnest diplomatically called the invitation ""a departure from protocol,"" and even staunch pro-Israel advocate and Anti-Defamation League head Abe Foxman termed it ""ill-advised."" Sadly, this invitation is glaring evidence that Israel is becoming a partisan football, a wedge issue cynically manipulated to grab headlines and seek political gain. We saw this dynamic play out in the 2012 presidential race when Mitt Romney's campaign attempted to peel off Jewish voters from President Obama by insinuating that Obama had thrown Israel ""under the bus."" It didn't work then, though the tactic will likely rear its ugly head again in the next race for the White House. And it's not likely to work now for Boehner, who is essentially enlisting the Israeli leader to help him try to deal the President of the United States a political blow by derailing nuclear negotiations with Iran through legislating new sanctions. Unfortunately, although the Republican Party is clearly hoping to hobble the current president's agenda, the real impact of the speaker's political stunt is likely to be a further erosion of the bipartisan nature of support for Israel, at a time when Israel increasingly needs America's backing as a bulwark against its growing international isolation. Secretary of State John Kerry held a lengthy meeting with Israel's ambassador to the United States on Tuesday, a day before the Washington visit was announced, a senior administration official told CNN. The Israeli government was being accused of assassinating an Iranian general on the Israel-Syria border, and the White House was, according to eminent Israeli journalist Nahum Barnea, exerting significant effort in an attempt to de-escalate the situation with Iran. Yet in an example of what Barnea describes as ""ingratitude of the ugliest kind,"" the planned visit was not mentioned. And when Netanyahu arrives in March, he and Kerry will not meet. Americans and Israelis who care about the relationship between the two countries must work quickly to prevent relations from sinking any lower. While our militaries are still coordinating as closely as ever, and our special relationship is ultimately built on more than the chemistry between two leaders, key long-term interests of both countries hang in the balance. Erosion of trust between our governments will damage our ability to work together to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, prevent a nuclear-armed Iran and establish a Palestinian state alongside Israel in peace and security. Boehner would be wise to postpone his invitation until later this spring, when the new Israeli government has been formed and the next prime minister has a fresh mandate from the Israeli people. And whoever that next leader is should make Washington his (or her) first visit, and work with the President to confront the serious challenges that our two countries face.","Invitation to Benjmain Netanyahu to speak to Congress has caused controversy .

"(CNN) -- The Spanish title race might have taken another twist Saturday when Barcelona visited mid-table Espanyol in the Catalan derby. For more than 75 minutes, the home team blanked Lionel Messi and the rest of the Barcelona attack. But just like in El Clasico on Sunday, Messi had the last word as he struck a late penalty to give Barcelona a 1-0 victory and all three points. His goal in the 77th minute over Espanyol temporarily put Barcelona two points atop the league standings ahead of Atletico Madrid but Atletico later rallied to defeat Athletic Bilbao 2-1 to regain its one-point advantage. Messi and Neymar missed good chances in the first half, while Espanyol's Pizzi also squandered a fine opportunity. But there were fewer chances in the second half, although Barcelona defender Gerard Pique struck the crossbar. With time running out, referee Clos Gomez ruled that Espanyol's Javi Lopez handled in the area and Messi made no mistake from the spot. Lopez then had to play goalkeeper after Francisco Casilla's handball outside the area stopped a Messi shot in the 83rd minute. Casilla was shown a straight red and Espanyol had already used all three of its substitutes. Iker Muniain put fourth-place Athletic ahead but Diego Costa leveled in the 22nd minute and Koke got the winner in the 55th. Aymeric Laporte saw red for hauling down Costa in the dying stages. Real Madrid, reeling from defeats to Barcelona and Sevilla, had its own derby late Saturday. It blanked Rayo Vallecano 5-0, getting two goals from Gareth Bale, and once again moved to within three points of Atletico. Barcelona and Atletico square off in the first leg of their Champions League quarterfinal next week. Rare stumble by Bayern . Under-strength Bayern Munich finally dropped points in Germany's Bundesliga, drawing Hoffenheim 3-3 to end a 19-match league winning streak that dated back to October. Bayern wrapped up the league title in record time this week and faces Manchester United in the Champions League quarterfinals Tuesday but it appeared as if Pep Guardiola's men were focused enough to claim three more points. It led 3-1 -- at home -- only for Sejad Salihovic to pull a goal back and Roberto Firmino to equalize in the 75th minute. To make matters worse, Spanish international midfielder Thiago Alcantara suffered a knee injury. Borussia Dortmund, which meets Real Madrid in the Champions League, maintained second place with a morale boosting 3-2 win at Stuttgart thanks to Marco Reus' hat-trick. Stuttgart led 2-1 but Georg Niedermeier conceded a penalty and received a second yellow in the 67th minute. Reus converted and added the winner in the 82nd minute.","Lionel Messi scores from the penalty spot as Barcelona beats Espanyol 1-0 .

"(CNN) -- You could say that Kilian Fischhuber is on top of his game. For almost a decade, the 30-year-old has scaled the peaks of competitive free-climbing, becoming one of the most successful boulderers the sport has ever known with five overall World Cup titles to his name. Bouldering -- the sport of climbing small rocks or boulders without ropes or harnesses -- combines athletic agility with incredible strength, which are two qualities the Austrian has in abundance. ""As a professional you need to be really focused and train really hard,"" Fischhuber told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""I think the thing that makes my climbing unique is that I'm really diverse. ""I'm really strong in different areas of climbing whether it's steep or flat, or long or short climbs. I'm a very powerful and dynamic climber, so this helps me to combine all the skills of the different areas of climbing."" Born in Waidhofen an der Ybbs, Fischhuber began climbing at the age of 11, honing his skills on indoor walls before moving outside to climb on rocks. He turned pro by the time he'd reached his late teens, and in 2005 he clinched his first World Cup title aged just 22. Once upon a time, bouldering was used solely for practice by climbers preparing for bigger climbs, but the rise in popularity of indoor climbing centers in recent decades has seen it morph into a sport. In 1998, it officially became a new climbing discipline, and the following year the International Federation of Sport Climbing held the first World Cup. This year, the competition was contested over eight meetings held around the globe, with competitors battling it out on a variety of artificial climbing walls with crash mats below. The winner is the climber who can conquer the most boulders in the fewest attempts. ""In competing, it's a lot about knowing what other people did and knowing you have to better them ... and that makes it really difficult,"" Fischhuber says. ""It's both mental and physical, but it depends on the situation. It can be very mental and not physical at all, but usually it's a combination."" Fischhuber has successfully mastered both over the last decade, recording a top-three finish in nine of the last 10 years. And while he didn't win the overall title this year, he made up for it by chalking up his first win at the European Championships in Eindhoven, Netherlands in September. ""Next season, I'm going to try to win the World Championships, which I haven't achieved yet ... that's one of my goals. And besides that, I want to climb hard stuff ... to push my limits,"" he says. Away from the competition walls, Fischhuber has already completed some of the toughest outdoor climbs. In 2006, he became one of only a handful of climbers to successfully scale Action Directe -- a famously difficult, 15-meter high rock in Frankenjura, Germany -- and in 2009, Fischhuber showed he was no slouch at longer climbs either, completing a 250-meter alpine ascent of ""The Emporer's New Clothes"" route in Austria's Wilder Kaiser region. ""Wherever I am, I always look out for rock faces. It would be good to discover something new, to go to places no-one has ever climbed before. I find myself on the Internet looking for places to climb. It's an addiction."" A recent trip to Zimbabwe uncovered ""some great rock faces and great places to develop climbing,"" he says, and from a personal perspective, he's keen to one day grapple with the mighty El Capitan, the 900 feet (275 meters) granite monolith in Yosemite National Park, California. But his heart, along with his fingers, remains firmly wedded to Europe's crags and cliffs, not least those flanking the Zillertal and Otztal valleys near his home in Innsbruck. It's a place where he can mix sport and pleasure, he says, picking routes that are sometimes really hard but also beautiful. ""It's not just the difficulty, it's also the aesthetics -- that it's a really nice climb makes it fun to do. It's a nice mix."" Fischhuber climbs the 100-meter cliff with the assistance of ropes, a harness and bolts anchored in the rock and a climbing partner called a belayer who controls the amount of friction on the rope. ""In sport climbing, or free climbing, you have a partner who belays you with a rope. Bolts are usually pre-placed -- drilled in, so really safe -- and you climb without resting or falling into the ropes. That's the objective ... It's usually a long process but it gives you a great feeling of satisfaction,"" Fischhuber says. ""There are situations when you are afraid -- for example, if you are really high above the last belay place, the last bolt -- but usually climbing and bouldering is not too dangerous. ""Sometimes it's difficult mentally, when you work on a route and you're not sure if it's possible. You put a lot of effort into it and learn later it's not possible, that's a big drawback, but you need to stay positive and have fun. It's just a really cool feeling to be up there alone."" Solitude at the top of a cliff is replaced by companionship when he gets back down. More often he's met by his girlfriend and fellow free climber Anna Stohr. The 25-year-old, a four-time overall World Cup winner and double world champion has the knack of keeping Fischhuber emotionally grounded while pushing him towards new career highs. ""All my travels and competitions and places I go, I spend time with her. With Anna, it's funny, she is successful. She has more titles than me and competing with her helps me a lot ... when we rock climb it's really inspiring. We can really push each other,"" he says. ""I still want to achieve harder climbs, longer climbs, some good places and results in competing. ""I think it's an old expression but when you die you don't want to look back at your life and think you haven't lived. So it's important what we do while we're alive.""","World-beating competition climber Kilian Fischhuber talks to CNN's Human to Hero series .

"(CNN)Journalist Steven Brill has written a new book about our dysfunctional system of health care and it's getting a lot of attention. In ""America's Bitter Pill: Money, Politics, Backroom Deals, and the Fight to Fix Our Broken Healthcare System,"" he describes the various struggles to implement the Affordable Care Act and dissects the ongoing opposition to the bill. As a nurse, I've always supported the ACA as a way for more Americans to get needed health care. But many people, including many nurses, view Obamacare as a government intrusion into individual lives. I can see their point of view, but I believe it's mistaken. The ACA does not allow government to interfere in our lives; it compels government to keep us as safe and healthy as possible. For the record, the Affordable Care Act was based on ""Romneycare,"" the market-based health insurance reform that Republican Mitt Romney put in place when he was governor of Massachusetts. The ACA, like Romneycare, prohibits insurance companies from excluding patients due to preexisting conditions, requires all individuals to buy insurance (since otherwise only the sick would sign up for coverage and the system would quickly become insolvent) and offers subsidies to middle-class and low-income families to make higher-quality coverage affordable. Despite its Republican provenance and utilization of private insurance companies, though, the ""government takeover"" label stuck to the ACA. And that was intentional. In his book, Brill explains that the phrase ""government takeover of health care"" came from conservative pollster Frank Luntz and became a rallying cry for the enemies of the Affordable Care Act who said Obamacare would deny Americans free choice over health insurance. ""Free choice"" is a tricky phrase here, because the ACA does curtail insurance choices, in that it disallows low-cost policies that don't provide anything close to real coverage of health care costs. But the only Americans who really had free choice over their health care prior to the implementation of Obamacare were those with excellent insurance or unlimited funds of their own. Consider Brill's story of his own aortic aneurysm and how glad he was to end up at New York-Presbyterian, one of New York's flagship hospital systems. There, he was operated on by an MD with an impeccable record in the exact surgical repair Brill needed. His hospital stay offered ""Mother Teresa care,"" and though his total bill came to $190,000, his insurance paid for the bulk of it. Now consider Sean Recchi, who's profiled in Brill's book: A 42-year-old, non-Hodgkin lymphoma patient from Lancaster, Ohio, with health insurance that, Brill specifies, provided minimal reimbursement for health care costs. Recchi had to pay M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston $83,900 in advance in order to begin treatment there. M.D. Anderson is a great hospital and I'm sure Recchi also received Mother Teresa care, but the upfront cost was enormous and the Recchis are not rich. The treatment he received did save his life, but it was obviously not free or freely chosen; his life was at stake and he believed M.D. Anderson would save him. Contrasting these anecdotes gets to the nub of the problem with health care: when people's lives are at stake -- as Brill's and Recchi's both were -- survival becomes much more important than cost. But cost of care can vary dramatically depending largely on whether someone has insurance and what the quality of that insurance is. The Affordable Care Act was intended to reduce those price disparities by better standardizing what insurance covers and what it costs, making it possible for more Americans to get the health care they need. The bill is complicated and imperfect, but it has created a much fairer system of health insurance than we had before. Brill, however, says the ACA does not go far enough in terms of controlling overall costs and improving quality. Right now, the United States pays much more for health care than any other developed country and we have worse health outcomes overall. The Affordable Care Act regulates insurance companies, but does not limit the huge profits made by pharmaceutical companies, device manufacturers or hospital administrators. That's because the ACA would not have passed without the support of those three groups. To corral those industries and really make American health care better, cheaper and fairer will probably require government intervention. I say that because every developed country that has some version of national health care uses government regulation to control access and set prices. Any move in that direction in the U.S., though, would bring further accusations of ""socialized medicine"" and stoke the ""government takeover"" fire. This is why I say we're focusing on the wrong thing -- on principles instead of lives. And I came to that conclusion by thinking back to my own father. A country boy from Osceola, Missouri, with the gumption to become a philosophy professor, my dad deeply resents ""Fasten Seat Belt"" lights in cars. ""It's the government telling me how to drive!"" was his common complaint. And he's right. But it's also true that seat belts save lives when automobiles crash, and Americans have acclimated ourselves to wearing seat belts and acknowledging their value. Obamacare then, may not effectively control health care costs in the long term, but the part of it that has made insurance newly affordable for millions of Americans is not an attempt to control people's lives, but to save them: a seat belt for travelers on our unbelievably expensive, miracle-delivering, health care highway. But don't take my word for it. Rely instead on Steve Beshear, governor of Kentucky, quoted in Bitter Pill describing his state's Obamacare exchange, called Kynect: ""Just have a look . . . You'll like it. It's not about me or President Obama. It's about you.""","Journalist Steven Brill has written a new book about our dysfunctional system of health care .

"(CNN) -- Jenna McCorkell has spent her career dancing on a knife edge. Upon the razor-slim width of her ice skates hinges more than just success or failure at the top end of the sport. Every year that skating travels further, every leap seemingly more intricate than the last, but one thing remains the same -- the unforgiving surface on which they perform. ""How the sport of ice skating is evolving, it's insane,"" McCorkell, an 11-time British champion from Northern Ireland, told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""You're seeing a lot more injuries, a lot more accidents with the tricky things we're being pushed to make our bodies do. ""You've got to take off, jump up, turn around three times in the air in a split second. You've got to be perfectly straight to make sure you've got that landing on one foot. ""It's not even on one foot -- it's on a tiny blade of a few millimeters. ""You haven't got much leeway to be out of balance. It does take an incredible amount of strength, balance and coordination to be able to perform those jumps."" Things weren't quite as daring when McCorkell's obsession with figure skating began. A newspaper article that featured a little girl in a sparkly dress clutching a shiny trophy had her pestering her parents for an introduction to the ice. ""They took me over to the ice rink and I started my first lessons. I just didn't stop from there,"" she explains. ""I was a nightmare. I wanted to do every public session, every club hour, everything. I was addicted from the start."" Three years later, she became the youngest skater to ever make the Great Britain team, aged just 10. Seventeen years after that, after 11 national championship titles, she is preparing to put the brakes on her skating career. But not before she competes at next month's Winter Olympics in Sochi, aiming to banish the memories of her performance in Vancouver four years previously. And yet, despite an ocean of time having passed since that first enchanting step onto the ice, there is still an element of that thrill present whenever she competes. ""The first time I ever performed, I remember being so excited. I remember I just couldn't wait to get my dress on,"" she recalls. ""It changes a lot as you get older but it's always fun to compete when you're at such a young age -- you've got no worries, no pressure and no stress. You're just so excited, bouncing to get on the ice. ""You go through a lot of different emotions and changes throughout the years -- some good, some bad."" All those early memories certainly filter into the former category. Her prodigious rise after first picking up her skates culminated in that unprecedented inclusion in the Great Britain squad for someone so young. McCorkell has enjoyed success on the international stage, winning gold medals at several prestigious events, and finishing in the top 10 at two European Championships. But it is on her own territory that she is peerless -- last year's British title success was her eighth in a row. ""Winning 11 titles is quite something,"" she said of her epic run. ""Somebody asked me how does it feel and I said, 'Old!' After 11 years of being British champion, it's quite an achievement and I'm really, really proud of it and proud of everyone that has supported me. ""You start to learn to cope with the fact that more and more is expected of you. I think the motivation to continue comes from wanting it more and more for myself."" There is an epic beauty about figure skating that resonates with the public. The effortless grace of competitors performing to music has produced iconic moments in the sport, sparked by a flawless sequence at the 1984 Winter Olympics. Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean's pairs routine in Sarajevo enchanted the public and judges alike, securing the British pair a perfect score from the judges -- a feat that had never been done before. It won't happen in the future either, after a change in the judging system on the back of a controversial ruling at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Russian pair Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze took gold in the mixed pairs despite many believing Canada's Jamie SalÃ© and David Pelletier should have triumphed. The new code means each skater gets a base value for every move they perform in a routine, based on its difficulty, even if they fall while doing it. That means a skater who has fallen can still score higher than a competitor who has skated cleanly. Consequently, routines are become more audacious, and some skaters are now pushing the boundaries by attempting quadruple axels -- four aerial revolutions on a jump. ""I love skating because on the ice you just feel free,"" McCorkell says. ""You're never at your limit. ""You can always try more -- there are so many goals, so much more you can do with the sport developing like it is, with the new judging system. ""It's more difficult for people like me who've been in the sport a long time to adapt to new things because our bodies are not like the fresh 15-year-olds who've been brought up in the new judging system. ""So that's something that's quite difficult. For the older generation, I think it's getting quite exciting, especially in the men's events -- it's getting crazy with the quad jumps. ""Before, it was unbelievable if they did one quad and now you've got guys, maybe five or six guys, doing three different quads in a program so it's quite exciting."" Looming large on the horizon is the pinnacle of any figure skating career -- the Winter Olympics. McCorkell made her first appearance at Vancouver 2010, and though she says her memories will last a lifetime, a disappointing 29th placing will also linger. ""It was an amazing experience I'll never forget,"" she says. ""Walking out at the opening ceremony, the feeling was just overwhelming. ""That's something nobody can ever take away from you -- no matter what those results are, you always have those memories. ""In Vancouver, I didn't have my best skate. It was probably my worst performance in the previous four years and I have no explanation as to why. It was just one of those days. ""It just didn't happen, so I think that it can always be better than that and I think I'm in a better place mentally now than I was then so hopefully it will all be OK. ""I'm pretty excited about Sochi now. It's getting closer and closer. ""The training is starting to pay off in the competitions so my results have been gradually increasing through the season and I hope that will continue and I hope I skate my best there for myself."" A strong performance in Sochi would represent a fitting finale to a distinguished and illustrious career that will officially end in March. ""After Sochi, I'll go to the world championships in Japan and then I'll retire, that'll be my last competitive season,"" McCorkell added. ""I think after so long, I've achieved more than I could ever have dreamed of and I hope to have a good end to the season and then that'll be me -- done.""","Jenna McCorkell is an 11-time British figure skating champion from Northern Ireland .

"(CNN)In case we need any reminder that gun politics can be over the top, there's the recent report that gunmaker PARA USA regrets supplying weapons to the action flick ""Taken 3"" and is calling for a boycott. Why? It's not because they're feeling guilty about triggering violent fantasies in some viewers, but because the star of the movie series, Liam Neeson, had the gall to tell a reporter that there were too many guns in America. There's no doubt Americans are worried about gun violence and support some proposals to keep guns away from potentially dangerous people. For example, in poll after poll, Americans of all political stripes, including gun owners, support background checks on all firearm purchases.  (A requirement of that sort was enacted by popular vote last November in Washington state.)  California, New York, and a handful of other states, altogether constituting one-quarter of the U.S. population, have regulations on gun design, transactions, possession or use that go well beyond federal requirements. On the other hand, public opinion in support of protecting gun rights has grown in recent decades, and in red states there has been a highly successful effort to deregulate guns. The political environment is surely challenging on this issue, but we see several promising policy approaches that are especially well suited to balancing different interests while advancing shared goals. The development of ""smart"" guns promises to give gun owners a new option that many of them would value, namely, a weapon that could only be unlocked by a ""key"" they control.  A gun of this sort has been developed by the German manufacturer Armatix, utilizing RFID technology of the same sort that we have all become accustomed to with our car keys.  These ""personalized"" guns won't reduce violence by reckless owners, but the technology will cut down on misuse by curious children, suicidal teens, thieves or other unauthorized users who get their hands on the weapon.  It seems ironic that the effort to block the introduction of such guns in the United States, so far successful, is led by organizations that advocate gun rights. Most gun assaults occur outside the home.  When an underage youth, gang member or ex-con is picked up carrying a gun, there is a good chance that a serious crime has been prevented.  Judges must do their part by treating illicit gun carrying as a serious offense, rather than dismissing such cases as ""victimless crimes.""  By analogy, most drunk-driving cases are ""victimless"" in that no one was harmed, but overall the successful crusade (by MADD and other groups) to have DUI treated as a serious crime has saved thousands of lives. Reducing illicit carrying would have the same effect. Recent mass shootings have brought mental health experts and gun violence prevention advocates together to forge sensible approaches. Federal law disqualifies from gun ownership those who have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution or otherwise ruled mentally incompetent by a judge.  That disqualification can only be effectively implemented in states that enter their mental health records into the national background check system kept by the FBI, a small step in the right direction. But federal law is of little use in responding to most cases where a psychotic individual poses a threat.  A carefully crafted policy is needed to allow judges to order guns removed from those who are found to be dangerous to themselves or others due to mental illness. Such quick response policies should be coupled with a process to restore gun rights when the danger has dissipated. In sum, guns, like many other commodities, create risks as well as benefits.  In regulating cars, liquor, medical procedures, and much else, there is a balance between risks and benefits.  That common-sense approach doesn't have the drama of a Liam Neeson film, but it is our best hope going forward.","Actor Liam Neeson criticizes gun culture in U.S.; in response, gun advocates call for boycott of his movie .
Philip Cook and Kristin Goss: There's actually a common sense approach to the gun issue ."
"No glamorous chandeliers, no extravagant façade -- to find the most beautiful bookshop in China, travelers just have to follow the yellow-striped road to an underground car park. Before Librairie Avant-Garde owner Qian Xiaohua, 50, obtained the 4,000-square-meter underground space beneath Wutaishan Stadium in Nanjing in 1999, it was a government car park and, earlier, a bomb shelter. ""We chose this car park because it borders Nanjing University -- it has become the second library for university students,"" says Qian. ""There is an old saying in Chinese -- turn something rotten into a miracle."" Instead of a shelf for best-selling books, visitors are welcomed by a replica of Rodin's ""The Thinker"" sculpture. The cashier counter is built from thousands of old books. ""You walk up the slope that still retains its yellow traffic stripes on the ground between two rows of shelves,"" says Qian, as though he'd just opened the shop a week ago. ""After that, look back and you'll see a big shining cross that shines upon you, as well as many others that came here before you."" Reading as religion . Qian converted to Christianity when he quit a job with the provincial government to open the first Librairie Avant-Garde, across the street from the St. Paul Cathedral. It was a tiny store -- 17 square meters. ""I listened to the hymns coming from the church every day and I felt so peaceful,"" says Qian. ""Then I became a Christian."" That explains the large crosses in all of shop's branches. But it's not simple Christian faith Qian is promoting. ""We aim to be a humanities bookstore as well as a religious store,"" says Zhang Xing, manager of the Wutaichan shop. ""Here in Librairie Avant-Garde, reading is our religion and this place is the heaven for book lovers."" The main hall of the bookstore serves as a forum for talks and concerts. It also houses a homey coffee shop, permanent exhibition space for beautiful book designs and a retail area for creative works by Nanjingers. Qian's favorite artworks hang from the ceiling. Pillars in the store are etched with famous verses and poems. Book shops reflect city's well being . The beauty of Qian's bookstore lies in its unique way of operating. Qian sees his shop as a kind of public library. Two long reading tables and more than 300 seats are available for readers who are encouraged to stay and read in the shop's main hall. ""I come here very often because they stock a wide range of books and they don't discriminate against readers who just want to read,"" says Robin Wang, a recent graduate from a local university. She says she came to the store twice a week during her years in the university. ""A good bookshop should provide space, vision and nurture the city with its humanitarian spirit,"" says Qian. ""It's a place for people to have dreams in the city."" As Chinese cities undergo rapid development, and e-books chip away at the market for traditional books, many independent book stores are facing financial difficulties across the country. ""Independent book shops represent the well being of the city,"" says Qian. ""When a city is losing its bookshops, it's actually losing something in its soul."" Librairie Avant-Garde operates two other stores in Nanjing, including one inside the Presidential Palace. Its latest store is its first outside of Nanjing; it's located in the old town in Wuxi. But it's the special car park location and design that's made the main shop a tourist landmark of the city. ""Librairie Avant-Garde has unintentionally become the city's tourist spot,"" says Qian. ""Tourists come here to observe the culture of a city, to exchange cultures and it's also become a new meeting spot in Nanjing."" Librairie Avant-Garde, 173 Guangzhou lu (next to Wutaishan Stadium), Gulou District, Nanjing; +86 25 8371 1455; open daily from 10 a.m.-9 p.m.","Voted China's most beautiful bookshop, Librairie Avant-Garde is in an underground car park .

"(CNN)As Americans, we are fortunate to have the right to speak our minds.  Filmmaker Michael Moore did just that with his attack on the use of military snipers in warfare just before the release of the Oscar-nominated and devastating war/anti-war movie ""American Sniper,"" directed by Clint Eastwood. Moore obviously has the same freedom of speech right that all Americans do. Some of what he has publicly stated in the past is opinion, some is fact and some is absolutely ludicrous. In an apparent reference to Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, credited with 160 enemy kills -- the most in U.S. history -- and the movie ""American Sniper,"" Moore commented on Twitter that his ""uncle was killed by a sniper"" and that he was ""taught that all snipers were cowards."" Moore explains snipers are 'cowards' tweet . To begin with, the reason Americans have the freedom of speech Moore was exercising is because brave men such as Kyle and other active-duty personnel and military veterans have fought to protect this precious right. As far as the comment that ""snipers are cowards,"" that is beyond ludicrous and it is difficult to understand just how anybody could make such a comment. Let's look at some of the basic facts surrounding Kyle's life as a Navy SEAL sniper. Kyle either trained for war or was deployed in war zones for more than 300 days a year during his service in the SEAL teams. SEAL wives basically raise their children alone. The divorce rate for SEALs is incredibly high. Many of the guys have been married multiple times. The children grow up not really knowing their dads because the dads go on frequent and often back-to-back deployments to war zones. These guys seldom know when they are leaving or for how long. Their work involves going in harm's way and fighting an enemy that is determined to do whatever it can to take away our way of life. After returning home from a deployment, these guys immediately go back to work preparing for the next deployment. Some are not so fortunate and are wounded or killed in the line of duty. A sniper, who operates behind enemy lines, has one of the most demanding and dangerous duties in the Special Operations community. Snipers operating in Iraq, Afghanistan and a host of other countries often must crawl and make their way through treacherous urban or desert war-zone terrain for hours just to reach their position undetected, a position of over-watch, cover and concealment. Once they are on site, they sometimes stay in their position for days on end waiting for follow-on orders. Why 'American Sniper' is a smash hit . Military snipers are not sociopaths, coldblooded killers. Snipers believe in their hearts that when they neutralize, or ""take out,"" a threat that they are saving the lives of their teammates, other military personnel or other innocent people. Their target hit lists typically include terrorists or people preparing to cause grave harm or death to the innocent. As I cite in my book ""The Modern Day Gunslinger,"" Lt. Col. David Grossman uses the analogy of wolves, sheep and sheepdogs. Grossman, in his book ""On Combat,"" compares the average citizen as basically peaceful and nonthreatening -- like sheep. These are the majority of people and do not want to cause harm to others; they wish to live peacefully. The terrorist -- the enemy, the ""bad guy"" -- strikes terror and threatens to harm and kill the innocent, like the wolf who threatens the sheep. Fortunately, there are brave men and women who sacrifice much to protect those who wish to live day to day in peace. These protectors are the community sheepdogs. Chris Kyle was a champion sheepdog. Every time Kyle pulled back on his trigger and fired a shot that neutralized a ""wolf,"" he was saving countless lives and protecting the sheep. Every wolf he put down was no longer capable of causing harm or death to the sheep, the innocents. I ask, how can anybody consider a sniper, a Navy SEAL sniper, to be a coward? As much as I try to keep my mind open to all viewpoints -- from the far left to the far right -- I can only reach the conclusion that Michael Moore has no idea what he is talking about. His unfounded comments could not be further from the truth. I am confident that if Moore had the courage to spend just one day in a war-zone ""sniper hide,"" waiting for the go signal to take out an enemy target his opinions on snipers and the military would change 180 degrees. I would go so far as to say if Moore would simply attend a one-day sniper-training course in the United States, his opinion would drastically change. Yes, of course, he has the right to say whatever he wishes, but when a guy like Moore has the pulpit and the attention of the media, he should have a moral obligation to speak only on topics in which he has some basic knowledge of the facts. Chris Kyle is an American war hero who has been credited and awarded for saving countless American and innocent lives. After what he did for our country, after all of his sacrifices, Kyle decided to get out of the Navy and assist those brothers in arms who returned from overseas with post-traumatic stress disorder. How incredibly sad and ironic that in February 2013, Kyle was killed and shot in the back, police say, by a former Marine suffering with PTSD whom he was trying to help and mentor. Michael Moore, tell me: How was Chris Kyle a coward? How are snipers cowards? When Kyle was killed, he left his loving and devoted wife, Taya, behind. She feels that ""American Sniper"" did a good job at portraying the struggles that Kyle endured as a Navy SEAL sniper as well as his roles as a husband and father.  The movie illustrates the real-life story of heroism, patriotism and self-sacrifice of a remarkable American war hero. Bradley Cooper, who portrayed Kyle, told NPR that the role was ""nothing short of life-changing. It's just not about me or Clint (Eastwood), or anybody else. ... It's a real human being. ... So there's a huge responsibility. But I saw it as an honor. ... I felt like I lived with him for those six months in a very intimate way. ... (H)e was the first voice I heard every morning and the last voice I heard going to bed."" Kyle joins the elite ranks of other American sniper icons such as Carlos Hathcock, who was credited with 93 confirmed kills during the Vietnam War. Hathcock felt the same as Kyle did when it came to taking out threats. He simply understood that he was protecting his fellow Marines and other innocent people. If there were not people like Kyle and Hathcock protecting our freedoms, Michael Moore, along with the rest of us, would live in a much more dangerous world. I remain deeply honored and humbled to be an American and to have been part of a community where heroes like Kyle have served.","Don Mann: Michael Moore called snipers cowards, but they protect his free speech .

"The Supreme Court delivered a Christmas present to Arizona DREAMers. You remember the DREAMers. This is one of the few cohorts of illegal immigrants who are actually innocent of wrongdoing since they were brought here as children by their parents. Although many DREAMers are reluctant to acknowledge this fact, it's the parents who did something wrong when they violated immigration law. But, in this country, we don't punish children for the sins of their parents. Instead, where it makes sense, we make accommodations. One such accommodation is Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a program by the Obama administration that allows undocumented youths to apply for a temporary reprieve from deportation and a two-year work permit. But what good is a job if you can't get to it? And so now, thanks to the high court and lower federal courts, the estimated 22,000 DREAMers in Arizona can finally do what thousands of other young adults do each year in the Grand Canyon State: apply for a driver's license. That's appropriate. Many of these people are driving anyway, and they have been for years. Why not give them a license and make them buy insurance? Besides, under DACA, these kids are working and paying taxes to the state of Arizona -- some of which go to build roads. How can state officials deny these people the right to drive on roads they helped build? This historic development came about despite the best efforts by state officials to block it, as a way of protesting the administration's policy. Whereas officials in most states made no attempt to deny DREAMers driver's licenses, Arizona once again outdid itself. Along with Nebraska, it was one of only two states to deny driving privileges to DACA recipients. In 2012, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer -- who had already used the immigration issue and her support for a tough state law that required local police to enforce federal immigration statutes to scare up enough votes to win re-election in 2010 -- went so far as to sign an executive order that barred DREAMers from obtaining driver's licenses. Normally, the issue of jurisdiction would be a slam dunk. Regulating driving privileges is the job of states. But, when state officials arbitrarily deny one group of people a benefit enjoyed by others -- especially for crass political reasons -- the federal courts must step in and correct the injustice. Recently, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals began the process of making such a correction when it ruled that Brewer's prohibition of driver's licenses for DREAMers was likely unconstitutional and told a lower court to issue a temporary injunction preventing state officials from enforcing the executive order. In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court declined to review the lower court ruling and denied Brewer's request for a stay. U.S. District Court Judge David Campbell will hold a hearing on January 7 to hear oral arguments and decide whether to make the injunction permanent. Within days of the high court's ruling, DREAMers (for the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act) started lining up at Arizona Department of Transportation offices around the state to apply for driver's licenses. In Arizona, and around the country, we can spend the next few years haggling over the details of what the actual driver's licenses look like. Some states might choose to add distinguishing marks to driver's licenses that go to the undocumented. Some states have already done that, for instance, stamping the words: ""For Driving Purposes Only"" or ""Not for Identification"" on top of some licenses. This prevents these documents from being used for other purposes, such as boarding airplanes. If they were meant for driving, then it's fine to limit their uses to driving. There is nothing wrong with these distinguishing marks, and if allowing them breaks the political impasse in some states and lets people drive legally who might not otherwise have that privilege, then all the better. But this story is about much more than being able to drive. It's about DREAMers stepping up and declaring their loyalty to the United States and their intent to stay here. Where else do they have to go? They came here as children -- in fact, some as infants -- and they've lived here most of their lives. This is their country, just as much as it is yours or mine. They're not here to subvert our way of life, but to join it. They want to be part of the family. And, given the initiative and perseverance they've shown in just getting this far, we should welcome that. Think about what happened recently when about 40 DREAMers -- from Arizona, Colorado, Texas, California, New York and New Mexico -- decided to do what nativists tell them to do and ""go back to Mexico."" The nativists want DREAMers to go one-way, but this group went round-trip. I've interviewed some of these travelers, including Erika Andiola and Cesar Vargas, the outspoken co-directors of the Dream Action Coalition. During the trip, which was organized by the Mexican Embassy and Mexico's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and made possible because of the limited travel privileges that come with DACA, something happened that was interesting but not totally unexpected. After spending years in the United States being viewed as Mexicans, once the DREAMers got to Mexico, they were treated as Americans. And, the more the DREAMers interacted with native Mexicans, the more it became clear that this is how they see themselves as well. Living in the United States has shaped their world view in profound ways that can't be undone. It's been said that these undocumented youths are caught between two worlds. Perhaps. But now we know that they only belong in one country. This one.","Ruben Navarrette: Supreme Court gave an early Christmas gift to Arizona DREAMers .

"(CNN)What can President Barack Obama realistically do in his final two years? Beyond executive action, his power to impact public policy is limited. Pundits can talk all they want about the President being ""more aggressive"" in his State of the Union address and report on how he won't be willing to be passive when faced with Republican opposition, but the truth is that Republicans control Congress. Most in the GOP will have little interest in cutting deals with the President. The odds of passing major legislation are slim. Even if the President fights tooth and nail, the nation won't see another New Deal or Great Society in the coming years. As a number of experts have explained, he can continue to use executive power, but that, too, is limited in terms of what he can achieve on the domestic front. Executive power only applies to a limited number of changes within existing law, and these decisions can be overturned by the next president. Yet there is something that the President can focus on in the coming months to significantly strengthen his long-term impact on the nation: Help Democrats do well in the 2016 election. President Obama's best bet is to establish the conditions that improve the odds for a Democratic president and Congress to succeed him. In many respects, most lame duck presidencies are more about the future than the present. If Democrats expand their power in 2016, they will be in better position to protect and nurture the programs, such as the Affordable Care Act, that have passed during Obama's tenure in the White House. And the longer that policies remain in place, the more voters and organized interests become invested in those programs and determined to protect the status quo. As the President did in a forceful State of the Union Address, he must continue to flood the agenda with ideas and issues that will excite and engage Democrats. There are many Democrats who feel deeply disillusioned after so many of the promises from 2008 remained unfulfilled, such as taming the role of money in politics, putting stringent regulations on Wall Street or restoring the balance between civil liberties and counterterrorism. Some have concluded that a broken Washington is impervious to change while others have lamented how a rightward drifting Republican Party has dominated Capitol Hill and stifled the administration from making substantial progress. Still other Democrats have complained that Obama has not put up enough of a fight and has been too willing to compromise his principles. Even if the odds of Congress passing bills based on Obama's proposals are slim, the President can help generate ongoing media discussion about key issues -- such as income inequality or middle class insecurity -- that play well for Democratic presidential candidates. As we have already seen in some of the early buzz from potential GOP presidential candidates such as Mitt Romney, Republicans are feeling defensive about the perception that they only represent the wealthiest Americans. Through speeches and proposals, Obama can keep this issue, and others like climate change or immigration reform, on the table so that Democratic voters remember what's at stake in 2016 when they vote for the next president. The President can also help make sure that the next congressional elections in 2016 go as well as possible for his party. President Obama has learned the hard way that without a supportive Congress, not much gets done. Since 2010, when Republicans took control of Congress, Capitol Hill has been rough sledding for the administration. One of his problems has been that President Obama's relations with Democrats on the Hill have been continually tense. Many congressional Democrats have felt that the President has not done enough to support them in midterm elections, including in 2014, at the same time that he has sent extraordinarily controversial proposals, such as the Affordable Care Act, to them that create electoral problems back home. In 2016, Democrats probably have very little opportunity to win control of the House given the size of Republican margins and the fact that gerrymandered districts make it unlikely to have big swings in House elections. However, they do have a chance to retake control of the Senate since more GOP seats will be at risk and Democrats can have better turnout with a strong presidential candidate on the ticket. In the coming years, the administration needs to work carefully and closely with Democrats in competitive states such as Illinois to ensure they have support, organizational enthusiasm and money. The final question will be how the President interacts with the Democratic presidential candidate. This has always been difficult, as was evident with Vice President Al Gore in 2000 when his awkward relationship with President Bill Clinton hurt his candidacy. This will be extraordinarily important when the top candidate emerges. Assuming the Democratic nominee will be the undeclared but widely acknowledged frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, the President will have to put aside some of the tensions that have existed with her to make sure that the candidacy runs as smoothly as possible. What happens after a president leaves office is as important as what a president does while in power. The success of Social Security and the Wagner Act remain the most lasting monument to FDR, while the endurance of so many of  President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society programs during the Age of Reagan enabled many Americans to remember his impressive domestic accomplishments in spite of the tragedy of Vietnam. President George H.W. Bush ensured that Ronald Reagan's moves to reach peace with the Soviet Union in 1987 did not go to waste, while Republicans and Democrats in Congress have entrenched most of the national security programs President George W. Bush put into place. President Obama needs to keep his eyes on 2016. Realistically, this is the best way that he  can bolster his own legacy and that of his party -- helping to set up political tools that Democrats will need to thrive once he is back in Chicago or New York and preventing the emergence of a conservative political coalition that would pick apart the achievements of the Obama presidency.​ . ​ .","Julian Zelizer: As a lame duck with GOP Congress, Obama's powers are limited .

"Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts has galvanized enough rank-and-file Republican voters to close the gap with independent challenger Greg Orman in one of the nation's hottest races, a new CNN/ORC poll has found. Roberts leads Orman, 49% to 48%, according to the survey of 687 likely voters that was conducted October 2-6. Orman's chances drastically improved -- and the race was catapulted into the national spotlight -- when Democratic candidate Chad Taylor dropped off the ballot in September, allowing Orman to appeal to a broad swath of anti-Roberts voters on the right and left without competition. Hoping to hold onto a seat that could be key to determining majority control of the Senate, Republicans have scrambled to paint Orman as a Democrat in disguise and to criticize the entrepreneur's business dealings. Roberts hit that point hard during a debate with Orman on Wednesday, repeatedly slamming Orman as a ""liberal Democrat"" who would continue the policies of President Barack Obama and Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid. Orman has run as a Democrat in the past, but has given money to and voted for candidates in both parties. The survey's results, with a 3.5 percentage point margin of error, are a major reversal from recent polls that have found Orman surging ahead. An NBC/Marist poll released three days ago showed the challenger with a 10 percentage point advantage over Roberts. ""Turnout is likely to be key -- the higher the number of Republicans who vote, the better for Roberts, and Republicans have been at least 43% of the vote (and usually higher) in Kansas elections since 2000,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""Roberts must convince disaffected Republicans to like him again. An 80% favorable rating among Republican likely voters in the current poll indicates that he may have closed that part of the deal,"" he said. The CNN/ORC International poll found that likely voters' views of Roberts have improved, compared to previous polls. Fifty percent said they view the three-term senator favorably, while 45% view Roberts unfavorably. Orman, meanwhile, is viewed favorably by 48% of the likely voters surveyed, and unfavorably by 33%. Nineteen percent aren't sure, according to the poll. Roberts enjoys an 84% to 15% lead among likely Republican voters, while Orman is backed by nearly all Democrats and 62% of independents, compared to 33% of independents who support Roberts. The survey suggested there's plenty of room for movement in the race's final month, with 21% of likely voters saying they could still change their minds. Based on what Orman told reporters Wednesday after his debate with Roberts, voters won't know until after Election Day the answer to a critical question: which party he will caucus with if he wins. Chamber 'all in' for Roberts in Kansas race . Orman says he would caucus with the majority party. But it is possible that the election results could put the Senate at 50-49. In that scenario, there would be no majority party until and unless Orman choses sides between Democrats and Republicans. ""If I get elected and neither party is in the majority, then what i'm going to do is I'm going sit down with both sides, propose a pro-problem solving agenda, and ask both sides whether or not they're willing to support that agenda. And we're going to be likely to support the agenda and the party that's most likely to embrace a pro-problem solving agenda,"" Orman told CNN. Sen. Pat Roberts' campaign bringing major players to Kansas . Translation: Orman will be in the cat bird's seat and plans to use it big time to try to get one of the parties to agree to an agenda he supports. ""I think it's a great thing for Kansas, I think it's an opportunity for Kansas to define the agenda in the United States Senate and finally get us back into the business of solving problems,"" Orman said. The poll also found Gov. Sam Brownback, who's faced criticism after pushing for steep tax cuts, locked in a dead heat with Democrat Paul Davis in his bid for a second term. Each drew 49% support. Democrats won't be getting any help from Obama in the blood-red state. Just 32% of likely Kansas voters said they approve of the job the President is doing.

"Actor Samuel L. Jackson has played a mob hit man and a Jedi master, among other roles. His newest role: Fighting childhood cancer. Jackson is featured in a new public awareness campaign, launched by the St. Baldrick's Foundation and Stand Up to Cancer, aimed at increasing awareness about childhood cancers. The campaign is designed to promote the ""critical importance for infants and children, and in particular teens and young adults with childhood cancers, to be treated by pediatric oncologists,"" according to a statement from the organizations. ""Survival for teens and young adults is far greater when treated on pediatric cancer protocols."" Each year, more than 175,000 children worldwide are diagnosed with cancer, and it's the No. 1 disease killer of children. The campaign also highlights the need to support pediatric cancer research, the organizations said. ""When I was a child in the 1950s, most kids who got diagnosed with cancer had little chance of survival. Now, there is hope,"" said Jackson in a statement. ""I am honored to join Stand Up to Cancer and the St. Baldrick's Foundation to help educate people about childhood cancer and the importance of seeing a pediatric oncologist."" Mark Harmon in cancer immunotherapy awareness PSA . Jackson, an Academy Award nominee who has appeared in more than 100 movies including ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""The Avengers"" and the ""Star Wars"" prequel trilogy, is joined in the PSA by four St. Baldrick's Honored Kids, ages 10 to 19, who have all had cancer. Some of them are still fighting the disease. ""Samuel L. Jackson is a powerful actor and has played some seriously tough guys,"" said Kathleen Ruddy, chief executive officer of the St. Baldrick's Foundation. ""It seems very fitting that we have someone with his level of intensity and power speaking out against childhood cancers, which are seriously tough diseases."" St. Baldrick's Foundation is the leading nongovernmental provider of childhood cancer research grants, according to the statement. Earlier this year, the foundation and Stand Up to Cancer announced the formation of a ""Dream Team"" dedicated to childhood cancer research.

Researchers on the team represent seven institutions in the United States and Canada. Will Congress carry on Gabriella's fight? ""We are grateful to Samuel L. Jackson for lending his support to this extremely important campaign,"" said Sung Poblete, Stand Up to Cancer's president and CEO. ""While great progress has been made in the battle against childhood cancer, the sad fact remains that one in five children diagnosed in the United States will not survive.

"(CNN)Dear Mother Nature, . I wanted to write you a quick note to say thank you. I was delighted to hear that you are not only sending a storm to the Northeast, but a ""historic"" storm with 58 million people in its path.  Schools are closing, flights are canceled and a state of emergency has been declared.  People are racing to the supermarkets as if a zombie apocalypse had arrived.  Milk! Bread! Flashlights! Candles! Batteries! A blizzard is coming!  Thank you, Mother Nature.  We needed this. I grew up in Western Michigan, where there was nothing as good as a snow day.  And we got a lot of them, thanks to the ""lake effect"" snow coming off Lake Michigan.  It was a day to sleep in, relax in front of the fire, head outside to play in the snow, bake cookies, help with the shoveling and drink lots of hot chocolate. And boy, we could all use this. I'm sure you've noticed: Every year it seems that we are all working harder and our schedules are busier. Finding time to just relax with our families and do next to nothing is next to impossible.  And for those of us with kids in school, even when we can take a personal day we usually use the time to get errands done and race the kids from one activity to another.  ""Quality time"" becomes riding in the car together. And I know we just had the holidays, but these are not the same as a snow day, where you can't go anywhere, you can't do much of anything outside and you are usually stuck inside with your the immediate family.  Here, suddenly, is your excuse to slow it down -- read a book, work on a DIY project, bake something complicated, play a board game or just feel bored.  Snow days are for those simple pleasures you'd feel too guilty dedicating an hour to any other day. That's why I'm also begging you, Mother Nature, could you please knock out the power for several hours too?  Make sure the lights are out long enough that the batteries die on the cellphones, iPads and laptops. Make it so neither kids nor parents can look at a screen, check in to work ... or even put in a full day telecommuting. This is hard to stop unless we are forced to. Studies suggest that the average working professional spends almost 30% of the day answering and processing emails.  That's 82 work days a year dealing with email! Just how out of control are we?  The Internet is already filling up with articles about how to ""maximize productivity"" during the storm and tips for ignoring your kids so you can stay connected to work.  Listen, we already work too much.  That's why the electricity needs to go out.  We need a snow day. It'll also make selling the Monopoly marathon to the kids much easier if I'm not competing with Minecraft and ""Gossip Girl"" reruns.  And if this drags on for a few days, maybe we'll reach out to our neighbors, band together and get creative with the meals. We can all go to sleep early ... and then sleep in. Which brings me to another nice thing about losing power: It'll make a family sleepover a necessity.  We've noticed that none of our kids want to sleep up in their rooms when there's no power; they want to be with us. Five people in one bed isn't going to fly, so building a sleep fort and camping out in the living room, now that's some solid family time. To be sure, massive snow storms are not all fun and games. They can be dangerous, even deadly for the elderly and the homeless.  Check on your older or disabled neighbors; for some of them a power outage is an opportunity for disaster.  I pray every one will be safe, stay indoors and seek help early if they need it. But for the many of us, getting snowed in with nowhere to go is a much-needed break from our insanely busy lives. The years are flying by.  Who knows how many more snow days we have left to enjoy.  So, thank you Mother Nature, for sending a ""historic"" storm our way.  I hope we all take the opportunity you've given us to unplug, crack open the board games and for one day, truly savor the weather, the day and the time doing nothing much at all.","Mel Robbins: Thanks, Mother Nature, for a snow day to stop working, veg out and have family time .
She says if power goes out, better still; kids, parents get break from screens, play board games or out in snow ."
"In little over a week, Boeing has announced three new developments in its quest to produce sustainable aviation biofuel. Last week, the company identified ""green diesel"" as a new biofuel that would emit at least 50% less carbon dioxide than fossil fuel over its lifecycle. On Saturday, a new initiative to build a biofuel supply chain in the United Arab Emirates was unveiled using another type of fuel. It was celebrated with a 45-minute demonstration flight by an Etihad Airways 777 plane powered by U.A.E.-produced biofuel. On Wednesday, also out of Abu Dhabi, Boeing and partners said they had made breakthroughs in researching a shrub-like plant called halophytes, which feeds off seawater in desert terrain. The research on the shrub-like plant was spearheaded by the Sustainable Bioenergy Research Consortium (SBRC), which is funded by Boeing, Etihad Airways and Honeywell UOP and hosted by the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology in Abu Dhabi. According to the findings, the desert plant can be made into biofuel more effectively than many other feedstocks. ""Halophytes show even more promise than we expected as a source of renewable fuel for jets and other vehicles,"" said SBRC director Dr. Alejandro Rios in a statement. Diversification . Why so many types of biofuel? For aviation companies, it's important to diversify the types of crops for biofuel production, as well as the locations where the crops are grown. This reduces exposure to the fuel cost volatility that comes from relying on a single source of energy. Similar to the supply chain announced by Boeing, Airbus has established six regional alternative fuel ""value chains"" in Australia, Brazil, the Middle East, Romania, China and Spain, and is looking at feedstocks such as algae and cooking oil. The industry's pressures and incentives to reduce carbon dioxide emissions are enormous. The current aggressive target is carbon neutral growth from 2020 and a 50% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, based on 2005 levels, according to both manufacturers and the International Air Transport Association (IATA). According to IATA, air transport produced 689 million tons of carbon dioxide, approximately 2% of the global total, in 2012. Green diesel . ""Our industry still faces two issues: there isn't enough aviation biofuel to meet airline demand, and we need to bring the cost down to parity with petroleum jet fuel,"" says Jessica Kowal of Boeing's environment communications team. For Boeing, green diesel is one of most compelling of the many biofuel ""pathways"" -- but not because it's considered to be better than other sources in terms of carbon emissions. Instead, green diesel's distinguishing factor is that it's already made in bulk, with a global production capacity of 800 million gallons. While that's far from meeting the total global aviation jet fuel demand of 60 billion gallons per year, the capacity to quickly address 1% of it (600 million gallons) is worth chasing. Boeing is currently seeking approval from regulators around the world to use it as jet fuel, blended with petroleum, beginning this year. Despite being made from the same sources of vegetable oils and animal fats, green diesel is not to be confused with biodiesel, as the latter produces different types of molecules during processing and cannot be used as jet fuel. Price is another big reason this new biofuel is a frontrunner -- with government incentives, it costs approximately $3 a gallon -- a competitive alternative to fossil jet fuel. Since aviation biofuel was approved for use in 2011, more than 1,500 commercial flights have been powered by a blend of traditional fuel and biofuels. Fueling the race . As companies pour resources into developing alternative fuels, it makes sense for major oil-producing nations to have a stake in what will potentially become their biggest competitor. Boeing's joint initiative with partners in the United Arab Emirates, including the government-owned Etihad Airways, thus marks a number of firsts. It's the first time United Arab Emirates has refined biofuel (by a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co.), as well as the first flight fueled with a new processing technology that is not yet approved but will be used in UAE biofuel production in the future. Critics and challenges . While aviation companies such as Boeing and Airbus pour money and manpower into researching aviation biofuels, there are still critics that say it's not worth the effort, and in fact may be causing more harm. Last year, The New York Times reported that the expansion of the biofuels industry is causing a shortage of land for food crops in the poor regions of Asia, Africa and Latin America. The European Commission proposed amending a policy on biofuels last year, due to concerns that first-generation biofuel production is pumping more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than it saves through use as fuel, but a compromise to restrict EU subsidies for first-generation biofuel was rejected in December. The issue is expected to remain at a standstill until the new parliament takes office later this year. ""Boeing's position, and that of many airlines we work with, is that aviation biofuel must be produced sustainably, meeting criteria for environmental, economic and social benefit,"" said Kowal. ""We do not pursue development of biofuel using feedstocks that compete for resources (such as land or water) used for food production.""","Boeing announces three new aviation biofuel initiatives .

"(CNN)It could be a family affair for the Williams sisters at the Australian Open. If Serena and Venus Williams -- who have combined to tally 25 majors -- both win their quarterfinals Wednesday, they'll meet at a grand slam for the first time since the Wimbledon final in 2009. But Monday was already a day of 'firsts' for Venus Williams, whose career has been hindered by the autoimmune disorder Sjogren's Syndrome. When the 34-year-old beat sixth-seed Agnieszka Radwanska 6-3 2-6 6-1, she ensured a quarterfinal berth at a grand slam for the first time in five years. Further it was her first top-10 win at a major since downing Italy's Francesca Schiavone at the 2010 U.S. Open. ""Of course, I want to be playing deep in all my events,"" Venus Williams told reporters. ""Everybody wants that. But it really just doesn't happen every time for everyone. ""Now is my moment and I want to keep this moment going all year and then next year, too. That will take work."" But reaching the quarterfinals in Melbourne won't be enough for her. She still has the game and belief, she said, to go even deeper. ""I feel like I've been here before, so it's not like I'm jumping up and down for joy, 'Oh, shoot, what is this?

"After a decade of construction and almost four years behind schedule, the Middle East's latest airport destination began full operations earlier this week. Hamad International Airport in Doha, Qatar, will eventually occupy 29 square kilometers (roughly a third of the size of Doha city itself) and comes in at a total cost of $15 billion. The giant facility will have an annual capacity of 50 million passengers as well as public spaces for art exhibitions, a VIP terminal inspired by Arabian sailboats and an aquatic themed mosque. Like an increasing number of oil and gas rich cities in the region, Doha is attempting to diversify its economy to make the most of new trade and tourism opportunities. For the head of Qatar's ambitious national carrier, the much-awaited development couldn't have come soon enough. ""It gives us unlimited opportunities,"" Qatar Airways CEO, Akbar al Baker told CNN. ""Doha International Airport was very congested. It was overcrowded. We could not give the standard of service we would prefer our passengers to have on the ground."" Analysts say Doha, like its Gulf neighbors, understands the power and potential of aviation to provide a stable long-term industry in the region. ""There's a recognition by the (Qatari) government that aviation plays a wider economic role which doesn't only directly support jobs,"" said John Strickland, director of aviation analytics firm JLS Consulting. ""It (also) supports trade, it supports stability to develop tourism and we've seen that that's been done very effectively for example in Dubai,"" Strickland added. Dubai opened the doors of its second airport, the mammoth Dubai World Central, just last year. There are already plans to increase annual capacity there from the 120 million agreed upon during the initial design phase to over 200 million. ""Ultimately we want to create the world's largest airport,"" said Paul Griffiths, CEO of Dubai Airports. ""The current largest airport in the world in Atlanta, Georgia, is about 89 million passengers so you can see the kind of scale and order we are looking at,"" Griffiths added. In Abu Dhabi, meanwhile, construction is underway for the new Midfield Terminal Complex at Abu Dhabi International Airport. Set to open in 2017, it will have a capacity of 30 million passengers per year alone. Such massive developments ensure competition in the region is stiff. But with so much capacity will there be enough tourism and trade to go around? That remains to be seen, but regional airlines seem convinced and are operating to ambitious expansion schedules themselves. ""Step by step we're opening up the U.S. but we're also going to balance that with more cities in Southeast Asia (and) in the Middle East,"" said James Hogan CEO of Abu Dhabi carrier, Etihad. According to the International Air Transport Association, Etihad and the other Middle Eastern carriers are currently gaining more passengers than any other region. In the first quarter of this year Dubai International Airport (a separate facility to Dubai World Central) became the busiest in the world with more than 18 million passengers, overtaking 16 million at London's Heathrow. On top of this, many analysts believe the Gulf hubs -- situated just 8 hours flying time from two-thirds of the world's population -- are well placed to tap into many new and emerging markets in Asia and Africa. ""I don't think the big hub airports in the Gulf are particularly competing with each other, they are more competing with other parts of the world,"" said John Strickland. ""The Gulf is positioned between growing markets in Asia, Africa and Latin America and the airlines who operate out of these hub airports have very long range modern aircraft. ""Many other airlines in other parts of the world  are simply not equipped .... so, these airports should be able to grow side by side,"" Strickland added. If that's the case, all that's left is for the Gulf carriers to grab a piece of the lucrative aviation pie in the skies. See also: Answering Egypt's economic riddle .

"Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito were not in the Florentine appellate court Monday for the opening day of their appeal against their 2009 convictions for the 2007 murder of Meredith Kercher. Knox and Sollecito were convicted of Kercher's murder in a highly divisive murder trial that, at times, pitted Americans against Italians who formed two camps. The ""innocentisti"" or those who supported Knox's innocence were convinced the Italian court was corrupt and spoon fed by a very successful public relations campaign out of Seattle, Washington. The ""colpevolisti"" were those who thought Knox was culpable in either the murder or the perceived cover up.  Kercher was found semi-nude in a student apartment she shared with Knox and two Italian women.  In an early interrogation, Knox confessed to being in the house when Kercher was killed, describing her screams in vivid detail. She later retracted the confession and accused Perugia police of hitting her on the back of the head. Giuliano Mignini, the Perugia prosecutor who won the original conviction and then lost the appeal also did not attend Monday's hearing, but almost everyone else from the original trials was there, including Patrick Lumumba, the Congolese bartender Knox originally accused of Kercher's murder. Lumumba attended almost every hearing of the earlier trials and his presence underscored the complexity of the case. ""I am proof that Amanda Knox is a liar,"" he told CNN on Monday. ""That's why I am here."" Lumumba spent several weeks in jail after Knox accused him of Kercher's murder, and he definitively won a defamation suit against her, for which she was ordered to pay €22,000 ($29,800) for his court costs. His lawyer Carlo Pacelli told the court Monday that Knox had not yet paid that fine. There were even locals from Perugia who were fixtures in the public gallery during the original trials who made the trip to Florence to see the story through. Amanda Knox: 'I'm afraid to go back' to Italy . Serious place . The presiding judge, Alessandro Nencini, and the assisting judge, Luciana Cicerchia, oversaw the proceedings in the austere Justice Palace in a nondescript suburb of Florence, far away from the tourist attractions like the Ponte Vecchio and Duomo. Six lay judges and two alternates -- who act more as conscientious objectors to bring the voice of the people to the judicial proceeding than as American-style jurors who have absolute voting power -- were draped in sashes with the colors of the Italian flag. The presiding judge, whose deep baritone voice filled the courtroom, interrupted the lawyers when they were long-winded, and had little patience for any distractions in the court. Only once, when a journalist's mobile phone rang out the Rossini music used as the ""Lone Ranger"" theme tune -- which gave prosecutor Alessandro Crini a momentary case of the giggles -- did the mood lighten. The rest of the time, Nencini's court was a serious place. The court is meeting to hear a new appeal by Knox and Sollecito, whose 2011 acquittal was overturned by Italy's Supreme Court based on what judges said were ""shortcomings, contradictions and inconsistencies,"" writing in their final reasoning ""too many questions remain unanswered."" Half of all cases in Italy are altered some way during the appellate process, so Knox's case is not an anomaly. Francesco Maresca, the lawyer representing Kercher, told CNN: ""The high court ruling will be the guide the defense teams for Knox and Sollecito will need to follow to try to win another acquittal."" The session began with the judge reading out the facts of the case, beginning with the discovery of Kercher's semi-nude body in the apartment she shared with Knox in 2007, and ending with the Supreme Court's decision to overturn the acquittal. Nencini also read the details of the Rudy Guede aspect of the case. Guede, an Ivory Coast native who was convicted in a fast-track trial for his role in Kercher's murder in 2008, has been definitively convicted for his role in the murder in the case, passing the first degree, appeal and high court, which is necessary for any case in Italy to be considered definitive. The court ruled that he was one of three murderers, but did not name the other two. Guede's sentence was reduced from 30 to 16 years on appeal meaning he will be eligible for parole in 2016. The discovery of Guede's fingerprints in Kercher's bedroom is what led to Lumumba's release. Knox concedes being 'tone-deaf' in days after roommate's murder . Defense requests . Nencini then asked for the defense teams to list their requests for the court, which included retesting some of the crucial evidence in the case, like Kercher's bra clasp on which Sollecito's DNA was found, but which had been left for 47 days in the murder room before it was collected. The judge did not allow the retesting of the clasp. The defense teams also asked that a suspect stain, which was referred to as the ""sperm stain"" on a pillow found under Kercher's body be tested. During the original trial, investigators chose to test a bloody foot print on the pillow instead of the stain because they presumed it was old stain, and most likely from Kercher's boyfriend. They also wanted to take another look at what they called the lack of evidence of a clean-up by Knox and Sollecito. The judge again denied the requests. The judge did agree to accept three of the defense's requests. One was to retest a knife found in Sollecito's apartment with Knox's DNA on the handle and what was found to be Kercher's DNA in a groove on the blade. The blade sample was too small to retest, so the results were not considered valid by the original appellate court. The new appellate judge agreed to have another stain on the knife, which had never been tested, subjected to forensic review. Aviello testimony . The new appellate court also ruled to accept the testimony from Luciano Aviello, a witness who testified in the first appeal. Luciano Aviello -- who served time with Sollecito in jail -- had written to the court to say that his brother Antonio had killed Kercher and that the knife he had used was buried in a garden in Perugia. He testified in court: ""My brother came in and sat on the sofa. The right arm of his jacket was ripped and he could see blood on his arm. My brother then pulled out a pocket knife and a set of keys. He was very afraid. He didn't want to create problems for me in Perugia. My brother was very emotional.""  He said that his brother then buried the murder weapon in a garden. Aviello's brother is currently on the run, according to Perugia police who tried to find him to investigate the allegations. The defense asked that Luciano Aviello's testimony be heard again since Perugia police apparently did not investigate the mysterious claim. The new appellate judge also accepted a request to enter into evidence photos of Sollecito's bitten fingernails taken the day after the murder. A lawyer for Sollecito, Luca Maori, told CNN that the photos proved that Sollecito did not have enough nail to successfully pry off the clasp of Kercher's bra. ""He bit his nails,"" Maori said.  ""There is no way he could have unclasped the bra."" The court adjourned until Friday, October 4, when Aviello will testify and investigators from the RIS -- Italy's department of defense staff information and security -- in Rome will be given the mandate to retest the knife. Knox says she will not attend the trial, but Sollecito is expected to attend some sessions, his father said. An appeal verdict is expected by the end of the year.

"This week, the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force issued its long-awaited guideline on lung cancer screening. They recommend annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography (CT) in adults ages 55 to 80 who are at high risk for lung cancer because they have smoked a pack or more per day of cigarettes for at least 30 years and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Low-dose CT is an imaging technology involving low doses of radiation. This is important news, as 160,000 Americans die of lung cancer every year. It is estimated that this test could eventually prevent between 8,000 and 22,000 lung cancer deaths per year. About 85% of lung cancers are due to cigarette smoking; 37% of Americans are current or former smokers and 20% still smoke. The task force, an independent group of experts, makes evidence-based recommendation on preventive services like screenings, preventive medications and counseling services. They are highly respected among screening and preventive medicine experts. Their process for developing guidelines involves an extensive review of scientific studies, issuing of a draft guideline for public input and publishing a final recommendation. The task force advises the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Affordable Care Act mandates that health insurance cover screenings the task force deems useful. This latest recommendation is largely based on the National Cancer Institute's National Lung Screening Trial. This study, which began in 2001, is one of the best-designed screening studies conducted on any cancer. Stigma lingers for deadliest cancer . The task force recommendation is similar to the lung screening guidelines issued by other organizations because of the quality of this trial. These organizations include the American College of Chest Physicians, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the American Thoracic Society, the American Association for Thoracic Surgery, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the American Cancer Society (for which I work). Disagreements exist in prostate and breast cancer screening recommendations because of flaws in all major prostate and breast screening trials. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) assessed more than 54,000 smokers and showed screening caused a 20% decline in lung cancer deaths eight to 10 years later. This means 80% of lung cancer deaths still occurred. Also, smoking-induced cardiovascular disease kills far more people than lung cancer. Smoking also causes a number of other serious diseases, including bronchitis, emphysema and at least 11 other cancers. All current lung cancer screening recommendations note that the patient needs to understand the risks and benefits of screening and decide if it is right for them. There are definite harms associated with lung cancer screening. More than one in four people screened will have a finding that leads to further testing. Ultimately, 24 out of 25 who get further testing will not have lung cancer. Additional testing can include more X-ray testing as well as invasive tests such as biopsies and surgeries. A small proportion of patients getting additional testing will have permanent disabilities or even die as a result. In the NLST, roughly one person died after an invasive procedure triggered by screening for every five to six lives saved because of screening. Studies also show that some people will have an ""overdiagnosis cancer"" -- that is, a cancer that would never progress and kill. It is still difficult for many of us in medicine to accept that there are cancers that do not need treatment. This is a relatively new phenomenon due to improvements in imaging and diagnostics. Nicotine in e-cigs, tobacco linked to heart disease . There is currently no good test to determine who has a cancer that needs treatment and who has a cancer that does not need treatment, therefore some screen-detected patients will receive treatment that is not needed to save their life. The NLST was conducted in 33 of the finest hospitals in the United States. These hospitals were chosen for their specific expertise in radiology, pulmonary medicine, thoracic surgery, and medical and radiation oncology. Many health care centers will have to work to ensure they have the appropriate equipment and skills to provide screening. Just as with the introduction of mammography for breast cancer screening, it may take years for these skills to be available throughout the country. This is a test for relatively heavy smokers. We need a screening test for nonsmokers and light smokers. About one in six people who develop lung cancer are nonsmokers. Unfortunately, studies suggest that there is not great benefit to low-dose spiral CT screening in these populations, but many of the potential harms remain. Patients who smoke or who have smoked cigarettes should talk to their doctor about whether low-dose spiral CT is a good test for them. Most importantly, do not use lung cancer screening as a reason to continue smoking, as all science to date tells us there is greater benefit in quitting.","160,000 Americans die of lung cancer every year .

"(CNN) -- If you're trying to lose weight, close your eyes for a minute and imagine the moments that make you fat. Think through your day, and you'll see them, as big and obvious as a hot fudge sundae sitting right in front of you. You've been good all day, and wham, your friends suggest you go to a buffet for dinner; or you've diligently worked out and wham, you end up at a cocktail party with an array of the most killer desserts ever. Don't rely on your willpower to get you through these tough times, advises James Hill, executive director of the Anschutz Health and Wellness Center at the University of Colorado. ""Willpower is not inexhaustible,"" he says. ""You only have a certain amount of it, and it's gone."" The key is to accept the fact that your willpower will run out at some point, and plan strategies to get you through fattening situations. Here are the top five moments that make you fat, and what you can do to outwit them. On vacation . The problem: You're on vacation and you want to kick back, relax, and enjoy the local cuisine -- but you don't want to come home with pounds to shed. The solution: ""Go for it,"" advises Frances Largeman-Roth, a registered dietitian and senior food and nutrition editor at Health magazine. But share with others. If you're in Paris, for example, don't skip a visit to the bakery -- that would be tres triste -- but share the goodies with friends. After a break-up . The problem: You want to bury your sorrows in a pint of ice cream. The solution: ""Instead of meeting your friend for a drink to dish about your ex, meet up for a power walk or run,"" Largeman-Roth advises. Also, sign up for a team that is training for a 5K or some other race to distract your self and meet new people. A party with fabulous food . The problem: You're at a party and everything looks delicious. It's free, it's in front of you, and no one's stopping you. The solution: Don't arrive famished, says Dr. Melina Jampolis, CNNHealth's diet and fitness expert. Eat a small protein snack before the party, such as a few slices of turkey, a half a cup of low-fat cottage cheese, or half a protein bar. Also, limit your alcohol, and not just because it's caloric, but because if it's hard to control yourself while you're sober, imagine how much harder it is while tipsy. Watching TV . The problem: You want to plop in front of the television with a high-fat snack. The solution: Use a small bowl, Largeman-Roth says, or snack on frozen grapes or veggies with a yogurt-based dip. At a buffet, or a restaurant with enormous portions . The problem: Buffets offer limitless amounts of food, and much of it has tons of calories. Restaurants with big portions of delicious foods make it hard to push the plate away. The solution: Simply don't go to buffet restaurants, Hill advises. But if you really have to, sit at a table where you can face away from the buffet -- Jampolis says studies show people who face away tend to eat less -- and load up initially on fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins so (at least hopefully) you won't have enough room for the bad stuff. At the end of the meal, she suggests having everyone at the table get just one dessert and share, so you get a little taste of lots of things. As for big portion restaurants, the trick is to get the doggy bag at the front end, not the back end. Hill suggests when you order your meal, ask for half of your dinner to be brought to you on a plate, and the other half in a to-go box.","Don't rely on your willpower to get you through tough times, expert says .

"Fifty years ago, smoking was linked to cancer in the first surgeon general's report on tobacco. On Friday, Dr. Boris Lushniak, the acting surgeon general, issued the 32nd report on tobacco, saying ""enough is enough."" His goal: eliminating the use of cigarettes and tobacco. In 1964, when Dr. Luther Terry released the first surgeon general's report, the public learned smoking causes lung cancer. At the time, 42% of American adults smoked, Lushniak says. Since then, ""Tobacco has killed more than 20 million people prematurely,"" says Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in the forward to the new report. The number of smokers has dropped to 18% in 2012, according to the latest estimates published Thursday by the CDC. But ""that still translates into 45 million people, including 3 million kids,"" Lushniak says. ""One out of three cancers is caused by tobacco (and other smoking products)."" Even though the number of smokers has gone down, the figures of those dying from disease linked to tobacco products are up. While 440,000 people died from smoking-related causes in 2008, that number has risen to 480,000 people dying each year, according to the report. And even though the latest data suggests 87% of lung cancer deaths are caused by smoking and secondhand smoke, more smokers age 35 and older die from heart disease than lung cancer. Another alarming milestone, according to the report, is that women have caught up to men and for the first time are just as likely as men to die from smoking-related diseases. What's new . Thirteen cancers are now linked to smoking and secondhand smoke. Liver and colorectal cancer are added in this report. So far, there's not enough evidence to say smoking causes breast cancer. Smoking does not cause prostate cancer, according to existing evidence, according to the report. Another finding: ""Exposure to secondhand smoke is a cause of stroke,"" according to the report. People who don't smoke themselves but are exposed to secondhand smoke have a 20% to 30% increased risk for a stroke. We know it can kill us: Why people still smoke . For the first time, the report found that smoking can cause diabetes, erectile dysfunction, rheumatoid arthritis, macular degeneration, ectopic pregnancies and impaired immune function. Smokers have a 30% to 40% increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes compared with nonsmokers. And women who smoke early in their pregnancies put their unborn at risk of having cleft palates or cleft lips, according to the report. Some 5.6 million children living today will die early because of smoking if things don't change, the report warns. That's one in 13 children, Lushniak says. Lushniak appears passionate about wanting to make smoking a thing of the past. The tools to do so already exist, he says, including making tobacco products more expensive. High-impact anti-smoking media campaigns, such as one the CDC conducted last year, as well as full access to smoking cessation programs may help. Smoke-free laws are needed across the United States, Lushniak says. ""It's embarrassing in this country only half our population is covered by those laws."" He says he believes using the Food and Drug Administration's authority to regulate tobacco products effectively and funding comprehensive statewide tobacco control programs at CDC-recommended levels will also help reduce smoking. ""But the current rate of progress in tobacco control is not fast enough. More needs to be done,"" according to the report. The CDC recommends spending $12 per person from taxes and tobacco settlement money to reduce smoking rates, Lushniak says. ""Right now, only just over a buck-fifty is spent per person."" His message to current smokers: ""Tell them it's never too late to stop. It's best to quit smoking completely. Talk to your doctor, call 1-800-QUIT-NOW."" He also recommends supporting those who want to quit. ""It's good for their health, your family's health and the nation's health."" Goal of a tobacco-free generation . Lushniak says he has a new formula to create a smoke-free generation. It can't just be a federal government attack on tobacco, he says; the battle needs to be fought on the local level, too, with nongovernmental agencies, academia, faith-based organizations, health care professionals and businesses. Lushniak has his work cut out for him. He has to devise a plan to prevent teens from wanting to smoke -- most adult smokers begin smoking as teenagers, according to the Mayo Clinic. The new report backs that up, stating that 87% of smokers had their first puff on a cigarette under the age of 18. And now kids have a new enticement: e-cigarettes. Last year, a CDC report found the percentage of middle and high school students trying electronic cigarettes doubled from 3.3% to 6.8%. While the safety of e-cigarettes is still being hashed out, some health officials fear these electronic devices may be a gateway to tobacco cigarettes and other tobacco products. Young people today don't write letters anymore because they prefer to text, Lushniak says. He wants the younger generation to think of smoking like writing a letter -- that it's no longer in vogue. As surgeon general, Lushniak oversees more than 6,500 public health professionals making up the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps. It's the first uniformed service to go entirely smoke free, he says; the others include the Navy, Marines, Air Force, Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""It is my sincere hope that 50 years from now we won't need another (surgeon general's) report on smoking and health, because tobacco-related disease and death will be a thing of the past,"" Lushniak writes in the report.","The new surgeon general's report links 13 cancers to smoking .

"Libya's parliament voted Prime Minister Ali Zeidan out of office on Tuesday after months of political infighting that has crippled the North African country. The vote of no-confidence came after rebels in eastern Libya said a tanker loaded with oil from a port under their control escaped a naval blockade and moved into international waters. The Libyan government said late on Monday that it had taken control of the North Korean-flagged tanker, Morning Glory, as it tried to leave the Al-Sidra port in eastern Libya, and after having briefly exchanged fire with rebels. However, in a sign of the chaos and conflicting information typical for Libya, the rebels rejected the assertion. Oil production, Libya's economic lifeline, has slowed to a trickle since the summer as armed protesters have seized oil ports and fields to press political and financial demands. They are seeking a greater share of the country's oil revenue, as well as autonomy for eastern Libya. The conflict over oil wealth is stoking fears Libya may slide deeper into chaos as the fragile government fails to rein in the armed brigades that helped oust Moammar Gadhafi in 2011 but now do as they please. The removal of Zeidan, a liberal weakened for months by infighting with Islamists, deepens the turmoil in the country of 6 million people. However, a crowd outside the Tripoli hotel where lawmakers had met to vote could be seen cheering as news broke of his dismissal, images broadcast on Libyan television showed. ""We have nothing personal against Zeidan, but his government has failed the people,"" one man said. Defense minister interim premier . Zeidan will be replaced temporarily by Defense Minister Abdallah al-Thinni, who will hold the position of premier for two weeks until a replacement is picked. He was sworn in after the vote. Libyan state news agency LANA said the General National Congress had passed the dismissal with 124 votes; it was not immediately clear how many of the nearly 200 lawmakers were present during the session. Previous attempts to bring down Zeidan, who has headed the government since November 2012, had failed to win the required majority. Zeidan was himself briefly abducted by former rebel militia in the heart of the capital Tripoli last year. He had for months been facing rising opposition from Islamist parties and the wider public, blaming his government for the rising violence in the vast desert nation. corruption and a multitude of other problems Libya is facing in its bumpy transition. At the same time, anger has been mounting against the GNC after it extended its term in office, which was supposed to end on February 7. Angry protesters earlier this month stormed the GNC headquarters -- ransacking it, assaulting some members and wounding two others while shooting. ""Nationwide demonstrations have taken place since early February against the continued tenure of the General National Congress,"" the United Nations' special envoy to Libya, Tarek Mitri, told the U.N. Security Council on Monday.  ""Strong resentment and animosity has grown between the two main, though not homogeneous, camps. Libya faces the risk of embarking on a new trajectory of unprecedented violence."" Slumping oil output . Tripoli had entrusted militia leader Ibrahim Jadran to safeguard some crucial oil ports. But eight months ago, he and his men seized them, blocked oil exports, and demanded more autonomy and shared revenue for his eastern region. The blockades have led to a slump in crude production -- with output said to be around 250,000 barrels per day, down from 1.6 million. Libya's government has threatened force against ships that entered the rebel-controlled oil ports on several occasions. But despite ultimatums to such ships, those deadlines came and went with no action from Libyan officials. In this case, Zeidan's government had threatened armed action, even an air strike, to prevent the Morning Glory tanker getting away with the oil bought from the rebels' self-declared autonomous regional government without the authorization of the state oil body, the National Oil Corporation. It is unclear who actually owns the vessel. Speaking as Thinni was sworn in, GNC President Nuri Abu Sahmain told lawmakers: ""This period is definitely hard, but we will work together and provide all we can based on our experience ... we wish him all the luck.""","Defense minister sworn in as temporary premier .

"Seven years after a disastrous response to Hurricane Katrina, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is winning praise for how it's dealing with Superstorm Sandy. ""This is the all-new FEMA, and the leadership is very, very good, very focused,"" said Dr. Irwin Redlener, a pediatrician and director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. ""They're doing an excellent job."" Score one for FEMA's attempts to come back from its infamous failure after Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in August 2005. But the post-Sandy reviews for FEMA aren't all moonlight and roses. As Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano -- whose department oversees FEMA --  is expected to visit the region Friday, many survivors in hard-hit places are angry. More than three days after the storm, they're mad about the lack of electricity, lack of information and the lack of gasoline to run generators. What's going on, said FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate, is part of a priority system. Search-and-rescue operations take priority over providing assistance, and searches are still going on, Fugate told CNN's Erin Burnett on Thursday night. Assistance for survivors ""is being made,"" he said, ""but we haven't reached everybody. Until we do, we're not stopping."" However, FEMA has ""been starting to get emergency fuels in for the generators and for the responders,"" Fugate added. In 2005, FEMA's slow and disengaged response was a major embarrassment for the George W. Bush administration, particularly when top officials admitted they were unaware of thousands of people stranded at a convention center in New Orleans without food and water, days after the storm hit. To be fair, the two storms were very different. Katrina hit Louisiana with much more force, and the population of the Northeast U.S. eclipses Katrina's target area. After Katrina, a Senate investigation found that FEMA was shorthanded, failed to commit enough people to prepare for the oncoming storm, didn't have enough supplies in position and had poor communication with state and local authorities. Its director at the time, Michael Brown, had little emergency management experience before being named to the agency's top job in 2003. By contrast, Fugate came to Washington after eight years as emergency management director in Florida, where he dealt with several hurricanes. One of the post-Katrina reforms passed by Congress was to require that FEMA administrator have an experienced chief, said Bruce Lockwood, an officer with the U.S. Council of the International Association of Emergency Managers. ""It couldn't be just a political appointee,"" Lockwood said. ""It had to be somebody who had a practitioner background in emergency management or public safety field. It had to be somebody who knew what they were doing before they got into that position."" Even in the highly charged political environment days before the U.S. elections, FEMA has won plaudits from governors of both parties. New Jersey's Chris Christie -- a Republican whose state bore the brunt of the storm -- told CBS News on Tuesday that ""cooperation has been great with FEMA here on the ground,"" while Delaware's Jack Markell -- a Democrat -- told CNN that people in his state have been ""really, really impressed by the response of FEMA."" 'Leaning forward' The agency is now aimed at ""leaning forward,"" moving supplies like food, water, generators, blankets and cots into an expected disaster zone ahead of time, said Lockwood, the deputy emergency management director in New Hartford, Connecticut. ""Before, they would have to wait for a call from a state before they started moving material,"" he said. They still need a request from a state to distribute those supplies, but ""They have things on the ready in a very immediate location."" In New York, for example, FEMA has publicized assistance, including rental payments for those whose homes are uninhabitable. Individuals can apply for grants for home repairs and to meet disaster-related needs. Money also is available for construction of a home. FEMA set up online pages for Connecticut, New York and New Jersey storm victims. But not everyone is happy with the Sandy response by governments. Staten Island Borough President James Molinaro said Thursday that residents did not receive timely information on how to get food, shelter and tools for putting their lives back together. ""There was no one there to answer these questions,"" Molinaro said. ""I need answers, and the people need answers."" On Friday, Napolitano is expected to visit Staten Island with FEMA Deputy Administrator Richard Serino to meet with state and local officials about response and recovery. Ten buses stocked with needed goods were transported to the island Thursday, and FEMA has promised to have a team working with Molinaro on the ground Friday, he said. The 2,200 people FEMA says it has poured into dealing with Sandy are about as many as it had on its entire payroll at the time of Katrina. The agency also has improved ties with its state and local counterparts as well as other arms of the federal government, said Redlener, the Columbia University disaster preparedness center director. In addition, Fugate ""has been able to attract staff back into the agency, and they have a very competent midlevel management layer to help organize efforts,"" Redlener said.  ""They're still probably underfunded, but their staffing is much, much better,"" he said. FEMA's current budget is about $7 billion. For Sandy, the agency said nine task forces were supporting local search-and-rescue operations. FEMA mobile units are providing logistics support for response efforts. ""Community relations teams are on the ground in the hardest-hit areas of the mid-Atlantic going door-to-door to inform disaster survivors about available services and resources and to gather situational awareness,"" FEMA said in a statement issued Wednesday. Lessons learned . By comparison, at the time of Katrina, FEMA had manpower and planning problems and confusion about the roles of officials in responding to disasters, according to a 2006 report by the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general. The report said that with the destruction of communications infrastructure, it took FEMA officials about three days after Katrina's landfall to grasp the magnitude of the hurricane's destruction. The report cited shortcomings with delivering housing and being prepared to conduct a massive search-and-rescue function. The Katrina report, which made 38 recommendations, said FEMA needed to improve the tracking of supplies. The experts said it appears that lessons have been learned. Lockwood said Fugate's philosophy has been that FEMA ""is not the team -- they are part of the team."" ""That's one of the biggest things that has come out post-Katrina,"" he said. ""There is a cooperative relationship now between local, state and federal agencies to meet the need and fill the gaps."" FEMA's recent performance also won high marks from a former chief, James Lee Witt, who led the agency during the Clinton administration. ""I think the most important thing that FEMA has already done is to have people in the emergency operation centers, and the prestaged equipment, and following whatever resources the states are going to need to start the process of recovery,"" Witt told CNN 's ""Starting Point."" Sandy hit the New Jersey coastline Monday night with 80 mph winds at its center, but it spread destruction across a broad swath of the eastern United States. The storm smashed beach resorts on the Jersey Shore and flooded Manhattan subway tunnels, felled trees as far south as North Carolina, dumped heavy snow on the highlands of West Virginia and sent debris flying through the streets of Toronto.","FEMA chief says search-and-rescue operations taking priority, some fuel being supplied .

"(CNN)A former mayor is a ""probable"" suspect in the disappearance of 43 students who were kidnapped last month from Iguala, a small city in Guerrero state, Mexican authorities said. Mexican Attorney General Jesús Murillo Karam said Wednesday his office has issued arrest warrants for former Iguala Mayor José Luis Abarca; his wife, Maria de los Ángeles Pineda Villa; and the city's former public safety director, Felipe Flores Velásquez. Murillo said they are considered ""probable masterminds"" of events that occurred in Iguala on September 26. According to the attorney general, on that day, a group of students from a teachers college in the nearby town of Ayotzinapa were on their way to stage a protest in Iguala. When the former mayor and his wife learned the protest would disrupt an event led by the mayor's wife, they gave orders to their public safety director to send police forces to prevent the students from protesting. ""The order to confront those people came from the police department's command center, straight from A-5, code name used to identify the Iguala mayor,"" Murillo said. The attorney general also said his office learned this information from interrogations of police officers and gang members detained in the last month who were allegedly involved in the incident. Police officers blocked the highway leading into the city and shot at the students as they arrived in buses and a van. One student was killed. Footage from the scene shows a white van left in the middle of the road with its windows blown out and the doors wide open. The students, Murillo said, were subsequently taken away by police officers, who handed them over to a local criminal gang known as Guerreros Unidos (United Warriors), which had infiltrated not only the police department but was also complicit with Mayor Abarca, his wife and the public safety director. All three disappeared the day after the clashes between police and the students. It has been almost a month since the incident and the students are still missing. Fifty-three people, including 36 officers and 17 suspected gang members, have been detained. No one was available for comment at the Iguala Police Department. The Mexican federal police and army have taken over the department and assumed all security responsibilities. Twenty-eight bodies were found in mass graves in the state of Guerrero, but DNA tests showed there were no missing students among those victims. Mexico was shocked this week by the revelations of a Roman Catholic priest and well-known activist who works with migrants and trafficking victims. The Rev. Alejandro Solalinde said the students were forced to walk to a remote location and then shot. ""Some who were wounded but still alive, with others who were already dead -- one, two, we don't know how many -- were put on top of firewood and set on fire with diesel,"" Solalinde said. He said he has given his information to prosecutors. The case has become a political crisis, with opposition lawmakers asking President Enrique Peña Nieto to dissolve the entire Guerrero state government and take charge. Peña Nieto has said his government will not spare any efforts until the students are found and justice is done. ""Violence, whatever its origin, goes against what we are as a country. Violence will never be a solution or pave the way towards a better future,"" the President said. Mexican authorities are offering a reward of nearly $5 million for information leading to finding the students and solving the case. Online, international students are also demanding answers. A video posted on YouTube shows young people from different countries ""demanding justice for the 43 Mexican students who went missing on September 26,"" in multiple languages.","43 students intending to protest in Iguala vanished on September 26 .

"At least two members of Libya's General National Congress were shot and wounded after protesters stormed its headquarters in Tripoli on Sunday evening, according to congress members. One of the congressmen, Abdul Rahman Sweihli, was shot in the leg after protesters opened fire on him inside the building. As his security detail rushed him out, gunmen opened fire on their cars as they were trying to flee, his son Bashir Sweihli told CNN. No information about the second lawmaker was available. A GNC member speaking on Libyan TV said lawmakers continued their evening session despite dozens of protesters surrounding the building and pouring gasoline on the walls before they stormed the building. Other members of the GNC, the country's interim parliament, were assaulted, and some of the women members harassed, lawmakers said. Young men ransacked the building, and parts of it were set on fire, according to witnesses. Videos posted to social media sites showed a chaotic scene, with young men setting cars and furniture outside the building ablaze. Public anger has been mounting against the GNC, especially after members voted last December to extend their term in office until the end of this year. For almost a month, thousands of Libyans have taken to the streets across the country in peaceful demonstrations demanding an end to the GNC's term. In response to the rising tensions, lawmakers announced last month that early elections would be held, but a date has not yet been set. Earlier in the day, anti-GNC protesters blocked off roads close to the building and set tires on fire after reports spread of an attack Saturday night on anti-GNC protesters. That attack included burning down their tent and reportedly kidnapping some protesters. More than two years after the overthrow of the Gadhafi regime, Libyans have become increasingly frustrated with the state of their country and the performance of their elected officials. Separately on Sunday, gunmen shot dead a French national in the eastern city of Benghazi. Local authorities condemned the killing and said the man was an employee of a private French company that was doing expansion work on the Benghazi Medical Center. The French Foreign Ministry condemned the killing of the man identified as Patrice Real and said the perpetrators must be pursued and punished. A Libyan soldier was also killed in Benghazi on Sunday when an improvised explosive device detonated under his car, according to the state news agency LANA. Four unidentified bodies of young men with gunshots to the head were found in a forest east of Benghazi, LANA reported. Separately, a fifth unidentified body was discovered in al-Jarutha, west of the city. Violence levels in the city have spiked over recent weeks with assassinations, kidnappings and bombings becoming near daily occurrences in the city that was the cradle of Libya's revolution. While no group has claimed responsibility for the rising violence in Benghazi, residents and officials blame the violence on Islamist extremist groups. Last week security forces found the bodies of seven Egyptian Christians dumped west of the city.","Protesters storm Libya's interim parliament and shoot two congressmen, members say .

"Raffaele Sollecito was a 23-year-old computer science student when his girlfriend's roommate, Meredith Kercher, was found dead in the house she shared with Amanda Knox in Perugia, Italy, in 2007. The discovery was the beginning of what Sollecito has called ""a nightmare"" he wouldn't wish on anyone. In 2009, he and Knox were convicted of Kercher's murder. In 2011, the pair were acquitted -- only to have that decision overturned by Italian Supreme Court judges two years later. A retrial began in Florence in September 2013. The initial guilty verdict at the 2009 trial had not been the result Sollecito had been expecting. ""When the sentencing was read, I didn't understand what was happening and even now it seems impossible and still I don't understand why I was convicted,"" he said in a prison interview through his lawyer the week after the sentencing. He said then he dreamed of returning to his studies. Sollecito is from Bari, on the Adriatic coast, far south of the central Italian university town where he was studying.  In his prison interview, he said he missed the smell of the sea, among other things. ""Above all my family,"" he said in the interview conducted via attorney Luca Maori. ""I also miss my friends, the everyday life, the walks in my town's square."" Sollecito finished his computer science degree while in prison, according to media reports. He was not studying at the same university as Knox, and was not held in the same prison. In the prison interview, he described how the verdict brought the world collapsing down on him and Knox. But he denied then that he was still in love with her, saying, ""I feel close to her because I consider her my companion in misadventure."" He rejected the idea that Knox was capable of murder. ""I don't even dare think a thing like that. It is absurd and inadmissible. She is a very sweet girl,"" he insisted. When their successful appeal saw Knox and Sollecito freed in 2011 -- after four years in prison -- they set about trying to rebuild their lives, a continent apart. Sollecito had hoped simply to blend in in his hometown of Bari. ""I only hope to be forgotten; the sooner the better. I want to have a normal life,"" he said before his release. ""I don't want to be recognized when I leave the prison."" 'Journey to hell' Sollecito published a book in 2012, the first by someone directly involved in the chain of events sparked by the discovery of Kercher's body. The memoir, ""Honor Bound: My Journey to Hell and Back with Amanda Knox,"" draws heavily on diaries he kept and letters he wrote to friends, family and his hometown newspaper during his years in prison, the preface says. Sollecito chronicles the day of the murder, admitting that he and Knox smoked marijuana that afternoon, which he says he regretted because it clouded his memory of what happened. While maintaining his innocence, he says he does not clearly remember even if Knox spent the night with him. He and Knox made mistakes the morning of the discovery, including trusting police investigators, he writes. Sollecito acknowledges that at times, he was uncomfortable with Knox's ""bizarre behavior,"" which he says prosecutors used against both of them. In the epilogue, he recounts how he went to visit Knox in Seattle after their release, but he was nervous to see her. ""I wasn't at all sure it was a good idea and I continued to waver back and forth even after I booked my ticket. ""We had been through so much; perhaps we owed it to each other to live our lives and leave each other in peace."" Rather than that hoped-for peace, Sollecito's nightmare began again following the 2013 ruling of the Supreme Court judges in Rome that there should be a retrial. In an interview with CNN soon after the retrial opened in September 2013, Sollecito maintained his innocence. ""I just think that in the Italian system, there's something really wrong in the rules that they sometimes are not respected or they are turned to hurt people. And they can hurt actually innocent people,"" he said. ""My life now is a hell."" Sollecito took the stand to defend himself in November. ""I would like to make you understand that these charges against me are absurd,"" he told the court. ""There was not a basis to charge me, to put me in jail ... I don't wish anybody on Earth to go through what I went through."" He said that evidence against him -- a knife that was a key part of the prosecution's case -- was ""an illusion."" ""I ask you ... to really look at reality,"" he implored the judges. ""For me, it's a nightmare that goes beyond imagination ... ""Right now, I don't have a real life.""

"An Australian-run orphanage in Cambodia suspected of beating and neglecting the children in its care has been shut down by local authorities. The Love in Action orphanage in Phnom Penh was raided on Friday by local officials and staff from Australian anti-trafficking group South East Asia Investigations into Social and Humanitarian Activities (SISHA), SISHA said. A government spokesman confirmed to CNN that the orphanage ""did not meet requirements"" and was under investigation by the country's courts but gave no further details. Twenty one children, including babies, were rescued but seven remain unaccounted for and the orphanage is now under investigation for human trafficking, child abuse, neglect and running an unregistered institution. According to its website, the Christian orphanage was run by Ruth Golder, an Australian woman, and received most of its funding from donations. A statement from SISHA said the woman has admitted to police that her orphanage was not registered and she had no legal authority to care for the children. Her current whereabouts are not known but a spokesperson for SISHA said she had not been arrested or charged in the case. The raid came after two groups of children recently fled from the orphanage and reported that they were beaten and neglected. An official inspection found that ""some children were visibly ill and not taken to a doctor, the facility was dirty, sewage was blocked and the living quarters were overcrowded,"" the statement from SISHA said. In interviews, children said they had been physically abused by staff at the orphanage. ""This marks the first time the Cambodian criminal justice and social services mechanisms have used due process to close an institution on short notice,"" the statement added. Steve Morrish, managing director of SISHA, said that many orphanages in Cambodia were unregulated and had a financial incentive to increase the number of children they look after as it means they receive more funding from international donors. ""They call themselves orphanages but in many cases the children are not orphans. They have one or both parents, who are just very poor."" Recruiters are known to approach poor and rural families, saying they can offer their children education, food, clothing and a chance for a better life, he said.","Authorities shut  Australian-run orphanage in Cambodia .

"It's not the latest reality television show but real life for the Palin clan, at least according to reports from bloggers. A vaguely worded police report is less specific about what actually happened at a weekend social gathering in Alaska. The facts seem to go something like this: Members of the Palin family, including Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, attended a party Saturday night in Anchorage, where a large brawl broke out. It was also Todd Palin's 50th birthday. Anchorage police confirmed they ""responded to a report of a verbal and physical altercation"" near a home in Anchorage where a party was taking place. ""Alcohol was believed to have been a factor in the incident. Some of the Palin family members were in attendance at the party,"" police spokeswoman Jennifer Castro said in a statement to CNN. More salacious details were reported by Alaska blogger Amanda Coyne, writing that Track Palin, Sarah Palin's 25-year-old son, ""stumbles out of stretch Hummer"" and sees an ex-boyfriend of his sister Willow's. Coyne says that Track and the former boyfriend began arguing, the owner of the house intervened, and with the Palin women screaming, Bristol took several swings and Sarah Palin yelled, ""Don't you know who I am?!"" CNN has not yet confirmed Coyne's reporting. CNN has reached out to Palin for comment but has not heard back. The police said, ""None of the involved parties wanted to press charges at the time of the incident and no arrests were made at the scene."" Neither Palin's social media accounts nor her online channel mention the party or an altercation. On Sunday, Palin posted a picture on Facebook for ""Todd's birthday greeting a day late"" because she said she was traveling. Palin spoke Friday evening at a Houston fundraiser for wounded veterans, giving her plenty of time to fly home and attend Saturday night's shindig.","Sarah Palin and family attend a party in Anchorage on Saturday night, where a fight took place .

"(CNN) -- The attempted attack on a Northwest Airlines flight Friday fell almost to the day eight years after another failed solo attack on an international flight. Two months after 19 jihadists hijacked airplanes and flew them into the World Trade Centers, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field, Richard Reid attempted to detonate explosives hidden in his sneakers on an American Airlines flight from Paris, France, to Miami, Florida. Passengers thwarted his plan, and the plane landed safely in Boston, Massachusetts. Reid pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in October 2002 and is serving a life sentence at the nation's super-maximum security prison in Florence, Colorado. American Airlines Flight 63, carrying 197 people from Paris to Miami was diverted to Boston on December 22, 2001, after passengers and crew saw Reid trying to light a fuse and subdued him by tying him to his seat. A doctor on board administered a tranquilizer. FBI bomb technicians and explosives experts found explosives in Reid's shoes. Reid, a British citizen and convert to Islam, pleaded guilty to all eight counts against him -- including attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, attempted homicide and placing an explosive device on an aircraft. ""At the end of the day, I know I did the actions,"" Reid said when entering his plea. ""Basically I got on a plane with a bomb. Basically I tried to ignite it."" Previously, Reid had called himself a disciple of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and an enemy of the United States. He also said he did not recognize the U.S. legal system. Zacarias Moussaoui, the only person convicted in the United States for his role in the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, said during his 2006 sentencing trial that he and Reid were supposed to be part of the attacks on U.S. targets. But Reid testified via a statement that although he knew Moussaoui, he knew nothing about the 2001 attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people, and was not to be part of them. The day before Reid went on his solo mission, he wrote a letter to his mother bequeathing his belongings to Moussaoui, casting further doubt on Moussaoui's claim that they later intended to die together in what court documents called a ""martyrdom operation."" Moussaoui was arrested in August 2001 in Minnesota after instructors at the flight school he was attending reported he was acting suspiciously and did not have much flying experience. Throughout his legal proceedings he repeatedly changed his story. He pleaded guilty to terrorism conspiracy and is also serving a life sentence in the Colorado prison.","Friday incident comes eight years after another failed solo attack on an international flight .

"It's an alleged true-life story that trumps Hollywood's latest castaway tale. Thirteen months adrift at sea (maybe more). Thousands of miles traveled. Survival with only what nature and the elements provided. Jose Salvador Alvarenga washed up on a remote coral atoll in the Marshall Islands last week in a heavily damaged boat. He said he had been living off fish and turtles he had caught and relying on rainwater, and sometimes his own urine, to drink. He said he had been lost at sea for 13 months, after setting off from southern Mexico -- thousands of miles to the east. Many questions remain about how he could have lived on his small boat for so long as it drifted across the ocean. Scientifically, his ordeal is plausible. But is it probable? Alvarenga told CNN in an exclusive interview that he left from a port called Paredon Viejo in Mexico's Chiapas state in December 2012. A Mexican newspaper visited the nearby hamlet where Alvarenga lived near Mexico's Pacific Coast. Local fishermen there say they remember Alvarenga and the day he went to sea and didn't come back. They recall the date of departure being in November, a month earlier than the castaway remembers. Boats went looking for him and his boat companion. The state sent an airplane to search for him. ""All of my fellow fishermen were elated because this is nothing short of a miracle. I have no words to describe the joy I felt when I learned he was alive. He's a wonderful human being and I'm glad he made it,""  Bellarmino Rodriguez Beyz, owner of Alvarenga's boat, told CNN. He said the boat was equipped with a GPS system and radio communication, but both systems got wet and stopped working when a storm hit. ""When they told me that a boat had appeared with somebody on board I had no doubts,"" Rodriguez said. ""I recognized Alvarenga immediately when I saw his picture. It couldn't be anyone else. The boat and the registration number check."" Who is this man? Authorities are trying to determine the veracity of Alvarenga's story. The Mexican government has confirmed his identity and says he is a Salvadoran national who was living in the city of Tonala. The local fishermen told El Universal newspaper he actually lived nearby at a place called Pijijiapan. Julio Camarena Villasenor, the Mexican ambassador to the Philippines, said Tuesday that Alvarenga is still recovering in a hospital in the Marshall Islands after being found in a ""weak state of mind and health."" He'll be repatriated to El Salvador as soon as possible, once he is medically cleared to travel and has the correct documentation, the ambassador said. No time frame for the repatriation has been established yet. Castaway's tale . How did a man survive such an ordeal -- as Alvarenga describes -- in a boat about the length of three people and the width of one person? He pointed upward and said, ""God. ... My faith in God."" ""I thought, 'I am going to get out,' "" he said. ""Get out, get out, get out."" But he also admitted to dark moments, saying he considered killing himself. ""Twice I wanted to,"" he said, as he gestured at slitting his throat. ""I wanted to with a knife. When I didn't have water, food; I gave up and I grabbed a knife."" But he says he was too ""scared"" to go through with it. Losing his companion . Alvarenga says he left for what was supposed to be a one-day trip to catch sharks on December 21, 2012. By his account, he and his teenage companion had already killed some sharks and had 400 kilograms (about 880 pounds) of the animals on the boat. But they would not have the shark meat to survive. ""We threw it into the water. It was too much weight, and there was too much wind,"" he said. ""Three days later, we wish we had what we had thrown away. We wanted to eat it, but the sea had already taken it away."" Alvarenga said that he and his companion were blown off course by northerly winds and then caught in a storm, eventually losing use of their engines. They had no radio signal to report their plight, he said. According to Anjenette Kattil of the Marshall Islands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Alvarenga said that four weeks into their drift, he lost the young man because he refused to eat raw birds. There are no details yet on what Alvarenga did with the young man's body. Rodriguez, the boat owner, identified Alvarenga's companion as 23-year-old Ezequiel Córdova. He said he was single with no children, but his parents, siblings and extended family live nearby. In his interview with CNN, the castaway mentioned his companion only in passing, saying he believed that the boy's parents knew he was missing. Lost at sea . During his long period at sea, Alvarenga said he lost track of the date and the day of the week. He would follow the sun's path across the sky, he said, indicating the movement with his hands as he spoke. ""I didn't know the date or the day -- only the hours. Only that there was a sunset and a sunrise, nothing else,"" he said. When there was no rain, he would resort to consuming his own urine, he said. ""Then it rained, oh, what happiness!"" Alvarenga said. The boat itself was a container to collect the precious rainwater. He also ate sea turtles. ""They would bang the boat -- boom, boom, boom -- and I would get up"" and grab them from the water, he said. Finding land . After 13 or 14 months at sea, Alvarenga says, the boat finally reached shore. He swam to land and spent a night in the woods. He said he didn't have the energy to climb up the coconut trees he saw but was excited to eat a coconut he found on the ground. The next morning, according to Alvarenga, he walked and found a small house and started shouting. A man and woman came to him, he said. ""I took them to see the boat, because they didn't understand me,"" Alvarenga said. He gave them the boat as a gift, he said. 'Much better shape' than expected . Alvarenga was found on sparsely populated Ebon Atoll, a 22-hour boat ride from the Marshall Islands capital of Majuro, on Thursday. The southernmost of the Marshall Islands' atolls, Ebon has only 2.2 square miles of land, one phone line and no Internet service. The government airplane that services the atoll was not working, so Alvarenga did not make it to Majuro until Monday morning. People on the island where he was found Thursday say the 26-foot fiberglass boat was in very bad condition, covered in barnacles and with the carcasses of several turtles littering the deck. Video from Majuro shows Alvarenga walking a gangplank from a government boat to a waiting ambulance. Waving to those gathered around the dock, he is supported by a medical assistant as he walks. From inside the ambulance, he gives a thumbs up before it drives away. ""He's in much better shape than one would expect after such an ordeal,"" said Tom Armbruster, U.S. ambassador to the Marshall Islands. Officials don't doubt story . If Alvarenga's story proves true, the trip across the Pacific would have taken him across roughly 6,600 miles (10,800 kilometers) of open ocean before ending in the Marshall Islands, about halfway between Hawaii and Australia, in the northern Pacific. Officials in the islands say they have no reason to doubt what he has told them so far, the Mexican ambassador said. Such an amazing journey isn't unheard of in the small Pacific nation, as three Mexican fishermen made a similar drift voyage in 2006 that lasted nine months. Those men lived off fish they caught and rainwater, and they read the Bible for comfort. Conditions in the Pacific make the timeline of Alvarenga's journey plausible, said Judson Jones, a producer for CNN Weather. Jones said that given the average currents between Mexico and the Marshall Islands, it would have taken less than a year to travel from the origin to the end in the strongest average currents. If the trip did indeed take 13-1/2 months, it means his boat would have averaged about 18.6 miles (30 kilometers) a day. But Jones said a meandering journey in and out of the currents was most likely. 'We will have him back soon' Alvarenga is from Garita Palmera in El Salvador, where CNN caught up with members of his family. They said they hadn't heard from him in about eight years and thought he might be dead. He has a 12-year-old daughter there who doesn't remember her father. ""My heart would tell me that my son was not dead, but I wondered about it so often that I had started to lose faith,"" said Julia Alvarenga, his mother. ""God willing, my son is not dead. God willing, my son is alive. And we're going to see him again one day. I'm very happy after learning that he's alive and that we will have him back home soon,"" said his father, Ricardo. But seeing what their son has been through also brings them feelings of sadness, he added. ""The last time we saw him, we didn't want him to go,"" his father said. In the Marshall Islands, Alvarenga had this message for his family: ""That I'm alive, that I'll see you soon."" Skepticism will undoubtedly follow his story as additional facts arise. There's more to tell, he told CNN, but ""I don't want to talk anymore. My head hurts. Another day, when I feel better.""

"Violence raged yet again Saturday in Afghanistan, including a battle at a sprawling military base that British troops gave up last month and an attack on a home for aid workers in Kabul. In the former, Taliban insurgents began an assault Thursday night on Camp Bastion, a facility in Helmand province that Britain handed over to Afghan authorities on October 14. That fighting was still going on Saturday. By then, at least five Afghan troops and nine Taliban fighters had been killed, according to Omar Zowak, a spokesman for the provincial governor. Camp Bastion housed British and coalition troops -- among them Britain's Prince Harry -- during the Afghanistan war. As such, it's been a frequent target for the Taliban. Yet it's hardly the only place where Afghan authorities and their allies are under threat. Two aid workers -- one of them a foreign national -- died after housing for them in the western part of Kabul was attacked, said Hashmat Stanikzai, a spokesman for the Afghan capital's police chief. Afghan forces arrived at the scene, battling three attackers for three hours before killing them, according to Stanikzai. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. Stanikzai declined to reveal the nationality of the slain foreign aid worker, but locals and eyewitnesses told CNN that the organization he worked for is based out of South Africa.","A building housing aid workers is attacked; 2 aid workers are killed, police say .

"Chinese police killed 11 assailants who launched what state media described as a terrorist attack on Friday afternoon at a food market in Xinjiang, in the country's northwest. It came as the region's People's Congress passed a new law to clamp down on religious extremism, including banning people from practicing religion in government offices, public schools, business or institutions, China Daily reported. The law gives local authorities the right to ban people from wearing clothes or logos associated with religious extremism, although the types of clothing and symbols weren't specified. The regulation also prohibits people from viewing videos about jihad and religious extremism. In Friday's attack, assailants threw explosives and attacked people with knives at a crowded food market in Shache County, killing four civilians. Fourteen others taken to hospital with injuries, state news agency Xinhua reported. It's one of a number of attacks in the region, the scene of ethnic tension between the indigenous Uyghurs, a mainly Turkic-speaking Muslim population, and Han Chinese. The new law on religious extremism -- the first in the country -- will come into force in January. The law defines religious extremism as ""activities or comments that twist the doctrines of a religion and promote thoughts of extremism, violence and hatred,"" China Daily reported. The article quoted Ma Mingcheng, deputy director of the Xinjiang People's Congress and director of its legislative affairs committee, as saying that ""an increasing number of problems involving religious affairs have emerged in Xinjiang."" ""The old regulation, which was passed 20 years ago, just cannot handle new situations, such as the spreading of terrorist or extreme religious materials via the Internet or social media, and using religion to interfere in people's lives,"" Ma said. State media has reported a number of violent attacks in Xinjiang, including the deaths of 37 civilians in a knife and ax attack in Shache in July. A local court sentenced 12 terrorists to death in October. Fifteen others were sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve.","State news: Assailants throw explosives, attack with knives on a street in Xinjiang .

"On July 17, 1996, TWA Flight 800 took off from JFK Airport headed for Paris. Just 12 minutes later, it exploded over the shores of Long Island, New York. There were 230 people on board, and no one survived. Many eyewitnesses described seeing something heading toward the plane before it exploded, and the suspicion of terrorism was almost instant. The biggest investigation in aviation history, at that time, ensued. The government spent four years and millions of dollars in that investigation and 18 years later, many still question whether they got it right. With that in mind, here are five surprising things you probably didn't know about the investigation, including one big thing the investigators themselves still don't know: . 1. The FBI interviewed at least 755 witnesses. TWA Flight 800 crashed eight miles off the coast of Long Island at dusk on a clear summer night. Hundreds of witnesses saw the plane explode from either on shore, on a boat, in a plane or in at least one case, a helicopter. Of the 755 witness reports that the FBI have made public, accounts vary widely but hundreds describe what they thought was either a flare or fireworks heading up toward the plane before it exploded. A few witnesses even used the words ""missile"" or ""rocket."" 2. America was in a high state of alert when TWA 800 crashed. A series of terrorism-related events in the years, months and weeks before the flight went down, and even one incident just days afterward, led many to suspect terrorism was to blame. -- December 21, 1988: Pan Am Flight 103 explodes over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 270 people on board. Eventually Libyan national Abdel Baset Ali Mohmed al Megrah is tried and found guilty of 270 counts of murder. -- February 26, 1993: A bomb explodes at the World Trade Center, killing six people and injuring more than 1000. Two years later, Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of that attack, is arrested in Pakistan by the FBI and the State Department and put on trial. ""I am a terrorist and proud of it,"" he told the court. -- April 19, 1995: The Alfred P. Murrah building in Oklahoma City is bombed. The blast destroys large parts of the building and kills 168 people, including 19 children. Two Americans, Timothy J. McVeigh and Terry L. Nichols, are eventually convicted for the attack. -- May 29, 1996: Yousef goes on trial in New York City. The trial continues through the crash of TWA Flight 800, leading many to question if the two were related. -- June 25, 1996: The Khobar Towers are attacked. A powerful truck bomb explodes on the perimeter of a U.S. military complex in eastern Saudi Arabia. Nineteen U.S. Air Force personnel are killed, and several hundred are wounded, in the deadliest attack against the American military since a 1983 bombing of the Marine headquarters in Beirut, Lebanon. -- July 17, 1996: TWA Flight 800 explodes over the shores of Long Island. -- July 27, 1996: A bomb explodes at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, killing one person and injuring over 100. More than two years later, Eric Robert Rudolph, a suspect in bombings at abortion clinics in Alabama, is charged in the Olympic Park bombing. Covering the crash: One CNN reporter remembers . 3. Moammar Gadhafi and Saddam Hussein were suspects. Beyond terrorist groups being suspected, state-sponsored terrorism was also cause for concern inside the White House. Leon Panetta, former secretary of Defense and former CIA director, was chief of staff for President Bill Clinton at the time of the crash. ""The investigation was looking at almost every possibility, including state actors, because we'd known that Libya had been involved with regards to bringing down the airliner over Scotland (Pam Am Flight 103)"", said Panetta. ""We were looking at Iraq and Saddam Hussein. We were looking at, you know, the possibility of even Iran might have played a role in this,"" added Panetta. 4. It took close to a year, but all 230 victims were eventually recovered. There were 230 people on board TWA Flight 800 from 13 countries. When the plane crashed into the water, much of what was left sunk 130 feet below the surface in the Atlantic Ocean. While it took authorities more than 10 months, remains of every victim were recovered. All of their names are etched into the TWA Flight 800 International Memorial at Smith Point County Park on Long Island, New York.  The memorial was dedicated on July 14, 2004, and it includes flags from the 13 countries of the victims. 5. The NTSB said a spark in a fuel tank led to the explosion . In November 1997, more than a year after the crash, the FBI announced that a criminal act did not bring down the ill-fated plane. At that point, it was up to the National Transportation Safety Board to figure out the cause of the explosion. A full four years after the crash of TWA Flight 800, the NTSB released its official report: It found the probable cause of the accident was a spark in the center fuel tank that eventually led to the explosion that brought down the aircraft. While they offered their best theory on where the spark came from, they never found a definitive answer. Nine aviation mysteries highlight history of disappearances .

"Britain's Prince Charles has called on governments around the world to do more to ensure religious freedom and urged religious leaders to promote tolerance between people of different faiths. In a video message recorded to accompany the release of a new report on religious freedom, Charles said current events in Iraq and Syria -- where Sunni extremist group ISIS has been massacring people of other faiths and sectarian tensions have flared -- were ""horrendous and heartbreaking."" ""We've learned with mounting despair of the expulsion of Christians, Muslims and Yazidis from towns and cities that their ancestors have occupied for centuries,"" he said. ""It is an indescribable tragedy that Christianity is now under such threat in the Middle East, an area where Christians have lived for 2,000 years and across which Islam spread in 700 A.D., with people of different faiths living together peaceably for centuries."" The report, by Roman Catholic charity Aid to the Church in Need, highlights the plight of Christians in particular, saying they ""remain the most persecuted faith in the world."" It adds that ""Muslims also face serious persecution; often from other Muslims who do not share their exact same beliefs,"" while Jews in parts of Western Europe are increasingly feeling threatened, prompting many to move to Israel. Prince Charles, who is heir to the British throne, pointed out that the issue of religious intolerance also affects some African nations and many countries across Asia. But some hope can be found in the efforts of certain communities and faith leaders who work to overcome division and hatred, and seek instead to engage in interfaith dialogue, he said. Faith leaders' duty . Charles, who referred to his own Christian faith in the video, suggested positive action to help tackle intolerance. ""First and foremost, rather than remaining silent, faith leaders have -- it seems to me -- a responsibility to ensure that people within their own tradition respect people from other faith traditions,"" he said. He also called on governments to honor their duty to uphold the freedom of people to practice their faith, including converting to a different religion if they choose. It's a principle enshrined in Article 18 of the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights. ""Yet even in the West this right is often challenged sadly -- and in many other countries, an absence of freedom to determine one's own faith is woven into the laws and customs of the nation,"" he said. Charles reflected on the case of Mariam Yehya Ibrahim, a Sudanese Christian woman who faced a death sentence this year after refusing to renounce her faith. She was eventually released and, after meeting Pope Francis in Rome, arrived in the United States this summer to start a new life with her husband and children. And he urged those facing persecution not to give up hope, while remaining strong in their faith. ""My heart goes out to all those around the world but especially at this time in the East, whether Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist or Hindu, who are so brutally persecuted solely for the faith they profess,"" he said. Deteriorating conditions . According to the report, which covers the period from October 2012 to June 2014, 81 of 196 countries in the world, or 41%, are identified as places where religious freedom is impaired or is in decline. Another 35 countries were classified as having some religious freedom issues that are ""of concern,"" but with no deterioration in their status. Change for the better is noted in only six countries, while conditions have deteriorated in 55 nations, the report's authors found. Overall, 20 countries are designated as having a high degree of religious persecution. The persecution is linked to extremist Islam in 14 of those countries, while in the remainder it is linked to an authoritarian regime. ""In the period under review, global religious freedom entered a period of serious decline,"" the report concludes.","Prince Charles calls on religious leaders to promote tolerance, understanding .

"Taking a cue from some of its competitors, Apple on Tuesday announced a smaller version of its popular iPad tablet -- the iPad Mini. And the company that introduced the concept of tablet computers to millions didn't waste any time bashing those competitor in the process. ""Others have tried to make tablets smaller than the iPad and they've failed miserably,"" said Apple senior vice president Phil Schiller. ""These are not great experiences."" At a media event, he unveiled the 7.9-inch tablet, which is 7.2 millimeters wide (the width of a pencil, Schiller said) and weighs less than 7/10ths of a pound. It will have the same display-resolution specs as last year's iPad 2, not the high-definition ""retina display"" of the newest iPad, which also got an update on Tuesday. The iPad Mini's display will be nearly an inch bigger than those of competitors like Amazon's Kindle Fire and Google's Nexus 7. It will also be somewhat more expensive. The smaller iPad will start at $329 for a 16GB, Wi-Fi only version, ranging up to $659 for a 64GB model with cellular capability. Those prices are at the high end of what analysts had predicted. The new Kindle Fire HD and the Nexus 7 sell for $199. Microsoft Surface tablet goes on sale for $499 . Pre-orders for the devices begin Friday, and the Wi-Fi only iPad Mini will go on sale in stores November 2. Models that have Wi-Fi and can connect over cellular networks will start shipping in a few weeks. The device's screen has the same proportions as the larger iPads, meaning that apps designed for the tablet should also look good on the Mini. Apple promises 10 hours of battery life, and the Mini will have front- and rear-facing cameras like its bigger cousins. It also will have the ""lightning"" connector that came new on the iPhone 5 and new iPods. ""This isn't just a shrunken-down iPad,"" Schiller said. ""It's an entirely new design."" As with other recent Apple events, today's main announcement wasn't much of a secret. Leaks ahead of the event sketched out most of the relevant details, from dimensions of the smaller iPad to what sizes it would come in. The Apple event started off with upgrades to the Mac lineup, and a joke about expectations for the day. ""You knew there would be something called 'mini' in this presentation, didn't you?"" said Schiller, while presenting an update of the company's smallest desktop computer, the Mac mini. It starts at $599 for 4 GB of RAM. Schiller opened by unveiling the new version of Apple's top-selling MacBook, the 13-inch MacBook Pro. The new version has a high-definition ""retina display"" screen for the first time and is 3/4 of an inch thick -- 20 percent thinner than the current 13-inch MacBook Pro. It weighs 3.5 pounds, making it the lightest MacBook Pro ever, Schiller said. Its price starts at $1,699. Both the Mac Mini and the new MacBook Pro begin shipping today. iPad mini worth buying? Schiller also showed off a sleeker and more powerful version of Apple's iconic desktop, the iMac. It starts at $1,299 and begins shipping in November. Released only six months ago, Apple's newest full-sized iPad also got an update, getting a faster A6X processing chip, an improved camera and, like the iPhone 5, 4G LTE capabilities. Apple's full-sized iPad has been a huge success and still dominates the overall tablet market, so why go small now? The biggest demand for non-Apple tablets has been for less expensive 7-inch devices such as Amazon's Kindle Fire, Samsung's Galaxy Tab, Google's Nexus 7 and Barnes and Noble's Nook. A smaller iPad would challenge these competitors head on, combining their popular size with Apple's killer features: the iOS operating system, Apple's app and media ecosystem, and quality design. The Kindle Fire is great for buying books, movies and shows from Amazon, and the Nexus 7 has Google's well-stocked Play store for media and apps. However, tablets have proven they can do more than just entertain, and customers might be drawn to the quality and quantity of Apple's App Store selection. Developers have been creating top-notch apps for the iPad for more than two years. The smaller iPad's screen is expected to have the same aspect ratio, so those apps would work the same on the new device. When the iPad came out, it was intended to be a consumption device. Ads for the tablet showed people reclining in various environments, clutching the iPad like a book. The spacious 10-inch screen was ideal for watching movies and TV shows, playing games, surfing the Web and otherwise consuming content. That's how most tablet owners use their devices. Tablets are homebodies, used most often in the living room (30% of the time according to Nielsen) followed by the bedroom (21% of the time). ""Fully half the time they're using tablets, they don't leave the couch or the bed,"" said Forrester analyst Sarah Rotman Epps. ""If you can do everything on the smaller iPad you can on the larger iPad -- that plus the added convenience of being able to take it with you more places could take the wind out of the sales of Amazon."" A smaller, lighter device is more portable, and people might not be as afraid of taking a cheaper tablet out into the big bad world where it would be less protected. That would also be a boost for Apple in the education market, which it has been courting heavily. Apple iPad Mini price gives rivals breathing room .","Apple unveils smaller iPad Mini tablet .

"Former Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius called comments from Jonathan Gruber on the ""stupidity of the American voter"" regarding passage of the President's signature health care law ""totally offensive"" and said she never worked with Gruber ""personally"" though he worked ""with a number of our agencies."" Sebelius made her comments Monday after appearing on CNN, saying that the MIT economist was not an ""architect"" of Obamacare, as some have suggested, but agreed that he could be considered one by osmosis given his role in drafting the Massachusetts health care law that she said served as a ""template"" for Obamacare. But Gruber's comments that the Obama administration misled voters couldn't be further from the truth, she said. ""You couldn't have debated this more. It couldn't have been more open,"" Sebelius said, echoing comments President Barack Obama made after videos of Gruber surfaced online this month. Aside from an appearance at the Aspen Ideas Festival this summer, Sebelius has largely steered clear of the public glare until she appeared on CNN Monday morning to promote health care enrollment period for 2015. Sebelius resigns . Sebelius also said that her successor Secretary Sylvia Burwell is ""very eager"" for Sebelius to help publicize the second open enrollment period to sign up for health coverage that started this month. ""She's very eager for me to do whatever it is that I can to help spread the word,"" Sebelius said of Burwell. ""This is always an all-hands-on-deck moment to get the word out that open enrollment is underway."" Sebelius said she speaks with ""folks"" in the White House on a regular basis and spoke with Burwell as recently as this weekend. She also said, ""other than politics,"" she ""has no idea"" why the House GOP is suing Obama over changes to the law's implementation, but said she tries to avoid speculating on legal issues. Sebelius added she is very aware that she has become the face of the health care law and the botched rollout of the health care enrollment website. ""There's no question that we had a very rocky rollout to the website and a miserable eight weeks that is seared in my brain as well as everybody else's,"" she said. Sebelius acknowledged that she and her team ""clearly...didn't focus enough"" on the tech side of the rollout because she was more concerned about ensuring that enough Americans signed up and enough insurers jumped into the new health marketplace. But Sebelius also touted the successes of the law, pointing to close to 8 million users who successfully used the website and the 1 million signups by January 1, 2014. About 6.7 million people have now signed up for health coverage under the law since the 2013 rollout. Sebelius added that Obamacare has been ""branded badly"" and while many voters still balk when they hear ""Obamacare,"" polls suggest that voters agree with the health care law's components. She said the term Obamacare ""has become very, very negative,"" but said individuals approve of the law's policies to allow young people to say on their parents' plan until they turn 26 and approve of policies preventing insurers from denying coverage due to preexisting conditions. ""I'm not sure that we need to get people to love the act, they just need to understand what it's about,"" she said. ""If they like the pieces of it, that's fine."" Sebelius had 'toughest job in Washington'","Sebelius said her successor is ""eager"" for her to help with the open enrollment push .

"When New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg appeared at a news conference Wednesday without Lydia Callis at his side, fans of the sign-language interpreter immediately expressed their disappointment via Twitter. ""Wait, where is Lydia Callis???? (aka our favorite sign language interpreter)"" @abbygardner tweeted. ""Watching Bloomberg's latest briefing. So sad Lydia Callis is not the sign language interpreter #Sandy"" tweeted @kyledoyle. ""Damn they change the #signlanguagelady ... WE WANT LYDIA CALLIS BACK !!!!"" @JoeyStugotz6 posted. Callis, 30, became an Internet sensation just three days earlier because of the dramatic facial expressions and body language she used to translate Bloomberg's dire warnings about the dangers coming with Superstorm Sandy. Comedy Central's Jon Stewart, during Wednesday night's ""Daily Show,"" said Callis's ""expressive sign-language interpreting turned disaster press briefings into an Alvin Ailey sign-language recital."" ""If you're in your home or somewhere safe where you can remain, stay there,"" Bloomberg said.  ""The time for relocation or evacuation is over.  Conditions outside are dangerous, and they're only going to get worse in the hours ahead."" New York after Sandy: A tale of two cities . When the mayor talked about falling trees, high winds, heavy rain and rising waters, Callis made sure her face, hands and body conveyed the urgency to those who could not hear. A falling tree took both arms to convey.  One arm was the ground, and the other was the tree. When Bloomberg warned ""It is dangerous,"" viewers could see the danger on Callis' face. As the mayor scolded two New Yorkers who had been arrested trying to surf the rolling waves of New York Harbor, calling it ""just an outrage,"" the outrage was clear in her expression. Several Tumblr accounts immediately appeared paying tribute to images of Callis signing for Bloomberg.  Twitter postings of amazement erupted. Newspaper stories and online blogs soon followed. New York magazine said Callis gave the city ""a legitimate reason to smile"" even as the storm loomed. ""The sign interpreter next to Bloomberg is basically his human emoticon set,"" @xeni tweeted Monday. The mayor's news conferences became must-see TV for her new fans. But Callis herself was staying out of the spotlight, apparently giving just one interview to DNAinfo.com reporter Jill Colvin, who tracked her down at the New York emergency management headquarters in Brooklyn on Wednesday. ""As you can see from when I'm interpreting, you see the tree falling, you see the building, you see the crane moving around,"" Callis told Colvin. ""Because I need to have those pictures for the deaf people that need ASL,"" or American Sign Language. Engineers: Dangling crane tied securely to NYC building . Her dramatic expressions, gestures and body language are needed to communicate the urgent message, she said. ""Hearing people tend to not understand that deaf people need those facial expressions,"" Callis said.  The body language replaces the intonation others hear in a voice, she said.  ""If I stand up there with a straight face and just interpret it, they're not getting half the message."" Callis said she tries to translate Bloomberg's emotions. ""When a reporter asks a sarcastic question, you can see it in my face,"" she said.  ""I'm like, 'Really — did you just ask that?' Because that's how the mayor is reacting in the tone of his voice. But I'm doing it on my face."" She told Colvin that she began signing as a child for her deaf mother and three siblings. But Wednesday afternoon, Callis was gone, replaced by another woman whom Bloomberg introduced at his news conference as Pat Mitchell.  She did not return for Thursday's briefing. ""Lydia Callis has been replaced! Feel bad for this woman signing now. Like trying to freestyle after JayZ has just performed,"" tweeted @janvijhaveri. ""Bloomberg's new signer does her job fine, but she doesn't have panache of Lydia Callis, who signed with a New York accent. Bring her back!"" posted @MahaRafiAtal. ""Awww what happened? Bloomberg didn't like all the shine Lydia Callis was getting? Or did they just finally give her a break?"" @DeePhunk wrote. The mayor's office, obviously with bigger matters to address, did not respond to CNN calls or e-mails about Callis and her replacement. Callis has remained mostly silent, not jumping into the New York media circus -- yet. Silence is a job requirement, according to Kim Kurz, who chairs the American Sign Language & Interpreting Education department at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf. Callis earned a degree in American Sign Language from that school, which is part of the Rochester Institute of Technology, before moving to New York City last year, a school spokesman said. ""We are honored to see Lydia's skills recognized in this situation and send her our best wishes for continued success in her profession,"" Gerard Buckley, the school's president, said in an e-mail to CNN.","New York's mayor appeared with a different sign-language interpreter Wednesday .

"The premier of Taiwan announced his resignation on Saturday after losing the first election since protests erupted over a controversial trade deal with mainland China. The move by Jiang Yi-huah sets the stage for significant turnover, and possibly reforms, in the East Asian island. Jiang said he'd step down after his ruling Kuomintang placed second in Saturday's election, with just over 40% support. The day's top vote-getter was the Democratic Progressive Party, with more than 47% of the vote. The election came months after protesters from what Taiwanese media dubbed the ""Sunflower Movement"" occupied Taiwan's parliament and hit the streets to rail against the trade agreement between Taiwan and mainland China, its longtime adversary, which was signed in Shanghai last year. Taiwan police clash with students over trade deal . Critics claimed the deal would threaten small businesses in Taiwan and give China greater influence in the island state. The public uproar held up the trade agreement, and soured relations between China and Taiwan -- officially the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China. Although the two separated in 1949 following a civil war, China still claims Taiwan as its territory. To this day, China is reported to have missiles pointed at the island. Yet there also have been recent signs of tensions thawing between the two. For instance, many Taiwanese companies have moved factories to China, while Chinese banks now operate on the island. Six years ago no direct flights existed between the island and the mainland; today there are hundreds of flights a week and tourists are flooding in.","Taiwan's Premier Jiang Yi-huah says he will step down .

"Four years after hosting the 2008 Summer Games, Beijing's Olympic legacy appears to be a lasting one. ""Beijingers are still steeped in the Olympic spirit,"" noted my daughter Michelle, 21, who is visiting Beijing for the summer. She grew up here and saw the city host the sporting showpiece. As a 17-year-old high school student, she took part in the Olympic torch relay a few days before the Games opened spectacularly in the National Stadium, an iconic structure fashioned after a bird's nest. ""The sports facilities seem a bit run down now but the space is still being used,"" she reported after a recent trip to the Olympic village. ""The Bird's Nest is now a tourist spot and holds sports and entertainment events. ""The Water Cube now has a water park open to the public for a fee,"" she added, referring the National Swimming Center designed to look like a blue cube. Michelle says the Chinese are supportive of London, which will host the 2012 Games this summer. ""They have huge ads promoting the London Olympics,"" she said. ""They even have a double-decker bus inside the Water Cube and I saw many visitors take pictures beside it."" With the London Games just one month away, China watchers ask: What legacy did the Olympics leave in Beijing? ""The legacy is bad and good,"" opined James McGregor, a senior adviser at communications firm APCO in China, and a long-time resident of Beijing. ""The bad side is that China now has very expensive white elephant facilities to maintain with government money because they can't quite allow themselves to properly commercialize them. ""The good side is individual participation in sports and it is now considered important to a healthy lifestyle."" Beijingers are proud to have pulled it off despite earlier skepticism and criticism. ""It's been generally positive,"" said Zhang Wenjia, a 36-year-old taxi driver. ""Infrastructure is much better, more tourists are coming and business remains good."" China has avoided a post-Olympic slump, largely because of the scale, momentum and potential of its juggernaut economy. With or without the 2008 Games, many observers agree China would have changed rapidly anyway. Opinion: China has room to grow . Still, they credit the Olympics as a catalyst of change. ""The legacy left behind by the Olympics is multifaceted, from hardware to software,"" said Wang Hui, director of the Beijing Information Office, and one of the official spokespeople of the 2008 Games. She credits it for speeding up the modernization of the city's infrastructure, from roads to telecoms, to subway lines. ""In 2001, when Beijing won its bid to host, our subway network was only 60 kilometers long,"" she explained. ""In 2008, it reached 200 km. At the end of 2011, it has grown to 372 km. We plan to expand it to 660 km by 2015."" She also spoke proudly of Terminal 3 at the Beijing Capital International Airport, an ultramodern terminal shaped like a dragon. Over the years, it has relieved the overloaded airport's other two terminals. ""T3 is now the world's biggest stand-alone airport terminal, capable of holding 66 million passengers a year -- the third largest in the world,"" Wang Hui said. Inbound tourism remains robust, thanks to the massive media exposure China got before and during the 17-day jamboree. The Games gave China a chance to use its cultural and historical legacy to attract people who would normally not travel to China. Who can forget the spectacular shows that film impressario Zhang Yimou staged during the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games? Wang Hui said the city's ""software"" has improved too.  ""People's habits are changing,"" she said. ""More and more residents are learning English. Beijing has become more cosmopolitan, more international. The Olympics has boosted our national pride and China's image overseas."" Scott Kronick, Ogilvy Public Relation's North Asia president, agrees. ""The world had a chance to see a different China from the one that is making the headline news,"" he said. ""I think it is fair to say the Games allowed China to be perceived in a different frame."" The frames these days show China in a state of flux -- changing rapidly, prosperous and strong, but also facing intractable problems. ""The Games helped China become more integrated into the world and with that comes different and higher expectations, like transparency, ensuring level playing fields and more,"" added Kronick, who has advised Chinese and multinational clients during the Olympics. But Beijing's modernization drive, hastened by the Olympics, has come at a price. This includes the displacement of countless residents and the disappearance of the famed hutongs -- the city's old streets and closely knit neighborhoods, many of which have been torn down to make way for new avenues and skyscrapers. Photographer Xu Yong, who has published a picture book on Beijing hutongs, noted wryly: ""When I photographed the hutongs in 1989, Beijing still had over 2,000 hutongs. Now, there are only 200 honest-to-goodness hutongs left."" Another price of rapid development is pollution. China air pollution: 'Slightly polluted' or 'hazardous'? Beijing residents have become more aware of environment issues, but many ""green"" projects remain unfinished. The city has allocated billions of dollars to tackle environmental issues, hoping to cut back coal-burning pollution, prevent sandstorms through reforestation, and create a greener and cleaner Beijing. But four years after the Games, Beijing's pollution indexes are still hitting record highs. Quite often, tourists drawn to the Bird's Nest find it shrouded by a thick film of grime. In 2007, a year before the Games, China also promised greater press freedom for foreign journalists covering China, saying they would be allowed to travel freely across most of the country and interview people with getting official approval. China has mostly lived up to that promise, but erratically. In recent months, foreign reporters have encountered a number of obstacles, especially in sensitive areas like the Tiananmen Square protests anniversary, Tibet and unrest in Xinjiang. China still routinely blocks internet access and locks up whistle-blowing journalists, bloggers and dissidents. For good or for ill, Beijing is changing fast. Its image now is light years away from the one I witnessed when I first arrived here 40 years ago. But for all its faults and imperfections, Beijing remains a charming and dynamic city. Is there any Beijing Olympics-related goal that has not panned out? I asked former Games spokeswoman Wang Hui. ""If you mean yet unfulfilled goals,"" she replied, ""it's that our national football team has yet to meet the expectations of our citizens.""","Analyst: Beijing has many expensive white elephant facilities from 2008 Olympic Games .

"Say ""laptop"" or ""tablet"" or ""app"" to a technophile and you may get them interested. Say ""robot,"" and you've got them excited. For centuries, we've been intrigued by the concept of creating mechanized beings that are as much like us as possible. And as our technological know-how marches ever forward, we're closer than ever to doing it. From robots you can buy right now to the ones invading the work force to tech giant Google's move into military robotics, our automated friends are no longer just the stuff of science-fiction double features. But like many scientific advances, fantasy was a prime motivator. ""Both scientific research and science fiction begin with the same two words: 'What if?'"" says University of Minnesota physics professor physics professor James Kakalios, who teaches a course called ""Everything I Know About Science I Learned From a Comic Book."" So, as we ponder the real-world arrival of robots in our midst -- delivery drones, self-driving cars -- it's worth taking a look at 10 of the most influential robots from pop culture that helped inspire us along the way. Leonardo's robot . Was Leonardo da Vinci the first celebrity to put the concept of a human-like, mechanical companion into the public consciousness? You can argue the answer is ""yes."" Some time around 1495, Leonardo -- the famed painter, sculptor, inventor, engineer and all-around genius -- sketched his idea for a ""mechanical knight."" The result was a suit of armor, automated by a system of pulleys and levers, that he is believed to have displayed at a party at the court of Milan. It could stand, sit, raise its visor and move its arm. When his notes were discovered in the 1950s, researchers re-created the ""robot,"" suggesting that his idea would have really worked. The automaton likely was powered by humans, meaning it's not technically a robot. But Leonardo later worked on programmable constructions, like an automated lion, suggesting he was definitely onto something. The first 'robots' ""R.U.R."" -- or ""Rossum's Universal Robots"" -- was a Czech play that premiered in 1921. It is believed to be the first time the term ""robots"" was used to describe artificial people (who, in the tale, are made in a factory from synthetic material). In Czech, ""robota"" means forced labor. As happens in these cases, the cyborg-like creations in the play seem perfectly happy to serve humans, until an uprising ends in the extinction of the human race. Can't win 'em all. The play was a huge success and, by 1923, it had been translated into 30 languages. Maria, the Maschinenmensch . The first movie robot wasn't far behind. In 1927, Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" became the first feature-length sci-fi film, painting a picture of a dystopian future that would be echoed decades later in movies like ""Blade Runner."" In it, rich industrialists deploy a female robot to impersonate Maria, a woman they fear will organize the workers they oppress. Pop artists from Queen to Nine Inch Nails to Madonna have made music videos either inspired by ""Metropolis"" or using clips from it. A half-century after ""Metropolis,"" the appearance of ""Star Wars"" droid C-3PO would be largely inspired by the robotic Maria. Asimov's Three Laws . The short story they come from, ""Runaround,"" was written in 1942, but would become more widely known when the story appeared in science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov's 1950 collection, ""I, Robot."" Before Asimov, most robot stories followed a similar pattern: Scientists create robot; robot goes haywire and attacks its creators. Bored with that, he set up new rules of the robotic road. His Three Laws are: . • A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. •  A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. • A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law . It wasn't that things would always go well from there. Many of Asimov's stories, and the stories and films that his laws inspired, focus on trouble that arises when robots have trouble knowing how to obey the laws in tricky real-world situations. But they are also credited with helping create the ""lovable"" robot in science fiction: an archetype popularized in TV and movies, from ""Lost in Space"" to ""Star Wars"" to ""Short Circuit."" Robby the Robot . Robby made his first appearance in the 1956 movie ""Forbidden Planet."" From there, he became arguably the silver screen's first mecha-celebrity. In old Hollywood's great tradition of over-the-top, and often misleading, ballyhoo, the movie's poster showed Robby manhandling a maiden, but he's actually a helpful robot with a dry wit to boot. After ""Forbidden Planet,"" Robby, or sometimes just the vaguely humanoid suit, went on to appear in dozens of movies and television shows, from ""The Twilight Zone,"" ""Lost In Space"" and ""The Addams Family"" to the much later ""Mork & Mindy"" and ""Earth Girls Are Easy"" Robby was inducted into Carnegie Mellon's Robot Hall of Fame in 2004. HAL 9000 . ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was Stanley Kubrick's epic, groundbreaking film from 1968, and HAL 9000 was unquestionably its star. Represented by an impassive, disembodied voice but able to mechanically control the spaceship Discovery, which he's tasked with running, HAL represented our fears of technology gone awry as the Space Age dawned. Instead of obeying Asimov's Laws, HAL, first and foremost, is devoted to making sure his ship's mission is a success. And that command has a deadly, and near-disastrous outcome. Some argue that since he didn't have a physical form (at least by the strictest standards) HAL is not really a robot. But Carnegie Mellon thought he deserved to go into the Robot Hall of Fame with its inaugural class in 2003. R2-D2 and C-3PO . It's hard to argue anyone did more to propel robots from hardcore science fiction into the wider public consciousness than these two when they hit the screen in 1977. Full of personality, gallant and always helpful, the pair have appeared in all six ""Star Wars"" films to date. Creator George Lucas has said that R2-D2 is his favorite character from the movies. Terminator . Mention any major advance of robotics, technology or artificial intelligence and, to this day, you'll inevitably hear something like this: ""Skynet just became self-aware."" Skynet is the system that leads to the Terminators, the titular robots of the series of movies (and later TV shows) which began in 1984. A new embodiment of our worst fears, the robots of ""Terminator"" are time-traveling killing machines -- and it's all because the people in charge let what we can do get ahead of what we should do. Data . Call Data the ""anti-Terminator."" The android from ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" is a creation that science has made so painfully close to human that his hyper-powered mind can't help but yearn to be one of us. The bad jokes weren't enough. Ultimately, an ""emotion chip"" granted Data's Pinocchio-like wish to become ""real."" Wall-E . The idea of a friendly robot with a ton of personality was well established by the time ""Wall-E"" came along in 2008. But the Academy Award-winning film is arguably Pixar's best, and a huge reason for that was Wall-E's wordless yet emotionally moving ""performance."" Like much great science fiction, ""Wall-E"" also tackles larger societal issues like rampant consumerism and environmental waste, while still offering up a robot who connected with millions of viewers, young and old, on a personal level.","Real-world robotics have been inspired by pop-culture creations .

"(CNN) -- President Obama seems determined to launch a two-front war with the new Republican Congress. The bigger news has been about his threatened executive order on immigration. The White House, however, has also indicated a determination to greet the new Senate majority leader from coal country with a series of very expensive environmental regulations necessitated by the climate agreement he announced with China. Before he takes these steps, President Obama should take a few days off and read a couple of books about President Woodrow Wilson's last two years in office. There are a lot of parallels between the two presidents. Both were college professors. Both liked to hide on a golf course (Wilson holds the record having played more than 1,000 rounds as President). Both were powerful orators. Both had deeply held convictions. Both disliked the Congress. The collapse of the Wilson presidency after the 1918 midterm defeat is a cautionary tale for President Obama. Republicans gained 25 seats in the House and five seats in the Senate, enabling them to control the Senate by a narrow 49-47 margin. Wilson did not seem to realize how powerful that Senate control was, even if by a close margin. He also did not realize how deeply senators feel about their prerogatives and constitutional authority. Obama determined as ever to bypass Congress . Wilson's reaction to the new Republican Senate was to defy it. He went off to the peace conference of Versailles which ended World War I with no Republican senators in the delegation. He wrote the League of Nations treaty (the forerunner to the United Nations) refusing to compromise with Republicans in the Senate. When the Republicans insisted on adding some limitations to the treaty, Wilson fought them. He went to the country and launched a nationwide speaking tour. The tension and exhaustion led him to collapse with a stroke on October 2, 1919. The incapacitated president was protected by his wife, who in effect ran the administration until he left office. The American people repudiated Wilson by an enormous margin in the 1920 elections. Republican Warren Harding won 404 electoral votes and more than 60% of the vote. In the House, Republicans gained 62 seats for a 302-131 majority. In the Senate, Republicans gained 10 seats for a 59-37 majority. President Wilson had presided over the destruction of the Democratic Party -- and it did not become competitive again until the Great Depression a decade later. President Obama seems determined to reject the American people. He set the terms for this election on October 2 at Northwestern University when he declared that his ""policies were on the ballot."" The American people took him at his word and defeated Democrats at every level. When the President's party loses the Senate, additional seats in the House, a number of governorships, and almost 300 state legislators, the American people have spoken. Republicans today have more state legislators than any time in the party's history. Republicans also control more state legislative bodies than any time in their history. Republicans have very likely tied and may surpass their post World War II high-point in membership in the U.S. House, making Speaker Boehner the most successful Republican Speaker in electoral terms since Longworth in the 1920s. If the president's opponent reaches those kind of high-water marks after a 160-year history, something big is happening. Pollster Kellyanne Conway reports  that 74% of last week's voters wanted President Obama to work with Congress rather than unilaterally issue an executive order on immigration. Gallup reports that 53% of the American people want the new GOP Congress to set priorities while only 36% favor President Obama setting the priorities. This is a striking decline for the President from 2012 (Obama is down 10 percentage points and Republicans are up 11 points in two years). If President Obama defies the will of the American people, he will destroy the Democrats' chances in 2016. Democrats in 2014 had to hide from Obama. By 2016, at this rate, they will have to repudiate him. That would all but guarantee their party's defeat, with a party descending into internal strife and the pro-Obama hard-liners fighting with anti-Obama Democrats who just want to survive. Hillary Clinton would find it a nearly impossible environment for a campaign. There are more immediate consequences to an Obama war on Congress. The Congress will fight back, and the Congress has more tools to fight with than the President does (the spending power, committee hearings and oversight power, and taking votes, to name a few). Congressional tools are so extensive and so misunderstood that they deserve their own column. It will be interesting to see how the White House reacts to the new Congress. Outgoing majority leader Harry Reid has protected the President from a lot of difficult choices by controlling the Senate so tightly. As a result, President Obama and his team may not even fully understand the disaster they could be creating by declaring war on Congress. Reading of Wilson's catastrophic experience might temper the Obama White House. If not, the new Republican Congress will defeat it.

In 1967, Alfano was an ""Eaglette"" -- an NFL cheerleader for the Philadelphia Eagles. Unlike today, the cheerleaders were covered from head to toe. The uniforms had long sleeves, and the cheerleaders wore gloves and cloth helmets. ""From the early 1960s until 1967, I spent tons of time on my hair,"" she says, noting her mod hairdo in the picture is actually a wig. ""Wigs were big back then. Everyone had at least one."" In 1968, the style began to evolve. Alfano still spent a lot of time on her hair, but her peers began heavily criticizing all things materialistic, so the style became more casual. ""I was still 'fussing' a bit with my hair, but the times were changing, and so was I,"" she says. The changing fashion of 'Mad Men' A year later, Alfano joined the ""flower children,"" moved to California, grew her hair out and wore more flowing clothes. She says many women stopped dying their hair or wearing makeup. Some even stopped shaving. ""It was all part of the 'revolution,' and the anti-establishment movement,"" Alfano says.

"Call it a historic technological achievement. Call it a victory lap across America. Call it a shameless promotion for a controversial energy agenda. Its owners simply call it Solar Impulse. It's the first manned plane to fly for 24 hours on nothing but solar-powered batteries. That's right -- we're talking about a sun-powered plane that can fly at night. ""Theoretically,"" said its pilot, Bertrand Piccard, ""the plane can fly forever."" The Swiss-made Solar Impulse is in the middle of a U.S. tour this month, flying five legs from California to New York. In 2015, Piccard and his co-pilot, Andre Borschberg, hope to make the next generation of Solar Impulse the first solar-powered plane to circle the globe. It's a lofty goal for this funny-looking, slow and unwieldy design --  with one main wheel, a tiny cockpit and no toilet. It's made of revolutionary lightweight materials and its solar cells are built in as part of the wings. Basically, it's a giant flying solar cell. Circling the globe is only part of the plan. The mission also includes an environmental agenda aimed at promoting the use of green technology and renewable energy sources such as the sun and the wind. We caught up with Piccard on the phone at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, where he landed after flying the first 18-hour, 650-mile leg of Solar Impulse's journey from Mountain View, California. As a safety precaution, Piccard reportedly had to circle the airport to wait for officials to suspend commercial flight operations for his landing. Turbulence poses the biggest danger when piloting Solar Impulse, Piccard said. While flying near San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge, he said, he experienced some of the worst turbulence since he started flying the aircraft in Europe several years ago. Related video: Watch Solar Impulse in motion . Even with the aircraft's lumbering 43-mph cruising speed, Piccard ""was really fighting hard to keep the plane on track,"" he said. Flying through clouds and near mountains, he said, offers the biggest potential for turbulence. He keeps a parachute handy for a worst-case scenario, which he said is unlikely. The men . At age 54, Piccard is a bona fide adventurer -- with world records to prove it. Decades after pioneering ultralight aircraft in the 1970s, Piccard and his colleague Brian Jones were the first to circle the earth nonstop in a balloon in 1999. Their gondola is displayed at the Smithsonian. Breaking barriers is a Piccard family tradition. His grandfather explored the stratosphere in a pressurized chamber carried by a balloon. Ten miles high, he was the first human to see the curvature of the planet with his own eyes. Piccard's father plumbed the Pacific, taking a special submarine to a record-setting depth of nearly 7 miles. ""I was deeply influenced by them,"" he said. ""Each of my adventures is a way to pay tribute to everything they've showed me and taught me and initiated me to do."" Oh, and on a random note, Piccard is a respected psychiatrist with a recognized expertise in hypnosis. Borschberg, 60, came to the project with more than two decades as a Swiss Air Force fighter pilot. It was Borschberg who was in the cockpit during the Solar Impulse's 24-hour flight. The machine . This beautiful example of elegant engineering looks like a giant goose. Its wings are huge: 208 feet -- that's wider than a Boeing 747. A 747's maximum takeoff weight is 833,000 pounds. This plane weighs only 3,500 pounds -- about the same as a Honda CR-V. Its batteries are able to store enough energy from the sun during the day to power the aircraft throughout the night. And what happens in the cockpit when nature calls? Piccard, always the gentleman, explained it like this: When the plane takes off, ""you have full bottles of water on the right side and empty bottles on the left side,"" he said. ""And when you land, it's the other way around."" In 2012, Solar Impulse flew from Spain to Morocco, making it the first manned sun-powered plane to fly to another continent. But it won't be the first solar aircraft to soar the entire width of the United States. The Sunseeker I, piloted by Eric Raymond, crossed the nation in 21 legs back in 1990. Four years earlier, Burt Rutan and Jeana Yeager flew a fossil fuel-powered plane, the Voyager, around the world nonstop without refueling. But it's never been done with a solar-powered aircraft -- so far. The mission . The Solar Impulse project's goals amount to more than breaking records and making history. The group hopes to change minds and influence future generations. With each stop on their itinerary, Piccard and Borschberg bring with them a message: Use technology that saves energy and support government-mandated targets for creating electricity from renewable sources. Many U.S. states have passed legislation calling on utilities to generate specific percentages of their electricity from renewables -- wind, water, solar or others -- by a certain date. Supporters say such regulations will cut pollution caused by burning fossil fuels. Opponents say it will drive energy prices higher. The Obama administration has opened millions of acres of public land to be used by private companies for giant solar power farms. What does the future of solar-powered transportation look like? As more consumers buy electric-powered cars, more vehicle charging stations are popping up which are powered by the sun. But a commercially viable solar-powered car, experts say, is still very far down the road. And many engineers say the development of a solar-powered airliner is very unlikely because they don't believe it's possible to build an onboard system that can produce the massive amounts of energy required. A few tinkerers are coming up with solar-powered scooters and pedal vehicles, like the Elf trike being sold in North Carolina. Development of Solar Impulse may contribute to better designs of ""long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicles,"" as the Pentagon calls them. Engineers are developing giant solar-powered flying wings that are remote-controlled and designed to remain aloft at high altitudes for weeks, months, or even years -- nonstop. Such machines could be used for scientific research or surveillance, or as relay stations to transmit communication signals across long distances. Piccard and Borschberg are looking forward to a future that includes more solar power. In the meantime, they'll be focusing on their plan to circle the globe and their current journey across America. That will include a stop in St. Louis, the hometown of aviation icon Charles Lindbergh. ""I think we share the same spirit,"" Piccard said of Lindbergh, the first pilot to solo across the Atlantic. Global excitement from that 1927 flight sparked the beginning of a ""new cycle,"" Piccard said, which led to the international airline industry we enjoy today. Piccard hopes Solar Impulse will start a similar cycle that will lead to unimaginable new dimensions in the development of technology.","Solar Impulse is the first manned plane to fly 24 hours on sun power .

"(CNN) -- I am tired. Tired of our streets being peppered with dead, unarmed black people. Tired of listening to armed assailants describe how they feared for their lives. Tired of being told ""this has nothing to do with race."" I am tired of having to march to have murderers arrested. Tired of worrying about my 17-year-old being gunned down by some random white guy who thinks his music is too loud.  Tired of knowing the same could happen to me. I am tired of seeing a hashtag in front of a victim's name on Twitter. Tired of seeing Al Sharpton speak on behalf of a family. Tired of waiting for verdicts and hoping for justice --as if hearing ""guilty"" can ease the anxiety of knowing a police officer shot and killed a 22-year-old black man while he was lying face down and with his hands behind his back. I'm tired of the cynics who are quick to extend the benefit of the doubt to a gunman but hesitant to do the same for an unarmed teenage girl who had been shot in the face. I am tired of seeing images of police officers with snarling dogs threatening a crowd of black protesters and not knowing if it's from the 1960s or last week. In the case of Michael Brown's death in Ferguson, Missouri, it's the latter. Witnesses said he was shot multiple times from 35 feet away after his hands were raised. Again, he was unarmed. I am tired of the U.S. Department of Justice having to closely watch local authorities. I am tired of local authorities advocating for Stop and Frisk one minute and dismissing the notion of racial profiling the next. I am tired of the charlatans who chase the bodies of innocent victims the way sleazy lawyers chase ambulances. I hate black looters at peaceful rallies the way I hate the KKK. I don't want to get shot by a police officer. And I'm tired of thinking that each time one walks by. I don't begrudge anyone who has the luxury of not knowing what that kind of siege feels like. I just hope they have the decency not to characterize the socioeconomic disparity along racial lines as a card to be played but rather recognize it as a looming element of our cultural fiber. For example, from 1934 to 1962, the federal government backed $120 billion of home loans. Because of an appraisal system that deemed integrated communities financial risks, less than 2% of those loans went to minorities. When you consider that home ownership has long been the prerequisite for the average American to acquire wealth, there is little wonder why white Americans have 22 times more wealth than blacks. That is not a card being played. That is math. And I'm tired of having to explain that. Just as I'm tired of watching the video of Eric Garner being placed in a chokehold by NYPD, listening to him say ""I can't breathe, I can't breathe"" and then watching him die minutes later. But I need to keep watching because apathy is a clever hunter. It cloaks itself with FBI statistics and slips into the system between runs to Starbucks. Then one day as you're sipping your grande decaf mocha, you see a headline about an unarmed black man being shot and killed by police and think nothing of it. Or worse yet -- assume he did something to deserve it. I'm tired of unarmed dead black people being put on trial. I'm tired of politicians visiting our churches for votes but skipping out on these funerals . I'm tired of hearing mothers and fathers weep for children who did not have to die.

"(CNN) -- What is going on inside the heads of those nine Supreme Court justices? This week's legal drama around same-sex marriage makes me worry that they're all thinking more about politics than doing right by the Constitution. Don't get me wrong. By deciding on Monday to turn down all pending same-sex marriage cases, the Supreme Court managed to bring marriage equality to at least five new states and many thousands of couples. In one sense, the Roberts court has done more good simply by doing nothing than they've been able to do in volumes and volumes of actual rulings. But I can't help but feel that the Supreme Court's decision to turn down all those cases passed the buck on their core constitutional responsibility to do justice. Over the past few years, we've learned that the Supreme Court doesn't have a care in the world about taking up huge, hot button issues and issuing sweeping rulings that change the future of this country. Citizens United. 5-4. Crippled our campaign finance system. Voting Rights Act. 5-4. Gutted it. Hobby Lobby. 5-4. Continued the war on women by putting their reproductive health decisions in the hands of corporations. (I don't know about you, but I hear a lot from my Republican friends about ""judicial activism."" Those are the rulings that sound like judicial activism to meâ€”striking down portions of critical laws that help make this a better, more equal country for all.) When it came down to guaranteeing the right to marriageâ€”a fundamental constitutional rightâ€”the court just passed the buck. The justices simply turned down the opportunity to do what's right. And, yes, the court's decision to turn down those cases on Monday meant that some states won marriage equality by default. But what about everyone else? What about a gay couple living in one of the states that is still being left behind, like my own home state of Louisiana? There are folks in these states who have been living together for decades, going to church, volunteering, or working for a better future. If one of those folks gets in a car accident tomorrow, their partner, their spouse, has no legal right to survival benefits, to pensions, to being on the death certificate! And the Supreme Court wants to tell us that there's no dispute here? No federal issue that merits their immediate attention? It's absurd. Campaign finance laws say a billionaire can't give a candidate a million dollars? The Supreme Court's on it like flies to honey. A little old lady's partner of 40 years dies, but her state says they were never married in the eyes of the law? ""Eh,"" the Supreme Court says, ""we'll get to it later."" It's just wrong. People are suffering, the nation's marriage laws are in chaos -- so what on Earth is the point of delay? To me, the only reason seems to be politics. I worry that most of those justices didn't want to get their hands dirty by dealing with this deeply emotional and human issue. But folks, that's just not how this social contract is supposed to work. If you're a Supreme Court justice, the American people have elevated you to one of the highest offices in the land out of the goodness of their heart and out of deference to your legal wisdom. You get a lifetime appointment, limitless prestige, a great office, and what I have to assume is a very comfortable chair. And as Americans, all we ask in return of our justices is that they do what's right. The justices failed in that duty this week, and I hope they get a chance to remedy that decision sooner rather than later. After all, when deep, fundamental constitutional rights are at stake, we know from history that we cannot tolerate two nations divided against one another. We need one nation, with liberty and justice for all. I hope we get one soon.","This week the Supreme Court turned down all pending gay marriage cases .

"Yachts fill the bay in front of sparkling new skyscrapers rising from the city beyond. Cross the street to the other side, and sandy beaches are lined with restaurants and nightclubs. Sunbathers lounge during the day, replaced in the evening by fine diners who think nothing of plopping down a couple hundred dollars for sushi or lobster. After a pre-disco nap, the beautiful people emerge and the music cranks up from midnight until the sun comes up again. It's not Miami or Rio, but the Ilha de Luanda, a tropical beach playground in the African country of Angola for the wealthy and increasing number of expatriates who work there. Sound like a party worth checking out? There's a catch. Visas to Angola are notoriously difficult to get and those that do get the stamp must ready themselves to swallow some whopping prices. Luanda is among the top 10 most expensive cities in the world for expats -- behind Caracas and Oslo, and well above other famously expensive cities: Geneva is 5th, Tokyo 11th, Hong Kong 29th, New York 39th. Unlike those cities, Luanda's wealthy waterfront is surrounded by grinding poverty, visible to anyone landing at the airport. That's an image that the city is trying to change, transforming its Marginal bay-front walkway and the Ilha, the thin peninsula that stretches in front of the city. For those that do make it here -- and it's worth trying, there's nowhere else like it -- here are the places to go. Naquele Lugar . Housed in a two-story house next to the Fortress of Sao Miguel, Naquele Lugar restaurant is located on the way to the Ilha. The soldier at the entrance will let guests through to the white-walled patio if they explain they're coming for dinner. Even though seafood seems like the smart choice here, the steak with pepper sauce is better. Honestly, there's better food elsewhere, but it's a unique location with an unmatched view of the city on the way out. Naquele Lugar, Rua 17 de Setembro; +244 926 322 615 . Lookal . Lookal is one of the most expensive places to eat in the city, which in Luanda is saying something. Why so pricey? Because even though guests are gazing over the Atlantic, and Angola has some of the world's least-fished waters, the seafood here is flown in from Europe. A decent meal for two costs $300, but the Portuguese lobster can cost nearly that much per kilo. Still, many people swear by the place. Those people all have expense accounts. After dinner, Lookal turns into a high-powered nightclub with dancing until sunrise. Lookal, No. 15 Rua Murtala Mohamed; +244 936 000 018 . Coconuts . Few places embody the changes on the Ilha as much as Coconuts. Fifteen years ago, this was a shell of a building, without a roof, windows or doors. A series of renovations have turned it into a luxurious spot that takes full advantage of its place at the end of the peninsula. Coconuts is now a great spot to enjoy a daytime drink or linger over an evening of seafood with friends. The chef prepares a special menu every week. It's not as expensive as some restaurants, but budget a minimum of $100 a person. Coconuts, Avenida Murtala Mohamed, Ilha do Cabo; +244 912 205 777 . Cais de Quatro . In many ways, Cais de Quatro represents Luanda's cosmopolitan aspirations. With one of the best views over the city, the international menu runs from pizza to sushi. It's a relative bargain: the pizza sets diners back just $25. If at this point they're feeling really pinched for cash, they can always have a drink and then wander to the Wimpy burger joint next door. Cais de Quatro, Avenida Murtala Mohamed, Casa do Desportista; +244 222 309 430 . Bahia . Those who'd rather walk along Luanda's newly renovated Marginal couldn't ask for a better spot than Bahia. The restaurant long predates the $350 million upgrade to the bayside boardwalk, which was once just another dusty, smelly street in a city where dusty and smelly are par for the course. Now it's got wide pedestrian trails, playgrounds and palm trees imported from Miami. Yes, palm trees imported to tropical Angola. Nonetheless, Bahia is a romantic spot to share a langoustine pizza by candlelight. And eating here won't break the bank. Bahia, 183/184 Avenida 4 de Fevereiro; +244 222 370 610 . Cabo Verde . For those who can find the place, the best thing to do on the Ilha is to hang with Luanda's Cape Verdian community at George's house. That's not the name of the venue.

"(CNN)It's a modern day gold rush. A trip to Super Bowl XLIX in Phoenix will cost even the most discerning fans thousands of dollars, while providing a hefty windfall for business owners riding one of the biggest consumer spending weekends of the year in the U.S. Victoria's Secret models hosting $25,000 tables, shady ticket deals, and risky online trading for Super Bowl seats have become as much a part of the annual celebration of America's favorite sport as the ceremonial opening coin toss. With so much at stake, many fans won't be leaving anything to chance in the race to book luxury hotels, limos, and some of the year's most lavish parties -- not to mention, tickets to the big game itself. As a result, a throwback solution from pre-Internet days has emerged as a winner: the hospitality package deal. ""It's a value-add situation,"" says Anbritt Stengele, owner of Chicago-based Sports Traveler, who sold out of her few remaining Super Bowl packages last Friday. ""Hotels are just not available,"" she says, explaining that there is extra demand for four and five-star accommodation over the weekend because of the Phoenix Open, a four-day PGA tournament featuring Tiger Woods, which concludes on Super Bowl Sunday. For Sports Traveler clients, drinking can start as early as at 11.30 a.m. on game day with a ""Touchdown Club Tailgate Party"" that includes an open bar and buffet that lasts until kickoff at 3.30 p.m. Understandably, a premium is placed on hassle-free transportation from the resorts of Scottsdale to the University of Phoenix Stadium, a 40-minute drive away. ""People want to have some fun; they don't want to be the designated driver,"" she explains. ""They just want the whole thing taken care of and guaranteed. Yes you can do it yourself, but a lot of people choose not to."" Working her 15th Super Bowl since starting her company as a student at Saint Xavier University in Chicago, Stengele reserves blocks of hotel rooms in Super Bowl cities 12 months in advance. She has already launched her search for rooms in San Francisco, in preparation for Super Bowl 50, to be played in nearby Santa Clara. Providing that scarce availability, along with a game ticket, provides an advantage over hotel booking sites, she says. At this late stage, the basic package deals left on ticketing site SBTickets.com begin at $6,000 for one 'Upper Level End Zone' (i.e. nosebleed) Super Bowl ticket, four nights at a three-star hotel, game day shuttles, and pre-game festivities. The quote is per person based on a double occupancy room. Singles start at $7,000 and airfare is not included. The cheapest Super Bowl ""get-in"" price on ticket aggregator SeatGeek at the time of writing stands at $3,507, valuing the add-ons and convenience of a package deal at $2,493 per person. Seventy percent of Sports Traveler's clients are corporates, many of whom have asked for golf tee times and PGA tickets to be lumped onto their deals. The remaining batch encompasses 'bucket listers' looking to attend any Super Bowl, international fans (mainly Australians), and of course, rabid Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots supporters who waited to see whether their teams would qualify (only the highest spending season ticket holders are allotted seats to the big game). Then there are the partiers; lots of them. The concept of staging bachelor party-themed events leading up to the Super Bowl began over 10 years ago and has taken on a new realm of competition. Each year, the likes of Rolling Stone, Maxim, and Playboy try and outdo each other to attract the most famous bands, models, and personalities to their parties, granting access at eye-watering prices. ""The Saturday night before the Super Bowl is really when everyone wants to go out,"" says Stengele, adding that the Playboy party is often at the top of her corporate clients demand list. ""It's a guy-based event, absolutely,"" she says, about the bash which advertises 24 Playboy bunnies mingling with guests, while the rapper Nelly plays Master of Ceremonies. All tickets include an open bar and buffet. But what else could make the $850 entrance fee worthwhile? ""You can use your imagination,"" she says. ""There are lots of girls in there and lots of drinking. It's an experience."" ""Every superstar player that's not appearing in the Super Bowl will make a [paid] appearance at one or two of those events prior to the game,"" says Ahmad Tahoun, who organized the New York Giants Super Bowl victory party in Phoenix in 2008. ""Imagine a nightclub two nights before the Super Bowl with nothing but multimillionaire young athletes competing on what they spend,"" he adds. ""It's just champagne and sparklers everywhere."" This year's hot ticket is the Rolling Stone Magazine party, with performances by Steven Tyler of Aerosmith and Charli XCX. Tickets start at $1,045 and hit $56,238 for a Platinum Center table on rukkus.com. The Victoria's Secret hosted Leather and Laces party starts at $495 for a lounge seat, climbs to $2,500 for a meet and greet with the likes of Adriana Lima and Lily Aldridge, and hits $25,000 for a 'Celebrity Cabana' (includes 14 tickets, 10 bottles of premium liquor, and three bottles of Moet Champagne). Although Tahoun stresses that soirées attended by A-listers are closed to the paying public, some parties advertised as invite-only are anything but. General admission tickets to ""DirecTV's Super Saturday Night Invite-Only Bash,"" featuring a performance from Rihanna, are offered on vividseats.com for $970. While arranging tickets to parties is usually a straightforward process for agencies (promoters offer them first dibs), procuring Super Bowl tickets is another issue entirely. Stengele says she sources some tickets via corporate sponsors, but declines to reveal exactly how she fulfills the remainder of her ticketing obligations. Forging ties with those who have access, along with playing the secondary ticket market (tickets resold online at prices that fluctuate based on supply and demand), are two methods, according to Will Flaherty at SeatGeek. ""A lot of the teams cut deals with ticket brokers and sell their tickets in advance,"" he says, pointing to a controversy last year when the Denver Broncos and Seahawks both sold Super Bowl tickets to Prime Sport.  ""It's not something that teams want people to know that they are doing, particularly teams that have qualified."" In addition, Flaherty says many agents work the secondary ticket market speculatively, like stock traders. Without holding inventory, they will enter agreements to sell tickets in the two weeks leading up to the playoff semifinals. Once the Super Bowl opponents are determined, prices normally fall by over $1,000 in the two weeks leading up to game day, Flaherty says. The drop allows agents to cover their end of the deal by purchasing cheaper tickets closer to game time at a healthy margin. The trend has been consistent over the last four years, according to data provided by SeatGeek, which places a value score on tickets available across the web. During this year's run-up, however, market forces have worked the other way, pushing the average sold ticket price up 40% from a week earlier to $4,126, potentially leaving risk-takers in turmoil only days before the Super Bowl. The wiliest brokers, however, eschew market speculation for less scrupulous means. ""It's not uncommon to hear stories of agents with briefcases full of cash flying down to Phoenix to buy Super Bowl tickets in hotel lobbies off of players,"" says Flaherty, noting that every NFL player and coach is allotted two Super Bowl tickets to purchase at face value. Reselling the tickets for profit is against NFL rules, a violation for which former Minnesota Vikings head coach Mike Tice was fined $100,000 in 2005. Flaherty advises fans to wait until a few days before Super Bowl Sunday to make their purchases, when last minute deals can often be procured. Tahoun suggests the same to party goers: ""Once you get there and your boots are on the ground, you can negotiate better deals for sure,"" he says. For some fans, competing for the best deals off the field is part of the fun. Most, however, would prefer to revel in what Phoenix has to offer and leave the strategizing to the professionals.","Tickets for Sunday's Super Bowl final trading for thousands of dollars .

"(CNN) -- With President Barack Obama's approval rating hovering in the low to mid-40s -- it was 45% in CNN/ORC International's recent poll --Democrats in tough contests are largely keeping their distance from the president's tarnished reputation. And as Election Day has drawn closer, those differences have become more pronounced. Republican opponents are trying harder than ever to link their rivals to the president, forcing Democrats to visibly distinguish themselves from the White House. Here are seven Democratic candidates who've kept Obama on the sidelines: . 1. Alison Lundergan Grimes, Kentucky. As the Democrat challenging the Senate's top Republican in a state that voted for Mitt Romney two years ago, Grimes has been perhaps the most high-profile candidate to keep her distance from Obama. Most notably, she refuses to say whether she voted for the president, citing a matter of principle of privacy at the ballot box as her reason for not answering the question. She's been pressed about her support for the president because she's made a blatant attempt to paint herself as the Democratic antithesis to the commander in chief. ""I'm not Barack Obama,"" she said in a campaign ad. ""I disagree with him on guns, coal and the EPA."" 2. Sen. Mark Begich, Alaska. Only 41% of Alaska voters sided with Obama in 2012, so Begich knows all too well that it's not a smart strategy to be a champion for the president. In fact, he likes to think of himself more as a ""thorn."" ""I'll be a thorn in his [posterior],"" Begich told the Washington Post. ""There's times when I'm a total thorn, you know, and he doesn't appreciate it."" Last week he admitted he voted for Obama but argued that his voting record was irrelevant because ""the president's not relevant"" and will be ""gone in two years."" A limited role for Obama in his final campaign . And earlier this year he told CNN that he doesn't need Obama to campaign for him in Alaska. ""I need him to change some of his policies."" Regardless of how big of a thorn he is, Begich has a tough hill to climb to win a second term. He barely squeaked out a win in 2008 over then-longtime Sen. Ted Stevens, who at the time was buried in an ethics scandal. And a CNN/ORC poll from early October had Sullivan leading Begich, 50% to 44%. 3. Sen. Mark Udall, Colorado. Udall was expected to have a smooth ride to re-election until Republican Rep. Cory Gardner entered the race in March. Obama attended a Democratic fundraiser in Denver this summer, with half of the money raised going to Udall's campaign. But the senator wasn't there. His staff chalked up the absence to last-minute votes and legislative activity. The episode was foreshadowed somewhat when Udall refused to answer questions from CNN's Dana Bash earlier this year over whether he'd want to campaign with Obama. In another example, Udall tried to take a stake out a firm line on airstrikes against ISIS, saying in September he won't give ""this president -- or any other president -- a blank check to begin another land war in Iraq."" 4. Sen. Kay Hagan, North Carolina. Hagan is running for a second term in a state that voted for Obama in 2008 but not in 2012. As a result, she's had to strike a balance between appealing to the pro-Obama factions in her state -- mostly concentrated in the college hubs and big cities -- and the more rural parts of North Carolina. Senate math seems impossible to some Democrats . She exhibited this fine line in August, when she publicly criticized the president over the Veterans Affairs scandal in remarks released ahead of her speech at the American Legion. But when he showed up to also speak at the event, she warmly greeted him at the airport. Last week she reluctantly admitted that the president hasn't shown strong leadership. And when he visited North Carolina in January, she avoided him entirely. 5. Sen. Mary Landrieu, Louisiana. Landrieu has tried to paint herself as someone willing to go toe-to-toe with the Obama administration, especially when it comes to energy policy. She uses her position as chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources as a major selling point in her campaign, and has sided with Republicans in pushing for the approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline. In an ad, she's seen saying ""the administration's policies are simply wrong when it comes to oil and gas production in this nation."" Last year Landrieu declined to attend a visit by Obama to her state, though she still hitched a ride aboard Air Force One with the President on his way to Louisiana. 6. Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire. Shaheen's Republican challenger, Scott Brown, can't say one sentence without highlighting that Shaheen with Obama voted 99% of the time. Shaheen says she's proud of her record, but she's still not angling for a visit by the president. Asked whether she would want him to campaign for her, Shaheen said ""we have a lot going on."" ""I don't think it makes sense for the president to come to New Hampshire,"" she continued, while answering the question at the CNN/NH1 debate last week. But she's happily welcomed former President Bill Clinton, and Hillary Clinton is set to visit this weekend. 7. Mark Pryor, Arkansas. Fighting to keep his seat against GOP challenger Rep. Tom Cotton, Pryor has also sought to strike a balance between the politics of his state and on the national level. For example, he backs a minimum wage hike that's on the ballot in Arkansas, but he opposes Obama's proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10. Like other vulnerable Senate candidates -- such as Shaheen, Udall and Hagan -- Pryor has also called for travel restrictions to help prevent Ebola from spreading to the United States, a policy the Obama administration has not pushed. Pryor made headlines earlier this month when he sounded unsure of how to answer a question about Obama's handling of the Ebola situation.","Democratic candidates in tough races are trying to keep President Obama at arm's length .
Many of those candidates are fighting in largely red states .
Obama's approval rating hovers in the mid to low 40s ."
"(CNN) -- A water-filled berm protecting a nuclear power plant in Nebraska from rising floodwaters collapsed Sunday, according to a spokesman, who said the plant remains secure. Some sort of machinery came in contact with the berm, puncturing it and causing the berm to deflate, said Mike Jones, a spokesman for the Omaha Public Power District (OPPD), which owns the Fort Calhoun plant. The plant, located about 20 miles north of Omaha, has been shut since April for refueling. ""The plant is still protected. This was an additional, a secondary, level of protection that we had put up,"" Jones said. ""The plant remains protected to the level it would have been if the aqua berm had not been added."" Parts of the grounds are already under water as the swollen Missouri River overflows its banks, including areas around some auxiliary buildings, Jones said. In addition to the berm, authorities have put in place floodgates and other barriers to help protect the facility, like sandbags. The 8-foot-tall, water-filled berm, 16 feet wide at its base, surrounded the reactor containment structure and auxiliary buildings, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ""We built the plant up high enough based on history, based on the flooding in the past. If the flood would rise for some reason above that level we have taken precautions, again, per our procedures to sandbag the important equipment for the reactors,"" said Dave Van Der Kamp, with the Nebraska Public Power District. He said the chances of floodwater getting into the building where the core is kept are almost zero. The plant is designed to withstand waters up to 1,014 feet above mean sea level, according to the OPPD. The river currently stands at 1,006.3 feet and is not expected to exceed 1,008 feet, the OPPD said. Heavy rainfall in Montana and North Dakota, combined with melting snow from the Rocky Mountains, have sent the Missouri surging downstream this summer. The river washed over and punched through levees in nearby northwestern Missouri, spurring authorities to urge about 250 nearby residents to leave their homes. The 6 to 12 inches of rainfall in the upper Missouri basin in the past few weeks is nearly a normal year's worth, and runoff from the mountain snowpack is 140% of normal, according to forecasters. It was catastrophic flooding from Japan's March 11 tsunami that knocked out cooling systems at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, resulting in three reactors melting down and producing the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. This year's Midwestern flooding has also led to a spate of rumors about the Fort Calhoun plant that OPPD and the NRC have been trying to knock down. The utility has set up a ""flood rumor control"" page to reassure the public that there has been no release of radioactivity from the plant. An electrical fire June 7 did knock out cooling to its spent fuel storage pool for about 90 minutes, but the coolant water did not reach a boiling point before backup pumps went into service, it has said. CNN's Patrick Oppmann contributed to this report.","The Fort Calhoun plant remains secure, its owner says .

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic cemented his status as the hottest tennis player on the planet this year with a superb 4-6 6-3 6-2 victory over world No. 1 Rafael Nadal in the final of the Masters Series event at Indian Wells on Sunday. The Australian Open champion claimed Roger Federer's No. 2 ranking when he beat the 16-time grand slam champion for the third time in 2011 in Saturday's semifinals, and followed that up with his first win over Nadal since 2009. The Serbian claimed the 21st title of his career, and his second at Indian Wells, as he avenged his 2007 final defeat to Nadal in the Californian desert in a match lasting two hours and 25 minutes. The Spaniard, playing his first tournament since suffering a hamstring injury in his quarterfinal defeat in Melbourne in January, also beat Djokovic in the final of last year's U.S. Open to complete his career grand slam. New No. 2 Djokovic sets up Nadal final . He was seeking to join Federer, Michael Chang and Jimmy Connors as the only players to win three times at Indian Wells. And it looked like the 24-year-old was on course for his 46th ATP Tour title after clinching the first set after a vital break in the seventh game, as he served out to love. But Djokovic, who had been punished on his second serve in the opener, battled back to take a 4-2 lead. Nadal immediately broke back, but then lost his own serve again, and Djokovic finally leveled at 1-1 after his opponent hit wide of the line as he tried to save a sixth set-point. Nadal's error rate grew alarmingly in the deciding set, and Djokovic romped to a 4-0 lead as his serve got stronger as the match went on to extend his unbeaten run to 18 matches this year. The 23-year-old claimed the $605,500 first prize after becoming only the third player to beat Nadal and Federer in the same tournament twice, joining Nikolay Davydenko and David Nalbandian. However, Djokovic -- who spent 26 weeks at second in the rankings last year -- will still be almost 4,000 points behind Nadal when the ATP rankings list is released on Monday. ""I lost today, but I lost to one of the greatest,"" said Nadal, whose last title came in Japan last October. Meanwhile, women's No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki claimed her second title of the year after beating Marion Bartoli 6-1 2-6 6-3 in the WTA Tour final at the same venue earlier on Sunday. The 20-year-old Dane captured the 14th crown of her short career as she survived a second-set fightback from the first Frenchwoman to reach the Indian Wells final. Wozniacki, the runner-up last year, handed 15th seed Bartoli her seventh defeat in 12 career title matches. ""This is such an amazing event and everyone loves playing here. I'm already looking forward to playing here next year,"" Wozniacki said. Bartoli, the 2007 Wimbledon runner-up, is set to return to the top-10 in the rankings when the new list is released. ""Caroline, you should be very proud of yourself and I wish you all the best in the future. I know your goal is to get a grand slam -- I'm sure you'll get it very soon,"" she said at the award ceremony.","New world No. 2 Novak Djokovic wins Indian Wells title for the second time .

"Authorities in New Orleans have caught the man they say fired the first shot in a deadly exchange of gunfire last weekend in the city's French Quarter, police said Friday. An arrest warrant was issued Friday morning for Trung Le -- a 20-year-old from nearby Belle Chasse, Louisiana -- on one count of first-degree murder and nine counts of attempted first-degree murder, police said. Police Officer Hilal Williams told CNN by e-mail early Friday evening that police officers and U.S. Marshals had apprehended Le. Authorities have not named any additional suspects in the case besides Le, Williams added. The shooting took place about 2:45 a.m. Sunday on the 700 block of Bourbon Street, a popular gathering place for tourists and revelers who pack bars and clubs between St. Peter and St. Ann streets and often spill into the streets. Authorities announced Wednesday that 21-year-old Brittany Thomas died of her wounds from that shooting. Nine others were wounded. After the incident, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu appealed for help to combat violence in his city. Specifically, he asked President Barack Obama to send a ""targeted surge team"" of federal law enforcement officers to help stem crime and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal to assign 100 state police officers to the city and rededicate a penny from the hotel/motel tax from the convention center to the city for public safety. ""These kinds of incidents will not go unanswered,"" Landrieu has said. ""These perpetrators will be brought to justice."" Earlier this week, homicide detectives interviewed a 20-year-old man in connection with the shooting -- but it wasn't Le. Justin Odom was interviewed with his attorney present, according to police. The 20-year-old was arrested and booked on unrelated traffic and shoplifting charges by police in nearby Gretna. Williams told CNN on Friday that Odom was then released.","No other suspects have been named yet, a New Orleans police officer says .

"She was called the Mexican Madonna and The Queen of Tejano Music. It's hard to believe that it's been 17 years since the singer Selena was murdered by Yolanda Saldivar. Selena, who was only 23 when she died, seemed poised for crossover success. Ironically Jennifer Lopez played Selena in a major motion picture of the same name and became a star when the movie opened at number one. In 1990 Chris Perez joined Selena's band as a guitarist.  The two soon began a clandestine relationship and were married in April, 1992. Perez has written a book about his time with Selena called, ""To Selena, With Love,"" which shows a different side to the singer. It's a deeply personal and honest book that is sure to delight Selena fans. Perez recently spoke with CNN about his marriage, the singer's death, and her legacy. CNN: Why did you decide to write this book? Chris Perez: I thought enough time had passed. I was comfortable putting some of the stories and the memories that I had of Selena to paper. I had communicated with Selena's fans on Facebook and the Internet and that had an impact on me and made me start thinking about it. Having done book signings and promoting the book the response has been incredible. Because I've been quiet for so long, the book shines a different light on Selena and the fans have been very grateful for that. She was everywhere after she passed away, she was all over the TV and then there was the trial but the memories I had were my own. I was very protective of those. With this book I was able to show her in a different light, the woman off the stage. She was full of energy. She was only 23 when it all happened and not only did she have two boutiques up and running but was designing clothes as well as doing the whole entertainment thing. She was looking to open up more boutiques and starting a perfume line. She had so much ambition and the message she would give to the kids about how important education was and to stay off drugs. I mean that was the real deal. That wasn't somebody just talking the talk. Read excerpts of the book on the In America blog . CNN: You write of how unhappy her father was when he discovered you two were a couple. Perez: I think the main reason for that was it kind of hurt his pride and his ego to find out that he was the last to know and when things got tense and things were said by him, it hurt me that he was saying it but I didn't let it get to me because I knew deep down he knew the kind of person I was. CNN: What was the worst thing he said? Perez: The worst thing he said to me was that I was like a cancer to his family. His family knew about us being together and was supportive; when he said that it was like, 'C'mon!' CNN: You guys had a rough patch in the marriage and even talked about divorce. Perez: I think what it boiled down to is that we were young. We were married and together 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We had to learn how to handle that and that was both of us. It's not like she brought up the idea and I was fighting it because honestly I was right there with her. We communicated with each other and when that came out on the table it wasn't like I hadn't thought of it myself. The more we talked about it and the more time went on, it wasn't a long time, maybe a month, we ended up patching things up and making a promise that we would never let that happen again. It was Selena's brother who actually opened her eyes. He said to her, 'You know Chris is going to move on. How are you going to feel if you see him with another woman?' And that's when she was like, 'Oh no, that ain't going to happen!' Shortly after that we patched things up. We started talking about a family. CNN: I'm not judging you or Selena's family but I never understood how you let her go and meet this woman who you already knew was trouble. Perez: Because we didn't think she was capable of doing what she did. CNN: Of course but you knew she was creepy. Perez: Yeah that's why I was with her the night before. That was the night that other woman had planned on doing everything. I usually didn't let her leave without knowing where she was going but that particular morning as fate would have it, I was asleep and she got up early to pick up some paperwork that Yolanda had said she had found. I heard Selena but I didn't get up. I didn't know she was leaving. I thought maybe she was going to hang out with my Dad who had stayed over. I didn't even think to ask and then she was gone. CNN: Did you feel guilty after? Perez: No, because I know I did all that I could. I was there at least two times where it could have happened but it didn't because I was there. Who knows even if I'd been there on March 31 what could have happened the next day or the day after? CNN: Do you think she would have found mainstream success? Perez: She definitely had the work ethic and I think that's the most important thing and of course the natural talent. You need the work ethic, the ambition, the right frame of mind, she had all of that. CNN: It's amazing how popular she still is. Perez: When she passed away the outpouring of love and support that we got from the fans shocked us. We weren't prepared for that. So I thought I knew about it but then when this book came out the response that we've gotten from that I'm actually shocked again. I didn't realize that I was putting something out there that all those fans had been waiting for. The response has been crazy.","On March 31, 17 years ago the singer Selena was murdered by Yolanda Saldivar .

"The videotaped, apparent beheading of a fourth Westerner by ISIS holds strong similarities to the prior three. In all four videos, the victims are kneeling in orange clothing on the sand and a black-clad man with a British accent speaks to Western leaders. But the taped killing of British aid worker Alan Henning differs in some ways, most notably in being much shorter, at one minute and 11 seconds. Henning speaks very briefly, for 10 seconds, and appears less composed than at least two of the others. The camera has only one angle throughout, whereas there were multiple angles in the videotaped killings of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. Foley's video ran five minutes and Sotloff's two minutes and 47 seconds. The latest tape, released Friday, opens with a short news clip on the British Parliament approving military strikes against ISIS from the Russian news agency Russia Today. Then the recording goes to a slate that reads ""Another Message to America and its Allies."" Henning speaks, apparently forced to read a script as the other three victims had. British hostage of ISIS was helping displaced Syrians, aid group says . A masked man dressed in black standing over Henning makes a reference to the third Westerner beheaded by ISIS, British aid worker David Haines. The killer says his message is for British Prime Minister David Cameron. ""The blood of David Haines was on your hands, Cameron. Alan Henning will also be slaughtered, but his blood is on the hands of the British Parliament,"" the knife-wielding killer says. In all four videos, the man wears black garb covering everything almost but his eyes. He wears a leather strap with a pistol and waves a knife in his left hand. He speaks with a British accent. ""It sounds, and he looks very much, like the same executioner that we've seen in the two previous killings,"" CNN's Nic Robertson said in an interview when ISIS released the video of the third beheading. ""That accent there is unmistakably British."" However, since the mask covers the man's mouth, it cannot be confirmed he's the one speaking. It's also not certain the man actually kills the hostages because the video goes to black before the beheading occurs. Last week, FBI Director James Comey said the United States believes it has identified the ISIS militant in the video showing Foley's killing. Comey did not publicly identify the man but FBI officials said they believe the same militant speaks in the videos showing Foley, Sotloff and Haines. Who is ISIS?

"(CNN) -- It's the question that everyone has been asking -- and now FIFA is ready to give us the answer. Just what happened on December 2, 2010 when football's world governing body FIFA decided to award the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 tournament to Qatar might be about to be revealed ... or not. The world governing body says it will publish a redacted version of Michael Garcia's report into the alleged wrongdoing surrounding the 2018 and 2022 bidding process. The move came following a two-day meeting of the organization's executive committee in Marrakech, Morroco. What will we find out? Possibly not a lot more to be honest. The report cannot be published until legal proceedings against five men facing charges from the ethics committee have been concluded. Three members of the committee -- Spain's MarÃ­a Villar Llona, Wowrawi Makudi, of Thailand and Belgium's Michel D'Hooghe -- were being investigated by Garcia for either alleged code breaches during the bidding process or for failing to comply with his probe. Harold Mayne-Nicholls, who led the inspection team visiting the candidates to host the 2018 and 2022 tournaments and former German World Cup winner Franz Beckenbauer are also facing charges from the FIFA ethics committee which both men have denied. Blatter also confirmed that Garcia has been replaced by his deputy, Cornel BorbÃ©ly, who he describes as ""an outstanding lawyer."" What has been the hold up? FIFA had always maintained that it could not publish the full report, compiled by independent investigator Michael Garcia, because it would break witness confidentiality. But it turned out that not everybody agreed -- and neither did Domenico Scala, FIFA's head of compliance. Michel Platini, the president of European football's governing body UEFA, and Sunil Gulati, the head of U.S. Soccer had both been advocates of publishing the report. Several leading figures such as vice-president Jim Boyce, who told British Newspaper The Times that FIFA must take this ""massive"" opportunity to restore the public's trust in the organization. The report created tensions within the football world when Garcia said it should be published last September. FIFA didn't like that at all; his request was rejected and it came close to disciplining the New York lawyer for speaking out, according to Garcia. Instead, last month, Hans-Joachim Eckert, a FIFA judge, published a 42-page summary of the report -- only for Garcia to respond immediately by claiming the German's publication contained ""numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations."" Eckert's summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing. When Garcia appealed against Eckert's findings he was told his complaint was inadmissible. That was a decision which prompted the U.S. attorney to quit his role and launch a fierce attack on FIFA, accusing it of a ""lack of leadership."" Aside from the politics, the World Cup is big business. According to Forbes, FIFA made $2 billion off the back of the 2014 tournament in Brazil. Not bad for a not-for-profit organization. Who is Michael Garcia? Garcia was the man chosen by FIFA to head up the investigation into alleged corruption during the World Cup bidding process. He worked as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York between 2005 and 2008 on some of the highest profile cases in the city. When he took on the role of FIFA's independent investigator in July 2012 he promised to get to the bottom of what had happened. Over 19 months, he compiled a report examining each of the bidding teams and speaking to witnesses from across the world of football. His 430-page report was delivered in September and given to Eckert to read. Why did he resign? Garcia quit on the eve of the meeting in Marrakech and didn't go quietly. In a statement issued just 24 hours after his appeal was rejected, Garcia made public his frustration. ""It now appears that, at least for the foreseeable future, the Eckert Decision will stand as the final word on the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bidding process,"" he said. ""No independent governance committee, investigator, or arbitration panel can change the culture of an organization."" FIFA president Sepp Blatter said he was surprised by Garcia's resignation but that the ""work of the Ethics Committee will nonetheless continue."" What is going on at FIFA? FIFA has taken a battering in the press -- particularly the British press -- following its failure to deal with the furor surrounding the Garcia report. Football fans are growing tired of the body's refusal to reform, while former players such as England's Gary Lineker have taken to Twitter to vent their frustration. Sponsors such as Visa and Coca-Cola have both issued statements criticizing FIFA over its lack of transparency, while Sony will not be renewing its partnership with the organization when its endorsement deal ends in the near future. There is still widespread skepticism at the way Russia and Qatar won the rights to host the next World Cup even though both were cleared of any wrongdoing and deny any allegations of wrongdoing. Meanwhile Blatter, the president who is still going strong at the age of 78, is expected to stand for a fifth term as head of FIFA. That plan has angered both UEFA and the English Football Association, which have said is time for the Swiss to stand down. Blatter faces little competition to retain his presidency and is already assured of support from Asia, Africa and South America. Jerome Champagne, the only man to have openly declared his candidacy, is unlikely to trouble Blatter at the polls. Will the World Cup still be held in Qatar? It looks likely at the moment, despite huge protests over the Gulf State's human rights record and the allegations of corruption which surrounded the bid, that Qatar will keep the tournament. Blatter certainly showed no sign of objecting, insisting that FIFA will not revisit the 2018 and 2022 vote. According to a report by DLA Piper and confirmed by the government, 964 workers from Bangladesh, India and Nepal died while living and working in the country in 2012 and 2013. The International Trade Union Confederation has estimated that 4,000 workers could die while working on projects by the time the 2022 World Cup begins. The Qatari government says there are more than over 1.4 million foreign workers currently plying their trade in the country and conditions are improving. According to the Qatar Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy, the organization responsible for the World Cup, huge progress has been made to improve the lives of migrant workers. It says that it ""is committed to improving labor conditions for workers employed on 2022 FIFA World Cup projects and the Workers' Welfare Committee works to achieve the highest possible standards for those employed on its projects -- this not only includes construction workers, but also workers of service suppliers."" What next? All eyes will remain firmly on Blatter as we enter 2015 and the FIFA presidential contest which will be held in May. The report is unlikely to be published any time soon given the legal constraints. More is likely to be revealed in the coming weeks but there are other avenues which could bring more revelations. The FBI is currently running an inquiry into whether there was any wrongdoing, while the Serious Fraud Office in the United Kingdom is doing similar work. For now thought, it's a case of wait and see.","FIFA says it will publish Garcia report with redactions .

"It's as simple as making eye contact and flashing a smile or knowing when to back off and stop talking so much. Social cues. Body language. Basic conversation. They make up the toolkit for meeting new people. But for those whose romantic realm is constructed entirely through social media and online dating, these intuitions might be eroding away. ""People have an easier time picking out an emoticon to display the emotion they are feeling rather than actually showing it on their face,"" Blake Eastman, body language expert and founder of The Nonverbal Group, said. ""Unfortunately, for the past 10 years, people have been really confident behind the computer keyboard, but then you see them in person and things are very different."" Dating coach and author Adam LoDolce has a simple solution: meet people organically. But the paralyzing fear of rejection often can make us long for the distance technology offers. To help people overcome the anxiety of approaching someone new, LoDolce made a 45-minute film including his advice: ""Go Talk to Her."" Like Eastman, he believes that people are killing off social skills by hiding behind a glowing screen of information that offers no chemistry. ""People want to go back to the day where you're sitting at a coffee shop, make eye contact and there is this mysterious moment where you don't know each other,"" LoDolce said. ""Online dating is one tool in the tool kit, but I think we as a society are seeing that there is still a real way to meet people."" How technology has changed romance . Anti-social media . Users mistake social media for being social. It isn't, Eastman said. Instead it creates a group of people that are highly connected online but feel socially isolated. ""We feel that we don't need to look people in the eyes to communicate anymore -- a keystroke has replaced that look,"" Eastman said. ""But at the end of the day, we're designed for human contact, not a computer screen."" Online daters and social media users easily fall into a new way of communicating. Instead of the rules and social norms used in face-to-face meeting, they create ones for digital interfacing. But the rules are looser and harder to enforce, Patricia Wallace, psychologist and author of ""The Psychology of the Internet,"" said. Psychologists highlight pitfalls of online dating . ""When you're in front of a computer or an iPad, you're not interacting with a human face,"" Wallace said. ""All of the millennia of evolution that helped us learn how to read all of the nuances to do that choreography of conversation aren't there."" Social media also allows ""loose ties"" with acquaintances and low-risk ways of communicating. The fear of rejection when someone doesn't answer a Facebook message lacks the impact of an ignored phone call, according to Wallace. But a general lack of satisfaction is perhaps the most noticeable effect of online dating. ""Online dating is like a buffet,"" Marni Battista, founder and CEO of Dating with Dignity, said. ""People are ruling out more than they're ruling in. After a date, they go home, get online and look for someone else. We're in this digital instant gratification age, and there is no patience for the dating process."" The upside of online dating: Always a funny story to tell . Bucking the standard . Unfortunately, offline dating has lost some of its charm. Eastman believes that dates are too ""standardized,"" especially in restaurants. A table in between two people -- staring at one another -- becomes an interview with adversarial posturing, he said. Keep the date moving along, stopping at a few places that will create an experience, which builds memories and intimacy, Eastman recommends. Shifting gender roles are also contributing to the confusion experienced on first dates. ""Men are almost afraid of being in the role of pursuing because they don't want to be perceived as creepy,"" Battista said. ""And successful, independent women still want men to step up. As a result, it's almost like a standoff."" Rejection, the kind that manifested itself in the awkward insecurities of middle school and survived maturity, remains the biggest enemy of dating success, LoDolce said. ""People think that being rejected is going to be the worst moment of their life,"" LoDolce said. ""This does not have to be the end of the world."" LoDolce, Eastman and Battista all coach clients in maneuvering the dating world. Here are some of their words of advice, especially for people re-entering offline dating: . Reach a social peak . Like preparing for a sprint, warm up to a peak social state when you're going out, day or night. It makes you the person in the room that everyone wants to meet. ""When we're nervous, we give off a bland, shy, introverted vibe with bad body language,"" LoDolce said. ""Learn how to talk to new people -- fake it until you make it, smile as if you won the lottery, bring the energy. People remember the best five percent and the worst five percent of what you say, the rest is up to body language."" Laughing, smiling and talking all contribute to facial animation, something we gravitate toward as human beings. It shows that a person is listening and interested. Movement and clear communication are signs of a good date, Eastman said. Online dating and a formula for love . Be self-confident and genuine . ""What people really need is to be in that place of self-love and confidence, being authentic to who they are,"" Battista said. ""Then you have a different energy out in the world -- you see yourself as a dater and on the market, and that confidence is attractive."" When approaching someone, be open, honest and genuine -- it creates an instant connection. If you think someone is stunning and you'll kick yourself later if you don't let them know, tell them, LoDolce said. Orient yourself . Ever stand in line at Starbucks and hear someone mention a common interest? Strike up a conversation, instead of sticking your nose in your phone. Take opportunities to practice being social everywhere. ""Understand when someone is orienting towards you -- it's the best time to say something to them,"" Eastman said. ""If we put ourselves out there for a little bit, it can be incredibly powerful in terms of what we get in return."" Young women dating even younger men . Take your time . One of the biggest mistakes people make is rushing into something and falling in love with who they want a person to be, and not the person, Battista said. ""Intimacy comes from slowly but surely discovering things about someone you never knew until you went through this phase of slow discovery,"" LoDolce said. Many of these small discoveries can happen only in person, these dating experts say, so perhaps it's time to close the laptop and take a walk.","Some dating experts say online dating has sapped our social skills .
Approaching people and starting conversations can be hard if you're not used to it .

"When Amanda Knox was convicted again on Thursday, Americans reacted with bafflement. The appeal was the third round through Italy's grinding, multi-level legal system, with its numerous checks and balances.  But the saga is also confusing because, while the crime is simple, the case built around it is a grand spectacle combining aspects of national pride, sexist archetypes and race. Knox and her co-defendant, Raffaele Sollecito, were first convicted by a jury in 2009 for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher in 2007.  An appellate judge overturned the conviction in 2011 and Knox returned to the United States after four years in jail. The prosecutor then appealed the acquittal to the Italian Supreme Court, which sent the case to the new appellate panel that reinstated the conviction. It isn't over yet. The defendants will now appeal and the case eventually could be returned to another appellate panel for yet another review. I spent two years researching and writing a book about the Knox case, living in Perugia, attending the trial, interviewing every lawyer involved in the case, reviewing thousands of pages of police documents and court transcripts, interviewing forensic police, coroners, the principals of the case, their family members and associates. Americans like me who believe the case against Knox and her then-boyfriend is fatally flawed have been accused of disliking Italy or disrespecting its judicial system. But what has happened in the Amanda Knox case is not an Italian problem. When prosecutors make mistakes anywhere in the world, they don't like to admit it. It takes an exceptionally brave and wise ""Solomon"" to reframe a case after arresting the wrong people. The latest Italian proceeding did not involve any new evidence and, sadly, didn't shed any new light on the crime. There is still no proof that Amanda Knox was in the bedroom where someone stabbed Meredith Kercher. The DNA and fingerprint evidence is still entirely linked to a man named Rudy Guede, who is serving a 16-year jail sentence for the murder -- shortened thanks to testimony that put Amanda Knox on the crime scene. After he arrested them, the trial prosecutor proposed that the motive was a post-Halloween ritualistic sex game. But when authorities soon realized the DNA and fingerprints in the murder room belonged to neither Knox nor Sollecito, rather than reframing their case, the small town prosecutors and police in the glare of international media dug in their heels. In the latest proceeding, a new prosecutor abandoned the sex game motive but suggested Knox murdered Kercher after an altercation over Knox's poor hygiene and sloppy housekeeping. In other words, out with Satan and in with the dirty laundry. With no hard evidence and no credible motive, spectators around the world are right to wonder what's going on in these Italian courtrooms. Rudy Guede has never denied watching Meredith Kercher bleed to death, and he left a bloody handprint in the victim's blood on her wall. According to testimony from Italian forensic police, his DNA was inside the victim—although it was not clear whether there was a sexual assault. In his prison writings and in his testimony at his appeal, he talked of how difficult it was for him to get the image of the blood that flowed from Meredith out of his head. Did this garish confession shock the Perugian authorities and courthouse press corps into trying to ascertain just who and what this young man was? On the contrary, he apparently elicited mercy, and had his sentence cut in half. He may well be walking free before the Knox case is settled. In his first comments on the case, before he was captured, Guede was surreptitiously recorded by Perugia police in a Skype conversation with a friend, according to police wiretap transcripts in the trial record, saying that Knox had nothing to do with it. But as soon as he was connected with a defense lawyer, he started to change his story. It's a trope of the case that Knox (and Sollecito) had a P.R. machine, vast amounts of money and great legal defense, while Guede was legally under-served.  In fact, his attorney was one of the busiest criminal defense lawyers in Perugia, well-connected with the prosecution, with a career behind him handling hundreds if not thousands of local crimes, often involving drugs and violence. Prosecutors' reluctance to deeply investigate Guede is understandable; they don't want to know.  But Guede may be the most interesting character in the story. Born in Ivory Coast, brought to Italy at age 5, he is more Italian than most immigrants, but, like other immigrants, he is legally just a guest in the homogenous country, not a citizen, required to report to the authorities annually (which was why his fingerprints were on file in Perugia). In the months before the Kercher murder, Guede was broke and showing signs of mental illness, and was involved in three and possibly more home invasions, according to police reports, trial testimony and interviews with victims. His apparent modus operandi was to break into what he thought were empty houses and make himself at home. A few weeks before the Kercher murder, someone broke into a Perugia law office through a second floor window, according to trial testimony from the lawyer who practiced there, turned up the heat, rearranged small trinkets, drank an orange soda from the refrigerator and appeared to have slept on the couch before making off with a laptop. At a nursery school in Milan a week later, director Maria Antonietta Salvadori Del Prato, walked in on a Saturday and found Guede sitting at her desk, she told me in an interview. She called police. They found the stolen laptop and a knife in his pack. Del Prato suspected he might have gotten a key to the nursery school from one of her employees who frequented the Milan club scene. Del Prato told me she believed he spent a night on the children's cots and cooked a pot of pasta in the kitchen, then placed it in little bowls around the room. From that interview and many more, I pieced together a picture of a young man who seemed to be acting out some sort of fantasy of a home, a fantasy that perhaps abruptly cracked when Meredith Kercher came home unexpectedly while he was burgling her house,  and unwittingly locked herself into the house with him.  (Guede has maintained ""whoever committed this terrible crime is still free."") I believe one reason for the lack of interest in this young man is that a man killing a woman is mundane and boring, compared with the more titillating image of women fighting and  killing each other. The other reason, sadly, is a kind of reverse racism. He's black, and innocent black men are far too often railroaded in white systems, Italian and American. To suggest that this young man might have been the lone killer has a taint of political incorrectness. Male violence against women is a major public health problem worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. In the end, in this case, it appears that the commonness of the crime is what the Italian prosecutors—and many others--refuse to accept, searching for something more interesting and unique, in an elaborate, headline-grabbing crackpot theory that, they unfortunately still cannot relinquish. Remove the racial aspect, forget national pride and whether you ""like"" Amanda Knox, and we can see that this simple tragedy is all too routine.","Nina Burleigh: Guilty verdict-- again--for Amanda Knox baffles Americans for good reason .

"Washington (CNN)Let's get the news out of the way to begin with. There isn't any news on whether Mitt Romney is going to run for president again. That isn't to say there aren't those who want him to run. CNN's Gloria Borger reports advisers are rooting for him to consider it. He's not sold on the idea. Regardless of what goes on behind closed doors, what we do know for sure is he has said he won't do it. So why does he keep creeping his way into headlines and onto campaign stages? He's 67, just a year older than Hillary Clinton, and he appears to continue to be in great shape. Both Romney and Clinton would be about the same age as Ronald Reagan was when he was first inaugurated. Age probably isn't an issue. Will Romney take the plunge again? So herewith, three reasons Mitt Romney is going to run for president: . 1. He's doing interviews with the New York Times: In a new profile published this week in the New York Times Magazine, Romney is asked about running for president again. He makes a joke about a scene in the movie ""Dumb and Dumber"" when Jim Carrey, asking a woman if she's interested in him, is told his chances are 1 in a million. ""So there's a chance?"" Carrey's character says in the movie. ""There's a chance,"" Romney told the New York Times, apparently while doing a Jim Carrey impression. But he didn't sound 1 in a million dismissive when he added: ""We've got a lot of people looking at the race.  We'll see what happens."" This latest version of ""no"" is a lot different than the flatter, more definitive ""nos"" he was giving not too long ago. The Washington Post examined all the different ways Romney has said ""No"" and discovered a softening of the resolve. 2. He won't go away: Romney isn't just on the campaign trail for Republicans in 2014, he's on the campaign trail with regularity. He's helping candidates large and small and he's helping the party raise money. He's traveling to Florida and New Jersey and he's helping out Scott Brown in New Hampshire. These are not the activities of a man who is done with public life. This is a man who is still in demand from his party and still wants to contribute. But as Julie Pace of the Associated Press said on CNN's ""New Day"" Tuesday, it's not clear if he's in so demand by Republicans because he is their top star or because no one has stepped into the void in a party with no clear leader. 3. He was right: Okay, whether he was actually right or not is and will remain the matter of some dispute, just like the campaign itself. But in the midst of a tough second term for President Barack Obama, Romney can point to issues as varied as terror, Detroit and tensions with Russia and argue that what he said on the campaign trail back in 2012 now seems prescient. How to campaign without campaigning . But for every reason Romney would run, there is an equally convincing reason he won't. Here are four: . 1. The 47% is still there: It was the turning point in the presidential campaign when Romney spoke the truth that about 47% of Americans were going to vote against him no matter what. Who knows if the exact number is still 47%, but it is about half the country. There's no doubt Americans have some buyer's remorse with Obama in his second term. A CNN/ORC poll in July found that 53% of Americans would support Mitt Romney against Obama in a hypothetical match-up. Of course, Obama can't run again. In that same poll, 55% would have supported Clinton over 42% for Romney. Her numbers have settled since then, but the point remains. Romney looks good to Americans in hindsight. He might look different if he actually started running again. 2. Running for president is hard: It's really hard to give up your life and spend most of your time flying across the country, sleeping in hotels and fund-raising. The rest of the time you spend giving speeches and glad-handing. The Netflix documentary ""Mitt,"" released earlier this year, did a good job of documenting that toll. You could see it on the exhausted face of his wife, Ann, and on the faces of his children. We're not privy to private Romney family discussions, but you've got to wonder if he would want to start up the family machine again. 3. He's run and lost twice already: In that Netflix documentary, Romney put it well. ""I have looked at what happens to anybody in this country who loses as the nominee of their party,"" he says. ""They become a loser for life"" and are ""brutalized"" by the public. Romney has now lived that reality. A third run would be almost unprecedented. As the son of a man who ran for president and having now done it twice himself, Romney must be keenly aware of legacy. A win would instantly erase all stigma from his previous losses. A third straight loss would make his name synonymous with defeat. 4. He'd have a primary: Romney lost the crowded 2008 primary and won the crowded primary in 2012. There's no question he'd have to win another crowded primary in 2016. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul are all seriously considering runs. Each of those men has a compelling campaign story. Romney would have to convince Americans to choose him over one of these new guys who hasn't had a chance yet. That could end up being a tough argument to make. Chris Christie builds profile as he eyes 2016 presidential run .","Mitt Romney has said he won't run for president again .
But that hasn't tamped down 2016 speculation .

"A federal judge approved Monday a preliminary settlement in a class action lawsuit filed by thousands of former NFL players against the National Football League. The settlement will provide eligible retired players with baseline neurological exams and include monetary awards for diagnoses of ALS, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and early and moderate dementia. There is no cap on the amount of funds available to pay these monetary awards and all valid claims will be paid in full for 65 years. ""This is an extraordinary settlement for retired NFL players and their families -- from those who suffer with neuro-cognitive illnesses today, to those who are currently healthy but fear they may develop symptoms decades into the future,"" said the two lead attorneys for the players, Christopher Seeger and Sol Weiss. The settlement also makes provisions for family members of some living and deceased players. ""We are grateful to Judge (Anita) Brody for her guidance and her thoughtful analysis of the issues as reflected in the comprehensive opinion she issued today,"" said NFL Senior Vice President Anastasia Danias. Initially there was a $765 million figure on the settlement with $675 million capped. The judge declined in January to approve the deal, saying she was concerned about the amount of money. But the latest agreement reached two weeks ago eliminated a maximum for the monetary award fund. The NFL will use $75 million for medical tests to help determine if any retired players have brain damage and for treatment. The retired players could receive between $1.5 million and $5 million depending on their age and the severity of their cognitive impairment. Players with less than five years of experience will receive smaller awards. The league could pay up to $112.5 million in legal fees, according to the settlement. About 5,000 former players are involved in the class action but as many as 20,000 might be eligible. Current NFL players are not included in the agreement. A hearing to assess the fairness of the outcome of the case is scheduled for November 19. The judge will issue her final ruling after that and players can then begin to register for benefits. They will have two years to do so.","About 5,000 former players have sued the NFL over concussion issues .

"Just hours before the 2012 NFL season kicks off, a new study suggests that professional football players are three times more likely to have neurodegenerative diseases than the general population. When researchers specifically looked at Alzheimer's disease and ALS -- amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease -- that risk increased to four times greater than the rest of us. The study, published Wednesday in the medical journal Neurology, surveyed nearly 3,500 retired NFL players who were in the league between 1959 and 1988. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, a division of the Centers for Disease Control, had been following this group of players since the early '90s, when the NFL asked the institute to evaluate them for their risk of cardiovascular disease. This time, the authors decided to look at the neurological outcomes of the players by specifically evaluating the autopsies of 334 players. ""We looked at all the death certificates, and Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and ALS had significant contribution to the death,"" according to study co-author Everett Lehman. When tallying those specific diseases, the authors found that among the 334 players, seven had died from Alzheimer's and another seven with ALS. Three players had died with Parkinson's disease, but the authors didn't find that to be significant when compared with the larger population. The average age of the players who had died was 57. Those numbers may seem small, but as Lehman explains, ""these are generally rare diseases, especially at the younger age. Even when looking at the general population, you're generally going to have small numbers."" However, the numbers, although small, were still considered statistically significant, according to Lehman, an epidemiologist at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. More than 2,000 former professional football players are currently suing the NFL, claiming that the league ""downplayed and misrepresented the issues and misled players concerning the risks associated with concussions."" The NFL has repeatedly stated that player safety is a priority and that ""any allegation that the NFL intentionally sought to mislead players has no merit."" Ohio State linebacker choosing career over concussions . While the study published Wednesday did not examine players' concussion history of the players, researchers did investigate whether the position played made a difference. The study authors found that players in speed positions like wide receivers and running backs were three times more likely to develop neurodegenerative disease than players in non-speed or lineman positions. ""There's a lot of velocity,"" Lehman said. However, ""We have to be very careful and note that we don't know if this is a result of concussions,"" says Jeffrey Kutcher, associate professor of neurology at the University of Michigan. ""Are these increased risks because of exposure to contact? In their words, there's an assumption that there is causality there. I think a general lifestyle of playing sport at a competitive level is abusive. It's hard to do physically and mentally."" In addition, genetics and family history may also be factors for dementia and Alzheimer's but weren't accounted for in the study. Studies have linked repeated concussions in football players to chronic traumatic encephelopathy, a neurodegenerative disease with Alzheimer's-like symptoms. Those symptoms can include depression, memory loss and mood swings. Former Chicago Bears safety David Duerson, who committed suicide, was diagnosed with CTE postmortem. It can be diagnosed only after death. Player's text: Send my brain to NFL research bank . Research on CTE shows commonalities with ALS and Alzheimer's, and examining the neurodegenerative diseases might be the best way to look at it, Lehman said. ""CTE maybe one of the outcomes or causes, but we just can't tell."" Dr. Julian Bailes, co-director of the NorthShore Neurological Institute and chair of the Pop Warner Medical Advisory Board, said, ""A study like this is very limited in its scope and how deep they can dig down. It's merely an observation in reporting in cause and death, and you can only draw so much -- but it supports in general a trend that we've seen, that neurodegenerative disease impacts football players."" Dr. Bob Stern, a professor of neurology and neurosurgery at Boston University, agrees. ""In general, it provides further evidence that repetitive brain trauma is associated with the development of neurodegenerative disease, like CTE, later in life,"" he said. Asked about the new study, the NFL said in a statement: ""Well before this study was released, the NFL took significant steps to address head injuries in football, provide medical and financial assistance to our retired players, and raise awareness of the most effective ways to prevent, manage and treat concussions."" The league announced Wednesday that it had awarded a $30 million unrestricted grant to the National Institutes of Health to support research into CTE, concussion management and treatment, as well as examining the relationship between traumatic brain injuries and late-life neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's.","NFL players more likely to develop Alzheimer's, ALS than general population .

"With seemingly every kid in America glued most waking hours to a glowing digital device, you might expect their parents to be worried about the potentially harmful effects of all that screen time. Turns out, not so much. The majority of parents in the United States are largely unconcerned about their young children's media use, according to a Northwestern University study released Tuesday. This despite 70% of parents saying that smartphones and tablets -- so-called ""digital babysitters"" used to appease bored or fussy kids -- don't make parenting any easier. Based on a nationally representative survey of more than 2,300 parents of children up to 8 years old, the study ""reveals a generational shift in parental attitudes about technology's role in young children's lives,"" said Ellen Wartella, director of Northwestern's Center on Media and Human Development and lead author of the report. An overwhelming majority (78%) of parents say their children's media use is not a source of family conflict, while 59% say they are not worried about their children becoming addicted to phones, tablet computers or gaming devices. The study found that 55% of parents are ""not too"" or ""not at all"" concerned about their children's media use, compared to 30% who are concerned. The study, ""Parenting in the Age of Digital Technology,"" also challenges two key assumptions about media and parenting: First, that smartphones and tablets have become today's ""go-to"" parenting tools. Instead, parents say they are more likely to turn to toys or activities (88%), books (79%), or TV (78%) when trying to keep their children occupied. Of those with smartphones or tablets, 37% say they are very or somewhat likely to turn to those devices. Even when trying to calm an upset child, parents say they are still more likely to turn to a toy or activity (65%) or to a book (58%) than to a media device. Second, the survey challenged the notion that the dominant pattern in most households is children pleading for screen time while parents try to limit it. ""Today's parents (of young children) grew up with technology as a central part of their lives, so they think about it differently than earlier generations of parents,"" said Northwestern's Wartella in a press release. ""Instead of a battle with kids on one side and parents on the other, the use of media and technology has become a family affair."" The impact of heavy media and technology use on kids' social, emotional and cognitive development is only beginning to be studied, although some early research suggests the Internet may actually be changing how our brains work. Among the other findings of the report: . -- With the exception of video games, parents think more positively than negatively about the impact of media (TV, computers and mobile devices) on children's reading and math skills and their creativity. -- Parents' most consistent concern about digital media is their negative impact on children's physical activity. -- Parents view video games more negatively than TV, computers or mobile devices. Parents rated video games as more likely to have a negative effect on children's academic skills, attention span, creativity, social skills, behavior and sleep than any other medium. -- Parents view computers as less harmful to their kids than TV or mobile devices.

"O.J. Simpson is staying behind bars. The former football star and media celebrity -- who some know best for his having stood trial in the killing of his ex-wife -- on Tuesday lost his latest legal fight, as a Nevada judge upheld his conviction on kidnapping, armed robbery and other charges. Simpson's legal team's bid, which followed an unsuccessful ""direct appeal,"" asked for a new trial on 22 specific grounds related to his trial and appeal. But they didn't sway Clark County Judge Linda Marie Bell, who sided against Simpson point-by-point-by-point. ""Given the overwhelming amount of evidence,"" Bell wrote, ""neither the errors in this case, nor the errors collectively, cause this court to question the validity of Mr. Simpson's conviction."" His current legal team expressed dissatisfaction with the ruling. ""We're shocked and disappointed,"" said Patricia Palm, one of his attorneys. ""We're convinced the law provides relief for Mr. Simpson."" The Heisman Trophy winner, as college football best player, and Pro Football Hall of Fame member had starred as a TV commentator, in commercials and in movies after his retirement from the sport. Simpson pleads with Nevada parole board to cut prison term . Yet he found himself accused of murder in 1994, following the killing of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald Goldman. After a lengthy, high-profile trial, a jury acquitted him in that case. But Simpson's life hardly returned to normal. He lost a civil trial brought against him in the deaths, and was ordered to pay millions in punitive damages -- including $33 million to Goldman's estate, according to Tuesday's ruling. Years of legal fights ensued; by 2007, the Goldman and Brown families had yet to collect any money from Simpson, according to their lawyers. That September, Simpson and several others went into a Las Vegas hotel room to get sports memorabilia Simpson said belonged to him. The six men confronted the dealers Bruce Fromong and Al Beardsley, brandishing weapons, but not firing them. Simpson, 66, insisted he was going after what was rightfully his, saying he regrets only bringing along men ""who I didn't know and one I didn't trust."" The jury didn't trust his side's arguments, finding Simpson guilty on 12 counts, including kidnapping and armed robbery. He was sentenced to up to 33 years in prison. A parole board partly reduced his sentence early this year, though he still has at least four more years to serve. This latest appeal attempted to throw out the conviction for several reasons, most of them related to his defense team. Simpson claimed his one-time lawyer, Yale Galanter, had a conflict of interest in the case, his lawyers improperly advised him not to testify, didn't tell him of prosecutors' plea offer and didn't present ""voluntary intoxication"" as a defense. One of the grounds was particularly sweeping, with Simpson asserting that his attorneys didn't properly address ""judicial misconduct, prosecutorial misconduct and the admission of prejudicial evidence,"" before citing several specific instances. But as with each of the other claims, Bell didn't accept his arguments. ""Mr. Simpson has failed to provide any evidence supporting his claim for ineffective assistance of trial counsel,"" she wrote about this matter, specifically. ""Consequently this claim is denied.""

"Mitt Romney and Hillary Clinton are back on the campaign trail. Romney was in Kentucky on Thursday stumping for Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell while Clinton flew to Florida to campaign for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist. The trips come amid intense speculation over how the 2016 presidential ticket might shape up. While it's unlikely Romney will run, he's leaving the door open a tiny crack to a third campaign. Meanwhile, of course, everyone is watching Clinton for signs that she might join the race -- and she's doing little to discourage the attention. The 2016 contest is far from a lock. But if the race came down to two leaders who have already run for president, would there be any surprises? Luckily, with two figures who have spent so many years in the public view, we have an idea of what a Romney-Clinton match up might look like.  Here are some areas that would be interesting to watch: . Russia . Critics have faulted Clinton for failing as secretary of state to foresee growing tensions between the U.S. and Russia. As secretary, Clinton famously offered her Russian counterpart a ""reset"" button meant to show the two countries were looking to cooperate more. But President Putin's incursion into Ukraine and his support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during the country's bloody civil war, both of which occurred after Clinton stepped down, have chilled the relationship Clinton hoped would thaw. Enter Romney, who was mocked after calling Russia the United States' ""number one geopolitical foe"" during an interview with CNN in 2012. At the time, Clinton called his remarks ""dated."" Romney struck back in an interview with Fox this summer, calling Clinton's reset button ""one of the most embarrassing incidents in American foreign policy."" Tracy Sefl, a Democratic strategist who worked on Clinton's 2008 effort, underlined the former secretary of state's real world foreign policy experience. ""As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton has a foreign policy record,"" Sefl said. ""I'm not entirely sure what Mitt Romney has besides campaign positions."" What about gaffes? Romney famously made his 2012 effort more difficult with a series of inopportune remarks that Democrats used to paint him as out-of-touch. From the ""couple of Cadillacs"" he said his wife owned, to the 47 percent of Americans he said were dependent on government, to his offhand remark that ""I like being able to fire people"" who provide bad service, Romney handed opponents an opening. But while promoting her book ""Hard Choices"" this summer, Clinton made some missteps of her own. The former first lady said she and her husband were ""dead broke"" when they left the White House in 2001. Earlier this year, she told an audience in New Orleans that she had not driven a car since 1996 because of Secret Service concerns. Were Romney to run again, Clinton's stumbles might help inoculate him against the same criticism he faced over his wealth during his two previous campaigns. A former Romney aide suggested Romney's more recent campaign trail experience would make him more comfortable on the stump. ""She's rusty,"" former Romney 2012 spokesman Ryan Williams said of Clinton. ""Gov. Romney has been through two campaigns at this point. He's been out on the campaign trail campaigning for midterm candidates. She certainly would have a steeper learning curve."" Clinton has granted dozens of press interviews and given many speeches to public and private groups. But she hasn't crisscrossed the country campaigning with midterm candidates like Romney. That potential advantage could extend to presidential debates. Romney shot up in the polls after surprising President Obama in their first one-on-one debate in October 2012. Clinton hasn't gone through that grueling experience since 2008. But CNN Senior Political Analyst and National Journal Editorial Director Ron Brownstein said Romney would be hard pressed to shake the sense of some voters that he doesn't understand them. ""It was really about him embodying the guy who came to your town and shut down the plant. I still think that's there,"" Brownstein said. ""I don't think Romney gets away from that no matter who he's running against."" Women . In 2008, Clinton's presidential campaign sparked tremendous enthusiasm among women voters and put 18 million cracks in the ""highest, hardest glass ceiling."" She continued her work on issues affecting women and girls at the State Department and through her family's philanthropic arm, the Clinton Foundation. Romney struggled with women voters in 2012, with 55% of women supporting President Obama. Clinton has the potential to grow Democratic support even among women who supported Romney during the last election. ""She is just extremely well positioned to exploit the demographic vulnerabilities of the Republican Party,"" Brownstein said, pointing to GOP support for the Hobby Lobby case on employer funded birth control and state level funding cuts for Planned Parenthood programs. Clinton supporters point to her focus in public remarks on pocketbook issues such as equal pay and affordable childcare, saying those issues have already resonated with voters. ""I fail to see anyone in the GOP that has either articulated an alternative or that embodies remotely the same amount of excitement and enthusiasm as Hillary does today,"" Sefl said. Message . Recent public remarks from Romney and Clinton give a few hints at how they might try to appeal to voters should they launch a presidential campaign. Clinton has spoken about creating more opportunities for women and girls at a variety of public and political events, in what some analysts have heard as a possible campaign theme. ""Don't let anyone dismiss what you're doing here today as women's work,"" Clinton told an audience at the Democratic Women's Leadership Forum in Washington, D.C. in September. ""We're here proud Democratic women and proud Democratic men, to stand up not just ourselves, not just for women but for all our people - for our families, our communities and our country."" Clinton also would enjoy the support and enthusiasm of a handful of outside political groups like the super PAC Ready For Hillary that have sprouted up purely to fuel her potential candidacy. As for Romney, his message could be something like: ""having second (or third) thoughts now?"" On that theme, he told an audience in Colorado this week that President Obama should have taken the terrorist group ISIS more seriously earlier. ""For the president to say, 'Gee, we underestimated ISIS' suggests he wasn't looking at the kinds of ideas that were being brought to him,"" Romney said. ""I guess he was busy doing other things -- vacations, golf, fundraising. He just hasn't done the job he promised to do."" A CNN/ORC poll from July found that 53% of Americans would support Romney over President Obama if they could vote again today. (In a hypothetical match up with Clinton, however, 55% would have supported Clinton, with 42% for Romney.) Romney supporters argue the former candidate seemed prescient on a variety of issues. ""He brings a proven track record of being forward thinking and having the ability to recognize problems and threats before they become a disaster,"" Williams, his former spokesman, said. But while the upcoming presidential election may center on change, both Clinton and Romney could find themselves talking a lot about their experience. ""You've also got to have people who've actually run something,"" Romney told Fox News in September. ""I don't think Hillary Clinton has that experience.""","Mitt Romney and Hillary Clinton both spent Thursday campaigning .
Romney has left the door open to another presidential bid .

"In ""The Obamas,"" the new book causing a stir with its speculation about the extent of the first lady's political influence, author Jodi Kantor recounts an anecdote: A young schoolgirl tells Michelle Obama that she hopes to someday become a president's wife herself one day. ""Doesn't pay well,"" Mrs. Obama wittily cracks. Truth be told, pay is the least of the drawbacks of being a first lady. The unelected, unaccountable and unofficial position has been challenging presidential spouses for more than two centuries now. I've spent years researching and interviewing first ladies, but it was Hillary Clinton who best crystallized for me the essential reality of what it means to be first lady: ""Who I really am as a person is ultimately less important to the public than what they want me to represent as a persona."" This was as true for mental health care reform advocate Rosalynn Carter in the 1970s as it was for the happy hostess Julia Grant a century earlier. Michelle Obama articulated her own frustration with this the other day, for seeming, she said, to have been cast as ""some kind of angry black woman."" There is truth in Mrs. Obama's observation; her historic status as the first African-American first lady has made her at times a target for unfair stereotype and very ugly treatment. But casting the first lady as ""the other"" -- that is, outside the concept of the Anglo-Saxon as acceptably ""American"" -- has a long history.  Almost a century ago, when the press widely reported that Edith Wilson was from the ""Red Bolling family,"" as the great-great-great-great-great-great-great-granddaughter of Princess Pocahontas, even serious journalists ignored the fact that it meant only one of her 512 ninth-generation ancestors was a Native American. Instead, it prompted members of the public to send her Native American items like a beaded belt and write to government officials warning that it was illegal for the first lady to be served alcohol. As late as the 1960 election, when the Catholicism of Democratic presidential candidate John F. Kennedy finally broke through the nation's historic anti-papist sentiment, the campaign of his opponent, Richard Nixon, soft-pedaled his wife's ethnic and religious background. Not only was Pat Nixon the daughter of a German immigrant mother, but also of an Irish Catholic father. Kennedy's campaign may not have been able to conceal that Jacqueline Kennedy was Catholic too, but at least her ""Bouvier"" maiden name offered legitimate exotic cover for the larger reality of her background: She had only one French paternal great-grandparent, and her ""Lee of Virginia"" mother was not of the famous blue-blood clan, but rather had briefly lived in the Old Dominion for a college term and was as Irish as the Kennedys. Mamie Eisenhower? Despite her widely distributed Swedish Christmas cookie recipe, even she never acknowledged  her grandparents as immigrants from Sweden. At other points, societal judgments of the first ladies served well as veiled partisan attacks on their husbands. In an earlier time, the worldly, abolitionist Mary Lincoln of the wealthy Kentucky Todd clan would have been idealized as a Southern belle hostess. But married to the Union's president during the Civil War, she was maliciously caricatured as a racist secretly loyal to the Confederacy. And William McKinley, realizing that disclosure of his wife Ida's epilepsy would fix her with a label of ""insanity,"" avoided the ignorant presumption by asserting that she was an ""invalid,"" as evidenced by her use of a wheelchair or cane. The 1828 campaign editorials shaming Rachel Jackson as morally unfit because her first marriage had ended in divorce were central to the character attacks on her husband, Andrew Jackson. Nearly 100 years later, such judgment was still so strongly feared for its political liability that Florence Harding outright lied to the press with her claim of having been widowed by her first husband, not divorced. By 1976, however, Betty Ford's first marriage ending in divorce was not an issue, and neither was the earlier divorce of presidential candidate Ronald Reagan. As time moves on and American life and demographics evolve, so too will the perceptions of wives in the White House. However, hurtful remarks or hateful racism aimed at the current first lady may feel to Americans of many different backgrounds so shaming as to force a tipping point in history. One can hope it will finally help reduce the rhetoric of future generations about presidential spouses based on their origins, appearance  -- even gender.

"Tell your friends. Don't get discouraged. It's worth the struggle. Sounding like a motivational speaker, President Barack Obama asked young supporters on Wednesday to encourage their peers to sign up for health coverage under his embattled reforms known both affectionately and derisively as Obamacare. At a White House Youth Summit, Obama used the opportunity to rally a key demographic for the success of the 2010 Affordable Care Act now that the system's problem-plagued website appeared to working smoothly for most users. Obamacare enrollment ramps up in days after website fix . He compared the never-ending political fight over the health care reforms to struggles that surrounded social progress milestones of the past century. ""I hope you haven't been discouraged by how hard it's been because stuff that's worth it is always hard,"" Obama said. ""The civil rights movement was hard. Getting women the right to vote -- that was hard. Making sure that workers had the right to organize -- that was hard. It's never been easy for us to change how we do business in this country."" Joking he had more gray hair because of relentless attacks on the reforms led by conservative Republicans, Obama added it was worth it and told the laughing summit participants to ""be persistent"" in spreading information about new benefits and helping others enroll. ""You may get a few gray hairs as a consequence, but at the end of the day, you'll think it's worth it,"" he said. The botched October 1 launch of the HealthCare.gov website for enrolling in new insurance exchanges set up under the reforms undermined the administration's efforts to create early momentum for the new system. White House begins three-week Obamacare blitz . Meanwhile, critics led by conservative Republicans have tried to dismantle the health care law at every turn. With the website now functioning relatively smoothly, Obama launched a three-week blitz on Tuesday to promote the reforms as uninsured consumers now required to obtain health coverage face a December 23 deadline to sign up in order to be covered as of January 1. A properly functioning HealthCare.gov is crucial to implementing the most vital provisions of the health law that require people to have health coverage. In theory, the law would create large pools of younger, healthier participants whose premiums would help offset the cost of providing care for older policy holders who use the health care system more. The program depends on convincing younger people who might be less inclined to pay for coverage they don't think they need. Obama told the youth summit participants to urge their friends and peers to ""imagine what happens if you get sick; what happens with the massive bills."" Because of the reforms, he said, most young people without insurance are likely to get health coverage for less than they pay for their smartphones. Administration officials hope the new ability of HealthCare.gov to handle 800,000 users a day or more without major problems signals a major step forward in getting people to sign up. However, officials including Obama warn that glitches will persist and describe the website as a work in progress. ""There will be other things that come up during the course of the next several months because you are starting off a new program that has an impact on one-sixth of the economy,"" Obama said Wednesday, adding that ""we are just going to keep on working on it and improving it and refining it, and if we see a problem, we are going to fix it. But we are not repealing it.  Not as long as I am president."" Insurance companies say some ""back-end"" aspects of the HealthCare.gov system continue to malfunction. In particular, insurers cite problems with applications from people who signed up through the website, including erroneous or missing information. Insurers still reporting errors on Obamacare applications . White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday that tech experts were working on the processing problems, offering assurances they would be fixed in time for coverage on January 1. 3 questions the administration won't answer about Obamacare . Republican criticism continues . Republicans seeking to eliminate the health care reforms leap at any opening to attack the law that passed Congress without any GOP support. They accuse Obama and Democrats of lying about the effects of the reforms, noting several million people had policies canceled despite pledges they could keep coverage they liked, and they describe the Affordable Care Act as an example of big government run amok. On Wednesday, the Republican National Committee demanded that the administration make public the problems cited by insurers with the 834 forms for applying for coverage on HealthCare.gov. ""Democrats are spending this week telling people how great they think Obamacare is, but they can't even get a website to function correctly,"" said a statement by RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, adding that ""the entire law -- not just the website -- is riddled with errors and needs to be repealed and replaced."" Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee's national youth director, Elliott Echols, called Wednesday's White House event an attempt to distract young Americans from the problems of the reforms. ""I'd love to see the White House use this time to answer some important questions from people, like 'Why are premiums doubling?' and 'Why can't I keep my doctor?' and 'Why did you lie to us?',"" Echols said in a statement. Obama and Democrats accuse Republicans of seeking to eliminate benefits of the reforms -- such as guaranteeing coverage for people with pre-existing conditions and ending caps on coverage costs -- without proposing anything substantive to help millions of uninsured Americans get affordable health insurance. He told the summit participants that they can play a significant role in helping people learn more about the reforms and signing up. ""The truth is that for your friends, for your family, the most important source of information is not going to be me, it's going to be you,"" the President said. ""They are going to trust you."" Obama OK with 'Obamacare' label . Getting specific, Obama urged student body leaders to organize conferences and bartenders to organize happy hours ""and also probably get health insurance because most bartenders don't have it."" The President also cleared up any question about whether he had a problem with calling the reforms Obamacare, a label used pejoratively by Republican foes. Repeating a line from his successful re-election campaign last year, Obama said to laughter and applause Wednesday that ""I know people call this law Obamacare and that's OK because I do care, I do,"" adding, ""I care about you, I care about families, I care about Americans."" Wording matters: Obamacare or Affordable Care Act? A source familiar with the website said Wednesday that 29,000 people had enrolled through it since officials announced Sunday that they had fixed the most egregious problems plaguing HealthCare.gov for the two previous months. The three-day figure is a vast improvement over October, the first month of the six-month enrollment period, when fewer than 27,000 people signed up through the HealthCare.gov website that was supposed to be the main enrollment portal. Overall, the total of enrollees in October topped 100,000, including those who used alternate channels and successful exchanges set up by 14 states. Marilyn Tavenner, the official charged with implementing Obamacare as director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said at a congressional hearing last month that the administration initially hoped to enroll 800,000 people by the end of November. The overall enrollment target by the March 31 deadline for 2014 is 7 million. Poll: Quarter of uninsured say they'll pay Obamacare fine .

"The mother of two brothers killed in the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 told CNN she regrets not taking her youngest son's fears about the flight more seriously. Ten-year-old Miguel Calehr died alongside his older brother Shaka, 19, when the Malaysia Airlines jet came down in Ukraine, close to the border with Russia, last Thursday. The pair were on their way to the Indonesian island of Bali for a fun-filled holiday with their grandmother. Their middle brother, Mika, 16, was supposed to be on the flight too, but it was fully booked, and he had to take a seat on a later plane. Just hours before the flight was to depart for Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Miguel told his mother he was nervous. ""After entering the passport [line], he came back to me and said 'Mama, I love you. I'm happy to see Oma [Grandma], but I'm going to miss you,'"" Samira Calehr told CNN. Then, she said, he asked her, ""'What happens when the plane will crash?' ""I said, 'Come on, don't be silly, you've been traveling already so many times. Everything's going to be OK.'"" It was the sort of pre-flight fear many travelers will be familiar with, brushed off by a casual remark parents all over the world are used to making. But single mom Calehr says she now wishes she'd paid more attention to his worries: ""If I could just turn back time. I didn't listen to him. I don't know, I have no words to say..."" Still stunned by the tragedy which has overtaken her family, she pleads: ""Why didn't they take my life? They are still young, they still have a future. Why? Why the children? Why not me?"" Samira's brother Harun told CNN his nephew Mika was being ""very brave"" -- like his mother and grandmother. ""It comes in waves,"" he explained. ""One minute they're completely distraught and inconsolable, and the other minute they're smiling and reminiscing and talking about the fun things that the boys did: the good things, the fun times, the memories."" Harun said the boys were good students. ""They worked hard, they were honest, they were fun to be around."" Above all, he said, ""they were such a blessing to my sister. ... They were a joy to her, and the reason for her being."" The boys' grandmother, Yasmine Calehr, said the family was heartbroken: ""Everybody is crying, everybody is losing something that belonged to them, but we feel like we have lost ourselves as well."" Harun said they were now focused on ensuring the boys' remains are repatriated to the Netherlands, where they can be given a proper farewell. ""As devastating as this process has been, we would like to have a grave, something to put into a grave... some remains or possibly the bodies intact to come home,"" he said. Mika, now the only surviving son, told CNN he has lost his ""best friends"" but insists the bond he has with Miguel and Shaka will go on beyond the grave. ""It feels like they're already one with me now,"" he said. ""They're my best friends, they're my brothers, and I feel like they're going to watch over me forever.""

"(CNN) -- Basketball might be a team sport, but Mount St. Joseph University freshman Lauren Hill was clearly the star of the court Sunday in Ohio's Cintas Center in Cincinnati. Her name was plastered on posters and signs waving in the stands. Much of the sold-out crowd of more than 10,000 fans wore T-shirts and sweatshirts bearing her name and the slogan ""Never Give Up."" Some had her jersey number, 22, painted on their faces. Mount St. Joseph already had a 64-55 lead over Hiram College when Hill came off the bench in response to chants of ""we want Lauren."" When she hit the final layup in the last nine seconds of the game, thunderous cheers underscored the significance of the shot, which could be the last of Hill's collegiate career and her life. The 19-year-old freshman is dying from a rare form of brain cancer called Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma. When doctors told her she did not have much time left, her school asked the NCAA if it could move up its season opener by two weeks so Hill could play her first collegiate basketball game. The answer was yes, prompting an outpouring of support from the greater Cincinnati community and beyond, culminating in Sunday's game. Hill also scored the first two points of the game, drawing cheers from Lions and Terrier fans alike. ""Today has been the best day I've ever had,"" a tearful Hill told the crowd after the game as she accepted the Wilma Rudolph Courage Award for overcome adversity and serving as positive role model. ""I don't know what to say but thank you."" Her diagnosis came during her final year of high school in 2013. She'd already signed up to play basketball at Mount St. Joseph. Undeterred, she played ball in high school despite rounds of chemotherapy for her inoperable tumor and went on to Mount St. Joseph University. ""I never gave up for a second even when I got a terminal diagnosis; I never thought about sitting back and not living life anymore,"" she told CNN affiliate WKRC. Hill's story touched people around the country after WKRC shared her story. Xavier University donated court space at Cintas Center when it became demand for tickets outnumbered available seats at Mount St. Joseph. Sports teams around the country took the #LayUp4Lauren challenge to raise money for pediatric brain cancer, from the Cincinnati Bengals to the Harlem Globetrotters. Legendary women's basketball coach Pat Summit was on hand during half-time to present Hill with the U.S. Basketball Writers Association's Most Courageous Award, a distinction normally reserved for a women's coach or player during the Women's Final Four. Buffalo Bills running back Fred Jackson, Chicago Sky's Elena Delle Donne and WNBA All-Star Tamika Catchings also attended Sunday's game. ""The thing about her is she's just so positive and encouraging,"" Catchings told WKRC. ""No matter what she's going through she's still out here talking about [how] we need a cure."" Even Ohio native and NBA star Lebron James is a fan. He congratulated her on Instagram. .","Mount St. Joseph University freshman Lauren Hill plays in season opener .

"A man who opened fire at a Georgia elementary school Tuesday was armed with an AK-47 ""and a number of other weapons,"" police said. The shooter barricaded himself in the school's front office with employees before eventually surrendering to police, DeKalb County Police Chief Cedric Alexander told reporters. No one was injured, authorities said. Suspected shooter Michael Brandon Hill, 20, faces charges including aggravated assault on a police officer, terroristic threats and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, police spokeswoman Mekka Parish said. The shooter fired about six shots from inside the school toward officers as they approached outside, Alexander said, and police returned fire. Police said it is unclear whether the suspect had any connection with the school, the Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy, which is about seven miles east of downtown Atlanta. Investigators think the gunman entered the school behind someone, Alexander said. As the standoff unfolded, a caller told CNN affiliate WSB's assignment desk that she was in the school office with a gunman. The man had a message he wanted the woman to share with the local television station, assignment editor Lacey LeCroy said, describing the conversation during WSB's newscast Tuesday evening. ""She said he told her to tell me he was not afraid to die,"" LeCroy said. The gunman also threatened to harm police, the woman said, according to LeCroy. Later, LeCroy heard gunshots crack over the television station's phone line. The woman in the school office wasn't sure who had fired, LeCroy said. Investigators initially suspected there could be explosives in a vehicle the shooter parked outside the school, but police found no explosives inside, Parish said. Teachers and administrators guided students out to a lawn outside the school's gym, where they remained while investigators combed the school to ensure there was no other threat. Concerns about explosives forced SWAT teams to cut a hole in a fence by the school and evacuate students through the yard of a neighboring home, Alexander said. On a nearby street, school buses waited to take them to safety. ""This was a very unusual situation where we had to get the kids away from any possible explosives,"" Alexander said. This was the second arrest in six months for Hill, of DeKalb County. In March, he was arrested in neighboring Henry County on suspicion of ""terrorist threats and acts,"" according to a record in the county sheriff's office. He was released on bail five days later. Information on what led to that arrest or whether the case is resolved wasn't immediately available. Students were reunited with their parents at a nearby shopping center Tuesday afternoon. The children smiled and waved, and parents cheered, as each school bus arrived with students aboard. ""Everybody's safe,"" DeKalb County Schools Superintendent Michael Thurmond said. ""This thing came out for the best,"" said Dale Holmes, DeKalb County's assistant police chief. ""Thank God no one was hurt -- not even the suspect.""","Suspect was arrested in March on suspicion of ""terrorist threats and acts""

"Nearly three years after it began, the surge of U.S. troops to Afghanistan is over. In December 2009, on President Barack Obama's order, an additional 30,000 troops headed to the war-torn country hoping to stabilize it and quash what was then widely viewed as a Taliban resurgence despite just more than eight years of war. Now, the last several hundred of the extra troops have left Afghanistan, according to a senior U.S. defense official. Payoff? Assessing the Afghan surge . That still leaves about 68,000 American troops still in the nation, as was the case in late 2008. And violence continues to rage in parts of Afghanistan, including numerous high-profile ""green-on-blue"" attacks of late in which men dressed in Afghan police and military uniforms open fire on other Afghan security officers and coalition forces. If all goes to plan, the withdrawal of U.S. troops will continue as more security responsibilities are handed over to Afghan authorities. NATO leaders this May signed off on Obama's exit strategy that calls for an end to combat operations next year and the withdrawal of the U.S.-led international military force by the end of 2014. After that, a new and different NATO mission will advise, train and assist an expected 350,000-strong Afghanistan force, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has said. Obama committed to the surge following years in which the U.S. government poured troops and resources into the war in Iraq, giving the Taliban time to rebuild and start retaking their traditional stronghold in southern Afghanistan. At the time, progress toward having Afghan forces prepared to take over security in their country had seemingly stalled. Earlier this month, the deputy commander of international forces in Afghanistan said NATO-led forces had made progress. Yet Lt. Gen. James L. Terry also noted the continued efforts by insurgents to ""divide the coalition from our Afghan partners."" One example of how the insurgency can strike, seemingly at will and around the country, is last week's brazen assault on a coalition base in southern Afghanistan that killed two U.S. troops and destroyed six coalition fighter jets, as well as a suicide attack in Kabul on Tuesday that killed 12 people. Violence rages as surge troops depart Afghanistan . The senior combat leader in Afghanistan, Gen. John Allen, said last month that insurgent violence in southern Afghanistan was down 3% over 2011 levels, but admitted it was not ""statistically significant."" However, while violence levels may not have changed much, Allen said the significant change was where the violence had moved. ""We have pushed hard on the insurgency to push them out of the population centers, much of which was cleared last year, and we've continued to push them into an increasingly smaller series of areas, districts, where we have, in many respects, contained them,"" said Allen, head of NATO's International Security Assistance Force. Mark Jacobson, a senior fellow at the Washington-based analyst organization German Marshall Fund, positively pointed to signs that ""the insurgency is not the monolithic structure it was back in 2009, when people said they were at the gates of Kabul."" NATO restricts Afghan operations after 'green-on-blue' killings, anti-Islam film . Yet Jacobson, a former NATO adviser to Gen. David Petraeus when the now CIA director was the top commander in Afghanistan, also added flatly, ""We have not seen as much success as we had hoped for."" ""Did the surge provide the necessary impetus in terms of security and the support of government and other activities so the Taliban and the insurgency would be brought to the table? I don't think that has happened as quickly as people had originally hoped,"" said Jacobson. The effort to train Afghan forces isn't over, even as the coalition troop withdrawal continues. Marine Gen. John A. Toolan, head of allied forces in southern Afghanistan, said last April that he'd seen improvement in Afghan security forces. Still, he added more work needs to be done in intelligence, combat medicine, special operations, artillery and criminal investigation. ""As the conventional forces leave, special operations forces will continue to be required because their (Afghan military) special operations capabilities are going to take a little bit more time to nurture and mature,"" according to Toolan.

"Who says teachers can't be cool? Administrators at a school in North Carolina decided to have some fun when they announced classes would be canceled because of the bad weather slamming the Southeast. They rapped about the closure to the tune of that classic hip hop song, ""Ice Ice Baby."" ""Alright stop. Collaborate and listen. Ice is back and the roads will glisten,"" sung Michael Ulku-Steiner and Lee Hark, head of school and assistant head of school, respectively, at Durham Academy in Durham, North Carolina. ""Sleet falling down like a million missiles, bringing school delays and early dismissals,"" they rapped. ""We had fun with it. It was very spur of the moment,"" Ulku-Steiner told CNN later. ""We'll try to keep people guessing for sure."" The message announced that Durham Academy, which has some 1,170 students, would be closed on Thursday. When asked whether the video is typical of how future cancellations might be announced, Hark laughed. ""We were thinking about a rain delay message using Milli Vanilli's 'Blame It on the Rain,' "" he joked. This isn't the first time school administrators have gotten creative with announcements.

"It's a theory many drivers have held since their first speeding ticket, that citations are somehow connected to a special perk for the officer writing it. Now, a memo among Atlanta police officers has reignited such suspicions. ""The mayor has designated traffic court and ticket revenue for future pay increases,"" Atlanta Police Union President Ken Allen wrote this month. Some residents scoffed at the idea. ""I'm probably going to switch from sales and join the police force in that case, if that's the way it's working,"" one resident, Ken Miller, told CNN affiliate WSB-TV. But Allen stressed that while revenue from tickets will be earmarked for raises, more tickets will not necessarily lead to higher raises. ""We're not even asking anybody, or no one has made any suggestion, that any officer write any additional tickets than they already have,"" the union president told CNN. ""The revenues from tickets already go to the general fund. What the mayor has suggested doing is ... earmarking where these revenues are going for the future pay raises."" Allen said revenues have decreased, but it's largely because of the dismissal rates of citations and an inefficient court system. He said many traffic cases get dismissed because officers can't make it to the scheduled court appearance. ""The citizens need to understand ... we're not running a ticket revenue stream just to get a pay increase. All we're trying to do is correct the inefficiencies and hold those accountable for citations we've already written."" But former police officer and TV judge Alex Ferrer said he's concerned about the possible effects of linking ticket revenues directly to pay increases. ""Once you tie something to somebody's financial earnings, they are motivated in a way that they are not motivated before,"" he said. But many officers say traffic stops yield a lot more benefits than just improved road safety and revenue. Tucson Police Chief Roberto Villasenor requires his officers to make an average of at least one traffic stop a day. He said many important arrests stem from traffic stops. ""That's where we get most of our narcotic arrests. We get a lot of warrants we've been able to serve,"" Villasenor told CNN affiliate KGUN. ""There's benefit from traffic (stops) that have been proven in city after city. I'm just saying we can't forget that's part of our job.""","Atlanta has designated traffic court and ticket revenue for future pay increases .

"It was one year ago Thursday that Jorge Mario Bergoglio became Pope Francis.  From that moment, Jesuits around the world asked the same question: ""Is he still a Jesuit?"" If someone becomes a pope, and therefore head of all Catholic religious orders -- Franciscans, Dominicans, Benedictines, Jesuits and so on -- is he still a member of his religious order? Since then, that question been answered several times by Pope Francis, who in gatherings with his brother Jesuits has spoken of ""We Jesuits."" Beyond the Jesuit parlor game of ""Is he or isn't he?"" the Pope's Jesuit identity is a key way to understand this world phenomenon of a pontiff. In fact, many of the words and deeds that have so shocked the world flow naturally from his Jesuit background. Let's look at five: . Humility. Is there anyone who has not noticed Francis' humility? His first public gesture as Pope was not to bless the vast crowd in St. Peter's Square but to request the crowd's blessing. A few days later, he turned down the traditional papal digs in the grand Apostolic Palace in favor of a modest suite at a Vatican guesthouse. Just this week, a photo taken of members of the Vatican staff on their annual retreat showed the Pope seated in their midst, along with the other bishops and cardinals, as just another person on retreat. Humility of course is a Christian virtue, but it is also something that St. Ignatius Loyola, the 16th-century founder of the Jesuits, specifically asked Jesuit priests and brothers to embrace. There are three kinds of humility, St. Ignatius said. The first is exemplified by the person who does nothing immoral. The second is the one who, when faced with honor or dishonor, is ""indifferent.""  The third is the person who chooses the humbler path, to be more like Jesus. Pope Francis exemplifies this ""Third Degree of Humility."" How to really measure the 'Francis effect' Poverty. Francis is the first Jesuit Pope and the first from a religious order since 1831. That means he is the first Pope to have lived under a ""vow of poverty"" since the mid-19th century. All priests are supposed to live simply, but members of religious orders take a specific vow of poverty. ""Almighty and eternal God ..."" begins the Jesuit vows: In other words, members of religious orders make a promise to God to live simply. Thus, for most of his adult life -- until he became a bishop and was released from that vow -- Jorge Mario Bergoglio owned nothing of his own. As all members of religious orders, he had to live on a strict budget. He had to turn into his community anything he earned and any gifts. He had to ask for cash for large purchases, such as a suit. This accustomed Bergoglio to a simple life, which many find one of his most appealing aspects. It also heightened his compassion for people who live not in voluntary poverty, as he did, but involuntary poverty, as the poor and marginalized do. Governance. Pope Francis had some longtime Vaticanologists scratching their heads when he appointed a group of eight cardinals to advise him and assist him in reforming the Vatican Curia, or central bureaucracy. The ""G8,"" as the cardinals have inevitably become known, have already implemented changes in such complex areas as the Vatican Bank. Many wondered why the Pope didn't rely more on the heads of the specific Vatican offices for this kind of close consultation. Why weren't the ""G8"" the prefects of the largest Vatican congregations? But to most Jesuits his ""way of proceeding,"" as St. Ignatius liked to say, was familiar. Before becoming archbishop of Buenos Aires, Bergoglio was the Jesuit ""provincial,"" or regional superior, of Argentina. As all Jesuit provincials  do, he selected province ""consultors"" who advise the provincial on all manner of decisions. Because they usually do not work directly in province governance, the provincial can rely on them to speak openly and candidly. With the ""G8,"" the Pope is replicating the familiar Jesuit model of governance. Prayer. Often you will hear Pope Francis say something similar to what he said in a homily recently to a parish in Rome when he asked parishioners to close their eyes and imagine themselves in a Gospel scene, in this case at the Jordan River at the Baptism of Jesus. ""Now speak to Jesus,"" he said. Last Easter he asked listeners to picture themselves with the women disciples approaching Jesus' tomb on Easter Sunday. This is a key characteristic of Jesuit prayer: asking the person to use their imagination and let God work through that. In homilies, reflections and speeches, Francis most often does not tell his listeners what to think, he invites them to imagine and think for themselves. It is not the Pope's Jesus whom you are invited to meet, but your own. Openness. Jesuits are asked to ""Find God in all things."" Again, this is not simply a Jesuit virtue but a Christian one. Yet that brief motto is the most commonly cited way of summing up Jesuit spirituality. And ""all things"" means all people. This includes those people who have felt excluded, or unwelcome, in the church. So although his message is based on simple Christian mercy, the world has witnessed the Pope repeatedly inviting the church to experience God in places that some other Catholic leaders may have overlooked or even ignored. Atheists, divorced and remarried Catholics, and gay men and lesbians, have all seen the Pope reach out to them. Francis is not so much trying to find God there -- because he knows that God is already there -- as he is reminding others to look for God in the lives of all these people. Other Jesuit hallmarks could be added to the list, such as flexibility, freedom and an emphasis on social justice. But overall, when Jesuits watch the Pope, we often nod our heads and say, ""That's very Jesuit."" Over the past year, Jesuits have been accused of being too proud of Pope Francis. I'm guilty myself. So at the risk of pride, I'll say that I think he's a great Pope, a great priest and a great Jesuit.  And I'll bet St. Ignatius would be proud -- or as proud as he would allow himself to be.","James Martin: Jesuits wonder if Pope Francis, when elected, was still a member of their order .
Martin: He has identified with the Jesuits, and his life reflects the order's teachings .
Humility, poverty, prayer and ""finding God in all things"" are Jesuit ideals, he says .
Martin: Pope Francis is a great leader who would please St. Ignatius, founder of Jesuits ."
"A speech to Europe aimed at Russia sounded a lot like President Barack Obama's successful campaign message from 2012, especially when it came to gay rights. The address on Wednesday at the Palais Des Beaux-Arts in Brussels followed talks with European Union and NATO leaders on Russia's military backed annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine. In making the case for a united stand against what he characterized as Russian aggression, Obama borrowed from the language that helped win him the White House for a second term. ""We believe in human dignity - that every person is created equal, no matter who you are, or what you look like, or who you love, or where you come from,"" he said. Later, Obama reiterated criticism of Russian intolerance spawned by a law passed before the Sochi Olympics that outlawed promoting gay rights to children. Western ideals and values of openness and tolerance would endure long past repression, he argued. ""Instead of targeting our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters, we can use our laws to protect their rights,"" he said. ""Instead of defining ourselves in opposition to others, we can affirm the aspirations that we hold in common. That's what will make America strong. That's what will make Europe strong. That's what makes us who we are."" His comments came a day before Obama meets with Pope Francis in Vatican City in a visit that the White House says will focus on their shared commitment to helping the disadvantaged. Earlier this month, the Pope reaffirmed the Catholic Church's opposition to gay marriage but suggested in a newspaper interview that it could support some types of civil unions. While reiterating the church's longstanding teaching that ""marriage is between a man and a woman,"" Francis said that ""we have to look at different cases and evaluate them in their variety."" In the wide-ranging interview published March 5 in Corriere della Sera, an Italian daily, the Pope noted that state-sanctioned unions can result from the need to ensure rights such as access to health care. The Catholic News Service called the comments ""the first time a Pope has indicated even tentative acceptance of civil unions."" Francis, who marked his papacy's first anniversary on March 13, has sought to set a more tolerant tone for his 1-billion-member church. Last June, the Pope refused to judge gay priests in comments that ricocheted around the world. He has also said that the church should not ""interfere"" in the spiritual lives of gays and lesbians.","President Obama promotes Western values against Russian intolerance .

"HANOI, Vietnam (CNN) -- Forty years after his plane was shot down over North Vietnam and he was taken prisoner,  presidential candidate Sen. John McCain's ordeal is included in a 12-minute biographical video. McCain was piloting an A4 Skyhawk on a bombing mission over North Vietnam when he was shot down. Photographs and footage in the video of his time as a prisoner of war to have never been seen before on American television, a campaign aide said. A unified Vietnam has capitalized on its American War -- as it calls it -- history and promotes war-related sites throughout the country to tourists. McCain's time in North Vietnam is marked at two locations in Hanoi which came to define his life and military career. One of the many French colonial-style buildings in the capital is the Hoa Lo Prison, better-known to most Americans as the ""Hanoi Hilton,"" the infamous detention facility in which American pilots were held as prisoners of war. Most of the original complex was demolished during the 1990s, but a portion of the old prison originally built by the French was preserved and is now a museum. Although most of the exhibits focus on events from the French period, a museum official estimates that about a fourth of the estimated 200 daily visitors are American tourists who are mostly interested in the two exhibits on American prisoners of war, the most famous of which is the Republican senator from Arizona.  Watch McCain and Col. Bud Day talk about their experience as POWs » . McCain's flight suit, helmet, and parachute from the night he was shot down are mounted in a display case in the Hoa Lo museum. His picture is mounted on an adjacent wall, along with those of other pilots who were also held there. None of the footage in the McCain campaign's video is on display at the museum but some of the photographs are, including his POW mug shot and a photograph of McCain being pulled out of a lake by a group of Vietnamese. A caption next to the mug shot notes that he is now a U.S. senator. The caption next to the lake photo reads in Vietnamese and English, ""Hanoi people and soldiers were saving American pilot who parachuted down in Truc Bach Lake in October 1967,"" but it does not identify McCain by name. Context and accuracy of the exhibits are often sacrificed to maintain its consistent and unabashed pro-Vietnamese slant. A few miles from the prison, the serene Truc Bach Lake was where McCain landed after his plane was shot down on the night of October 26, 1967 and he bailed out. ""Everything happened very quickly,"" McCain said recalling that night while visiting Vietnam in 2000.   ""I broke both my arms and a leg, and I was dragged ashore and I was beaten."" A stone monument on the shore marks the event. The inscription translated from Vietnamese reads ""On 26 October 1967 near the Truc Bach Lake, the Vietnamese people in Hanoi caught [John Sidney McCain]. He was the captain of a group who flew planes in the sky who attacked Hanoi. The number of the plane was A4. The plane fell on Yen Phu power plant. This was one of 10 planes that fell on the same day."" McCain would spend the next 5½ years in the Hanoi Hilton until his release on March 14, 1973. Two decades later, McCain worked towards reconciliation and normalization of U.S.-Vietnam relations and investigated the U.S. government's handling of POW issues as a member of the Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs. McCain returned to visit Hoa Lo in April 2000, a photo of which is included in the exhibit. ""I put the Vietnam War behind me a long time ago,"" McCain said at the time. ""But I harbor no anger nor rancor. I'm a better man for my experience, and I'm grateful for having the opportunity of serving."" E-mail to a friend .

"More than 11,000 children have been killed in the nearly three-year civil war in Syria, including young boys and girls who were tortured and executed, according to a report from a London-based think tank. The Oxford Research Group said that most of the 11,420 children reported dead were killed in explosions, and many others were shot to death. Teenage boys were most likely to be the victims of targeted killings, according to the report, entitled ""Stolen Futures: The Hidden Toll of Child Casualties in Syria."" ""What is most disturbing about the findings of this report is not only the sheer numbers of children killed in this conflict, but the way they are being killed,"" co-author Hana Salama said in a statement. More than 1,000 children were either summarily executed (764) or killed by snipers (389), the report found. Some 112 children, even infants, were tortured before being killed. And what's worse, deaths of children are ""mounting,"" the report said. Both Syrian troops and rebel groups have been blamed for targeting civilians. ""The world needs to take a much closer interest in the effects of the conflict on Syria's children,"" Salama said. The report authors called for the warring sides to stop using explosives in places where children live and play. The Oxford Research Group said Aleppo Governorate was the site of the most child deaths, with 2,223. The statistics are taken from the casualty lists of Syrian organizations from March 2011 to August 2013 and include only named victims. In June, the United Nations said at least 6,500 children had been killed since the start of the war. ""There are ... well-documented cases of individual children being tortured and executed, and entire families, including babies, being massacred,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said at the time. The overall death toll topped 100,000 in late July, the U.N. announced. The U.N. says that more than 2.1 million people have fled Syria, which has about 22.5 million residents.","The report says 112 children were tortured, then executed .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton broached the issue of human rights with Chinese leaders on Saturday, but emphasized that the global financial slump and other international crises were more pressing and immediate priorities. U.S. Secretary Of State Hillary Clinton meets Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao in Beijing. The United States will continue to press China on issues such as Tibet, Taiwan and human rights, she told reporters accompanying her. ""Successive administrations and Chinese governments have been poised back and forth on these issues, and we have to continue to press them. But our pressing on those issues can't interfere with the global economic crisis, the global climate change crisis, and the security crisis,"" she told reporters in Seoul, South Korea. Clinton made China the last and most crucial stopover in her Asia trip, signaling the new administration's first attempts to lay a foundation toward a China policy. It is Clinton's first trip to China as secretary of state.  Watch Clinton talk to CNN about Asian tour » . She met with Chinese President Hu Jintao on Saturday and discussed the framework for further high-level and mid-level discussions. ""It is essential that the United States and China have a positive, cooperative relationship,"" Clinton told a group of reporters. Earlier Saturday, Clinton met with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao in Beijing, where they discussed what they regard as the new defining Sino-U.S. strategic goals: the world economic crisis, regional security and the environment.  Watch report on the talks » . The United States and China are the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases. Human rights, a traditional topic in discussions between the two countries, was broached during Saturday's meeting between Clinton and Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, who agreed to engage in a continuous discussion on the issue. Secretary Clinton said both nations will continue to hold frank discussions on crucial human rights issues, such as Tibet and freedom of expression in China. In the past, Clinton has been an outspoken, staunch critic of China's human rights stance. In a welcoming response, Yang said China was willing to discuss the often-contentious subject of human rights. ""Although differences exist, China is willing to conduct the dialogues with the U.S. to push forward the human rights situation on the premise of mutual respect and noninterference in each other's internal affairs,"" Yang was quoted by China's state-run Xinhua news agency as saying. On the economic front, both leaders emphasized the importance of working in cooperation since their economies are intertwined. China, the world's top holder of U.S. debt, wants to ensure liquidity and security in its dealings with U.S. treasury bonds. ""We did use foreign exchange reserves to buy U.S. treasury bonds. Our principle of using reserves is to ensure security and liquidity,"" Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi told reporters. China-U.S. trade volume rose by 10.5 percent in 2008 to 333.7 billion U.S. dollars, Xinhua reported. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, China is North Korea's largest trade partner. It has taken a leadership position in the six-party talks, a multinational diplomatic effort to denuclearize North Korea. In Seoul, Clinton did not refrain from harsh words, restating the U.S. position on North Korea. ""North Korea is not going to get a different relationship with the U.S. while insulting and refusing dialogue with the Republic of Korea,"" she said. Mid-level military discussions will resume this month, Clinton announced Saturday. Last October, the Bush administration notified Congress of its plan to sell $6.5 billion in arms to Taiwan -- a move that caused China to suspend military talks with the U.S. Clinton told CNN's Senior Correspondent Jill Dougherty that U.S. policy toward Taiwan will not change.

"Erick Muñoz tried to keep hope alive, but he knew his wife was dead. ""Many a night, I asked God to take me instead,"" he said in an exclusive interview with CNN's ""AC360"" on Wednesday. ""But you can't turn off that knowledge, that you know how bad it was. ... And I promised her, I told her I will honor her wishes."" On Sunday, someone switched off the machines inside a Texas hospital that kept Marlise Muñoz's heart and lungs working. Her family spoke to CNN on Wednesday in their first national television interview since they won their battle to disconnect the ventilator from the pregnant woman's body. Their wrenching court fight drew national attention and sparked debate over who's alive, who's dead and whether the presence of a fetus changes the equation. Now, they say they want their story to be heard in order to save other families from going through the same nightmare. Marlise was 33 years old and 14 weeks pregnant with the couple's second child when her husband found her unconscious on their kitchen floor November 26. Though doctors had pronounced her brain dead and her family had said she did not want to have machines keep her body alive, officials at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas, argued state law required them to maintain life-sustaining treatment for a pregnant patient. Marlise didn't leave any written directives regarding end-of-life care. But long before she was hospitalized, her family said, they had made Marlise a promise to honor her wishes, and they were determined to keep it. ""We looked her in the eye and told her,"" Erick Muñoz said, his voice cracking as he spoke to CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""And for the state of Texas, to not let us do that, was hard. You know, you want to keep your word to your loved one."" 'They're using my wife' Erick Muñoz had no doubt about what his wife wanted. They were both paramedics, and it was something they'd talked about many times as they discussed their days. In their line of work, Erick Muñoz said, they became all too aware of families who held on to loved ones long after they'd gone. And of how fleeting life can be. ""You work on a freeway or a busy road,"" he said. ""That driver just accidentally hits you, and you could be gone."" Now that Marlise is gone, her family is pushing for others to have those same conversations. ""We were together on the same page from the very beginning, which we feel is very important for families that have to go through something like this, that there isn't any in-house fighting,"" said Marlise's mother, Lynne Machado. It should be a family's decision, they said, not a political issue. They've heard protesters and politicians pointing to the case and claiming laws should be rewritten to make sure someone like Marlise can't be disconnected from life support. Those people, they said, are missing the point. ""I feel that's unfair on their part. They're not the family. I can't take the right away from you to do something with your loved ones. I don't feel they should, either,"" Erick Muñoz said. ""I feel they're using my wife, unfortunately, as a stepping stone, as an argument for their debates. They want votes. And I tell them, 'That's wrong.' ... They are using her as a political argument."" Mom: 'We needed to do this for her' Marlise's family members were preparing to say their final goodbyes in the ICU the day in November when doctors showed them that her heart kept stopping and that her brain was swelling. But then suddenly, the situation changed: a doctor told them they couldn't disconnect the machines. The family says they were shocked, and that even the doctors seemed surprised. ""I thought, there must have been a miscommunication in some way. We said 'No, no, no. That's not what she wanted. She wanted never to be on life support.' They said, 'Well, but she's pregnant.' And then, you know, it went from there,"" Machado said. ""We knew we weren't going to let this rest, because it wasn't right. It was not honoring her wishes."" That's why the family went to court and kept fighting, she said, even as the going got tough. Even as it became clearer every day that the woman they loved had slipped away. Even as her skin texture changed -- becoming like a mannequin's, cool and rubbery. Even as the air in her hospital room started to smell more like death than life. ""There would be times I'd feel frustrated by the process we were having to go through. And I could just feel Marlise say, 'Mom, don't give up, keep going, keep fighting.' And for many days, that's what I held onto,"" Machado said. ""We tried to raise our children to stand up for what's right, even if you're the only one standing up. And this is what Marlise would have done had the situation been different. She would have stood up for what's right, so we needed to do this for her."" A judge in Fort Worth sided with the family on Friday, ordering the hospital to remove any artificial means of life support from Marlise by 5 p.m. Monday. The devices were shut off Sunday morning and her body was released to her husband. ""The Muñoz and Machado families will now proceed with the somber task of laying Marlise Muñoz's body to rest, and grieving over the great loss that has been suffered,"" the family's attorneys said in a statement at the time. ""May Marlise Muñoz finally rest in peace, and her family find the strength to complete what has been an unbearably long and arduous journey."" Now, the family says they know that Marlise and the baby girl she carried, who they named Nicole, are in heaven. But even the legal victory, which gave them a chance to say their final goodbyes, wasn't a moment for celebration. ""It wasn't happy for anybody. There was not a happy ending,"" Machado said. ""We were pleased that the judge ruled in our favor, and that he realized that Marlise was not a patient, as the hospital was saying. That she was, in fact, legally dead."" Attorneys: Fetus was 'distinctly abnormal' What happens next? The hospital acknowledged Friday that Marlise had been brain dead since November 28 and that the fetus she carried was not viable. ""The past eight weeks have been difficult for the Muñoz family, the caregivers and the entire Tarrant County community, which found itself involved in a sad situation,"" a hospital statement said over the weekend. ""JPS Health Network has followed what we believed were the demands of a state statute.""

"Sixty-eight and counting. An outbreak of measles in Ohio has infected 68 people, adding to what is already an 18-year high of measles cases in the United States. That's disturbing news for health professionals, who considered the contagious infectious disease eliminated in the United States in 2000. The outbreak in Ohio began with a group from Christian Aid Ministries, who went on a mission trip to the Philippines earlier this year, health officials say. Philippines is experiencing a very large measles outbreak; at least 20,000 confirmed and suspected cases have been reported in the Asian nation. Four people who were on the mission trip became infected, according to Pam Palm, the public information officer for Knox County Health Department, and the disease has since spread to 62 others in the Amish community. Knox County has 40 cases. Palm said the first few cases were initially misdiagnosed as dengue fever, a testament to how few cases of measles doctors usually see. ""Because of the success of the measles vaccine, many clinicians have never seen measles and may not be able to recognize its features,"" Dr. Julia Sammons wrote in a commentary published in April in Annals of Internal Medicine. Ohio health officials have immunized nearly 800 people with the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine since the outbreak began. ""The Amish who are family members and acquaintances of those who now have measles have been extremely cooperative in a willingness to get vaccinated,"" Jackie Fletcher, director of nursing for the Knox County Health Department, said in a statement. ""And those who currently have measles have been staying home."" California, another state reporting a high number of measles cases this year, said its outbreak also resulted from people visiting the Philippines. Visitors may pick up the disease and bring it back to the United States, potentially infecting those who cannot be vaccinated against the measles because they are too young, for example, or who have intentionally remained unvaccinated. Data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on April 24 found 129 cases of measles in the United States between January 1 to April 18. That's the highest number of cases recorded for the period since 1996. Some of the Ohio cases were recorded after that reporting period -- meaning the total now is undoubtedly higher. Fletcher said many of the measles patients her staff are seeing are ""really sick."" Symptoms usually include fever, cough and conjunctivitis, along with a rash. In rare cases, measles can lead to pneumonia and brain infections, which can be fatal. ""Although most of us don't realize it because it is so rare in our country, measles is a serious disease,"" CDC director Tom Frieden wrote on CNN in 2013. ""Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 9 of 10 people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected."" Were you at this concert?

"In business, if one of our companies is failing, we take steps to identify and solve the problem. What we don't do is continue failing strategies that cost huge sums of money and make the problem worse. It's this kind of logic that underpins a new report published Tuesday by the Global Commission on Drug Policy, one that aims to take the debate on drug regulation to the next level. I'm a member of the commission, and I am pleased to note that since our initial report in 2011, international leaders and heads of state have increasingly echoed our calls for a major shift in global drug policy. Colorado and Washington took the discussion from theory to reality in 2012 by becoming the first political jurisdictions in the world to approve the legal regulation of the production, distribution and sale of marijuana. Uruguay took it a step further last December by becoming the first country in the world to do so. This latest report, ""Taking Control: Pathways to Drug Policies that Work,"" reflects a new evolution in our thinking. We not only reiterate the case for decriminalization, alternatives to incarceration, and greater emphasis on public health approaches, but we now also call for permitting the legal regulation of psychoactive substances. The reality is that the most effective way to advance the goals of public health and safety is to get drugs under control through responsible legal regulation. Much can be learned from the successes and failures in regulating alcohol, tobacco, pharmaceutical drugs and other products and activities that pose health risks to individuals and societies. And drug regulation is not as radical as some might think. In fact, it doesn't even require a fundamental reconsideration of established policy principles. There is a wide spectrum of policy options to control various types of drugs. At one end of this spectrum are illegal, criminally controlled markets subject to a full-scale war on drugs. At the other end are legal, unfettered free markets controlled by commercial enterprises. Both of these options are characterized by an absence of regulation, with governments essentially forfeiting control of the drug trade. What's needed are appropriately regulated legal drug markets. True, the importance to public health of legally regulating drugs comes not because they are safe, but precisely because they can be dangerous and pose serious risks. Yet however dangerous a particular drug may be on its own, its risks increase dramatically when it is produced, sold and consumed in an unregulated criminal environment. Putting accountable governments and regulatory bodies in control of this market can significantly reduce these risks. When thinking about how to best reduce the harms of drugs, alcohol prohibition in United States is a lesson in unintended, disastrous consequences, as I wrote in 2012 on CNN on the anniversary of the end of alcohol prohibition, that policy prompted an increase in consumption of hard liquor, organized crime taking over legal production and distribution, and widespread anger with the federal government. Since the war on drugs began in 1971, over $1 trillion has been wasted and the United States has the highest prison population in the world. Some of these prisoners, from Ironwood State Prison, shared the stage with me in May during California's first TEDX talk at a prison: while it was encouraging to see their anti-recidivism efforts and preparation for productive lives after prison, we should not be overcrowding prisons in the first place with people who need treatment and people who are nonviolent offenders. Under prohibition, no product controls exist. Illegal drug markets are driven by economic processes that encourage the production and supply of more potent -- and therefore more profitable -- drug preparations. Effective regulation could help gradually reverse this dynamic. In the United States and around the world, ending drug prohibition is being openly discussed. Elected officials, businessmen, physicians, educators, civil society and religious leaders are breaking the taboo and engaging in debate about common sense alternatives including reducing the harm done by existing drug policies. Law enforcement officials such as San Francisco District Attorney George Gascon support the upcoming Safe Neighborhood and Schools Act, which Californians will vote on this November. If a majority says ""yes on 47,"" nonviolent drug crimes will be treated as a misdemeanor, reducing prison overcrowding, focusing law enforcement to go after violent criminals, and freeing up $1 billion over the next five years from prisons to education and health care. Imagine the possibilities when drugs are treated like a health issue, not a criminal issue. The one thing we cannot afford to do is to go on pretending the war on drugs is working. California has a chance to reverse the harm done to its communities and its fiscal health by failed drug policies. More voters deserve opportunities to support alternative approaches to public safety, health and education that go hand in hand with the responsible regulation of legalized drugs. If drug policy, which costs $100 billion annually, were my business, I would call it a failure and shut it down before it ruins more lives. It's time to apply that sort of thinking to our failed drug policies. Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter .","New report by Global Commission on Drug Policy calls for drug policy rethink .

"(CNN) -- A portrait is beginning to emerge of Joseph Andrew Stack, the man officials believe set his house on fire and then intentionally crashed his small aircraft into an office building in Austin, Texas. Stack, 53, owns a Piper Cherokee PA-28, according to aviation records, and federal officials believe that is the plane that crashed into the building Thursday. Authorities said the remains of two people were found in the building after the crash. They were not immediately identified. Share images, information about the crash . A message on a software company Web site registered to Stack appears to be a suicide note. ""If you're reading this, you're no doubt asking yourself, 'Why did this have to happen?' "" the message said. ""The simple truth is that it is complicated and has been coming for a long time."" At the FBI's request, the letter was later removed from the site. As recently as February 7, the Web site was for Embedded Art, which appears to be a software company founded by Stack. ""Embedded Art is a small independent software house, specializing in process control and automation,"" a cached version of the Web site said. ""In its current form it represents the culmination of 20 years of experience in the software development consulting business. Founded by Joe Stack in 1983 (under the name of Prowess Engineering) in Southern California, the company thrived for 15 years until shifting focus to the Sacramento area to take advantage of growth in the Silicon Valley."" The Web site changed over on February 16, indicating Stack had possibly been planning to post the note for at least two days. The document had been revised 27 times since the 16th, according to the site's page information, and was finalized at 1:42 a.m. ET -- about eight hours before he is believed to have taken his plane from the airport. In the long message, the writer rails against the government and, particularly, the Internal Revenue Service. Read the apparent suicide note (PDF) The building into which the airplane crashed is a federal IRS center with 199 employees. ""I saw it written once that the definition of insanity is repeating the same process over and over and expecting the outcome to suddenly be different,"" the online message said. ""I am finally ready to stop this insanity. Well, Mr. Big Brother IRS man, let's try something different; take my pound of flesh and sleep well."" In the letter, the writer, who signs as Joe Stack, said he feels some frustration in writing, ""given my gross inability to gracefully articulate my thoughts in light of the storm raging in my head."" Details in the letter coincide with details of Stack's life, such as his move from California to Texas in 2004. Once in Austin, he bought a $230,000 home in a leafy subdivision, the same home that he allegedly set on fire before piloting the plane into the building. Photos from the scene of the fire showed a fire truck parked in front of a large brick house, flames and plumes of thick smoke rising into the sky. CNN affiliate KXAN reported Stack's wife, Sheryl, and 12-year-old stepdaughter had moved into a hotel on Wednesday evening after, friends said, Stack went ""ballistic"" about his IRS problems. Stack's wife is listed as a teaching assistant at the University of Texas-Austin. The examples of Stack's apparent frustration in the note coincide with financial troubles his companies had. The California Franchise Tax Board said Stack's Software Systems Service Corporation license was suspended June 1, 2004, for not paying taxes in 1996 and 2002, CNN affiliate KCRA reported. And another of Stack's companies in California -- known as Prowess Engineering, which became Embedded Art -- had its license suspended November 1, 2000, for a failure to file a 1994 tax return, KCRA reported. Thursday's incident left those who knew Stack scratching their heads. ""I can't believe it's the same person,"" said Ric Furley, an Austin musician who played in a band with Stack for a period more than two years ago. Stack played bass, the accordion and sang for the band, according to the band's Web site. Stack was very musical, and conversations with his bandmates typically revolved around music, not grievances he may have had. ""He was very easygoing,"" Furley said, adding that he guessed it was insanity that led Stack to his alleged suicide mission. ""What else could it be?"" In the online message, the writer noted how during past times of crisis, like during the Great Depression, some of the wealthy who lost everything were known to have killed themselves. ""Now, when the wealthy f--- up, the poor get to die for the mistakes ... isn't that a clever, tidy solution,"" the letter said. The letter also hinted at darker thoughts. ""Nothing changes unless there is a body count,"" it said. ""I choose to not keep looking over my shoulder at 'Big Brother' while he strips my carcass, I choose not to ignore what is going on all around me, I choose not to pretend that business as usual won't continue; I have just had enough."" He plainly stated his conclusion: ""Sadly, though I spent my entire life trying to believe it wasn't so, but violence not only is the answer, it is the only answer.""","Former bandmate says Stack was easygoing; ""I can't believe it's the same person""

"Gina, the owner of a busy graphic design firm, started giving herself -- and her employees -- four-day workweeks after she had knee surgery and found it tough to get around. It was meant to be temporary, and Gina only made the change because she felt guilty staying home while the others toiled. But she quickly realized the shorter week was less a burden than a surprise boon. From Monday through Thursday, her staff got in early to get their work done, and employees seemed genuinely excited to be there. Productivity increased dramatically. People still had fun, but even the office chitchat seemed more efficient. And when they were at work, they worked. ""They were using the extra day off to spend time with their families, do errands and take long weekends away, but also to schedule appointments they might otherwise have taken an afternoon off to attend,"" Gina said. People ended up taking fewer vacations days, and sick days disappeared almost entirely. The notion of the four-day work week was introduced in the 1950s by American labor union leader Walter Reuther, but workers -- or, more specifically, bosses -- have been slow to buy in. By most accounts, the American workweek is now at its most saturated: Nearly 86% of American men and 67% of women work more than 40 hours in any given week, in the name of productivity, financial necessity and, according to at least one study, happiness. In her book ""White Collar Sweatshop,"" author Jill Andresky Fraser writes about a culture of American workers being on-call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, even as salaries and benefits decrease. That's because, despite the evidence, we're programmed to believe that working longer and harder begets great achievement. But what if working less is the real key to success? Earlier this year, when Facebook exec Nicola Mendelsohn was hired as a company vice president, she reportedly negotiated a four-day workweek so she could spend more time with her family. Much was made of the rumor, which Facebook would neither confirm nor deny, despite the fact that many working mothers around the country routinely, and increasingly, negotiate four-day workweeks. In fact, 44% of female doctors now work four or fewer days a week, up from 29% in 2005. And yet Mendelsohn's four-day imperative sparked big debate: Critics called the move entitled and questioned its fairness, while working mothers hailed it a victory, naming her a poster child for work-life balance. Many have argued for the four-day workweek, or flexible hours in general, as a way to retain talented female workers who might otherwise quit altogether in order to have children. But a four-day workweek isn't beneficial to mothers alone -- and it is beneficial. When Utah introduced four-day workweeks for many of its state employees in 2008, it boosted productivity and worker satisfaction. They reverted to the standard five-day week only three years later, because residents complained about not having access to services on Fridays. In a 2012 op-ed in the New York Times, software CEO Jason Fried reported that the 32-hour, four-day workweek his company follows from May through October has resulted in an increase in productivity. ""Better work gets done in four days than in five,"" he wrote. It makes sense: When there's less time to work, there's less time to waste. And when you have a compressed workweek, you tend to focus on what's important. (Like sleep, quality work happens best when uninterrupted.) Fried also reported that the four-day workweek had made it easier to recruit new talent and retain valuable staff -- male and female. There's one caveat. Though unlikely to affect higher-ups like Mendelsohn, the four-day week tends to work best when the entire office is involved. One reason many employees may feel reluctant to take on a four-day week is because of the fear of ""missing out"" on access to the boss or to the flow of ideas and information. Ten weeks after her first daughter was born, Mary, an environmental attorney in Denver, returned to work, taking the firm up on its offer to let her come in four days a week while everyone else remained at five. A month later, Mary found herself exhausted, constantly irritable, and nursing a persistent cough. ""I was happy they wanted to keep me enough to be flexible,"" she said. ""But I always felt that the most important decisions were made when I was home relieving the nanny."" Instead of providing some relief, the flexible hours that were Mary's, and Mary's alone, only made her that much more anxious. ""I became convinced that once out of sight, I was out of mind."" Putting everyone on the same schedule helps reduce that fear. There's also the simple economics of the four-day week, as seen in Utah. When the lights are on four days instead of five, and employees need to make the commute two fewer times, costs are lowered. For all these reasons, many employers who go the four-day route never go back. Three years later, Gina's knee is healed but the four-day workweek remains. Her firm has grown by 20%. Was it the change in schedule? ""I'm sure that can't account for all the growth,"" Gina said. ""But it played a role for sure. Now I joke that blowing out my knee was the best career move I ever made.""","Peggy Drexler: Employers find a four-day workweek increases productivity and job satisfaction .
She says 86% of American men, 67% of women work more than 40 hours a week .

"Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, a former Taliban prisoner, on Thursday wrapped up a two-day interview with an Army investigating officer to discuss his disappearance in Afghanistan five years ago. After disappearing from his post in June 2009, the soldier, now 28, spent five years in the hands of Taliban militants. Bergdahl's civilian attorney was present for the interviews. The investigation is ongoing, Army spokesman Wayne Hall said. Bergdahl attorney Eugene Fidell described Wednesday's portion of questioning as both long and productive. ""He answered every question that was put to him,"" Fidell said Wednesday about his client. ""I think it was helpful, personally, to Sgt. Bergdahl to be able to tell his story, you know, to a person in a position of responsibility without a lot of sort of intermediation by third parties."" After he was released in May in exchange for five senior Taliban members held by the U.S. military, Bergdahl underwent counseling and medical care at a hospital in San Antonio, where he is now back on regular duty at Fort Sam Houston. The news of Bergdahl's freedom initially was met with jubilation, but the mood quickly turned as many called for an investigation into his disappearance and captivity. Some critics accused the soldier of deserting his comrades in war. An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will, according to an official who was briefed on the report. The Army has no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent, something officials couldn't learn without talking to the soldier, a U.S. military official recently told CNN. Bergdahl works at the headquarters of U.S. Army North in Texas. He is with a unit responsible for homeland defense, civil support operations and security cooperation programs involving countries such as Canada, Mexico and the Bahamas. He will eventually be given a position commensurate with his current rank of sergeant, the Army said last month. Bergdahl was a private first class when he was captured, and the Army extended his enlistment and twice promoted him on schedule while he was in captivity. Unless he requests an extension, the investigating officer has until mid-August to complete the probe; a report would be issued about a month later.

"The Haqqani Network is aligned with the Taliban and al Qaeda and is considered one of the most significant threats to stability in Afghanistan, security experts say. Associated with Pakistani intelligence, the network is actually a family. Last year, the New York Times called the Haqqani Network ""the Sopranos of the Afghanistan War."" Friday, the Obama administration said it's going to designate the group a terror organization which would make is possible to freeze any personal assets the network holds in United States banks. Based in Waziristan, a tribal area of Pakistan, they've been an effective fighting force in the region for most of the past 30 years. Their calling card is bold and complex suicide bombings, including high-profile attacks on U.S. and foreign personnel and assassinations of high level people in Kabul and northern Afghanistan, the Institute for the Study of War reports. The Haqqanis maintain legal businesses (like car dealerships and construction companies) and illegal business interests from Afghanistan and Pakistan and areas in the Persian Gulf and beyond, the Institute found. It also runs import-export operations and has commercial and residential real estate holdings. Read at length about the 'remarkably resilient' Haqqani Network . In September 2011, former U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker officially blamed the Haqqani Network for a nearly day-long attack on the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California, said Friday that she supported the administration's action Friday. ""This group is responsible for more than 1,300 killed and injured U.S. troops, orchestrates the largest attacks inside Afghanistan, assassinates Afghan leaders and seeks control of Afghan provinces,"" Feinstein said, noting that that the discussion to do this has been ongoing for two years. ""Over the past two years I have heard from leaders in the intelligence community and military in Washington and in Kabul that designation is the right thing to do,"" she said. For a more detailed analysis, West Point's Combating Terrorism Center lays out the Haqqani group and its objectives. For years, patriarch Jalaluddin Haqqani, who would be in his 60s, led the network. The former anti-Soviet resistance commander is regarded for his ability on the battlefield. His sons Sirajuddin, Badruddin and Nasiruddin and their uncle, Ibrahim, are believed to be in charge now. One son, Salahuddin, told a journalist that there are nine siblings in the family, according to the Jane's security site. Six of the siblings were born to an Afghan wife, and three to an Arab wife. Sirajuddin is most likely leading the group, several security reports say. He is considered the most radicalized and violent in the family. ""Siraj is a brutal criminal murderer,"" Gen. Jeffrey Schloesser outgoing commander of the U.S. 101st Airborne Division in eastern Afghanistan, told Jane's. Another U.S. military source, which Jane's did not name, described Sirajuddin as ""very much into the global extremism of al Qaeda... He has got those ties (to al Qaeda) so he tends to be more violent than his father ever was."" Siraj, as he's known to intelligence sources, seems to have begun turning the Haqqani terror empire into a ruthless killing machine around 2007. That year, Lt. Col. Dave Anders said in a press release: ""Siraj is part of a younger, more aggressive generation of Taliban senior leadership that is pushing aside the formerly respected elders."" In late August, Badruddin was reportedly killed in a drone strike in North Waziristan. Badruddin handled day-to-day operations, security analyst Jeffrey Dressler said, adding that the death wasn't anticipated to hurt the group as long as the Haqqani had money to regroup. Several security experts and U.S. military officials say Siraj Haqqani has extended the Haqqani Network's reach to countries far from Pakistan and Afghanistan. In recent years, the group has managed to recruit fighters in Chechnya and Turkey, analysts say. -- Until recently, U.S. and coalition troops lacked sufficient forces to reverse the momentum of the Haqqani Network. The massive increase of special operations forces over the past year, combined with the increase in the number of conventional forces to execute counterinsurgency operations, is beginning to disrupt and degrade the Haqqani network's infrastructure and operations. -- An increased drone campaign against senior Haqqani safe havens in North Waziristan has disrupted the network's ability to plan and execute operations, and has targeted al Qaeda senior leadership and other foreign terrorists. To this point, there is a core power within Haqqani, but experts say that the network has survived for so many years because that core doesn't bigfoot its many commanders. The Haqqani Network is more macro-management than micro-management. They cultivate alliances. And the looseness of their organizational structure seems to have served them. The Haqqanis also have reported links to Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency. In late April, the U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen said on Pakistan's Geo TV that ISI has a ""long-standing relationship"" with the Haqqani Network. A senior Pakistani intelligence official responded: ""We do have a relationship: that of an adversary."" ""We have made our resolve very clear that (the Haqqani Network) is an enemy we need to fight together,"" said the official, who did not want to be identified discussing intelligence matters. Examples of carnage the network is believed to have orchestrated: . -- The attack on the Serena Hotel in Kabul. In January 2008, a team of gunmen strapped with explosives stormed the popular hotel. In that attack, three gunmen with explosives ""bluffed, shot and blasted their way through the hotel's security measures, terrifying Afghanistan's small international community in the process,"" according to Jane's. -- The attack on the Hotel Inter-Continental in Kabul. On June 28, masked gunmen stormed a side entrance to the hotel, popular with journalists and Westerners. Six attackers detonated explosives; several were shot and killed on the rooftop of the building. As an organized terror outfit, the Haqqani Network's roots go back to the father's emergence as a skilled fighter in Afghanistan's war against the Soviets in the 1980s. The family is part of the Zadran tribe, which spans the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and stretches to Khost province. The United States military has described the Zadrans as warrior-oriented especially proud of trouncing their enemy in that war. Jalaluddin garnered an impressively tough reputation as a mujahideen fighter at that time. Later, at the head of his terror group, he was described by several U.S. officers as a ""mafia godfather,"" according to Jane's. Jalaluddin Haqqani developed a relationship in the mid-1990s with Osama bin Laden when bin Laden began living in Afghanistan. That is according to bestselling Pakistani journalist Ahmed Rashid, who is regarded as one of the world's top experts on al Qaeda, the Taliban and Afghanistan. An unnamed military intelligence source explained to Jane's in June 2009 that the Haqqanis would send politely worded but menacing letters to local tribes. The letters would inform the receivers that if they aided U.S. or coalition forces, the Haqqanis would kill them and their families. ""The line at the bottom of the intimidation letter is, 'You have no right to complain because we have warned you,'"" the military source told Jane's. The Haqqani Network reportedly is well-funded. Security analysts said the father raised funds shortly after the war with the Soviets by traveling throughout the Middle East, cashing in on his reputation as a formidable mujahideen fighter. According to Jane's, he also used connections achieved through his second wife, who is Arab. She either is living or has lived in the United Arab Emirates.","Haqqani Network is a family with patriarch and now sons running terror operations .

"Wesleyan University officials announced Monday that residential fraternities will be required to accept women and men as full members. The policy change comes after consulting fraternity members, alumni and faculty, university spokesperson Kate Carlisle said. There are nonresidential Greek organizations, including one sorority, that will not be affected because they do not have on-campus houses. ""In the end, the decision is based on making our campus as fair, inclusive and equitable as possible, and reflects Wesleyan's tradition of progressive leadership,"" Carlisle said. Wesleyan's board of trustees asked President Michael S. Roth in May to ""prepare a plan to address the future of Greek life"" after ""highly publicized incidents of sexual violence."" In a March 2014 lawsuit against Wesleyan's Xi Chapter of Psi Upsilon, a then-freshman student alleged she was raped in front of onlookers at the fraternity's on-campus residence. An April 2014 Wesleyan Student Assembly survey that found 47% of respondents felt less safe in fraternity spaces also contributed to the review, Roth said in a statement. ""The trustees and administration recognize that residential fraternities have contributed greatly to Wesleyan over a long period of time, but we also believe they must change to continue to benefit their members and the larger campus community,"" Roth and Joshua Boger, the chair of the university's board of trustees, wrote in a joint statement on Monday. The fraternities have three years to complete the co-educational transition. The Middletown, Connecticut, university has a current population of about 2,900 undergraduates with two all-male fraternity residences on campus, Psi Upsilon and Delta Kappa Epsilon. Delta Kappa Epsilon International Fraternity, the organization's national governing body, said it ""strongly"" disagreed with the decision, calling the university's justification for the decision ""vague."" ""Remarkably absent from the University's statement are any facts -- even opinions -- about why Wesleyan feels it will be better off with co-educational fraternities. How can a highly rated liberal arts institution implement a major policy change, without even describing to those affected by it, the problem that you are intending to solve?""","Wesleyan University ordered fraternities to become co-ed in the next three years .

"(CNN)Hosts Australia have won their first ever Asian Cup title, the continent's equivalent of the European Championships, after beating Korea 2-1. In a pulsating final played in front of more than 70,000 supporters at Stadium Australia, Sydney, the Socceroos took the lead against the run of play just before half time thanks to a stunning goal by Massimo Luongo. Luongo, a 22 year old midfielder who plays for Swindon Town in the English third tier, spun away from his marker before crashing a shot into the bottom right hand corner of the goal, the first goal Korea had conceded in the entire tournament. Extra time goal . Australia looked to have held out for 90 minutes and a famous Asian Cup title -- their first since switching to the Asian Football Confederation from the smaller less competitive Oceania Football Confederation -- until Bayer Leverkusen striker Son Hueng-min equalized in the first minute of injury time, silencing the boisterous home crowd and sending the final to extra time. But Australia stormed back and James Troisi shot home from close range after a defensive mix up to seal the victory. ""It's a massive moment for Australian football,"" former Everton and New York Red Bulls forward  Tim Cahill told AFP after the game. ""All I can recall is all those people who didn't believe in us,"" he added. ""This is one of the biggest moments in sport for Australia because this is an Asian tournament that's so difficult to win -- and a tournament we were never supposed to win with this group of players."" Cahill's last stand? The tournament is likely to be Cahill's last after a glittering career in English and international soccer. But Socceroos' coach Ange Postecoglou believes that Cahill still has much to offer the team, with qualification for the 2018 World Cup finals in Russia next on the agenda. ""I'd be surprised,"" Postecoglou said of Cahill's rumored retirement. ""He's had a fantastic tournament. He hasn't said anything to me. I haven't had any discussion with him about his future and I'd be surprised if I had to because again he was a very important part of our team."" If Cahill was part of the past, one of the last members of Australia's so-called ""golden generation"" that qualified for three World Cup finals in a row, then goal scoring hero Massimo Luongo could be the future. He was named player of the tournament, having been involved in six goals over the course of the tournament. Switch to AFC . The victory was also vindication of Australia's decision to join the Asian Football Confederation. Up until 2005 Australia had competed in the Oceania Football Confederation -- the smallest of FIFA's six confederations -- with little in the way of true competition aside from the occasional matches against New Zealand. The OFC also offers just half a qualification spot for the World Cup finals: a playoff match against tough opponents in South America or Asia. A 31-0 victory against American Samoa in a qualification match for the 2002 World Cup finals -- a world record that still stands today -- forced Australian soccer to focus on joining the AFC, which they did in 2005. West Asia unhappy? As well as holding Asia's most prestigious international title, club side Sydney Wanderers famously won last year's Asian Champions League final against Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal, prompting allegations that not everyone in Asian soccer is happy with Australia's success. After the Socceroos beat the United Arab Emirates in the semifinal, one leading figure appeared to express concern that Australia had taken one of the AFC's prized World Cup qualification spots yet had given little back in return. ""Yes, it is true, there are indications that confirm that there is a desire among West Asian federations to remove Australia from the AFC,"" Sheikh Salman Bin Ibrahim Al-Khalifa, the Bahraini president of the AFC, said in an interview with Emiraiti newspaper Al Ittihad. ""I also know that the Arabs are not the only ones that are not convinced with the value of Australia staying within the Asian football family."" Sheikh Salman later denied the comments, saying they had been ""manipulated"". ""I'm really stunned with the timing to bring this topic out. It's a false topic,"" he told Australia's Herald Sun newspaper. ""To read a story like this is really sad because there's no truth in it. The success of this tournament has exceeded our expectations. I won't let a story like this affect the success of the tournament we had in Australia."" After Australia's victory Sheikh Salman was quick to praise the team and the country's hosting of the tournament, telling the AFC's website that the ""competition that has been remarkable in spirit and in passion, and we have Australia to thank for that.""","Hosts Australia win Asian Cup .

"(CNN) -- Famed attorney Robert Shapiro -- best known to the public as part of O.J. Simpson's legal ""dream team"" -- is now defending actress Lindsay Lohan, according to Lohan's father. Lohan's former lawyer, Shawn Chapman Holley, resigned last week shortly after releasing a statement about her client's ""harsh and unfair"" sentence. Lohan was ordered Tuesday to serve 90 days in jail for missing alcohol counseling sessions in violation of her probation. She was also sentenced to spend 90 days in a drug and alcohol rehab program after her jail term is completed. The actress must begin serving her sentence on July 20. Michael Lohan sent an e-mail to CNN Thursday stating that Shapiro had been hired, and expressing hope that his daughter's sentence would be reevaluated if she is allowed to attend rehab first. ""Bob (Shapiro) is representing her,"" Lohan wrote. ""But tell me, why is (it) that I had to cry from the mountain for Lindsay to listen to me, and now finally she is doing what I said? None of this would have happened if Lindsay and (her mother) Dina had. I was telling Dina and Lindsay this for years now. I just pray that they implement everything else I said, like getting clean off all meds, asking the court to go to rehab first and then reevaluate Lindsay's incarceration."" Michael Lohan, who is divorced and reportedly has a rocky relationship with his daughter, also wrote that he hopes Lindsay picks ""all new friends and management, and finally that Dina (attends) counseling with Lindsay and me. I thank Mr. Shapiro and think he will agree with my suggestions, since unfortunately, he has been down this road as well. It doesn't matter who takes the credit, Dina or Bob. As long as Lindsay gets off the meds and listens to me, that's all I care about.""

"A finding that Hezbollah is to blame for the bomb attack that killed five Israeli tourists in Bulgaria last July adds to pressure on the European Union to label the controversial group an outlaw terrorist organization. The Bulgarian government's announcement of its conclusions Tuesday also could complicate life for Lebanon's coalition government, of which Hezbollah is a member. Israelis killed in Bulgaria bus terror attack, minister says . Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov told reporters in Sofia that of the three people who carried out the attack, ""We have established that two were members of the militant wing of Hezbollah. There is information that shows financing and the connection between Hezbollah and the two suspects."" He also said the pair had traveled on genuine Australian and Canadian passports, though it's not clear whether the documents had been stolen. Bulgaria explosion comes amid growing Iranian-Israeli tension . Hezbollah has said nothing about Israel's previous accusation that it was responsible for the attack, which occurred outside a bus waiting at the airport in the Bulgarian resort of Burgas. The United States and Israel seized on the conclusion of the Bulgarian investigation to urge the EU to move against Hezbollah. President Barack Obama's counterterrorism adviser, John Brennan, said Tuesday the investigation had exposed Hezbollah as ""a terrorist group that is willing to recklessly attack innocent men, women, and children, and that poses a real and growing threat not only to Europe, but to the rest of the world."" Read more: The inner workings of Hezbollah . In a statement issued from the White House, Brennan said, ""Bulgaria's implication of (Hezbollah) underscores the importance of international cooperation in disrupting terrorist threats. ""We call on our European partners as well as other members of the international community to take proactive action to uncover (Hezbollah's) infrastructure and disrupt the group's financing schemes and operational networks."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry reiterated the call for European countries to ""crack down on Hezbollah."" ""We need to send an unequivocal message to this terrorist group that it can no longer engage in despicable actions with impunity,"" he said in a statement. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also commended the Bulgarian investigation, saying: ""The attack in Burgas was an attack on European soil against a member country of the EU. We hope that the Europeans draw the necessary conclusions as to the true character of Hezbollah."" Bulgarian bus attack is work of suicide bomber, minister says . Canada also joined the chorus, with Foreign Minister John Baird issuing a statement saying: ""We urge the European Union and all partners who have not already done so to list Hezbollah as a terrorist entity and prosecute terrorist acts committed by this inhumane organization to the fullest possible extent."" A technical analysis of the explosion, carried out by a team of consultants and provided on background to CNN, said the Israeli tourists had placed their luggage in a baggage compartment along the side of the bus and were boarding when the explosion occurred. The bomb -- concealed in a backpack -- went off in a confined space between two buses, instantly killing four of the tourists and the bus driver, as well as the bomber. The consultants' analysis of closed-circuit video of the suspected bomber waiting in the terminal and of the remains of the device suggests that the bomb was detonated by remote radio control. Residue from two radio transceivers was recovered from the scene, along with a dual-tone multiple-frequency circuit. The explosive charge was approximately 3 kilograms (6 pounds) of TNT and ammonite, probably obtained from a Bulgarian company, according to the consultants. Police release composite image of Bulgaria bus bomber . Whether the bomber intended to kill himself is unclear. It is possible that he planned to load the backpack on the bus and detonate it remotely as it pulled away. The premature detonation of the device before all members of the Israeli group were on board the bus could have been caused by a malfunction or by violent movement, or it could have happened as the device was being armed. Alternatively, an accomplice could have detonated the bomb from a nearby vantage point, in which case the bomber may have been deceived about his true role in the attack. Read more: Iran in ""open war"" with Israel . Bulgarian investigators last month said their evidence was that the bombing was not intended as a suicide attack. Analysts say the attack was not that of a ""lone wolf"" but rather required planning and reconnaissance, suggesting a well-orchestrated plan. Last year, Matthew Olsen, director of the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center, said in a congressional hearing that the Bulgarian attack could have been part of a growing international campaign of terror attacks by Hezbollah. ""Since May 2008, Hezbollah plots against Israeli targets in Azerbaijan, Egypt and Israel have been disrupted, and additional operational activity in Turkey has reportedly been uncovered,"" Olsen said. But while the United States has stepped up efforts to interdict Hezbollah's international financial operations, the group has enjoyed greater freedom in Europe. Germany's annual threat report in 2012 concluded that nearly 1,000 Hezbollah members and supporters lived there. Hezbollah raises money quietly in several European cities, according to intelligence agencies, to support its extensive network of social programs in Lebanon. Experts: Hezbollah positioned for attack in U.S . Only the Netherlands among the main European governments describes Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. Britain distinguishes between its military wing -- which is proscribed -- and its work as a political party in Lebanon. France and other EU states do not characterize any part of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. If the European Union moves toward unified sanctions against Hezbollah, the current Lebanese coalition government led by Prime Minister Najib Mikati may be in jeopardy . Mohanad Hage Ali, a Lebanese expert on Hezbollah based at the London School of Economics, told CNN, ""Since Mikati formed his government two years ago, there has been steady European support. But since Hezbollah is part of this government, more EU member states are likely to dissociate themselves from Mikati's government"" if the link with the Bulgaria bombing is confirmed. ""Since the 1980s,"" he added, ""the United States listing of Hezbollah on its list of terrorist organizations has been seen as a unilateral act, while the Lebanese party was improving its international relations, especially with EU states. This may now change."" Mikati said Tuesday his government is ""ready to cooperate in clarifying the circumstances"" of the attack ""in fairness and safeguarding justice,"" but he did not address the accusations against Hezbollah . Hage Ali said that if Hezbollah were designated a terrorist group by the EU it would virtually eliminate the European role in mediating between Hezbollah and Israel on such issues as negotiating prisoner exchanges. Germany has been especially active in mediating on humanitarian issues. But there have been signals in the past few months from senior figures in Angela Merkel's coalition that the mood is shifting. Last August, the foreign policy spokesman for Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, Philipp Missfelder, told the Jerusalem Post it was ""long overdue to place Hezbollah on the EU's list of terror organizations."" The British foreign secretary, William Hague, has also called on the EU to reopen discussions on Hezbollah's status.","Bulgaria announces that Hezbollah was behind a fatal attack in July .

"(CNN) -- ""Are you running for president?"" ""When will you announce that you're running for president?"" ""Why won't you just announce that you're running for president?"" ""You wouldn't be have gone to Iowa if you weren't running for president, would you? Despite the world aflame, Ebola spreading and the Washington Nationals in the playoffs, it seems the only thing the political press can do is speculate about a potential Hillary presidential candidacy. Keep in mind we are two years and two months away from the next presidential election. And yet the urgency is fierce, bordering on indignation: ""Why won't she just tell us if she's running?"" Well, why should she? An announcement now would be stupid, and Hillary is definitely not stupid. If she were to go Open Kimono on us now it would draw attention from crucial midterm elections, siphon campaign donations from Democrats struggling to hold onto the Senate and possibly even eclipse important debates on how to fight ISIS and whether to shut down the government (again). There is little such insistence about, say, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie or Indiana Gov. Mike Pence or even two-time loser Mitt Romney. We presume they're running -- just as most folks presume Hillary is. But we're not hectoring them at every turn; we're not resentful that they haven't made a formal announcement. Probably because we just don't care as much about them. They're not leading in the polls by a million points (nor will Hillary, if and when a campaign is underway), and they simply do not rivet the national attention the way the former first lady, former senator, former secretary of state and future (?!) first female president does. I have not been in touch with Hillary, so I do not speak with intimate knowledge. But I have known her for -- jeez, 23 years. And I actually believe her when she says she has not completely made up her mind. Hillary is a wonk who's had to learn the rhythms of campaigning. That's very different from, say, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a glad-handing natural for whom it can be said that if an idea wanted to cross his mind it would need to bring a canteen. Hillary believes politics should be about ideas -- a clash of visions, of competing plans to promote the general welfare and provide for the common defense. This, after all, is a woman who rings in each New Year by standing and singing ""God Bless America."" But there are aspects of campaigning that she loves: a vigorous honest, face-to-face debate; a town hall meeting in which folks ask substantive questions; meeting people who pour their hearts out to her, who hold their baby daughters up to her, who share their hopes and their heartbreaks with her. So I can imagine that there is an angel on her shoulder whispering, ""Who needs it?"" Who needs the phoniness, the vacuity, the mind-numbing, bone-wearying, soul-crushing grind? But on the other shoulder stands another angel, whispering, ""Because it's worth it."" If you care about, say, universal pre-kindergarten -- an issue Hillary has cared about and worked on for decades -- or finding ways to stimulate job growth; if you care about peace abroad and supporting our military families at home; if you care about the climate crisis and full equality for LGBT Americans and voting rights and a million other issues: the best way to make turn those ideas into action is through the presidency. Hillary will decide soon enough. In the meantime, let's let her listen to both of the angels debating for her heart. And maybe we can even give her a little breathing room as she becomes a grandmother. We have plenty of other potential presidential candidates. I suspect they'd love the attention.","The political media wants to know why Hillary Clinton went to Iowa recently .

"T.J. Lane, a remorseless killer who escaped from an Ohio prison where he was serving three life sentences for a school shooting, has been captured. For six long hours, police scoured neighborhoods on the north end of Lima, Ohio, asking residents to lock their doors and stay inside. They brought in extra officers and provided patrols to the families of Lane's victims. In the end, he was found 100 yards away outside a church, the prison warden said. He didn't say anything, nor did he put up a fight, authorities said. Lane was serving consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole for his attack at Chardon High School on February 27, 2012. He walked in to the school cafeteria with a .22-caliber gun and randomly started shooting.  He fired 10 rounds, killing three students. The 19-year-old scaled a fence at the Allen Oakwood Correctional Institution in Lima, about 90 miles northwest of Columbus, Warden Kevin Jones said. ""He wasn't in the maximum-security facility. That is something we have to sit down and take a look at."" Lane escaped, along with two other men, about 7:40 p.m. Thursday. He was back in custody about shortly after 1 a.m. Friday. ""You never plan on someone escaping and certainly someone of that notoriety, you would think that they would take special precautions to prevent this,"" Ian Friedman, who represented him at his trial, said late Thursday. ""This was a huge case here in Ohio.  So, everyone in Ohio is shocked right now."" Friends, family remember Ohio school shooting victims . Prison infractions . The Allen Oakwood Correctional Institution houses about 1,600 inmates guarded by 257 security personnel. A Correctional Institution Inspection Committee report in April said the facility was over capacity by 217 inmates. In addition, the number of inmate assaults on staff increased by 60.7% last year, compared with 2012. No escapes were mentioned in the report. In the 18 months he's been there, Lane was disciplined seven times, according to The Plain Dealer newspaper. The infractions ranged from urinating on a wall to giving himself a tattoo, the paper said. Lane escaped with Clifford E. Opperud, 45, who was serving time for aggravated robbery, and another man. All three have been captured. Chardon is about 190 miles away from Lima. ""We're upset this happened,"" said Ron Parmetor, whose nephew Daniel Parmetor, 16,  was one of Lane's victims. Parmetor says he wants answers; how could Lane just escape? The other two victims were Demetrius Hewlin, 16, and Russell King Jr., 17. Chardon schools will be closed Friday, but counselors and other support services will be provided, the school district superintendent said. Community shaken . Chardon is a community of 5,100 people, some 30 miles east of Cleveland. It was shaken by the shooting at the high school, and further traumatized by Lane's behavior in court. Lane pleaded guilty last year to three counts of aggravated murder, two counts of attempted aggravated murder and weapons-related charges. But he never offered an explanation. He was sentenced to consecutive sentences of life without parole and additional sentences totaling 37 years. At the sentencing hearing, Lane unbuttoned his blue dress shirt to reveal a white T-shirt on which he had scrawled the word ""KILLER"" across the front. He had on a similar shirt during his shooting rampage. Before the sentencing, he addressed the victims' families using profane imagery and ending with the expletive, ""F--- all of you."" He then held up his middle finger. ""For everyone in that courtroom -- the victims, their families, the prosecutors, defense -- everyone in that courtroom was just absolutely taken aback,"" said Friedman, who hasn't talked to Lane in about a year. ""There was no way to fully comprehend what happened in the courtroom that afternoon."" T.J. Lane tightlipped about motive, escape .

"(CNN)On what would have been the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 86th birthday, the Academy Awards decided to snub a beautiful film made about a seminal moment in his life. ""Selma"" did pick up two nominations, including one for best picture. But when the Hollywood gods consider a film to be truly great, its actors and/or actresses, screenplay and particularly its director are also recognized. ""Selma"" is a good film that told a great story, at least according to Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences voters. Those voters are 93% white, 76% male and the average age is 63, according to a 2012 analysis by the Los Angeles Times. But did those demographics play a role in how ""Selma"" was received? True, the historical drama has been besieged by criticism over accuracy, particularly its portrayal of President Lyndon Johnson. In the film, King and Johnson are depicted as a lot more adversarial than the actual tapes of their conversation suggests. But it's hard to see that being the reason for its snub: ""Gravity"" was nominated for 10 Oscars, won seven, and yet you won't find an astronaut who would describe the film as accurate. And ""Dallas Buyer's Club"" was also a 2014 Oscar darling that sprinkled creative liberties all over a true story. Race could be invoked as a factor when you remember the email exchange between two top-level Sony executives that became public courtesy of  ""The Interview"" hack. In it they joked about the kind of movie President Obama prefers and then began listing only those starring black people. But the two were also unkind to Jeffrey Katzenberg in that same exchange. There were backstabbing remarks revealed in emails about Angelina Jolie and Adam Sandler as well. My point is -- and I'm sure I'm at risk of losing my black card for writing this -- when those same old, white men made ""12 Years A Slave"" a favorite of the Oscars just a year ago, it is hard to say the snubbing of ""Selma"" is all about the demographics of the voters. Some, sure. But all? Remember, these people live in a land of make believe, where it's normal for the inhabitants to be injected with silicone. Oscar snubbings could come from a thousand superficial reasons, like someone sleeping with or not sleeping with the right person at the right time. In a town full of gay men, the heart wrenching ""Brokeback Mountain"" somehow lost out to the woefully mediocre ""Crash."" Leonardo DiCaprio's trophy case continues to sit empty. And I will never understand how ""Shakespeare in Love"" beat ""Saving Private Ryan"" for best picture. Truth be told. my favorite film of 2014 was ""The Drop"" and I don't think that was nominated for anything by anyone. It would have been wonderful to see ""Selma"" director Ava DuVernay become the first black female director nominated for an Oscar. She is incredibly talented and it is always nice to be recognized by peers. But I do not need her to win an Oscar to tell me how I should feel about ""Selma."" I do not need the Academy to tell me how I should spend my money at the movies. I do not need old, white men to validate a story so deeply personal and relevant to me today. That's not to suggest Hollywood's racism should not be called out. Only that the true story of Selma is much more than calling out racism. To paraphrase the acceptance speech Common gave at the Golden Globes on Sunday, ""Selma"" the movie and Selma the historic marches are about the awakening of our humanity. The old guard at the Oscars has the power to snub ""Selma"" for whatever reason it sees fit. But as a summer full of marches for the fight for equality reminded us, Hollywood has neither the power to snub nor the authority to validate Selma.","LZ: ""Selma's"" 2 Oscar nominations seen as a snub by some; Academy voters mostly white .

"(CNN)It was billed as a top of the table clash that would determine the fate of the English Premier League title. Instead, Saturday evening's dull 1-1 draw between leaders Chelsea and current champions Manchester City did little more than preserve the status quo. Manchester City traveled to west London five points behind Chelsea, knowing that victory would take a large chunk out of that lead. Also traveling was Manchester City's Frank Lampard, who until last season played for Chelsea and remains their record goal scorer. His controversial move to Manchester City, when it had been thought he had signed for MLS team New York City FC, had angered many Chelsea supporters, giving extra spice to the clash. But there was little drama in a largely benign encounter, with Chelsea showing signs of fatigue after their midweek exertions against Liverpool in the League Cup. Cagey . After a cagey opening half, the game did briefly come to life after Chelsea's French international striker Loic Remy fired the home side into a lead which only lasted a few minutes. Manchester City quickly equalized when Spain international David Silva converted after a rare mistake by Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. Manchester City dominated the second half without creating any more clean cut chances. Indeed, Chelsea would fail to register a single shot on target after their goal. The game did come to life again briefly when Lampard came on as a late substitute. Despite some boos, he was given a largely warm reception back at a club where he scored a record 211 goals in all competitions. But Lampard couldn't find the breakthrough either as the two teams shared the spoils. Standing ovation . ""They had a big old game midweek,"" Lampard told Sky Sports after the game, referring to Wednesday's match against Liverpool. ""it was a good performance all round without the electricity the big games need. Chelsea, I think, accepted the point."" After the game Lampard was given a standing ovation from the home side, something he was denied before leaving in the close season. ""It felt a bit strange and I was excited about today but a bit nervous too. I knew this would be different,"" Lampard said of his return. ""I was delighted with the reception from both fans,"" he added. ""They [Chelsea fans] showed complete class by giving me an ovation at the end, which I didn't get a chance to see at the end of last season."" Manchester United gain . Earlier in the day Manchester United beat bottom of the table Leicester City 3-1, lifting them up to third. The reverse fixture last year was arguably coach Louis Van Gaal lowest moment in the job. His United team somehow conspired to turn a 3-1 lead into a 5-3 defeat but there was little chance of a repeat at Old Trafford. Goals from Robin van Persie, Falcao and an own goal by Wes Morgan before half time handed United an unassailable lead. Leicester City scored a consolation through Marcin Wasilewski, but it was too late for the Midlands club to mount another comeback. Sturridge returns . Liverpool maintained their recent run of good form with a 2-0 victory against West Ham United. West Ham have not won at Anfield since 1963 -- a game in which England's 1966 World Cup hero Geoff Hurst scored twice -- so little was expected of the visiting side. Liverpool eventually took the lead through Raheem Sterling but it was the return of striker Daniel Sturridge that had the Kop on their feet. With Luis Suarez now at Barcelona and Sturridge injured for much of the season, Liverpool have struggled for goals. But the England international scored shorty after coming on, giving Liverpool another boost in their efforts to secure a Champions League spot. Two of the teams in contention for fourth place in the league, Arsenal and Southampton, play against Aston Villa and Swansea respectively on Sunday.","Chelsea and Man City play out 1-1 draw .

"Marcia Clark knows her way around a courtroom. She spent years as a deputy district attorney in Los Angeles. She became a household name as the lead prosecutor in the O.J. Simpson murder trial, one of the only cases she ever lost. Clark left that life behind a long time ago, but she's still mining her past, only now as a successful crime novelist. Clark published her first novel, ""Guilt by Association,"" last year to strong sales and positive reviews. It featured Rachel Knight, a strong-willed deputy district attorney in Los Angeles, with a deep sense of justice and a bit of a rebellious streak. Sound like anyone familiar? Now Rachel Knight returns in ""Guilt by Degrees,"" which hits book stores May 8. This time out Rachel is looking for a homeless man's killer. In her investigation she uncovers a connection to the brutal murder of a Los Angeles police officer. As Rachel gets closer to the truth, she becomes the target of a cunning psychopath. Given her background, it's no surprise that Clark's writing crackles with authenticity. The courtroom exchanges in her latest novel are crisp and brimming with tension. The lawyers, cops and bad guys feel real. The story is fast-paced and will keep readers interested to the end. While Clark closed the door on her career as a prosecutor, she continues to stay active with the law by working on appellate court cases. She's also a frequent legal commentator and analyst for several TV networks, including CNN, but Clark says writing has become her real passion. She recently talked to CNN from her home in Los Angeles. The following is an edited transcript: . CNN: I understand you're a longtime fan of crime fiction. When did you know you wanted to be a writer? Clark: This has been a lifelong addiction for me. It started with Nancy Drew. She was my hero. I loved reading those stories. When I was 10 or 11 I cracked her code. I figured out the formula that every time her dad went out of town she caught a case. I was still fascinated. Then I graduated into crime fiction of the adult variety. I was so addicted that even when I was a prosecutor I was reading murder mysteries, authors like James Ellroy and watching ""Law & Order,"" as well as doing it for real all day long. So that's obsessed. CNN: It seems like you share a lot in common with your heroine, Rachel Knight. How autobiographical are your books? Clark: I share traits in common with all the characters. I don't know if there's a way to avoid putting yourself into each and every character, the bad guys as well as the good ones. I'd like to try because I certainly don't want the book to be about me, but it is about a female prosecutor so there's going to be things in common. I was only conscious of giving her my bad traits. I think of Rachel as being so much better than me, with the exception of the places where she's like me and then she's not so good. CNN: How did being a prosecutor help you in becoming a writer? Clark: First of all, the experience of meeting the kind of people that you meet being a criminal attorney, whether its prosecutor or defense attorney, is unmatchable. There's nothing like it. There's no duplicating that in any other job or career. You run into worlds of people you would never ordinarily meet. That gives you a sense of the kinds of characters that are out there. As a criminal lawyer, especially as a prosecutor, you have to be able to tell a story and put that story together as cogently as possible and then try to present it as cogently as possible. You do set up a case with the idea in mind that you're going to be telling a story as effectively, as comprehensively, and as dramatically as you can. Now judges can get in the way of that, every time an objection gets sustained and every time you get a bad ruling things can go awry. You can't control it all, but you try. CNN: What kind of feedback have you had from other lawyers? Clark: From what I've heard so far they agree that it feels spot on. What I was trying to do was capture more than the technical and procedural details, because sometimes I had to bend those rules, shorten time frames and things like that. If I have to start talking about the backlog at the crime lab or how long it takes to get a rape kit tested -- snore! I need to tighten that up and make it sound like we can get our results as fast as we wish we could. Other than that, I wanted to share the feeling of camaraderie among prosecutors and police officers, the kind of humor they share, their dialogue, the way they're always needling each other, messing with each other, that kind of sense of sharing a world together, I wanted to convey that feeling. The people who have read the books who are in the business tell me it feels very real. CNN: Do you miss your days in court? Clark: I get as much as I want from doing appellate work. I handle criminal appeals. That's something you can do from home. You review transcripts for technical errors and you write briefs, so it's all written. It keeps me up to speed with how cases are being tried today, as opposed to back when I was in court. It keeps me up to speed with the technology they're using in courtrooms, the kinds of crimes that are being prosecuted, the kinds of criminals that are coming through. So it keeps me fresh that way. I really don't miss the trials and courtroom appearances. CNN: As a legal analyst, I expect you're following the Trayvon Martin case. What's your take? Clark: I would expect now what's going to happen is this is going to go away for quite some time. If I'm a defense attorney what I want is for everybody to calm down, go away and forget about the case and let tempers cool. Because right now it's still very hot, there's a lot of hard feelings and emotion in the air. That's the last thing the defense wants if you go to trial under these circumstances. So, I would expect the defense to do everything they can to delay the trial and it wouldn't surprise me if it took at least a year to get into court. CNN: Is this a case you would have wanted to prosecute? Clark: I can't say there's any case I look at and say, ""Gee, I wish I was the prosecutor."" I'm really done. I've really closed that door. CNN: What's next for you? Clark: I'm sticking with the books. I'm wrapping up book three right now and then jumping into book four.

"""He never asked nor accepted any reward, because he was good and simple and did not think that one did good for a reward."" (Primo Levi, If This Is A Man) Gino Bartali wanted to keep it to himself. How could a man, so famous and so revered, keep it a secret for so long? ""Good is something you do, not something you talk about,"" Bartali once explained. ""Some medals are pinned to your soul, not to your jacket."" He was Italy's very own version of Babe Ruth -- a man whose personality, character and success transcended sport. In the 1930s, Bartali, a son of Tuscany, was one of the leading cyclists in the world, a man admired by all. He had won three Giro d'Italia titles -- one of the three major European cycling events -- in addition to his triumph at the 1938 Tour de France and was very much the country's poster boy. And yet for a man who lived in his life in the full glare of the public, a new film, My Italian Secret reveals a very different side to Bartali's remarkable life. Directed by Oren Jacoby, the film shows how Bartali was part of a secret Italian resistance movement which helped hide the country's Jews during the Nazi invasion of 1943. Using the handlebars on his bike to hide counterfeit identity papers, Bartali would ride to Jews in hiding and deliver their exit visas which allowed them to escape transportation to the death camps -- he is credited with saving the lives of 800 people. ""He never talked about what he did during World War II,"" said Jacoby. People loved him, they adored him. Italy was so proud of him. ""He risked his life to save others and it's a story which Italy is now embracing."" Wheels of fortune . Born in Florence in 1914, Bartali was a devout Catholic whose parents were married by the local Cardinal, Elia Angelo Dalla Costa. It was Dalla Costa who recruited Bartali into his secret network at a time where much of  Italy had been ceded to the Nazis. In 1938, Italy's Fascist regime, led by Benito Mussolini, enacted a series of anti-Semtiic laws which prevented Jews from working within government or education, banned intermarriage and removed them from positions in the media. While some of the country's Jews fled the country before the outbreak of World War II, those who stayed behind remained largely unscathed until the Germans began deportations in 1943. It was at this time that Dalla Costa, working with Rabbi Nathan Cassuto, created a system which involved convents, monasteries and members of the general public hiding Jews in all kinds of ingenious ways. Even after Cassuto was arrested by the Germans, deported and sent to his death, the secret network continued to operate. Using the guise of long-distance training, Bartali would ride for hundreds of miles delivering documents while the Fascist secret police simply let him pass given their admiration for the cyclist. Whenever he was stopped, he would simply ask that his bike not be touched since the technical set up was arranged to achieve maximum speed. Eventually, Bartali was forced to go into hiding in the town of Citta Di Castello in Umbria, where he hid the Goldenberg family. In the book, Road to Valour written by siblings Aili and Andres McConnon, Giorgio Goldenberg recalls how Bartali's actions helped save his life and the lives of his family. ""There is no doubt whatsoever for me that he saved our lives,"" said Goldenberg, who hid in Bartali's cellar until the liberation of Florence in 1944. ""He not only saved our lives but he helped save the lives of hundreds of people. He put his own life and his family's in danger in order to do so. ""In my opinion, he was a hero and he is entitled to be called a hero of the Italian people during World War II."" It was not just the rescued who were grateful to Bartali, those who were involved in creating the counterfeit papers in Assisi also took courage from the cyclist's fearlessness. Worked in the counterfeiting business, Trento Brizi  explained how Bartali's influence gave him courage at a time where the Nazis began to get suspicious. In the book, Road to Valor, Brizi said: ""The idea of taking part in an organization that could boast of a champion like Gino Bartali among its ranks, filled me with such pride that my fear took a back seat."" According to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust museum in Jerusalem, 7,680 out of 44,500 Italian Jews were killed by the Nazis. While many Italians helped defy Adolf Hitler's attempts to cleanse Europe of Jews, Bartali's high-profile meant he risked playing a dangerous game. And yet, according to Aili McConnon, he refused to take any credit for his role in saving Jewish lives. ""He was very modest about it,"" she told CNN. ""He held a profound sense that so many had suffered in a much greater capacity than he had. He didn't want to be in the spotlight or diminish the contributions of others. ""As a cyclist and competitor, he could be a real loudmouth. He was very proud and very competitive. ""But what made him so fascinating, was his other side -- the modesty which he possessed."" ""Real Heroes"" In September 2013, Bartali's wartime heroism was honored in Israel when he was named as a ""Righteous Among the Nations"" by Yad Vashem -- Israel's official memorial to Holocaust victims. While Bartali rarely spoke of his actions before he passed away in 2000, his son, Andrea, attended the ceremony and met survivors, including Goldenberg, who had been helped by his father's actions. It was Andrea who helped push his father's war time contribution into the public consciousness following years in secrecy. ""When people were telling him 'Gino, you're a hero,' ""He would reply, 'No, no. I want to be remembered for my sporting achievements,'"" Andrea Bartali told reporters upon his visit to Israel in 2013. ""Real heroes are others, those who have suffered in their soul, in their heart, in their spirit, in their mind, for their loved ones. Those are the real heroes. I'm just a cyclist."" My Italian Secret has already had a profound affect on Italian society. Its showing at the Rome Film Festival was widely lauded by critics and has helped Italy begin to acknowledge its past, according to Jacoby. ""We were overwhelmed by the response the film got in Italy,"" added the film's director, whose Jewish heritage comes through his father's side. ""I think this topic had not been touched on or thought about since the war. It was a chance for Italy to come to terms to get to grips with chapter of history it hadn't addressed."" Having spent a summer in Rome as a 19-year-old, the story of Italy's Jews and how ordinary Italians managed to defy the Nazis had always been at the back of Jacoby's mind. While he spent time learning from some of the great Italian directors such as Federico Fellini (Casanova), Ina Wertmuller (Seven Beauties), and Pier Paolo Pasolini (Salo), it was a meeting with a Polish filmmaker which left a lasting impression. ""One day, the professor who ran the course, a Polish filmmaker named Marian Marzynski, took me to lunch in a café in the Rome ghetto, meters away from a plaque memorializing the roundup of Rome's Jews in 1943,"" recalled Jacoby. ""He told me how he had survived the Warsaw Ghetto as a hidden child, protected first by ordinary people and later, by priests in a monastery, who all risked their lives to help him escape. ""I never thought, back in 1975, that almost 40 years later I would be given the opportunity to tell the story of Italian children who were hidden and saved, along with the story of Gino Bartali and some of the other heroes who risked their lives to do it."" 'Il Morbo di K' While Bartali's heroics have caught much of the attention, the story of physician Giovanni Borromeo is equally remarkable. It was by chance that Jacoby, filming in Rome during an early shoot, came into contact with Borromeo's son, Pietro. ""We heard that a guy wanted to get in touch with us about the film,"" recalled Jacoby. ""So he came and met us for lunch and what he told us was incredible -- absolutely incredible."" Dr Borromeo was a Roman surgeon who worked in the Catholic Fatebenefratelli Hospital on Tiberina Island in Rome. There he hid hundreds of Jews after concocting a tale of a ""deadly"" disease which had engulfed the hospital. ""Dr Borromeo invented a fake disease to scare the Nazis off and prevent them from searching the hospital,"" said Jacoby. ""He called it 'Il Morbo di K' and used it to protect the Jewish people who he was hiding. ""He would say to the Nazis, 'hey, you guys can come in but you'll get this disease and it could kill you'. ""He saved many people -- but it didn't really hit home until some of those he saved turned up at our screening. That was incredible."" Bartali remained intent on being remembered for his cycling success -- his second Tour de France in 1948 was remarkable given it came a decade after his first victory. It was only later on in life after meeting Cassuto's daughter that he agreed to speak about his experiences, though he insisted that he would not be recorded. While Bartali's cycling achievements are remembered each year in an event dedicated to him and fierce rival, Fausto Coppi -- the annual Settimana Coppi e Bartali race -- his legacy in the wider world lives on. ""He hid us in spite of knowing that the Germans were killing everybody who was hiding Jews,"" Goldenberg's son, Giorgio, says in Jacoby's film. ""He was risking not only his life but also his family. Gino Bartali saved my life and the life of my family. That's clear because if he hadn't hidden us, we had nowhere to go.""","Gino Bartali helped save over 800 Jews during the Holocaust .

"At one point in the 2012 presidential campaign, each of Mitt Romney's tweets had to be approved by nearly two dozen aides in the lead-up to the Republican's loss to President Barack Obama, a new study says. The figure is included in a University of North Carolina study published Friday. The study cites Caitlin Checkett, Romney's digital integration director, who says that each post -- on Twitter, Facebook, the campaign's blog or elsewhere -- had to be approved by an ever-growing roster of the campaign's operatives. ""Towards the end of the campaign that was 22 individuals who had to approve it. ... The digital team unfortunately did not have the opportunity to think of things on their own and post them. ... The downfall of that of course is as fast as we are moving it can take a little bit of time to get that approval to happen,"" she says. Romney's digital director, Zac Moffatt, concurred, saying the campaign had ""the best tweets ever written by 17 people ... it was the best they all could agree on every single time."" That enough Romney aides to play a football game had to approve each tweet underscores major differences in approaches between Obama's digitally-savvy campaign and the clunkier operations it defeated -- including Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary and Romney in 2012. The study's author is Daniel Kreiss, an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina who researches political communication. He wrote that ""in contrast to the Obama campaign, Romney's digital team had to go through an extensive vetting process for all of its public communications, meaning that the temporal workflow of the campaign did not match the speed of social media."" Kreiss wrote that the Romney campaign's digital team felt undermined by its lack of autonomy. By the campaign's conclusion, he wrote, Romney staffers were repackaging press releases for use on social media because they knew that language had already been green-lighted.","A new study says each Mitt Romney tweet had to be approved by 22 campaign staffers .

"Shortly after O.J. Simpson was charged with the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald Goldman, gruesome killings turned into a manhunt. Simpson -- a Heisman Trophy winner, NFL Hall-of-Famer and actor -- was missing. Police declared Simpson a fugitive, and hours later, the infamous low-speed chase began. Approximately 6:45 p.m. on June 17, 1994, police saw Simpson on the expressway in a white Ford Bronco driven by his best friend and former teammate, Al Cowlings. Simpson was riding in the back, and he reportedly had a gun. With the cavalcade of police cars in pursuit, TV helicopters swooped in to join the chase. The 60-mile, low-speed pursuit through southern Los Angeles would go down in television history. Nearly 20 years later, here are five things that might surprise you about the chase. Fast facts: O.J. Simpson . 1. The Bronco chase and subsequent ""not guilty"" verdict are among the most memorable TV moments in the past 50 years. The Simpson verdict was the third most ""universally impactful"" televised moment of the last 50 years behind the September 11, 2001, attacks and Hurricane Katrina in 2005, according to a survey by Nielsen and Sony. Big shift in attitude toward O.J. Simpson . Simpson's white Bronco chase came in sixth, behind the Challenger space shuttle disaster and the death of Osama bin Laden. The survey scored each big televised event based on how many people viewed the event live, how many could recall details about where they were during the event and how many people who could remember talking about it with other people. 2. The Bronco chase dominated sports coverage on a day with major sports news. On June 17, 1994, legendary golfer Arnold Palmer played his last round at the U.S. Open, the World Cup opened in Chicago, the Rangers celebrated winning the Stanley Cup, the Knicks played game five of the NBA finals against the Houston Rockets, and Ken Griffey Jr. tied Babe Ruth for the most home runs hit before June 30. ESPN covered the other big sporting news, but jumped back and forth for frequent updates on the chase. NBC continued coverage of the NBA finals, but the game appeared in a small box in the corner while Tom Brokaw anchored coverage of the Bronco chase. 3. Domino's Pizza reported record sales of pizza delivery during the chase. Presumably because people were glued to the TV set, not wanting to miss anything, they ordered pizza. ""It was a record night at the time. It was dinner time on the West Coast and 9 p.m. on the East. People were fascinated and didn't want to miss it. It was as big as a Super Bowl Sunday up to that point,"" said Tim McIntyre, vice president of corporate communications for Domino's Pizza. 4. Robert Kardashian, father of Kourtney, Kim, Khloé and Rob, was O. J. Simpson's friend. He read a note by Simpson on the day of the chase and served with his defense team during Simpson's murder trial. When Simpson failed to turn himself in on the day of the case, Robert Kardashian read a letter by Simpson to the media. This letter was interpreted by many as a suicide note: . ""To whom it may concern, first, everyone understand I had nothing to do with Nicole's murder. ... Don't feel sorry for me. I've had a great life, great friends. Please think of the real O.J. and not this lost person. Thanks for making my life special. I hope I helped yours,"" he read. 5. O.J. Simpson said he was not running, but he had some interesting items with him when the chase ended. During the chase, on the phone with LAPD Detective Tom Lange, Simpson said, ""...you let the police know, you let them all know, I wasn't running."" When Cowlings pulled into Simpson's driveway, police were waiting. The sun set, and Simpson was still holed up in the car. Police didn't approach the Bronco. Simpson had a gun, and they wanted to avoid a potentially violent end. Finally, two hours after police first spotted him, Simpson emerged from the Bronco. Clutching family photos, he staggered out of his car and collapsed into officers' arms. In Cowlings' pockets, police found almost $9,000 in cash. In the Bronco, police found a fake goatee and mustache with a bottle of makeup adhesive and receipts from a beauty store, along with Simpson's passport and the gun.

"(CNN) -- King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia has left a New York hospital to recuperate at his home in the city, the official Saudi Press Agency said Wednesday. The king left the New York Presbyterian Hospital / Weill Cornell Medical Center Tuesday night, the news agency said citing the Royal Court.

He had a successful follow-up back surgery on December 3 to stabilize several vertebrae in his spine, the agency said earlier. The king traveled to the United States for treatment of a herniated spinal disc and a blood clot that was causing him back pain, Saudi state media reported. Abdullah, 86, had named Crown Prince Sultan to administer the state's affairs in the monarch's absence, the state-run Saudi Press Agency reported at the time. The top three figures in the kingdom -- Abdullah, Sultan and Prince Nayef, the country's interior minister and second deputy prime minister -- are all sons of King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud, who founded modern Saudi Arabia in 1932. Abdullah has ruled the oil-rich kingdom since the August 2005 death of his half-brother, King Fahd. But Abdullah ran most of the kingdom's affairs for a decade before that on behalf of his ailing half-brother.

"(CNN) -- Mark McGwire deserves a ban from baseball more than any sympathy. It is sad to hear his quavery confession of a career filled with steroids, his sorrow over the pain it caused his family and fans, his revelation of a life of lies that burned inside him like a hidden disease and consumed the game he loved. But for those of us who also love baseball, the damage he did was too deep and his further threat to the integrity of the game is too great to justify his return. McGwire's entire playing career is indelibly stained and his judgment is not to be trusted. What else are we to make of a man who cheated and didn't come clean for 20 years? Can he be trusted to coach other players who may be using steroids? Is he fit for any job that is also a test of character and personal standards? Baseball should bar him from coaching and never again allow his name on a Hall of Fame ballot. St. Louis manager Tony La Russa, McGwire's longtime apologist, is leading the charge to rehabilitate him in his new role as the Cardinals' batting coach, saying Monday's admission and expression of regret is worthy of respect. This from a manager who either closed his eyes to drug use on his teams, didn't know what he should have known, or kept conspiratorially silent about it through all the years with McGwire on the Oakland Athletics (along with Jose Canseco) and on the Cards. So, too, with commissioner Bud Selig and the Cardinals' general manager and the players who would like to see the whole cancer of steroids in baseball vanish in a wash of tears and belated contrition. Not so fast. A mea culpa doesn't undo the enormous harm that McGwire and his pumped-up colleagues inflicted on baseball -- worse than all the gambling that has kept Pete Rose out of the Hall of Fame and from returning to the game. SI.com: Time to forgive McGwire . McGwire chose the wrong path years ago and stayed on it -- making the mistake of all public figures who try to stonewall their way out of trouble, from Richard Nixon to Tiger Woods. In the end, everybody knows and many will forgive, but the guilty have to live with the consequences of their transgressions. When I  saw the then-legal steroid androstenedione in his locker and reported it during his glorious, now-bittersweet, 70-homer summer of '98, his first instinct was to deny it. Pressed, he admitted using it for more than a year and defended it. He lied about juicing up on more potent steroids and human growth hormone. Now he wants to put behind him the past he famously refused to talk about with Congress when he was called to testify in 2005. He says it was hard to tell the truth to his family, but it's difficult to believe even that. One of his brothers had already revealed it. Didn't those close to him suspect what everyone else did as they watched him balloon into a freakish hulk during his career? For two decades -- from the time McGwire now says he started using performance-enhancers, through his retirement in 2001 and self-imposed exile -- he cheated, covered up and remained ignobly quiet while others were exposed, prosecuted and punished. He put the ""code of the clubhouse"" above the truth in not speaking out about his and others' drug use years ago, at a time when he might have stopped a generation of young athletes from emulating his physique or gaining his advantages. He put legal consequences ahead of baseball's reputation when he dodged questions from congressmen because he wasn't granted immunity. Could he be trusted to do the right thing if he comes across another player on drugs? He's a compromised man. He still hasn't detailed all the drugs he used and where he got them, though his much-scorned former Bash Brother, Canseco, seems to have been the bearer of a fair amount of truth all along, no matter how self-serving or uncomfortable his revelations were to baseball. Why Mark McGwire doesn't get it . McGwire explains away all his drug use by saying it was mainly to help him recover from injuries, not just to power him up to hit home runs. He argues that steroids and human growth hormone alone didn't make him a great slugger, saying that he had good and bad years when he was juiced, just as he had good years, such as his record-setting rookie season, when he claims he wasn't chemically enhanced. He trots out the fact that he always worked hard, on and off the field, and that he had God-given talent. I believe him about all that, though no one should excuse him for it, as he seems to wish. But I believe, too, he became addicted to his strength, his size, the power it gave him, the high arc of his homers, even if he always felt awkward in the spotlight. iReporter: McGwire's ""ball most foul"" Anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs won't give a player the kind of hand-eye coordination, the skills, the quick, sweet swing that McGwire had that enabled him to launch so many balls so far. And he wouldn't have gotten so big, even with hundreds of injections, if he hadn't pumped iron day after day. Sure, he put in the work in the gym, and, sure, he put in the hours at batting practice. But the drugs are what helped him put in those hours, enabled him to recover more quickly from workout to workout, to maintain a higher level of lean musculature and energy than those who played it straight. They were his shortcut to greatness at the plate. If McGwire's admissions can serve any good now, it would be to prompt other steroid users to come clean. Confession is not only good for the soul, it would be very good for the game to get it all out now, once and for all. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steve Wilstein.","Steve Wilstein broke the story of Mark McGwire's use of the drug andro .

"By the time the summer of 1974 rolled around, America was ready for a break. The Vietnam War had ended for the United States the year prior, but the emotional and psychological toll at home had just begun. The lifting of the 1973 oil embargo in March 1974 eased economic tensions and allowed Americans to hit the open roads once again. And, let's not forget the Watergate scandal. By the summer of 1974, the fate of most of the president's men had been decided, and the Supreme Court had rejected President Richard Nixon's claims of executive privilege, paving the way for his resignation August 9. It was a time of weariness and confusion, which was reflected in the music and films of 1974. But it also was a period of transition for America as the progressive values that emerged in the 1960s around political awareness and women's rights continued to flourish. A shift in pop culture also was under way, from Beatlemania and Flower Power to disco and what Tom Wolfe dubbed the ""Me"" decade.

"Saudi Arabia's king on Friday appointed 30 women to the Shura Council, the first time women have been chosen for the country's top consultative body. King Abdullah issued a decree that the 150-member council be composed of at least 20% women, the official SPA news agency reported. Abdullah also ordered that the term of the council members be four years, beginning after the current term ends. The SPA said the move was made ""after consultations with a large number of distinguished scholars from the High Council of Scholars and others."" The king will select the members ""from a number of scholars, experts and specialists,"" SPA said. The women members, who ""will have full membership rights,"" must be committed to the principles of the Sharia law and must ""observe the proper veil (hijab),"" the news agency said. The council will ensure that the women are segregated, entering and exiting through their own doors, having separate offices and sitting and praying separately, it said. The moves elicited faint praise from some. ""It's a step forward but they are appointed, not elected,"" said Eman Al Nafjan, a Saudi writer and blogger who tweets as Saudiwoman. ""I don't believe we'll see any substantial change except in the mind-set of conservatives. It'll be interesting to see how they'll react to having women on the Shura Council."" Wajeha Al-Huwaider, a prominent Saudi women's rights activist, called the decrees ""a good thing, a step forward."" But, she added, ""I think it's not enough. It's not going to affect our lives as ordinary women -- our daily life, going to work, finding a job, getting an education. We're still struggling with the guardianship law. Women are still not allowed to drive. We'll have representatives on the Shura Council who can't even go there without a driver."" Still, al-Huwaider  said, ""It's good, though, because you'll see women doing the same job as men. These women will be role models for the younger generation and maybe in the future we'll have women who are elected, not just appointed. At the end of the day, we're happy but we're still waiting for our basic rights."" The conservative country has been moving toward change under Abdullah, who became king in 2005. In 2009, he appointed Saudi Arabia's first female deputy minister; in 2011, he announced that women can run for office and vote in local elections in 2015. There are no specific traffic laws that make it illegal for women to drive in Saudi Arabia. However, religious edicts are often interpreted as a prohibition of female drivers. Such edicts also prevent women from opening bank accounts, obtaining passports or even going to school without the presence of a male guardian.","At least 30 of the 150 seats must be held by women, Abdullah decrees .

"Last November, avid biker Leon Shaner found himself pushing harder than usual to keep up with a new friend. The two were locked in a fierce month-long competition to bike at least 1,000 miles. They rode at the same time, trading small talk and stats after each ride, and urged each other on. Shaner said that because of the close competition, he doubled the number of miles he would normally have biked in a month. The biking, sweat and pain were all real. But the race itself was virtual. The conversations were on Twitter, the rides tracked by an iPhone app. The friend, someone Shaner had never met, lives halfway around the world in Japan. Welcome to the new world of fitness-tracking technology. The tech has taken off over the past few years, led by small wearable pedometers like the FitBit and Nike Fuel Band, and apps that use the GPS and accelerometers in smartphones, like RunKeeper and Endomondo. On their own, these tools can be helpful for anyone trying to get into shape. They collect all manner of data, tracking workouts so people can set goals and self-monitor their progress along the way. That's an important factor in changing any behavior, according to sports psychologists. But newer social features are turning the gadgets into even more powerful motivation tools. People are connecting with friends on the apps and embracing official and unofficial ways of swapping encouraging messages and trash talk, comparing workout stats, and using peer pressure and the need for approval to push each other to work out more and meet their goals. People who have friends on RunKeeper, even just one, are two to three times more active than people who use the app solo, according to CEO Jason Jacobs. FitBit says its users who use the social features on FitBit also tend to be more active. Working out for approval . What is it about friends that makes us work out a little harder? When deciding how to add social features, many of the app and device makers were influenced by the research of Stanford professor BJ Fogg, who studies behavioral motivation. Fogg said social features on fitness devices play three roles: They motivate people; the various interactions act as triggers for action; and sharing information and tips can increase ability. Almost all fitness tracking tools now let you share your workout through the apps or on social media sites so people can see that you just finished a workout. Some even let them track you during the workout or, for example, a big race. You've probably noticed some of these in your Twitter or Facebook feed. They might seem like a brag at first (even if they did trigger you to do some cardio). But publicly sharing workouts has real benefits, especially for people who are just getting into shape and are trying to stick to new behaviors. ""People tend to continue exercise if they feel it's approved by other people who are meaningful to them,"" said sports psychologist Jen Gapin. Even light positive feedback can be a motivator, such as a simple ""Like"" on Facebook, ""Cheer"" on FitBit or a ""Healthy"" vote on RunKeeper, which is the app's equivalent of a like. The RunKeeper app has a leaderboard that lets you compare your activity levels over the past month to your friends who also use the app. If one of your less motivated friends has been inactive for over 30 days, a shaming couch icon appears to the left of their name and a megaphone button to the right. The megaphone lets you send a message to your less-active friend telling them to go for a walk, run or bike ride -- but you can only bully them once ever seven days. FitBit also has a leaderboard but doesn't currently allow messaging through the mobile apps, though you can tweet out your progress. On the FitBit website, friends can communicate with short messages or send each other a ""Cheer"" or ""Taunt."" ""They tend to send more cheers than they do taunts, so it does tilt towards positive encouragement,"" said Nichiketa Choudary a senior product manager at FitBit. ""At the same time we have some very interesting trash talk, more so on the playful side."" 'There's no gunshot start' Built-in social features are still in their infancy for many trackers, but the people using them are finding creative ways to communicate with friends. Knowing that people are rooting for him keeps Dan Gillis running. He'll post details about a run on Facebook and Twitter. And he'll share it live as on the RunKeeper app, where his friends can see stats like a map of the route he ran and his pace. He pops in his headphones and turns on the accessibility option in his iPhone so that any supportive texts and tweets he gets are read aloud while he's running. Caleb Canal posts screenshots of graphs showing his cycling, running and walking activities to Instagram, as well as photos from workouts. Sharing small victories and receiving virtual pats on the back on social networks was especially welcome when Canal first started doing training runs for a marathon in 2010 -- losing 60 pounds in the process. ""Without a social fitness-tracking website like RunKeeper, no one would usually take notice of that run,"" he said. ""There's no gunshot start, no water stops, no cheering crowds, and no finish line, unless it's your own driveway."" Amara Poolswasdi sometimes checks encouraging messages on her phone while she's doing long-distance running, which she says keep her motivated -- ""especially when things get rough."" She started running as a challenge to herself to get in shape for a 5k and, nine months later, she completed her first marathon. She tracked her running stats and posted them to her public blog as well as social media. People using mobile apps that don't have options for messaging, like FitBit, will take screenshots of their leaderboard and share with the friends they're competing with on Twitter or over text message. In many of these cases it's for bragging rights and a bit of light smack talk. ""Support in the form of a challenge always motivates me more than a typical 'Good Job' or 'You Killed that Ride,'"" said cyclist Steve Ford, who recently completed his first triathlon. Not just about motivation . Even when they're trading insults, friends can provide valuable information on how to improve techniques and workouts. People who live in the same area can see the best biking or jogging routes suggested by other people. Fitness tracking tools that let you connect with strangers are a good way to pair up with people who are at a similar fitness level. ""One way that people gain self-confidence is when they see other people of similar ability doing things,"" said Gapin. ""It helps people improve adherence to exercise."" In addition to messaging and Twitter, many people on these networks are trading tips and giving each other guidance on message boards. ""Change isn't just about motivation,"" said Fogg. ""As important is helping people learn 'how to' and increasing their ability.""","People who connect with friends on fitness tracking tools tend to be more active .
Tightly knit, supportive communities have popped up for apps like RunKeeper and tools like FitBit .
Connections help remind people to work out and keep them motivated ."
"Washington (CNN)Hillary Clinton is a New Yorker. And an Arkansan. And an Illinoisan. And at times also even a Pennsylvanian. While the question -- Where is Hillary Clinton from? -- may seem simple, the answer was made harder as Clinton traveled the country over the last six months stumping for Democratic candidates during the midterms and peddling her memoir. People from at least four states like to lay claim to Clinton, and the former secretary of state never shied away from those signs of citizenship. Born in Park Ridge, Illinois in 1947, Clinton rose to prominence during her 20-year stay in Arkansas from 1974 to 1992. After living in Washington, D.C., for eight years as first lady, Clinton moved to Chappaqua, New York and represented the Empire State for eight years in the Senate. Geographical identity politics are a core part of the American campaign trail from local offices all the way up Pennsylvania Avenue -- just ask Dick Lugar or Scott Brown -- and having home roots that are considered authentic by voters is a key part of messaging for any presidential hopeful, and that includes Clinton. At times, she plays up her Arkansas roots and slight southern accent. In other forums, she is the former senator from New York and resident of Chappaqua. And when she is anywhere in the Midwest, Clinton is the Chicago Cubs-loving child from Park Ridge, Illinois. The Clintons currently maintain their primary residence in New York and another home in Washington, D.C. Clinton's returning to one of these ""home"" states this weekend -- Arkansas -- for a 10th anniversary celebration of the Clinton Presidential Center in Little Rock. Here is how Clinton is linked to four states -- Illinois, Arkansas, New York and Pennsylvania -- and why it matters. Illinois: . In Chicago, Clinton is heralded as a native daughter. Giving her an introduction at an October event in Chicago, Lester Knight said he was ""welcoming her home."" Mayor Rahm Emanuel said in June that Clinton ""still and will forever be a Chicagoan at heart."" Clinton spent her first eighteen years of life in Park Ridge, Illinois, a middle class neighborhood a few miles from downtown. Clinton, however, left the state in 1965 to attend Wellesley College in Massachusetts and since then has not lived in Illinois for any considerable time. Clinton maintains a small group of Park Ridge friends to this day. When she visited the city in June, she had a small dinner with many of them and reminisced about their years in at school and in their Methodist church group. ""It is always great to be back in Chicago,"" Clinton said in October. ""This is where I was born, where I grew up. Where I made so many life long friends and it is wonderful to be part of an extended community such as Chicago represents."" Arkansas: . More than any other state, the Clinton family is most closely associated with Arkansas. Hillary Clinton moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas in 1974 to marry Bill Clinton, a native son of the state and rising political star. For the next 18 years, the Clintons came to dominate the state's political scene. Bill Clinton served one term as Attorney General before serving five terms as governor. Hillary Clinton was a high profile first lady in the state, but Arkansas was never really home for her. Even her closest friends acknowledge that Hillary was never in love with Arkansas and was at times put off by how women were viewed. Hillary Clinton does, however, occasionally returns to the state, as she did when she spoke at two Little Rock events in July. And longtime Democrats in the state still lay claim to the former first lady. ""Hillary Clinton's roots in Arkansas run deep, and many Arkansans still consider her their hometown girl,"" said Adrienne Elrod, a former Clinton aide from Arkansas. ""As a native Arkansan, I could not be more proud to call her one of us."" New York: . When Hillary Clinton decided to run for Senate in 2000, she had no connection to New York. And Republicans knew it was a weakness. ""Name me three things Hillary Clinton has ever done for the people of New York,"" Sean Hannity, then a New York radio host, proclaimed regularly during his show at the time. Aware of the challenges, Clinton traveled the state on a ""listening tour"" and talked with voters in schools, labor halls and community buildings. She also established residency in the Empire State by moving to Chappaqua, the small hamlet that the Clintons still consider home today. ""I think I have some real work to do, to get out and listen and learn from the people of New York and demonstrate that what I'm for is maybe as important, if not more important, than where I'm from,"" Clinton told the New York Times in 1999. Clinton even played up her sporting allegiances to become closer to New York. ""I am Cubs fan,"" she told an audience in Chicago before noting that because she ""couldn't stay hitched with a losing team"" she ""became a Yankees fan."" Clinton's supporters argue she was a Yankees fan as a child and photos from 1992 published in her 2003 memoir ""Living History"" show the first lady in a New York hat. ""I'm wearing the hat of my lifelong favorite American League team,"" says the description under the photo. Today, Clinton identifies most with New York. She lives there, votes there and her office is in Manhattan. Pennsylvania: . Of the states that have laid claim to Clinton, Pennsylvania is the most random. Clinton's father -- Hugh Rodham -- was born in Scranton, a city in the Northeast corner of the state. The Rodham family has deep ties to the region and even after moving to Chicago, Hillary and her family would spend summers at a rustic cabin on Lake Winola on the city's outskirts. (If Scranton sounds familiar, that's because it's also from where another potential 2016 Democratic hopeful Vice President Joe Biden.) ""The rustic cabin had no heat except for the cast-iron cook stove in the kitchen, and no indoor bath or shower,"" Clinton wrote in her memoir ""Living History."" ""To stay clean, we swam in the lake or stood below the back porch while someone poured a tub of water onto our heads."" So when Clinton campaigned for Pennsylvania Democrats in 2014, many used those roots to tie her with the state. Tom Wolf, the governor-elect of the state, said, ""coursing through [Hillary Clinton's] veins is blood that's tinged with Pennsylvania values and Pennsylvania ideas."" At the event, Clinton also played up those roots and talked about her father's side of the family, their interest in politics and her time on the lake. ""I spent every summer of my growing up years traveling on the turnpike going up to Scranton and often times during Christmas coming back,"" Clinton said. ""The state has been very good to my family and to my husband and to me."" Clinton's ties to the state also came in handy when Clinton ran for president in 2008. Because Clinton was able to better identify with the hard scrabble, predominately white Democrats of central and North East Pennsylvania, she won the state's primary. ""She's tough,"" Christopher Doherty, Scranton's mayor at the time told the New York Times. ""That's a real Scranton trait.""","Hillary Clinton has key ties to four states: Illinois, Arkansas, New York and Pennsylvania .

"It happens every summer: A certain song lyric, a momentous movie scene or a fresh-looking fashion colors every memory of the season, even years and decades later. This summer, CNN Living takes a look back at summers past to explore the stuff of summer that still speaks to us. We'll start 50 years ago, in 1964, when temperatures hit 95 degrees in New York, 104 in Walla Walla, Washington, and 106 in Dallas. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 passed and was signed into law. The Federal Trade Commission concluded for the first time that warnings should be printed on cigarette packages. Nelson Mandela was sentenced to life in prison. Race riots exploded in Jersey City, Harlem and Philadelphia, while the ""Freedom Summer"" swept through the American South. The Summer Olympics in Tokyo weren't quite the talk of the dinner table; the ""summer"" games didn't begin until October that year. The sights and sounds of that summer were unforgettable to those who were around -- and had an impact on summers future, too. Here's a look back at summer of 50 years ago, and the little memories that made it. Songs of summer: Beatlemania goes big . Every summer seems to have a breakout hit, but they don't always age so well. Think about it: Fifteen years ago, summer radio was dominated by LFO's ""Summer Girls"" -- chorus: ""I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch"" -- and ""Nookie,"" a (Grammy-winning! Really!) single by Limp Bizkit. Consider the better times: In the summer of 1964, the Beatles were touring in the United States. The Rolling Stones played their first U.S. gig. The songs topping the charts became classics of the era, by musicians who are still household names: the Beach Boys' ""I Get Around,"" the Supremes' ""Where Did Our Love Go,"" the Beatles' ""A Hard Day's Night,"" Barbra Streisand's ""People"" and the Dixie Cups ""Chapel of Love."" Big screen blockbusters: Sing-alongs on screen . America was still more than a decade away from a true summer blockbuster -- ""Jaws"" set that standard in 1975 -- but there were hits on the big screen 50 years ago. Summer 1964 was a season of musicals, with Elvis Presley's ""Viva Las Vegas"" opening that May, and ""Mary Poppins,"" ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" and ""A Hard Day's Night"" passing through theaters throughout the rest of the season. There was a bit of summer drama too, notably, ""The Night of the Iguana."" The film, based on a Tennessee Williams play, starred Richard Burton, Ava Gardner and Deborah Kerr. The film might as well have starred Elizabeth Taylor, Burton's future wife, given the attention she drew by joining her beau on set. Beach reads: Spy vs. spy . In the summer of 1964, America did plenty of not-exactly-beachy summer reading. Ernest Hemingway's memoir of his life in 1920s Paris, ""A Moveable Feast,"" was among the bestsellers. So was Charles Silberman's ""Crisis in Black and White,"" an analysis of racial oppression in the United States. But filling far more spaces on bestseller lists were spy stories, and lots of 'em. Ian Fleming's James Bond tale, ""On her Majesty's Secret Service,"" Helen MacInnes' ""The Venetian Affair"" and John le Carre's ""The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"" were all among the top books of the season. Spy stories weren't beholden to the page, either: Bond tales ""Goldfinger"" and ""From Russia With Love"" were among the top films for the year, too. Summer style: Short dresses and swimwear . Maybe the realities of 1960s fashion can't live up to our imaginations  -- thanks, ""Mad Men"" -- but the buzzed-about looks of summer 1964 were, um, eye-catching. That was the summer that bore the discotheque dress -- a short, sleeveless number that gave a gal plenty of room to move. Within a few years, it would be a staple of the swingin' '60s closet. The season also saw the introduction of the Birkenstock sandal. They wouldn't arrive stateside for a few more years, but those clunky, cork-soles shoes have now comforted generations of feet ... and haunted picky fashionistas . Let us not forget 1964's most jarring fashion: the monokini. Not familiar? It was a topless, one-piece women's bathing suit designed by Rudi Gernreich. Shock of shocks: Bare breasts at the beach generated a bit of controversy. The suit took off among the avant-garde, if not the broader beach-going public. Stuff of summer: Skating and Sting-Rays . In summer 1964, skateboards were just beginning a slow roll from California to the rest of the country. Onetime lifeguard Larry Stevenson had perfected a small surfboard-on-wheels that made skating a lot more daring, and naturally, popular. For those not willing to hop on a board, there was the Schwinn Sting-Ray, a banana-seated, high-handle barred beast of a bike that had been introduced the year before, and appeared in the Schwinn catalog for the first time in 1964. For $49.95, folks could take one home in flamboyant lime, red, radiant coppertone, sky blue or violet. A version ""for mother, daughter or even grandmother"" called the Schwinn Fair Lady sold in radiant blue, violet, or white with rose. For a little more flash and a few more bucks, people could pick up a version with chrome fenders and whitewall tires. However you rolled, there was a new tool to make the memories of summer 1964 a bit clearer. The Kodak Instamatic was introduced in 1963, and millions of the ultra-easy cameras were in circulation within a few years. What better way could there be to remember?

"(CNN)  -- More than 14 months after they fled fighting between rebel and government forces, park rangers who monitor mountain gorillas in war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo have returned to the reserve. Young gorillas play in Congo's Virunga National Park in an undated photograph. It is a welcome sight at Virunga National Park, where around 200 of the world's 700 mountain gorillas live. Samantha Newport, communications director for the refuge, told CNN on Friday that 70 rangers have returned to the gorilla refuge. They left when the sector was taken over by Laurent Nkunda's Tutsi armed force, which is fighting Congolese soldiers and their militia allies. About 50 other rangers who fled after rebels seized the park headquarters last month also have come back, Newport said, and about 150 other rangers will be returning after being away for a month or two. Around 400 other rangers never left the nearly 8,000-square kilometer park, in which the gorilla reserve encompasses 250 square kilometers, Newport said. The gorilla section of the park lies in a strategically important area near the borders of Rwanda and Uganda. Newport said Nkunda's rebels still control much of the park and the preserve, but efforts have been made by combatants to protect the gorilla refuge and not interfere with the park rangers' duties. In a news release, Virunga Park Director Emmanuel de Merode said, ""It is a huge step that all sides have agreed that the protection of Virunga as a World Heritage Site and its mountain gorillas is of sufficient priority to transcend political differences."" He added, ""Rangers are neutral in this conflict, and it is right that they should be allowed to do their job."" The rangers will be conducting a census of the gorillas. There were 72 habituated and around 120 non-habituated gorillas in the reserve in August 2007, when the last census was conducted. That number is expected to change because of births and deaths. Habituated describes those gorillas who are accustomed to contact with humans, and non-habituated refers to those who are not used to human presence, Newport explained. Virunga National Park is a UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) World Heritage Site and Africa's oldest national park. It was formerly known as Albert National Park.","Fighting forced rangers to flee gorilla reserve in Democratic Republic of Congo .

"The Pentagon broke federal law by exchanging five Taliban detainees for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl without giving Congress the appropriate notice, Congress' independent investigative arm announced Thursday. Susan Poling, general counsel for the U.S. Government Accountability Office, wrote in a letter to nine Republican senators that the Pentagon should have notified ""the relevant congressional committees at least 30 days in advance of the transfer."" Moreover, Poling noted that the GAO also concluded the Defense Department broke the law by using ""appropriated funds to carry out the transfer when no money was available for that purpose."" Poling noted that her office wasn't weighing in on Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel's decision to carry out the prisoner swap, but rather his ""responsibility to comply with a notification condition on the availability of appropriations to transfer individuals from Guantanamo Bay."" Talking to CNN on Thursday evening, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby noted Hagel's previous admission ""that we probably could have done a better job keeping Congress informed. Absolutely."" But that doesn't mean the Defense Department did anything illegal, Kirby said. He stated officials felt they had ""to move quickly"" out of concern for Bergdahl's life. The Pentagon said that President Barack Obama's administration felt ""it was necessary and appropriate to forgo 30 days' notice"" to do so. ""We ... believe that it was lawfully done, lawfully conducted,"" Kirby said of the exchange. ""And this was a judgment that was shared by the Justice Department."" Poling's letter was in response to a June 13 request from the GOP senators for her opinion on the matter. Captured in Afghanistan early in the summer of 2009, Bergdahl was freed almost five years later in exchange for five men who were being held at the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. U.S. soldier freed in swap . At the time of his release, the 28-year-old was the longest-held U.S. soldier since the Vietnam War. The swap stirred sharp criticism, especially among Republicans who questioned whether the U.S. government might encourage its enemies to take more Americans captive. Others -- including members of his unit -- accused him of deserting his comrades in the midst of a war. An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will, according to an official who was briefed on the report. There has been no definitive conclusion Bergdahl was a deserter. He met for two days earlier this month with an Army investigating officer who has been reviewing his case. Unless he requests an extension, the investigating officer has until mid-August to complete the probe. A report would typically be issued about a month later. As for Bergdahl, he's back in the active military. Following his release in late May, the Idaho native underwent medical care and mental counseling at an Army hospital in San Antonio before taking a desk job at Fort Sam Houston, according to military officials. Bergdahl finishes with Army investigator . Sen. Saxby Chambliss made no mention of Bergdahl -- including how he went missing, his time in captivity or his future -- in a statement Thursday on the GAO's findings. The Georgia Republican did, however, reference ""the Taliban Five"" and repeated Poling's assertions about the Defense Department handling of this matter. In doing so, he reiterated a claim made by many in his party -- as evidenced by the GOP-led House giving the go-ahead earlier this summer to sue Obama over executive orders -- that the administration has often overreached its authority. ""While the President has a habit of ignoring laws relating to domestic policy, such as health care and immigration, this latest overreach regarding our national security has dangerous implications,"" Chambliss said. ""The United States has a long-standing policy of not negotiating with terrorists for good reason, and these senior Taliban leaders will soon rejoin the fight.""","Critical GOP senator: ""This latest overreach... has dangerous implications""

"Like most Americans, President Barack Obama is tired of war. Unlike most Americans, he just started another one. In launching his new campaign against Islamic State terrorists inside Iraq and Syria, the Nobel peace laureate acknowledged the engagement wouldn't be another Iraq or Afghanistan. And a day after Secretary of State John Kerry insisted the campaign is not a war, press secretary Josh Earnest on Friday affirmed that the United States is indeed ""at war"" with ISIS. But semantics aside, Obama is embarking upon a sustained military operation without an end date, price tag or clear definition of victory -- threatening his legacy as a war-ender and almost certainly dashing his goal of leaving the next commander in chief with a clean slate. ""This effort will be different from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,"" Obama insisted during his address to the nation on Wednesday, noting no American troops were being sent in a combat role and a coalition of allied nations was joining the fight. But while Obama has broad public approval for his ISIS mission, according to polls, the decision to engage the U.S. military in Iraq and Syria undercuts his image as a president opposed to war -- though describing him as a foreign policy ""dove"" was never truly accurate. During his campaign for president in 2008, Obama made clear he opposed military engagements such as the the war in Iraq, which he termed ""dumb"" and vowed to end. But he maintained there were times and places where U.S. military engagement was necessary. When he accepted his Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 -- awarded for fostering a ""new climate"" in international relations -- Obama admitted war wasn't going to end under his presidency. ""We must begin by acknowledging the hard truth: We will not eradicate violent conflict in our lifetimes,"" he said then. ""There will be times when nations -- acting individually or in concert -- will find the use of force not only necessary but morally justified."" In the six years he's been President, that use of force has translated into a surge in drone strikes against suspected militants in countries like Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia -- the latter two examples Obama cited Wednesday as models for his mission against ISIS. The drone campaign has infuriated civil libertarians and human rights advocates, who point to civilian casualties that often go unnoticed by the American public. But the strikes have allowed Obama to keep troops out of dangerous situations while mitigating terrorist threats. When he's sent American personnel into danger, it's been in small, tactical missions in the model of the raid that led to the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Obama attempted to sum up his policy during remarks at West Point last spring: ""To say that we have an interest in pursuing peace and freedom beyond our borders is not to say that every problem has a military solution,"" he said then. Put more bluntly a few months earlier, Obama said he wasn't interested taking a ""swing at every pitch"" that came his way. With his expansion of the mission in Iraq, Obama seems to have seen a pitch he liked, making him the fourth president in a row to order an air campaign over the country. His goals there, analysts say, are distinct from Iraq campaigns in the past. ""I do not believe what he's laid out in his speech or what he intends to do is transformative,"" said Aaron David Miller, a scholar at the Wilson Center in Washington who's worked for Democratic and Republican administrations. ""He's not interested in nation-building."" While Obama may be setting out on a very different type of mission in Iraq, vowing the United States. wouldn't ""get dragged into another ground war"" there, he's nonetheless setting his successor up to carry on the mission. ""He has clearly gotten pulled back in,"" said David Gergen, a former adviser to four presidents and CNN analyst. ""He's a very reluctant warrior. He didn't want to do this. But it is good he recognized reality.""","Despite broad public support, Obama's campaign against ISIS undercuts his image as a president opposed to war .
Obama hit the war in Iraq as ""dumb"" while running for president, but was never viewed as a true foreign policy dove .

"Just months after being told the country's whaling expeditions in Antarctica must stop, Japan's Prime Minister has riled activists by suggesting he will push for their resumption. On Monday, Shinzo Abe told a parliamentary committee he would like Japan to resume commercial whaling ""in order to obtain scientific information indispensable to the management of the whale resources."" Japan suspended its southern hunt after a long-awaited ruling from the International Court of Justice in March found that its justification for the hunt lacked scientific rigor. Australia led the legal challenge against Japan's justification of whaling in the ICJ, claiming the country was using scientific research as a cover for commercial whaling. Japan has long argued that its research programs are necessary to help manage and conserve whale populations, accusing anti-whaling activists of trying to discredit its activities. While it halted its program in Antarctica, the country is still hunting whales on a smaller scale in the northwest Pacific. Comments 'worrying' New Zealand backed the Australian legal challenge, and on Tuesday the country's foreign minister, Murray McCully, described Abe's comments as ""worrying."" ""While it is not clear precisely what Prime Minister Abe is proposing in the short term, the fact that he has told a Parliamentary Committee that he wants to aim towards the resumption of commercial whaling is both unfortunate and unhelpful,"" McCully said in a statement. Anti-whaling activist Jeff Hansen, director of Sea Shepherd Australia, told CNN Abe's comments were ""not surprising, but definitely disappointing."" ""The International Court of Justice ruling gave Japan a way to save face without handing a victory to Sea Shepherd, and when you see more and more people within Japan against whaling, it's a shame that Japan's taking this route,"" Hansen said. Hansen said his organization had three ships ready to dispatch to the region, should Japan resume whaling in the Antarctic. An attack on Japan? At a press conference Tuesday, the Japanese commissioner to the International Whaling Commission Joji Morishita said the country was eager to find a solution that would allow it to satisfy the demands of the ICJ while continuing the hunt. ""If whaling activities involve over-exploitation or non-controlled activities, it is expected that Japan will be blamed like any other fisheries or any other resource utilization activities. But what we'd like to achieve is sustainable whaling,"" he said. ""Often, it is described [that] Japan is aggressively seeking commercial whaling ... but for many, the general public at least, [the] whaling dispute is also seen as an attack to Japan from outside,"" Morishita added. According to the Japan Whaling Association, information on ""population, age structure, growth rates, age of maturity, reproductive rates, feeding, nutrition and levels of contaminants ... can not be obtained through small DNA samples or analysis of organochlorine, but only through lethal research."" Japan also conducts non-lethal research, but images of its whalers harpooning minke whales has led to the condemnation of its program as unnecessary and cruel. Abe told the parliamentary committee Japan demonstrated its respect for whales killed by holding a ""religious service"" for the culled mammals. ""It is a pity that that part of Japanese culture is not understood by the international community,"" he said. Japan claims that eating whale is one of its traditions, however consumption rates are falling, leading to large stockpiles of whale meat. Japan holds 'whale week' This week, Japan's agriculture, forestry and fisheries department is trying to reacquaint Japanese people with the delicacy by giving away free samples of fried whale meat to visitors to the ministry. Earlier this week, a photo of agriculture minister Yoshimasa Hayashi tucking into a bowl of whale meat was released to encourage his countrymen to do the same. Hayashi told the parliamentary committee: ""Whaling and whale meat cuisine is an important Japanese culture. I would like to proactively provide  information about it to the public widely and deepen the understanding for the whaling."" According to a survey released by Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun in April, 37% of people -- including roughly half of respondents in their 20s and 30s -- said they did not eat whale meat; 4% of respondents said they occasionally eat whale meat, 10% said they ate it on ""rare occasions,"" while 48% said they'd eaten it in once in the past, but had not eaten it recently.

"A federal judge ruled Monday that the latest White House jumper is incompetent to stand trial, and ordered 23-year-old Dominic Adesanya held for more psychiatric testing and treatment. Adesanya looked across to his lawyer and could be heard by spectators as he repeated the judge's word ""incompetent?"" He was told to be quiet, and the judge re-read a report that declared him presently unfit to understand the charges against him. At the end of the proceeding, Adesanya stood and yelled ""stop, you're not gonna do this to me!"" and began to struggle with U.S Marshals as they tried to lead him away. He had not been restrained by handcuffs or leg irons for his appearance in court, despite previous resistance at an earlier court proceeding. As he moved away from the defense table a Marshall standing behind him quickly grabbed him in a bear hug and lifted him off the ground. Several other court security workers rushed toward the man and hustled him out a courtroom door used for those in custody.  As the door closed, Adesanya yelled ""Help me! Help me!"" The metallic sound of chains and someone saying ""Relax!  Relax!"" could be heard in the courtroom as the struggle behind the closed door apparently continued.  Then, ""Somebody help me, please!, it's a scheme!"" was the last utterance heard from Adesanya as his voice trailed off in the secure hallway not visible to spectators.

"Instagram, the iPhone photo-sharing app that turns almost anyone into an artful photographer, is growing at an astonishing rate. The app now has 27 million registered users -- up from 15 million in December, its co-founders announced Sunday. And a long-awaited version of Instagram for the Android platform is coming soon. ""We've been able to put together one of the most incredible Android apps you will ever see,"" said CEO Kevin Systrom told audience members during a session at the South By Southwest Interactive conference, waving an Android phone with a prototype on it. ""It's extremely fast."" Systrom said he's been using the Android phone since shattering his iPhone while climbing out of an Austin pedicab. Systrom said the Android app is in private beta but will be released to the public ""really soon."" Instagram also is looking at WIndows Phone 7 as another possible future platform, he said. ""It's a very exciting time for us. We're growing faster more quickly than anyone right now,"" he said. Launched by Systrom and partner Mike Krieger less than two years ago, Instagram already has more users than location-based network Foursquare, despite only being available on Apple's iOS. Systrom and Krieger attributed their dramatic growth rate to the popularity of the iPhone 4S and Apple naming Instagram as its 2011 App of the Year. The pair also were featured in a Best Buy ad that aired during the Super Bowl last month. The app lets users enhance their photos with filters, share them with their friends or other people and comment on friends' photos. Like Twitter, Instagram also allows people to follow other users. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Instagram is raising a new round of funding that would value the company at up to $500 million. Systrom declined to comment on that Sunday.","Photo-sharing app Instagram has almost doubled its user base since December .

"(CNN)When she was an undergraduate at Princeton University, books like ""The Hot Zone"" and ""Virus Hunters"" captivated Rebecca Levine, inspiring her to become a disease detective. Fifteen years later, Lt. Rebecca Levine, a newly minted officer with the U.S. Public Health Service, stepped off a plane in West Africa to fight Ebola, ready to implement the key strategy she'd been taught: contact tracing. The process that's helped stop diseases like SARS and smallpox seems simple: Find everyone who had close contact with infected individuals and track them for 21 days. If any of these contacts comes down with the disease, isolate them from the community and repeat the process by tracking the contacts' contacts. But tracing works only if you have a list of the contacts and their addresses. When Levine arrived at a Ministry of Health office in Sierra Leone, she found that the database she needed was ""pretty much in shambles."" Many contacts' addresses were missing or were vague like ""down by the farm road."" In all, only 20% to 30% of the contacts in the database had a usable address. That meant the local contact tracers weren't able to do their jobs properly. ""They were really unfamiliar with what contact tracing was,"" she said. ""And they didn't have the resources they needed."" According to the United Nations, only 16 of 44 zones in West Africa have sufficient contact tracing. This inability to do complete contact tracing is a major reason -- perhaps the major reason -- that the Ebola outbreak continues to spiral out of control, according to public health officials and experts. ""There's a lot of infection out there. Contact tracing breaks down. Then you have a real problem."" Dr. Bruce Aylward, assistant director-general of the World Health Organization, said August 28. Top WHO officials have said there aren't enough contact tracers to get the job done, and the organization forecasts an ""exponential increase"" in the number of Ebola cases in the coming weeks. Donald Thea isn't surprised that the system is breaking down in many areas. An infectious disease epidemiologist at the Boston University School of Public Health, he's worked in Africa for more than 25 years. Like Levine, he often found that people had no address -- or had one that even locals couldn't decipher. Residents moved a lot, and when they did, many times they took their doors and locks with them to save money. They wouldn't change the number on the door, so the streets ended up with a mishmash of addresses. Add that to the fact that people are often uncooperative with the tracers, sometimes even throwing stones at health care workers. They fear that they or their loved ones will be put in the hospital; they've seen firsthand that people who go there often don't return. ""The community perceives this as a death sentence,"" he said. ""Relinquishing your loved one is tantamount to death."" And health care workers have very little to offer people as an incentive to cooperate. ""With smallpox, we could offer people a vaccine, a carrot in essence to induce them to be cooperative. With Ebola, we have nothing,"" Thea said. In Sierra Leone, Levine, an officer with the Epidemic Intelligence Service at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, remembers the words of her agency's director, Dr. Tom Frieden. Battling Ebola is like fighting a forest fire: Miss even just one contact, and you could be leaving behind a burning ember that will reignite the outbreak. When Levine arrived in Sierra Leone on August 17, she brought software on a thumb drive to manage cases and contacts. The software was designed by the CDC and was far more effective at organizing thousands of names than the unwieldy Excel spreadsheet that the local health care workers had been using. With the help of other organizations, she also got the workers more computers and training in how to do contact tracing. Now, hundreds of contact tracers are assigned to go out into the neighborhoods in her district every day. She says the death and illness all around her spur her on. ""Each one of these heartbreaking stories just makes me want to cry,"" she said. ""It's more reason to try harder and think of more creative solutions.""","Disease detective finds contact tracing system for Ebola outbreak ""in shambles""

"Wearing a blue prison uniform, O.J. Simpson testified Wednesday in a Las Vegas courtroom that his former attorney advised he could use some force to reclaim personal items from sports memorabilia dealers as long as he didn't trespass. Simpson took the witness stand in an effort to get a new trial on his armed robbery, assault and kidnapping convictions stemming from the confrontation in 2007. He insists that his attorney in that case, Yale Galanter, didn't adequately represent him during the trial a year later. Simpson said he trusted Galanter's advice on how to get the items back. He said he believed the items were stolen and he wanted to give them to his children someday. ""The overall advice that he gave me is that you have a right to get your stuff. He gave me an example that if you're walking the street and you see your laptop in a car, you can use force to break the window of the car,"" Simpson told the court. ""Yale is a pretty forceful guy, and he sort of takes over,"" Simpson said. When Simpson expressed concerns about going to trial and possibly being convicted, ""he said, 'Relax, relax, O.J. I got it, I got it. I will get you out of this,' "" Simpson testified. Galanter frequently stated ""I got it, I got it,"" Simpson continued. ""You could never really say what you're feeling because he got it."" The 65-year-old former football star was convicted of leading a group of associates into a room at the Palace Station hotel and casino and using threats, guns and force to take back items from the two dealers. Simpson testified that Galanter advised him that he could demand his property back from the dealers, and if they refused to return it, he could use some force, but he could not trespass. Simpson didn't discuss with his attorney, however, about whether any weapons would be used in the incident. Simpson and co-defendants would later be accused of using a weapon. Galanter is scheduled to testify Friday in the proceedings on Simpson's new trial request. On Wednesday, Simpson testified he didn't know of any weapons being present when he and five co-defendants confronted the memorabilia dealers in the hotel room. ""But I suspect"" there were, he testified. Of the five men who went with Simpson to the room, four pleaded guilty to reduced charges in exchange for their testimony at trial, but Clarence ""C.J."" Stewart faced a jury conviction alongside Simpson. Stewart later won a court order for a new trial. In 2011, Stewart was sentenced to three years' probation after entering an Alford plea to robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery, meaning he didn't admit guilt but acknowledged that prosecutors could prove their case, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported then. By testifying against his former attorney, Simpson waived his right to the attorney-client privilege in the 2007 case, but his attorney in this week's court proceedings said Simpson has no concerns about losing those protections. ""I am confident Mr. Simpson has not told him anything that would inculpate him because I'm confident the truth is he did not intend to commit any crime. So, no, I'm not worried,""  attorney Patricia Palm said. A deputy escorted Simpson to the stand Wednesday and unlocked the manacles binding his hands to his waist. His feet were also shackled. The former NFL player was heavier and had more gray hair than when he gained notoriety in the mid-1990s in his trial on charges of killing his ex-wife and her friend. A jury acquitted him in that case. In court Wednesday, Simpson recounted his working relationship with Galanter, who he said had a conflict of interest in the case and failed to mount an effective defense. ""Yale had a relationship with the media and he would go on various shows to refute the tabloid stories,"" Simpson said. ""He had a good relationship with the media and consequently I was in the media a lot, and that gave him an opportunity to go on TV."" Under questioning by his attorney, Simpson seemed relaxed, alert and attentive to each question. His voice was low and at times raspy. His left wrist manacled to his waist, creating an image of a one-armed man as he gestured only with his right hand in animated moments. The courtroom gallery is small, occupied mainly by journalists, and the hearing lacked the big media spectacle of prior Simpson court appearances. The proceeding is being heard by Clark County District Judge Linda Marie Bell, who will also rule on Simpson's request. In documents filed requesting the new trial, Simpson argued that Galanter prevented him from testifying on his own behalf, leaving nothing to challenge evidence put forward by prosecutors of criminal intent and other issues. Because Simpson didn't testify in the 2008 trial, he now ""wants to tell his story,"" attorney Osmaldo Fumo said Tuesday, the second day of the hearing. ""There are 19 issues here in our writ and all you need is one of them to be granted and Mr. Simpson gets a new trial,"" Fumo said. ""It just seems overwhelming that more than one of them should or would be granted and I'm confident he'll get a new trial."" Simpson is serving a 33-year prison term and is eligible for parole in 2017. Simpson lost an appeal of his verdict in 2010 in Nevada Supreme Court. Prosecutors say there is no evidence of conflict of interest and Simpson's claims are ""without merit."" Simpson, who played in the NFL from 1969 to 1979, was acquitted in a criminal trial in the 1994 deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. A civil jury later slapped him with a $33 million wrongful-death judgment.

"The NFL announced Thursday it will review Adrian Peterson's status now that he has reached a plea deal after being charged with whipping his son, according to a league spokesman. Peterson -- who in 2011 signed a seven-year contract worth more than $100 million and is considered one of the NFL's best running backs, if not the best -- took a leave of absence from the Minnesota Vikings in September after the team deactivated, then activated and then deactivated him again. He was placed on the reserve/commissioner exempt list by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, which allows the Vikings to pay Peterson while he sorts out his legal issues. At no point has Peterson been suspended. ""His matter will now be reviewed for potential discipline under the NFL's personal conduct policy,"" said Brian McCarthy, the NFL's vice president of corporate communications. Peterson will remain on the exempt list ""pending completion of the process,"" according to McCarthy. He has the opportunity to have a hearing prior to being disciplined by the league.

"Democratic Republic of Congo (CNN) -- Our friend Kika is a long-term resident of Panzi Clinic, a remarkable facility in eastern Congo that manages, under extraordinarily difficult circumstances, to accommodate a small number of women who have survived excruciating acts of gender violence. For the sufferers who have heard of Panzi, post-rape, they will do anything to get there. Kika did. She crawled. It took her one month. Kika was fetching water one early morning, as she always did. On this day, something that is becoming almost inevitable for girls and women happened to her. Armed militia appeared and began to sexually assault her. She screamed, attracting her older brother Patrice's attention. He came running. The militia welcomed their next victim by demanding he rape his sister. He refused. They insisted again. He said, ""Kika is like my mother. I will not."" They stabbed him to death with their bayonets, then repeatedly raped Kika. Patrice's now deceased and Kika's now broken body were carried back to their small home. After a week, Kika smelled very bad. She had had no medical attention. Her own family insisted she leave. That was when she began to crawl. What links Kika's anguish and any one of us reading this? What connects us to her catastrophic suffering and that of so many other women and girls like her from Congo? The ingredients in our electronics, that's what. The way they are being mined has everything to do with armed militia gang raping tens of thousands of civilians in what is grimly known as the worst place In the world to be a girl or woman. Complete coverage: Humanitarian Travel . A silver lining has emerged in the dark clouds that have hung over eastern Congo for the last decade and a half of war and human rights atrocities. A bill recently passed in Congress and signed by President Obama has targeted the deadly trade in conflict minerals originating from the Congo -- tin, tungsten and tantalum -- that power our cell phones, laptops and other electronic devices while fueling the deadliest war in the world. The bill and the corresponding consumer movement in the United States demanding conflict-free electronics products has sent a signal to those profiting from this deadly trade that the status quo of horrific gender violence is unacceptable, the profits purchased with so much Congolese blood are at risk, and that change is required. The window of opportunity for leveraging peace is huge. There are at least 15 initiatives attempting to address the problem of conflict minerals by governments, companies and international organizations. This is the usual story of good intentions paving the road to hell, given that these overlapping and for the most part uncoordinated efforts will largely cancel each other out. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton should follow up her August 2009 trip to Congo and lead the United States in partnering with the governments of Congo, Rwanda and Uganda to initiate a process that ties all these efforts together into one major initiative, the aim of which is a certification scheme for conflict minerals, backed by a robust monitoring mechanism on the ground as well as tracing and auditing requirements to ensure due diligence. The objective of mineral certification is to change the commercial calculus from violence to stability, from smuggling to legality, from collapsed state to rebuilding state, from private bank accounts to public revenues. The chain of change begins with the consumer of the end products: laptops, cell phones, etc. The consumer demands change from companies and governments. Companies and governments lean on mineral to metal refiners. Refiners in turn press Central African exporters. Exporters subsequently -- for their economic survival -- demand transparency from suppliers right down to the mines, if that is what making money requires. It is a classic domino effect. Change in the first instance won't come from the gun or the courtroom. It will come when it no longer pays off to violently and illegally extract minerals from the Congo. The status quo is so deadly and parasitic, it must be disrupted. Who actually most wants reform of this deadly minerals trade? It turns out that the two constituencies that have the biggest interest in reform are the survivors of violence in Congo like Kika and consumers of electronics products in the United States and Europe who learn what their purchases are doing to the Congolese people. That means the primary allies of our human rights consumer movement for conflict-free products are the women and girls who have survived sexual violence, the families who have been displaced and the kids who want opportunities beyond the barrel of a gun. Opinion: Stopping flow of conflict minerals to your cell phone . The multiple roots of Congo's crisis can't be addressed one by one in isolation. If major progress in dealing with the unparalleled violence in the eastern part of the country is to be achieved, a number of causes have to be attacked at once as part of a larger vision or strategy. The time is ripe for a grand bargain to be struck among Congo, its neighbors and the broader international community. Motivation for such a deal for Congo and its neighbors would come from the urgency to avoid an embargo of minerals from the region. A U.S.-led international effort to create an accepted certification of Central African minerals is the only route to forestalling an embargo. International efforts on conflict minerals provide the point of leverage on all parties that did not exist before to drive broader reform and peace-building. Conflict mineral certification is a means to an end, a catalyst for peace. For the Congo, donors should use that leverage to work for a comprehensive multiyear plan to reform the Congolese army, which may be the largest single violator of human rights in the east, and the broken justice system, which enables the violations. When asked how she had endured such suffering, the otherwise straight-backed and stoic Kika wept. ""Panzi Clinic did not abandon me,"" she said, sopping tears with a kitchen towel worn at her waist. The statement is profound. U.S. law targets 'conflict minerals' in Congo . The question for us, then, is, will we abandon her? Will we abandon tens of thousands of girls and women already incapacitated by the extraordinary violence done to their bodies and spirits, crippling a whole society? Will we abandon those who will be raped, either again, or for the first time, by armed militia extracting the minerals used in the electronics we love and rely on? Or, will we as consumers, as Americans, as members of the human race, take these simple actions, sustained over time, to make gender violence atrocities stop?","Ashley Judd  tells story of girl who was victim of conflict mineral violence .

"(CNN) -- With a dozen humanitarian missions behind her, Ashley Judd has ventured to Africa to challenge the relationship between valuable minerals and unspeakable violence. She's meeting this week with local businessmen, officials and victims of rape and other atrocities in the Democratic Republic of Congo, to raise awareness about the issue of conflict minerals. Natural resources such as tin, tantalum and tungsten -- which are used to make the world's cell phones, computers and other electronics -- fuel continued violence in Congo, especially mass rapes.  Judd spoke to CNN on Monday from the city of Bukavu in eastern Congo about what she witnessed at one of the African nation's camps for displaced persons and how she prepares for difficult humanitarian trips. Complete coverage: Humanitarian Travel . CNN: Could you help us to connect the dots between the rape victims you've met in these camps and the materials used in the electronics industry? JUDD: The armed militias make war on a woman's body. In Congolese society, women are the pillars. They are the backbone. They are the heart, and so when an external force wants to destroy a society, wreck havoc, disrupt, the most efficient, direct and -- in a way -- sickeningly cunningly brilliant way to do it is to literally attack the woman's body. And by humiliating women and terrorizing families, the militias achieve their objective of literally displacing them, literally running them out of their homes so that the armed militias can simply set up without obstacles, without barriers -- access to phenomenal mineral wealth on which these families are living. If a family is not displaced, they are wholly subjugated. Perhaps they don't vacate their homes, but they're dominated and tyrannized by the ongoing presence of the militias. When I arrived at the camp ... the situation is so jaw-droppingly raw. They lack basic services. There's no running water. The water that they do have access to is not really safe for drinking, but they drink it anyway. There's certainly no water for showers or luxuries of that nature. The latrines are poorly dug holes. And people's accommodation is corn husks and sticks and sometimes UN-issued sheets of plastic or -- ironically in one of my new friends' homes -- a cardboard box that American-made goods had been transported in. Her interior decoration was cardboard stamped with ""USA."" All three of the women I met had been living in the camp for two years. All three of them had been raped multiple times. Two of them had been gang-raped twice; one of them had been gang-raped three times. Part of what's really important to note is that the perpetrators of these atrocities were both FDLR [Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda] and Congolese militia. [Editor's note: The FDLR consists of Rwandan Hutus blamed for the 1994 genocide who fled into the lawless provinces of eastern Congo, where their presence fueled a five-year war that killed more than 3 million people.] . It was pretty stunning that these women were willing to admit that they had been raped, in fact, by Congolese militia. All three of them had borne children conceived in rape. All three of them said they made no distinction between the children and the baby born of rape. All three were unimaginably and desperately poor. When I asked them what kind of future they could possibly envision for themselves, they're in survival mode, and it literally was about where the next meal is coming from. They couldn't even get to the place where we could talk about the dream of an education for their children. They're just not there. We need to put so much pressure on these electronics companies, because it's incredibly lucrative right now, and until we disrupt how lucrative it is for the militias, things are not going to change. See more on the connection between minerals and militias . CNN: What can Americans do that would directly improve the future of women like the ones you met? JUDD: I have four things that I suggest. For immediate triage, something that can literally in a very short amount of time make an appreciable difference in the life of a survivor of gender violence is to sponsor Congolese women through Women for Women International. Anyone can go to womenforwomen.org and literally with a click and a small financial commitment put money in the hands of a survivor of gender violence. The other immediate piece of triage that Americans can do is contribute to Population Services International, which has grass-roots health interventions and helps poor women deal with preventable disease, family planning, HIV, because a lot of them become HIV positive after they've been raped, because they're raped by so many men, their exposure to HIV is very high. Also, we can contribute to Doctors Without Borders. See a map of the Democratic Republic of Congo . To genuinely end the root causes of mass rape in eastern DRC, people can send an e-mail immediately to the world's top 20 electronics manufacturers and absolutely demand insist that these manufacturers create a clean supply of minerals that they use in their products and that end up in our pockets. Opinion: Stopping flow of conflict minerals to your cell phone . CNN: How do you maintain the commitment to your cause while maintaining the rest of your life? JUDD: In a way, what happens to the women of Congo is also happening to me, and I also lose my humanity. I compromise my integrity when I do not engage in their struggle. And it's not easy. One of the things that has really helped me cope over the years is keeping an extensive diary. I started in Cambodia on the first day I went to a genocide museum there. And then the next thing I knew, I was at Svay Pak. I didn't even know what Svay Pak was. It took me a while to figure out that the first brothel I ever went to was one of the most infamous notorious brothels in the entire world. And that night, I thought I was going to die. I thought I was going to die from grief. The grief comes up even when I just remember it. It's amazing, I walk into a woman's home, and she opens up her life to me. She tells me everything. She endows me with this beautiful sacred trust of her story, and I'm telling you that's all she has. She has her children, and she has her story. That is it. And I promise her, I will never forget her. I tell her I will share her story with other American women, and I will speak her story to power. I say, ""I cannot make promises to you about what my government will do, but I promise you I will take action on your behalf."" U.S. law targets 'conflict minerals' in Congo . CNN: What are some of your personal emotional driving forces behind your humanitarian journeys? JUDD: The trips I take are indeed phenomenally emotionally grueling. I always go through a breakdown, and by the grace of God today and because of the brilliant grass-roots solutions that already exist in most countries that simply need to be amplified and incorporated into policy on the government and transnational level, I also have a breakthrough. CNN: In general, how should travelers planning humanitarian missions prepare emotionally, mentally and practically for journeys to remote and possibly dangerous places? JUDD: Number one: Check your motives. That's the most important thing. Number two: Understand the local context. Educate yourself. Reach out to experts, both at the policy level as well as the grass-roots level. Read books about the history of the place. And also be savvy about the particular historical perspective that the author may have. Watch documentaries. I watched ""Born into Brothels"" before I started spending time in brothels in Mumbai, India, and it was very helpful for me to kind of spiritually fortify myself because I had the visual. I knew what they looked like, what they sounded like, before I went, and so that helped me skip over the visceral shock of walking into these phenomenally crowded, fetid brothels. I had a spiritual director in my life and a spiritual community with whom I stay very current -- and that's enormously important to me. Because eastern Congo is what it is, it's such a severe place and the problems are so huge, I had my crisis of faith and my breakdown within 72 hours of getting here. Normally, it happens like three weeks into a trip, but this place just cut me off at the knees immediately, and I had to reach out to people with whom I'm walking this walk -- both through e-mail and through telephone -- and that sort of helped me have that breakthrough and tap back into my resilience. CNN: There is often a significant cultural divide travelers encounter when journeying to places like the Eastern Congo.  Are there any strategies you'd recommend for folks who are facing this challenge? JUDD: Learn the difference between pity and empathy, charity and self efficacy. Abandon the former, which is patronizing, practice the latter, which builds capacity. Accept your will, in spite of your most noble intentions and earnest aspirations, bring unconscious biases and prejudices with you. It is impossible not to. Have the humility to spot, admit, and correct your own thinking. Live your amends. Take care of your mental health. Any unhealthy coping mechanism you have, or -ism  (compulsion/obsession/addiction), will be triggered and amplified.  You are not  the exception, no matter how strong your faith and will. Consider therapy, a 12-step program, or other healing modality before you go, and continue to seek help and support. Remember: denial stands for ""Don't Even Know I Am Lying.""  The work may be rewarding, but it is also intensely grueling.  You will pay high costs for not taking care of yourself. Rejoice in your opportunity. Practice an attitude of gratitude in everything you do. The world, even in the most desperate places, is full of wonder and miracles.","Ashley Judd: Humanitarian travelers should check motives, learn local context .

"Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, released from Taliban captivity last month, has been moved from inpatient care at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio to outpatient treatment for reintegration and medical care at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, the Army said Sunday. It is the latest step in the reintegration process for Bergdahl, who was held captive for five years and released in exchange for the transfer of five prisoners from Guantanamo Bay. He is the seventh person to go through the Army's reintegration program but the first junior enlisted person to do so. The program began at Brooke Army Medical Center in 2006. That's where Bergdahl arrived on June 13. Previous captives have completed their reintegration in a week to 10 days before returning to their families or occupations. Bergdahl was at the medical center for 10 days, but his reintegration process will extend beyond that with the outpatient care at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston. ""His reintegration process continues with exposure to more people and a gradual increase of social interactions,"" the Army said in a statement. ""Debriefings and counseling from Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) psychologists continue to ensure he progresses to the point where he can return to duty."" Bergdahl went missing on June 30, 2009, in Afghanistan's Paktika province, where he was deployed with the 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division. Several veterans and soldiers call him a deserter who walked off his base. An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will, according to an official who was briefed on the report. The Army has no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something officials couldn't learn without talking to the soldier, a U.S. military official told CNN. The military has assigned Maj. Gen. Kenneth Dahl to conduct an investigation and said that Dahl will not interview Bergdahl until the reintegration team approves.","Bowe Bergdahl is now in outpatient care .

"Police say a Savannah, Georgia, police officer killed a handcuffed, armed man Thursday as the man tried to break out of a patrol car, a shooting that stirred up citizens and prompted the mayor to acknowledge that the community has ""many questions."" The incident occurred shortly after 11 a.m. in the historic coastal city, Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police Chief Julie Tolbert said. Tolbert has asked that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation look into the shooting. The GBI, based on its preliminary investigation, says officers arrested 29-year-old Charles Smith on outstanding warrants and handcuffed him behind his back. Smith was put into a police car, where he managed to move his hands to the front of his body, and he kicked out one of the vehicle's windows, authorities said. ""The officers said, as Smith attempted to exit the patrol car, they saw that he had a firearm,"" the GBI said in its statement. ""This encounter resulted in Smith being shot and killed at the scene."" A firearm was later found under Smith's body, the GBI reported. Dozens of people gathered in a Savannah neighborhood at the shooting scene, which was cordoned off by police tape. Some of them cried and hugged, a few appeared outwardly angry, and a handful carried signs to voice their views, video from CNN affiliate WTOC shows. At one point, many of them -- including some children -- joined hands in a circle. ""The amount of people in the street"" spurred the Chatham Emergency Management Agency to send out automatic calls to warn staff and volunteers about a ""potential civil unrest situation,"" agency spokeswoman Meredith Ley told CNN. She added that such notifications are standard for times like a parade or a marathon when there's a situation with ""a large amount of people that could escalate quickly."" Savannah Mayor Edna Branch Jackson said that after talking to ""the victim's family"" and West Savannah residents, she shares ""many of (their) questions"" about the incident, concerns she has relayed to police officials. ""When the answers come, we will be open, transparent and forthcoming,"" vowed Jackson, who said in a statement that she is ""distressed"" about the shooting. ""We will remain in continuous communication with the family. For now, I hope the citizens of Savannah will join me in remaining calm and patient as authorities gather the facts."" Speaking to people congregating in West Savannah, the mayor said: ""This will be cleared up. This will be cleared up. We don't need anything to happen. And we are going, we are going to keep the family and the community informed of everything that is going on. Now, does that sound fair?"" Tolbert told those gathered that the investigation is ""going to take time."" In the meantime, ""What we are asking you to do is not jump to conclusions, not make rash decisions, not ... do something that will cause you problems."" The GBI pledged it will ""thoroughly investigate this incident to determine exactly what occurred."" That includes an autopsy on Smith to be conducted Friday in Savannah. ""When the investigation is completed, the findings will be turned over to the Eastern Judicial District Attorney's Office,"" the GBI said. David Jannot, a 10-year veteran of the Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police Department, has been placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation, police said in a statement. The police chief, Tolbert, told reporters that such leave is in line with ""proper protocol."" As to Smith, the man Jannot killed, a friend described him as ""cool people."" ""He was willing to help out,"" Joe Strobert told WTOC. ""He was willing. If you ... needed help, he got you.""

"Many climbers dream of reaching the peak of the world's highest mountain at least once in their lifetime. Chhurim Sherpa has done it twice -- in one week. Guinness World Records formally recognized the 29-year-old's achievement last week, though it's been almost one year since she completed her historic double climb. ""People have set different kinds of climbing records in Everest,"" said Chhurim, sitting on her living room couch directly beneath a string of certificates hung on the wall -- the Guinness plaque included. ""But no one has climbed twice within a week. So I just climbed with the sole motive of making a world record."" Chhurim made her initial ascent on May 12 and then, after a two-day rest on her return to base camp, reached the peak again on May 19, 2012. Since Tenzing Norgay Sherpa and Sir Edmund Hillary broke barriers by stepping afoot the 8,848-meter peak in 1953, many benchmarks have been set. But for Chhurim, it was Pasang Lhamu Sherpa -- the first Nepalese woman to climb Everest (she died during her descent) -- who inspired the then fifth grader to sketch a future plan that most girls the same age couldn't conceive of. Growing up in Taplejung district in north-eastern Nepal, Chhurim's early romance with mountaineering blossomed when she saw tourists trekking through her village. She wanted to do the same. ""I wanted to carry a backpack and climb the peak [Mt. Kanchanjunga] I saw from my village,"" she said. But her eyes were set on Everest. She expected herself to achieve the extraordinary. When she came to Kathmandu to visit her sister in 2010, Chhurim enrolled in a basic mountaineering training course run by the Nepal Mountaineering Association. She said it helped her get the ""psychological, physical, and technical training"" required to prepare for her the mission. For the next two years, Chhurim honed her skills in rock climbing and first aid and climbed the Yala Peak (5,520m) -- also considered a trekking peak -- in Nepal's Langtang region. Concerned about the risks and dangers, Chhurim's parents, however, were wary of her planned Everest ascent. ""She was determined,"" said Dandu Sherpa, her proud father. ""She was on a quest to do something extraordinary -- it was difficult for us to stop her."" While parents and family members kept track of Chhurim throughout her journey, the climber said she detached herself from any emotions. ""The only thing on my mind was to successfully set the record,"" Chhurim said. She looked across the couch to her parents, and laughed, ""I didn't really think of anyone during the climb, not even myself."" On May 12, when she reached 8,848m for the first time with a group of four other climbers, she stood amazed above the ""layer of tiny mountain peaks blanketed by circular cloud patterns."" During the 15 minutes she spent on top of the world, Chhurim said she took a moment to thank God, her parents, and then reminded herself that she had to do it all again. After returning to base camp two days later and resting for another two days, Chhurim made the ascent again on May 17. But this time, she only had Tshering Dhendup, her aid, for company. It was 33-year-old Dhendup's third trip to Everest. He recalled the two-day climb with Chhurim as a ""memorable experience."" ""She's fit and firm,"" he said, adding that he takes pride in being a part of Chhurim's record-setting expedition. But for Chhurim, ""Everest was exhausting."" En route to the world's highest peak, she also traversed the Khumbu Icefall at 5,486m as well as the steepest climb after Camp 3 (7,470m), all while carrying 15 kilograms of her expedition gear that she said seemed to weigh more like 50. ""But I did it -- I reached the summit on May 19, stood there for a little longer this time, about 25 minutes, and then headed to base camp in a day and a half,"" Chhurim said, describing the journey with such ease as if it were a trek for amateurs. To date, the total number of people who have successfully climbed Everest from the Nepalese side, according to the Expedition Department at the Ministry of Tourism, stands at 3,842. Of them only 219 are women, out of whom a mere 21 are Nepalese. ""I really want other Nepalese women to get involved in mountaineering,"" Chhurim said. ""We should have a can-do attitude so that we can move forward and not be left behind simply because we're women."" Though soft-spoken and shy, Chhurim was assertive when she talked about the involvement of women in the country's tourism sector. To her, it's also of utmost importance for women to become educated. Though successful in her own right, Chhurim still laments not being able to continue school after eighth grade. There was no high school in her village and her family did not have the money to move to Kathmandu, or the closest town with a school. ""But it isn't too late,"" Chhurim said. Currently, she is studying English at a local language institute in Kathmandu. She believes that the ""international language"" will further empower women to move forward in the tourism sector. It certainly is helping her to work as a tour guide, she added. With only two peaks -- Mera Peak (6,476m) and Island Peak (6,189m) --  to her credit before Everest, she's since gone on to conquer Mt. Ama Dablam (6,812m) and Kun peak (7,135m) in India. But she's not finished with Everest. Chhurim wants to climb the summit again from the Chinese side, as well as ascend Mt. Kanchanjunga, and also the highest peak on every continent. Her father said he ""couldn't be happier or more proud"" to see one of his eight children achieve something no one else has. For Chhurim, it's the world record that matters -- it's a testament of her determination to succeed in her mission. As she held her framed world record certificate to pose for a photograph, Chhurim said, ""I have created a name for myself and I have raised my country's profile. If you're really determined, you can definitely take yourself to new heights, and that's what I've done.""","Chhurim Sherpa is the only person to have climbed Everest twice in one week .

"Samsung Electronics posted a profit of $6.6 billion in the last three months of 2012 marking a 76% increase from the previous year. While this represents a new record quarter for the world's largest maker of smartphones, Samsung's share price had slumped more than 2% by mid-day trading in Seoul after the company predicted consumers will buy fewer smartphones in 2013. ""The furious growth spurt seen in the global smartphone market last year is expected to be pacified by intensifying price competition compounded by a slew of new products,"" said Samsung in a press release. ""In the first quarter, demand for smartphones in developed countries is expected to decelerate, while their emerging counterparts will see their markets escalate with the introduction of more affordable smartphones."" Samsung's quarterly earnings release comes one day after Apple, its biggest rival in the smartphone and tablet markets, also announced record quarterly earnings of $13.1 billion in its last quarter. However, Apple's share price plunged more than 12% after the company missed its revenue estimate by about $200 million. Analysts had expected quarterly revenue of $54.7 billion; Apple announced actual revenue of $54.5 billion. iPhone and iPad sales, which continued to be strong, failed to impress investors who have become used to the tech giant far exceeding its own sales and profit forecasts. Samsung, which surpassed Apple as the world's largest vendor of smartphones in early 2012, maintained its number one position for the year by shipping 213 million smartphones worldwide, according to Strategy Analytics. ""Despite tough competition in stores and courtrooms, Samsung continued to deliver numerous hit models, from the high-end Galaxy Note2 phablet to the mass-market Galaxy Y,"" wrote Neil Mawston, executive director at Strategy Analytics, in a press release. The company added Samsung's 2012 shipment volume was the largest number of units ever shipped by a smartphone vendor in a single year.

"In George Orwell's 1949 dystopian novel, ""Nineteen Eighty-Four,"" the world is engaged in perpetual war, and citizens are under constant surveillance by a totalitarian dictator called Big Brother. That's, like, grody to the max, dude. In the summer of 1984, American pop culture was at a neon-hued, hair-teasing, ghostbusting fever pitch. In the latest entry in our Summer List series, we're taking a look back at what made the summer 30 years ago stand out: from movie soundtracks to athletic feats to a political climate dogged by the specter of nuclear conflict. Politics: 'Morning in America,' Mondale in mourning . The summer of 1984 fell smack dab in the middle of the Ronald Reagan era. With oil prices at a low and interest rates inching upward, the so-called Teflon President seemed virtually assured re-election over Democratic opponent Walter Mondale that November. Americans had been reeling from the loss of 241 Marines after an attack in Beirut, Lebanon, the previous fall, but the swiftly executed invasion of Grenada had reaffirmed the public's faith in Reagan's leadership. Mondale attempted to keep images of the fallen soldiers (not to mention potential nuclear attack by unspecified foreign forces) fresh in voters' minds, but it was no match for the sunny optimism of Reagan's ad ""America Is Back"" (often known as ""Morning In America""), which depicted house-buying, flag-waving, fully employed Americans going about their business. Mondale managed only to win his home state of Minnesota and the District of Columbia in the election. Music: Private dancing in the dark while doves cry . Let's hear it for the boys. And the girls. And an epic era of movie music. The ""Footloose"" soundtrack, packed with powerhouse hits from Deniece Williams, Kenny Loggins and others, reached its apex right at the beginning of summer '84, but still pumped out of poolside boomboxes throughout the season. Cyndi Lauper's ""Time After Time"" and Duran Duran's ""The Reflex"" skipped through the spotlight before the artist formerly and currently known as Prince wrested the top Billboard spot for five consecutive weeks from July to early August with ""When Doves Cry"" from his soundtrack album ""Purple Rain."" Ray Parker Jr. blasted onto the Billboard Hot 100 in August with a three-week stint in the top spot for his single ""Ghostbusters,"" but who'd he have to call? His lawyer, apparently. Huey Lewis eventually sued the artist for $5 million, citing similarities between the chart topper and his hit ""I Want a New Drug."" The matter later was settled out of court confidentially. A 20-year-old Courteney Cox swayed onstage with Bruce Springsteen in the video for ""Dancing In the Dark"" -- the first single from his smash-hit album ""Born in the U.S.A."" But it was Tina Turner who capped off the season that September with three weeks in the No. 1 spot for ""What's Love Got to Do With It"" from the album ""Private Dancer."" The song was later used as the title for a film of Turner's life story, and it marked her first Top 10 single since the 1970s -- making her, at 44, the oldest solo chart-topping female artist to date. Movies: Revenge of the ghostbusting nerd kids . It's easy to wax (on) rhapsodic about the silver screen in the summer of 1984 -- especially if you were an underdog. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson and the late Harold Ramis starred as a team of misfit parapsychologists tasked with ridding New York of ghosts and meddlesome gods. The June release of ""Ghostbusters"" slimed the competition at the box office, while Harrison Ford took a wild mine ride into second place with ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" after its late May release. A baby-faced Ralph Macchio leg-swept his way into moviegoers' hearts as ""The Karate Kid"" under the tutelage of handyman/martial arts expert Mr. Miyagi (played by Noriyuki ""Pat"" Morita). The Kid stood up to Cobra Kai tyrant Johnny Lawrence, played by William Zabka, who was eternally typecast as the go-to blond bully boy of the era. In ""Revenge of the Nerds,"" released in July, Robert Carradine and Anthony Edwards paired up to play academically inclined freshmen who eventually gain social supremacy over the jockish jerks of the Alpha Beta fraternity by joining forces with other outcasts, panty raiders and nose-pickers. ""Gremlins"" fed moviegoers' appetite for cutesy horror, Patrick Swayze's ""Red Dawn"" became the first release to earn a first PG-13 rating for its ""intensity"" of violence in a fictional post-communist invasion America, and Tom Hanks threw a ""Bachelor Party"" that got a tad out of hand. Prince's ""Purple Rain"" went crazy at the box office and the record stores, while ""The Natural"" swung for the fences. The ""Star Trek"" franchise found its place among the season's biggest hits with its third installment, ""The Search for Spock""; and the nation's geeks (and probably a jock or two) commenced a collective crush on John Hughes' red-haired muse Molly Ringwald with her breakout role as Samantha in ""Sixteen Candles."" Olympics: Barefoot, bouncing, Beatrice and bumping into history . The XXIII Olympiad in Los Angeles may have been boycotted by the Soviet bloc, but China made a grand return to the Games after its last outing in 1952, taking home 15 gold medals. Mary Lou Retton (and her iconic bouncy haircut) tumbled her way into history -- and the nation's heart -- by becoming the first American to win the women's all-round gold medal in gymnastics. Zola Budd was nearly booed off the track as the barefoot South African runner (competing for Great Britain) collided with American runner Mary Decker during the 3,000-meter run for the gold medal, knocking her to the curb and out of competition. American runner Carl Lewis completed his quest to match Jesse Owens' record four gold medals in a Games in 1936, but likely due to controversy over his long jump approach, fell short of the lucrative endorsement goals he'd set for himself. The televised Games also marked the semi-creepy public reveal of the scope of the ""Beatrice"" brand of products, with an omnipresent commercial campaign showing the range of common household food brands manufactured by the billion-dollar processing company. ""We're Beatrice. You've known us all along,"" the ads said. ""Is that you, Big Brother?"" responded the viewing public. Street style: Floppy, bright and totally tubular . Big, loose belts, sky-high hair, workout wear, Swatch watches, neon hues, draped scarves and a surprising return to seersucker defined 1984 summer style. The tail end of the old-school hip-hop era ushered in a new wave helmed by New York-centric artists such as Run-D.M.C. and LL Cool J, and documented in the film ""Graffiti Rock."" The B-Boy culture of break dancing and graffiti art had been popular in Puerto Rican and African-American youth culture since the 1970s, but suddenly, it seemed as if everyone and their suburban cousin was hauling sheets of cardboard out to the sidewalk and practicing their backspins by the mesquite grill.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actress Lindsay Lohan was under house arrest early Friday, authorities said, after she turned herself in early to begin a sentence for jewelry theft conviction. Lohan showed up three weeks early at a Los Angeles jail to begin serving her sentence, Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said Thursday. It was determined that she would serve her time under house arrest because of overcrowding at the facility, authorities said. She was fitted with an electronic ankle bracelet to monitor her movements and ensure she stays at home, except as allowed by the court, Whitmore said. The actress was sentenced May 11 to 120 days in jail, but overcrowding at the facility and state rules could reduce the time she must be confined to her Venice, California, home, the sheriff's office said earlier. Lohan, 24, pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor theft charge after she apparently left a Venice jewelry store in January wearing a gold and diamond necklace she had not paid for. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner gave Lohan until June 17 to begin the sentence, but she reported to the jail early on Thursday, Whitmore said. Once there, it was determined that she was eligible for home confinement instead of jail, he said. Early release formulas, required by a federal order to reduce jail overcrowding, will likely reduce the sentence to about 14 days, Whitmore said after the sentencing. ""Because of budget constraints and because we're under a federal consent decree that requires us to curb our overcrowding situation, nonviolent offenders, lesser crimes, get 20% of their sentence,"" the spokesman explained. Sautner remarked that the discounts on the sentences ""seem to be like shopping at Costco."" As part of Lohan's sentence, Sautner also ordered that the actress remain on supervised probation until she completes 480 hours of community service. But the judge rejected Deputy City Attorney Melanie Chavira's request for substance abuse counseling for the actress. Sautner said drugs and alcohol are not the root of Lohan's legal troubles, but ""she's got other problems for which she self-medicates."" Lohan's four years in and out of court -- and sometimes jail -- started with two drunken driving arrests in 2007. Since then, she's spent more than eight months in substance abuse rehabilitation programs. After her sentencing, the court released a probation report that said the actress ""appears to be continuing to struggle with substance abuse issues."" ""It would appear that the defendant's criminal conduct is increasing in seriousness and severity,"" the probation report said, yet it suggested she serve her sentence on probation and not in jail. Lohan tested positive for alcohol use, a violation of probation rules, in February, the report said. It also revealed that the drug test failure last August, which resulted in a jail sentence and court-ordered rehab, involved cocaine and amphetamines. Lohan was not at the May 11 hearing, but her lawyer entered a no-contest plea to the misdemeanor theft charge on her behalf. ""I am glad to be able to put this past me and move on with my life and my career,"" Lohan said in a written statement released by her lawyer. ""I support the judge's decision and hold myself accountable for being in this situation."" CNN's Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report.","Lohan had until June 17 to start her sentence .

"Bogota, Colombia (CNN) -- It's the largest producer of cocaine in the world and a key supplier of heroin to the United States. According to the CIA, Colombia produces 535 metric tons of cocaine a year, most of it for the U.S. market. The South American country has retained its status as key cocaine producer in spite of an ambitious anti-drug agreement launched a decade ago with the financial support of the United States. The agreement is called ""Plan Colombia."" Since 2000, the plan has cost the United States $7 billion, according to the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington think tank that has closely monitored the implementation of Plan Colombia. The money has been mostly used to help Colombia strengthen its police and military. Before the implementation of Plan Colombia, 50% of the Colombian territory didn't have a government security presence. Marta Lucia Ramirez, a former Colombian minister of defense and one of the architects of Plan Colombia, says the agreement has helped her country to strengthen democracy and government institutions. It has also increased the Colombian government's ability to fight what she calls ""narco-terrorism."" But Ramirez also says that the high drug demand in the U.S. makes it difficult to eradicate production at home. ""I really believe that the American strategy against drugs is not enough. It's probably a failure. It's [a policy] that they have to review,"" says Ramirez. Colombia welcomes U.S. drug czar Gil Kerlikowske this week. Kerlikowske, in his role as director of the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy, will do a progress evaluation of plan Colombia as part of his trip. Ahead of his visit, Kerlikowske told the Colombian newspaper El Tiempo that he sees a commitment on the part of the government of President Juan Manuel Santos, who took office in August. ""We're going to talk about the continuation of the relationship between both countries, not only in terms of reduction but also in terms of prevention and demand,"" said Kerlikowske. Security experts, including Colombian Aurelio Suarez, say Plan Colombia has improved security, but it has fallen short on its original goal of reducing drug production in the region. In what is known as the balloon effect, increased army attacks against drug traffickers in Colombia has moved coca and poppy crops elsewhere. ""And the quantity of the drug production from the Andean countries like Bolivia, Peru and Colombia is the same as 10 years ago,"" says Suarez. Salud Hernandez, a journalist who has traveled extensively in areas where coca is grown, has witnessed the balloon effect. She says drug traffickers just move to other countries, but also relocate within Colombia. ""There are still drug dealers [in Colombia]. There's still a lot of drug trafficking, and there are still a lot of crops in many regions of the country,"" says Hernandez. What's even more troublesome, the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue says that roughly 90% of cocaine sold in the United States still comes from Colombia. Michael Shifter, the organization's president, says that ""Plan Colombia's many critics rightly point to the policy's failure to meet the fundamental purpose for which the program was developed: To reduce the availability of drugs, particularly cocaine in U.S. communities,"" says Shifter. In Colombia there's a new push to refocus government efforts on improving socioeconomic conditions for the population as a means of making organized crime and guerrillas associated with drug traffickers less appealing to peasants who live in marginalized areas. Colombia's problems go well beyond drug trafficking and security. About 50% of Colombians live in poverty, and 60% have no regular employment. Now that security has improved, many Colombians such as security analyst Suarez say it's time for the Colombian government to address issues such as social inequality and long-term development as a way to slow down the seemingly never-ending production of illicit drugs in Colombia.","Since 2000, U.S. has funded anti-drug initiative ""Plan Colombia"" at cost of $7 billion .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of citizens and community leaders packed into the Bay Area Rapid Transit board room and two overflow rooms Thursday, demanding the group take responsibility for a subway officer's shooting that left a young man dead. A woman holds a sign demanding justice for victim Oscar Grant at a BART board of directors meeting Thursday. The BART board of directors meeting started with a moment of silence for Oscar Grant, a 22-year-old father who was killed on New Year's Day in a crowded train station, but it quickly turned into a parade of angry speeches by elected officials, activists and outraged citizens. For nearly six hours, according to local media, about 60 people addressed the board. The public asked the BART directors, and they agreed, to set up a committee to review procedures. They also discussed the possibility of creating a civilian review board. Inside the room, people clutched Grant's photo. Some held signs against police brutality. A couple of times citizens chanted loudly and pumped their fists in the air. Grant's mother, Wanda Johnson, dressed in a shirt with her son's face and the words ""RIP Oscar,"" held a news conference Thursday afternoon at the family attorney's office to plead with the public to stop the rioting breaking out in response to the shooting, according to CNN affiliate KTVU-TV. iReport.com: Are you there? Share your photos, video and reaction . ""I am begging the citizens not to use violent tactics, not to be angry,"" an emotional Johnson said at the news conference. ""I know it's a very frustrating time, but Oscar would not want to see all the violence that's going on. He would not want to see the fires, he would not want to see this."" ""You're hurting people who have nothing to do with the situation. You're vandalizing their property, hurting their cars and breaking their windows. Please just stop it, please."" Johnson wiped tears from her eyes as her son's friends also pleaded for calm. At the news conference, the Grant family attorney, John Burris, said he understood the frustration that African-Americans, especially those who are young, were feeling. Noting the case of Sean Bell, Burris asked the community to not take away from the tragedy by creating more violence. ""That's not what Oscar stood for, that's not the life he led, so don't mar the image of Oscar. He was trying to be a peacemaker on that tape,"" Burris said referring to a recorded video of Grant's shooting. Footage from KTVU showed demonstrators rampaging through the streets of Oakland, California, on Wednesday protesting Grant's death. iReport.com: Protesters rally against police . The Oakland Police Department made 105 arrests, including a mass arrest of about 80 people at 11 p.m., said Officer Jeff Thomason. The charges include inciting a riot, vandalism, assault on a police officer and unlawful assembly, he said. One officer was injured, but not seriously, Thomason said. Some protesters lay on their stomachs, saying they were showing solidarity with Grant, who was shot in the back as he was face-down on the floor at a train station.  Watch angry protesters in Oakland » . Several witnesses caught the incident on camera, and there have been numerous demonstrations this week. The protests turned violent Wednesday night after Grant's funeral and following an announcement by authorities that Officer Johannes Mehserle, who is implicated in the shooting, had turned in his resignation. Videos from witnesses show Mehserle shoot Grant in the back as another BART officer kneels on Grant. A BART spokesman has said there is more to the story than what can be seen on the grainy images.

""We live a life of fear, and we want them to be afraid tonight,"" an unnamed female protester said. iReport.com: BART protests turn violent . The protests began peacefully about 3:30 p.m. with about 500 people gathering at the Fruitvale station, where the shooting occurred last week, Thomason said. Soon, a group of about 150 protesters surrounded a police officer. Fearing for his safety, Thomason said, ""the decision was made to use chemical agents to protect that police officer."" The crowd calmed down, but then a contingent of protesters turned violent again, smashing windows and setting cars on fire, he said. Police tried to disperse the crowd and warned five times that anyone who didn't leave would be arrested. At about 8:30 p.m., police started making arrests. One person was arrested after carrying a firearm; another faces charges of possessing suspected crack cocaine, Thomason said. The crowd finally dispersed about 11 p.m. after police hemmed in a crowd of rowdy protesters at the downtown intersection of 20th Street and Broadway. There, police cuffed 80 protesters, Thomason said. ""If people want to peacefully protest, we're all for that,"" he said. ""If it's peaceful, we're all for it. We're not going to stand in the way of people saying what they want to say."" This was not the case Wednesday night, Thomason said, warning that police would be out in force again Thursday night to make sure any protests remain orderly. David Chai, chief of staff for Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums, said Dellums was ""out and about"" in the streets Wednesday, urging protesters to exercise their frustration productively. Dellums also announced that the Oakland Police Department was conducting its own investigation into the matter. ""The mayor's involvement was essentially to try to calm everybody down,"" Chai said. ""He obviously expressed some frustration with the process."" He said Oakland residents also were ""rightfully"" frustrated that the investigation has gone on for a week with little development. Thomason said Oakland police will either work alongside BART in its investigation or take the probe over, but no decisions have been made. BART spokesman Linton Johnson said Wednesday that Mehserle's attorney has advised his client not to speak to authorities. BART released a statement Wednesday saying the officer's attorney and a union representative had handed in his resignation letter. Attorney Christopher Miller released a statement confirming his client's resignation, effective Wednesday. ""Officer Mehserle's resignation should allow BART to get back to the business of managing regional transportation and allow the Alameda County district attorney to take primary responsibility for reviewing this matter,"" the statement said. Johnson told CNN on Wednesday that Mehserle had received death threats. District Attorney Tom Orloff told CNN on Wednesday the incident is a ""pretty clear"" homicide, and his office will focus primarily on Mehserle's mental state before the shooting. Burris is pushing Orloff to press criminal charges against Mehserle. Burris has also filed a $25 million claim with BART, alleging wrongful death. Read the claim (PDF) ""Without so much as flinching, the Officer Mehserle stood over Grant and mercilessly fired his weapon, mortally wounding Mr. Grant with a single gunshot wound to the back,"" the claim alleges. BART has until late February to respond. Burris said that the young men had been celebrating the new year at a popular waterfront tourist spot, The Embarcadero. They were heading home when police pulled them from the train car about 2 a.m. Witness videos show Grant and two other men sitting against a wall in the Fruitvale station after being pulled off the train. BART reported that they had received a report of an altercation on the train. Police are seen putting Grant face-down on the ground. Grant appears to struggle. One of the officers kneels on Grant as another officer stands, tugs at his gun, unholsters it and fires a shot into Grant's back. There have been unconfirmed reports that Mehserle may have mistook his gun for a Taser, but Burris is not swayed. ""My view is, this is criminal conduct, period,"" he said. BART Police Chief Gary Gee released a statement this week expressing condolences for Grant's family and saying the authority is cooperating with Orloff's office. A statement Wednesday said BART ""will continue to seek and examine all available evidence and will continue its full cooperation with the ongoing independent investigation by the district attorney.""

"(CNN) -- The father of a man suspected in a botched terror attack aboard a Northwest Airlines flight contacted the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria recently with concerns his son was planning something, a senior U.S. administration official said Saturday. The father -- identified by a family source as Umaru Abdul Mutallab -- contacted the U.S. Embassy ""a few weeks ago"" saying his son, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, had ""become radicalized,"" the senior administration official, who is familiar with the case, told CNN. Abdulmutallab, 23, was charged in a federal criminal complaint Saturday with attempting to destroy the plane Friday on its final approach to Michigan's Detroit Metropolitan Airport, and placing a destructive device on the aircraft, the Department of Justice said. A family source told CNN that Mutallab -- who recently retired as chairman of First Bank PLC, one of Nigeria's premier banks -- had contacted the embassy in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, and various other security agencies earlier than the timeline provided by the administration official. The family source said Mutallab went to those agencies about three months ago after receiving a text message from his son. The source, who lives at the family home in Kaduna in northern Nigeria, said the son informed his family in the text message that he was leaving school in Dubai to move to Yemen. He implied that he was leaving ""for the course of Islam."" The family member said Abdulmutallab ""had no family consent or support,"" adding he ""absconded to Yemen."" Mutallab's information about his son was forwarded to the National Counter-Terrorism Center, and Abdulmutallab was added to a general watch list, the senior administration official said. But the official said ""the info on him was not deemed specific enough to pull his visa or put him on a no-fly list."" Abdulmutallab was arrested Friday and made an initial court appearance Saturday afternoon at the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor, where he was being treated for severe burns suffered when he ignited a small explosive device. Read the federal criminal complaint and affidavit . The fire was put out and he was subdued by crew members and passengers, and the plane landed shortly thereafter. He was taken into custody for questioning by the FBI, authorities said. A preliminary FBI analysis found that the device contained PETN, also known as Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate, a highly explosive chemical compound. In addition, FBI agents recovered what appear to be the remnants of a syringe from the vicinity of Abdulmutallab's seat, believed to have been part of the device. Abdulmutallab was granted a multiple-year, multiple-entry tourist visa at the U.S. Embassy in London in June 2008, the administration official said. He was a student in London at the time, and there was ""no derogatory information that would have prevented him from getting a visa,"" the official said. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, in a statement Saturday, said, ""The security of the public must always be our primary concern."" Britain's Home Secretary Alan Johnson said Saturday he is following developments closely and has assured the public that police in Britain are working closely with U.S. investigators ""to uncover the full background to the incident."" Read more about the investigation in the U.K. When Abdulmutallab returned to Nigeria from London, he told his family he wanted to get a second college degree in Egypt or Saudi Arabia, the family source said. The family refused, because they were worried that he may have developed ties to some dubious people. He went to Dubai, instead, the source said, where he sent a text message saying he had gone to Yemen to start a new life, and that it would be difficult for anyone to reach him because he had thrown away his SIM card. Abdulmutallab's father notified the U.S. Embassy with information on his son, saying the family feared he went to Yemen to participate in ""some kind of jihad."" A federal security bulletin obtained by CNN said Abdulmutallab claimed the explosive device used Friday ""was acquired in Yemen along with instructions as to when it should be used."" Yemeni authorities have yet to receive official information on the terror attempt, according to a Yemeni official who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the press. But, the source said the country's government will take immediate action once the attempted bombing suspect's alleged link to the country is officially identified. Earlier Saturday, the Netherlands' national coordinator for counterterrorism told CNN that Abdulmutallab had gone through ""normal security procedures"" in Amsterdam before boarding the flight to Detroit, Michigan, and those were ""well-performed."" The initial impression is that the suspect was acting alone and did not have any formal connections to organized terrorist groups, the U.S. administration official said. See passengers' accounts . U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi, who chairs the House Committee on Homeland Security, said the attempted act of terrorism would be the focus of an oversight hearing next month. ""The committee will get to the bottom of what did and did not happen with Mr. Abdulmutallab and what security precautions need to take place in the future,"" Thompson said. In Nigeria, the government said Saturday that it ""received with dismay the news of attempted terrorist attack on a U.S. airline"" and has ordered its security agencies to investigate the incident. ""While steps are being taken to verify the identity of the alleged suspect and his motives, our security agencies will cooperate fully with the American authorities in the on-going investigations,"" said Dora Akunyili, Nigeria's minister of information and communications. ""We state very clearly that as a nation, we abhor all forms of terrorism."" Officials from the Nigerian Embassy in Washington, D.C., have flown to Michigan ""to gain Consular access"" to the suspect, the embassy said in a statement Saturday. The embassy said it plans to cooperate with U.S. authorities in the case. An official with the U.S. Transportation Security Administration told CNN there will be increased security measures taken on international flights to the United States. The official advised travelers to allow for extra time before the flight. There will be no change in the number of carry-on bags allowed. CNN's Jeanne Meserve, Richard Quest, Nic Robertson and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","Father of suspect in foiled attack had relayed concerns to U.S. Embassy, source says .

"Since Roger Goodell took over as NFL commissioner in September 2006, he's had his hands full. The current domestic violence case involving former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice is just the latest in a long list of controversies that have punctuated his reign atop the country's most profitable sports league. Here are some that have attracted the biggest headlines: . Michael Vick's dog fighting arrest . Allegations of Vick's participation in dog fighting activities began to swirl in April 2007. Within three months, the Atlanta Falcons quarterback and three associates were indicted in federal court. By the end of August, Vick reached a plea agreement with federal prosecutors on one charge of conspiracy involving illegal dog fighting.  Vick admitted participating in killing dogs and operating a business enterprise that involved illegal gambling. Goodell notified Vick that he was suspended from the National Football League indefinitely, without pay. Vick served 20 months for the conviction. In 2009, Goodell reinstated Vick to the league on a conditional basis.  In 2011, he signed a six-year, $100 million contract with the Philadelphia Eagles, making Vick one of the highest earning players in the NFL. Vick is now a backup quarterback for the New York Jets. Plaxico Buress' nightclub incident . The former New York Giants wide receiver accidentally shot himself in the leg with a .40-caliber semiautomatic pistol he was carrying in his waistband. The incident happened November 2008, in the VIP area of the Latin Quarter nightclub in Manhattan. Buress served 20 months on a weapons charge. The NFL's punishment was much less severe. Goodell give him a four-game suspension.  The Giants later released him. Ben Roethlisberger's sex assault accusations . The longtime Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback has been accused for sexual assault twice -- one in Nevada in 2009 and in Georgia in 2010. No criminal charges were ever filed. But Goodell decided that ""Big Ben"" violated the NFL's personal conduct policy and suspended him for the first four games of the 2010 season. ""You don't have to be convicted of a crime,"" Goodell said.  ""You will be held accountable to that standard, and we expect them to meet that."" New Orleans' ""bountygate"" scandal . The NFL said that from 2009-11 Saints players ""pledged significant amounts of their own money toward bounties"" for injuring or knocking opposing players out of the game.  That payout amount doubled and tripled for playoff games, the league said. League punishment was steep. Saints coach Sean Payton was suspended for the 2012 season, while the NFL levied an indefinite suspension on former Saints defensive coordinator Gregg Williams, who was accused of masterminding the bonus program. Four players were suspended, although some of their terms were reduced and some were cleared. ""It is the obligation of everyone, including the players on the field, to ensure that rules designed to promote player safety, fair play, and the integrity of the game are adhered to and effectively and consistently enforced,"" Goodell said. The concussion lawsuits . In August 2007, the NFL formalized new concussion guidelines. The House Judiciary Committee held hearings on the matter in 2009 and 2010.  Goodell defends the League's policy regarding concussions. ""Decisions regarding treatment of players with concussions and when they can resume play must be made by doctors and doctors alone,"" Goodell said.  ""We are changing the culture of our game for the better."" Goodell also touted improved medical and retirement benefits for retirees. In August 2013, the NFL and ex-players reached a deal in the class action lawsuit that called for the NFL to pay $765 million to fund medical exams, concussion-related compensation, medical research for retired NFL players and their families. The agreement still needs to be approved by the judge assigned to the case, which has grown to include more than 4,500 plaintiffs. In January, the NFL proposed a $760 million settlement that Goodell was confident a federal judge would approve. But she didn't, saying she didn't think it was enough money. In May of this year, several former NFL players sued the NFL over concussions, claiming the NFL knew for years of the link between concussions and long-term health problems. Ray Rice and domestic abuse . The Ray Rice case puts Goodell and the NFL in an especially harsh spotlight. Not just because it involves domestic abuse, but because the punishment often pales in comparison to suspensions Goodell has handed out for drug and alcohol offenses. Critics say the discrepancy sends a message that slapping around your wife, girlfriend or date isn't as big of a deal to the league as drug or alcohol use and abuse. In the Rice case, a security camera video that showed former Ravens running back knocking out his now-wife on a casino elevator has touched a nerve.  Not only for the violence, but for how the league handled it. Goodell levied a mere two-game guspension, based on an initial video that showed Rice dragging an unconscious Janay Palmer off an Atlantic City casino elevator. The suspension became indefinite when a second video obtained by TMZ showed Rice throwing the punch that knocked her out.  The Ravens kicked him off the team Monday. Bowing to the criticism, the NFL announced late Wednesday that former FBI Director Robert Mueller will lead an independent inquiry into the league's investigation and how it gathered evidence in the case. The new domestic violence policy . Unlike the other controversies that have faded over time, the scrutiny over Rice incident appears to only grow more intense. Twelve Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have sent a letter to Goodell demanding ""the highest level of transparency"" concerning the investigation of the Rice incident. On the other side of Capitol Hill, 16 female U.S. Senators have also sent a letter to Goodell a letter.  In it, they say they are ""shocked and disgusted"" by the elevator video and want the NFL to have a ""real zero tolerance policy."" Goodell recently announced a new domestic violence policy that will dole out six-game suspensions for a first-time offense, and a lifetime ban for a second one. The league is also under fire from the National Organization for Women. ""We are insisting that Roger Goodell must resign and we want a truly independent investigator with full authority and full power to do a top-to-bottom review of all the domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking incidents within the NFL community,"" said Terry O'Neill, the group's president. So far, no team owner has spoken out against Goodell, and it's their call on whether the NFL commissioner keeps his job. Asked in a CBS interview if he felt his job was on the line, Goodell said, ""No."" ""I'm used to criticism.  I'm used to that,"" Goodell said.  ""Every day I have to earn my stripes.""","Controversies have peppered Roger Goodell's career as NFL commissioner .

"Whitney Houston's only child opened up Sunday about her late mother in her first interview since the singer's death last month. Bobbi Kristina Brown, 19, told Oprah Winfrey she can still hear her mother's voice sometimes and feel her spirit, urging her to ""keep moving."" ""She's always with me. I can always feel her,"" Brown said during the interview that aired on Winfrey's network, OWN. On the same show, Winfrey also spoke to Houston's sister-in-law and friend, Patricia Houston, and her brother, Gary Houston. Whitney Houston, 48, died February 11 in her room at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, the day before the music industry gathered for the Grammys in Los Angeles. The famed singer won six Grammys and sold 170 million albums, singles and videos during her career. But in recent years, her struggles with drug addiction overshadowed her accomplishments. When asked whether she feared drugs would one day take her friend, Patricia Houston told Winfrey she ""would be kidding"" to say otherwise. ""The handwriting was kind of on the wall."" Recently, she said, she observed Houston ""chasing a dream, looking for love in all the wrong places."" Houston was married to singer Bobby Brown from 1992 until 2007. Bobbi Kristina was born in 1993. ""I'm her daughter. I gotta keep moving. I gotta carry on her legacy. ... I still have a voice,"" Brown told Winfrey. Whitney Houston toxicology reports pending . The grief comes in waves still, Brown said, and sometimes it doesn't seem real that her mother is gone. ""I'm getting through it. I'm doing as good as I possibly can,"" she said. ""Just trying to keep going."" Sources close to the investigation into the singer's death told CNN on Friday that officials were looking to speak with her daughter before closing the case.  They said it was unclear whether Bobbi Kristina would agree to be interviewed. She was interviewed briefly by Beverly Hills police the day her mother died, but she was too distraught to offer helpful information, the sources said. She was taken twice to a Los Angeles hospital briefly after her mother's death, a source close to the family said last month. Investigators have wrapped up the logistical part of their inquiry by having contacted all physicians and pharmacies with ties to Houston, and nothing so far appears criminal, the sources said. Authorities are reviewing additional medical information that will be used in the final ruling on cause of death, and Houston's toxicology report should be complete ""on or around"" March 23, the sources said. Last month, officials with the Los Angeles County coroner's office said the singer's body had no visible signs of trauma and foul play wasn't suspected.  Her cause of death was listed as ""deferred,"" officials said. More official details on the investigation haven't been released because the Beverly Hills Police Department was granted a ""security hold"" on the case, the coroner's office said. Common in high-profile cases, the hold restricts the release of information. Authorities have said that police and fire officials were called to Houston's hotel room after her unconscious body was found in the bathtub, just hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammy party. A coroner official last month downplayed the suspicion that drugs had played a major role in Houston's death. Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said that ""not many prescription bottles"" were found in the singer's hotel room. ""I know there are reports that she maybe was drowned or did she overdose, but we won't make a final determination until all the tests are in,"" he said last month.","Houston's sister-in-law says the late singer was ""chasing a dream""

"It was a Friday evening in February when Adrian Vasquez, an 18-year-old from the town of Rio Hato, Panama, accepted an invitation from two friends to accompany them on what was proposed as an overnight fishing expedition. Their plan, according to Vasquez's mother, Nilsa de la Cruz, ""was to return the following morning. On February 24, they left from Ensenada Beach in the town of San Carlos aboard a small fishing boat."" But the following morning came and went without their return, and the Vasquez family started looking for the 18-year-old and his friends. Arnaldo Vasquez, the teen's father and a hotel worker, asked fishermen to search for them along the shore from which they had departed, and his mother prayed at home with relatives and friends. Soon after, the Panamanian navy joined the search, sending ships and airplanes to look for Vasquez, Oropeces Betancourt, 24, and Fernando Osorio,16. For nearly a month, their fate remained a mystery. But on March 21, fishermen spotted the boat, the Fifty Cents, adrift north of the Galapagos Islands, nearly 600 miles from where it had launched. After being alerted by the fishermen, the Ecuadorian navy rescued the lone crew member. In a statement, Rear Adm. Freddy Garcia Calle said Vasquez showed ""severe signs of dehydration and lack of nutrition."" He said the survivor had thrown his friends' bodies into the ocean ""because they had become badly decomposed."" Vasquez returned Tuesday to Panama City on a commercial flight. According to his mother, he had lost 20 pounds. ""After 28 days of anguish, after praying to God that he be found alive ... this is indeed a miracle,"" de la Cruz said. She said her son told her the fishing trip had started out well. The three caught plenty of fish. But the boat's engine died without warning and, with no tools and scant navigational experience, there was little the trio could do, de la Cruz told CNN. Soon, currents had swept their boat out into the Pacific, far from the coast. De la Cruz said they ate raw fish and drank rainwater. She did not detail how the other two died. The Ecuadorian navy has said it is not investigating the deaths and considers the incident a rescue operation. De la Cruz described an emotional reunion Tuesday at the airport in Panama City, where relatives hugged Vasquez and cried tears of joy. He was taken to his home in Rio Hato, in Panama's Coclé province, southwest of the capital. Reached Wednesday by phone, de la Cruz said her son ""has been sleeping a lot. We don't want to ask him any questions because we know he's traumatized. He's surrounded by the family.  We're loving on him and trying to help him feel better. We're going to take him to a psychologist tomorrow."" De la Cruz said her son is ""a very loving and hardworking young man"" who enjoys spending time with his brothers and loves soccer. She said the family is taking one day at a time and trying to support her son. ""For us, this is an opportunity to get closer as a family, to be more understanding and loving,"" she said.","Three friends set out on a fishing trip on February 24 from San Carlos, Panama .

"Traditional Maasai living in one of the world's most famous wildlife centers are pitting themselves against the government in a fight for land. The Loliondo region in northern Tanzania lies along the famed southern migratory route, where herds of wildebeest and zebra graze at roadsides and antelope dart around the trees. In colonial times it was a hunting ground for European royalty. Today, it is Emirati royals and other wealthy visitors being granted the right to hunt, fanning a controversy that has simmered for two decades. The Tanzanian government is threatening to evict the local Maasai community from the area in a bid to create a 4000 square kilometer ""conservation corridor."" They say it is to protect the wildlife -- which is also a major source of income from hunting and safaris -- from Maasai cattle overgrazing the land. Under the plan, most of the conservation corridor will still be accessible for grazing but no one will be allowed to live there. The other 1500 sq. km. will be a ""game controlled area"", where hunting is permitted and access controlled. Maasai leaders say it means they will be evicted from their own land and will lose about 40 percent of their grazing land. Loliondo's lush hills are where the Maasai take their cattle to graze during the dry season. To restrict their access, the Maasai say, is ""a death sentence."" For rural Maasai cattle provide milk, meat, blood -- and can even be used as currency. Their survival is the community's survival. Read more: Maasai boy scares off lions with flashy invention . Maasai activists date their land conflicts with the current government to 1992, when they were first accused of illegal settling and ordered to move. The same year the government granted a hunting concession to the Otterlo Business Corporation (OBC). Owned by royals from the United Arab Emirates, the terms of OBC's concession grant it hunting rights in Loliondo. OBC spokesman Isaak Mollel told CNN the land issue has nothing to do with his corporation, as they do not actually own land in Loliondo. He says, in fact, that the new conservation corridor will reduce their areas, with the government set to deduct 2,500 sq. km. from their hunting concession. ""Our hunting operations are guided by Tanzania wildlife acts and regulations,"" he said. ""Everything is done according to procedures."" In one Loliondo village, Maasai gathered from all over the district to discuss the issue. Many walked for miles to get there -- eager to hear what their leaders would propose. Elias Ngorisa is head of the Ngorongoro District Council, under which Loliondo falls. He has a government notice which he says details the intended eviction. In his hands he holds a thick dossier. In it, he says, are their land title deeds. Ngorisa says: ""I can show you all the title deeds of the village land. How can they say that the land does not belong to the community?"" ""This is because the government wants to give the OBC, the hunting company, the Arab hunting company land for hunting without being disturbed by the local communities."" The Tanzanian government maintains it owns the land. In response to the Maasai allegations, the Tanzanian government referred CNN to an earlier statement in which the minister for natural resources denied OBC were a factor in the decision to evict. The statement read: ""It took this decision with the understanding that environment conservation is as important for eco-system protection as it is for community livelihood and community development ... Surely no government in the world can be blamed for meeting its responsibilities to such high levels."" More than 60,000 Tanzanian Maasai live in the 4000 sq. km. that make up Loliondo. Human rights groups say every one of them will be affected if the eviction goes through. Ngorisa told CNN they were pleading for a government rethink. He said: ""If [they] do this, the livelihoods of these people, the citizens of this country, will be lost and we are saying we will not move from here."" ""This is our last weapon,"" he said. ""It is better to die rather than to just leave this land."" This is not the first time the Maasai have been forcibly moved from their land. They were evicted repeatedly in colonial times and then again to make way for East Africa's famed wildlife reserves. The Maasai say each move eroded their livelihoods and way of life. This time they say they will not be moved, whatever the consequences. The Tanzanian parliament has announced plans to convene a two-day debate to discuss options.

"Chelsea Manning, convicted of espionage and imprisoned at Fort Leavenworth, has filed a lawsuit in federal court, claiming she ""has been denied access to medically necessary treatment"" for her gender disorder. The inmate once known as Bradley Manning announced in August 2013, the day after her court sentencing, that she is female. Manning is suing to follow grooming standards such as growing her hair longer and using cosmetics, and to receive hormone treatment ""in order to express her female gender,"" said the suit filed Tuesday in district court in Washington. ""She brings this action to compel defendants [Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and the federal government] to treat her serious medical needs consistent with their obligation under the Constitution,"" said the suit. If the requests are denied, said Manning's lawyers, she ""will suffer continued pain, depression and anxiety and is at an extremely high risk of self-castration and suicidality."" A Kansas judge in April granted the former Army intelligence analyst's request to formally be known as Chelsea Elizabeth Manning. ""I've been working for months for this change, and waiting for years,"" she said in a statement at the time. There was no immediate reaction from the government on Manning's new lawsuit. The Obama administration is expected  to give a written response to the lawsuit in coming weeks. Manning is serving a 35-year sentence at Fort Leavenworth, an Army prison in eastern Kansas. She was convicted last year of stealing and disseminating 750,000 pages of documents and videos to WikiLeaks in what has been described as the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history. Manning was found guilty of 20 of the 22 charges against her, including violations of the U.S. Espionage Act. At the time of her announcement that she planned to live as a woman, Manning asked for support and said she wanted to begin hormone therapy as soon as possible. ""I requested that the military provide me with a treatment plan consistent with the recognized professional standards of care for trans [gender] health. They quickly evaluated me and informed me that they came up with a proposed treatment plan. ""However, I have not yet seen their treatment plan, and in over eight months, I have not received any response as to whether the plan will be approved or disapproved, or whether it follows the guidelines of qualified health professionals,"" Manning said. She said that lack of treatment continues to this day. Her supporters had indicated a lawsuit would be a likely option. Manning said she was diagnosed in 2010 with gender dysphoria, which her lawyers describe as ""the medical diagnosis given to individuals whose gender identity-- their innate sense of being male or female-- differs from the sex they were assigned at birth, causing clinically significant distress."" 5 things to know about gender identity . Prisoners and male-to-female transsexuals, like Manning in particular, are at high risk of self-mutilation including castration, according to her legal team from the ACLU. Manning said Army officials have been too slow in responding to her requests for clinical treatment, grooming preferences and ultimate transfer to a civilian prison where she believes those requests would be better addressed. ""No decision to transfer Pvt. Manning to a civilian detention facility has been made,"" said Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby in May, ""and any such decision will, of course, properly balance the soldier's medical needs with our obligation to ensure she remains behind bars.""

"On Veterans Day, former Army special ops officer Gary Linfoot took a brisk stroll around the Statue of Liberty. That's remarkable because Linfoot is a paraplegic -- injured while on one of his many tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. He's been wheelchair-bound and paralyzed below the waist since 2008. But new technology has offered Linfoot the opportunity to walk again. The bionic suit . It's possible because of a kind of wearable robot -- a full-body apparatus developed by California-based Ekso Bionics. Built-in sensors detect the user's weight shifts and initiate steps. Battery-powered motors drive the legs and make up for deficits in neuromuscular function. Linfoot is the first veteran to receive the Ekso suit for personal use. It's a gift made possible through a nonprofit organization focused on mental and physical issues facing returning veterans and their families. ""We were able to surprise the heck out a great soldier of ours. He's now marching around,"" said Colin Baden, president of Infinite Hero Foundation. The symbolic walk signals Linfoot's determination to move on -- and the backdrop of the Statue of Liberty National Monument represents ""the freedom I fought for,"" said Linfoot. Special veterans court marks 25th anniversary . One soldier's strength . A highly decorated soldier, Linfoot was a member of the U.S. Army's elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne). During his 19th combat tour in Iraq, his helicopter had a mechanical failure and crashed. After just three months of rehabilitation, Linfoot returned to duty as the officer in charge of the Special Operations Aquatic Training Facility. Since retiring from service in 2010, he has pushed hard to overcome limitations. Linfoot now lives with his wife, Mari, in Clarksville, Tennessee. He will provide crucial information to advance the technology of the bionic suit. It's in limited, trial use at hospitals and rehabilitation centers for patients with spinal cord injuries or those who've suffered strokes. Fast-moving technology . Creators of the Ekso suit predict the kind of rapid availability seen with other technology in recent years. ""We definitely see opportunity to reduce the cost (currently about $100,000). When you look back in time, only a few people could afford the first cell phones. Now, the masses can enjoy that technology,"" said Ekso Bionics co-founder Russ Angold. The idea was originally funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the U.S. Department of Defense agency that has a history of world-changing innovations. Today, many entities are working to broaden applications of the wearable robot. A team of engineers and medical doctors at Georgia Tech Research Institute is working to enhance sensors in the suit that would make mobility possible even in difficult terrain. ""Technology is developing not only to help people walk again, but to help retrain neural pathways and mend the ruptured spinal column so that it can regenerate,"" said GTRI Health Systems Technical Director Dr. Shean Phelps, a former special forces officer. Veterans find a new way to serve -- in the kitchen . The scope of paralysis . In this country, some 6 million people -- one in 50 -- live with some degree of paralysis, according to a 2009 report by the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation. Actor Christopher Reeve, who was outspoken about his resolve to walk again after a paralyzing accident, died in 2004. At that time, the concept of the robotic exoskeleton was still in its infancy. ""It was science fiction technology. That is what we were working on,"" said Angold. ""Here we are less than 10 years later, and we're helping people walk again that otherwise couldn't. And so we've brought science fiction to reality in a very short period of time."" Just five people in the world own Ekso suits. One of the pioneers is endurance athlete Mark Pollack. Though blind and paralyzed, he recently set a record -- walking the equivalent of a mile and a half in a one-hour training session. Symbolic steps . On this day, a crisp, clear afternoon in November, Gary Linfoot stands his full 6 feet, 2 inches tall and walks again. The site is significant on many levels. The Statue of Liberty is a universal beacon of freedom and part of the National Parks Service, which offers free, year-round access to all national parks for disabled veterans. ""Being here on Veterans Day with New York City in the background -- it's very special,"" says Linfoot. ""It exemplifies hope for the future. One day, one day soon, we'll be able to leave that wheelchair behind."" Members of Congress thank veterans on Twitter .","Gary Linfoot has been wheelchair-bound since 2008 .
On Monday, he used a new exoskeleton to walk around the Statue of Liberty .
He's the first veteran to receive the suit for personal use ."
"As the shock sinks in of North Korea's extraordinary announcement of the execution of leader Kim Jong Un's uncle and former protector, government officials and analysts are trying to decipher what the brutal move means. The ruthless disposal of Jang Song Thaek -- Kim's uncle by marriage who had, until recently, been regarded as the second-most powerful figure in the secretive, nuclear-armed nation -- has serious implications for North Korea, its neighbors and the United States, observers said. But exactly what is going on inside the notoriously opaque North Korea regime remains as murky as ever. ""We don't have a clear sense of this at all,"" said Victor Cha, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who represented the United States in nuclear talks with North Korea. Some saw the execution, which North Korean state media reported early Friday, as a chilling demonstration of total control by Kim, the young leader who came to power two years ago. ""I think what he's telling people -- the United States, South Korea, China, others -- is that he is his own man, that you are going to have to deal with him,"" said Philip Yun, executive director of the Ploughshares Fund, a nuclear nonproliferation group. Who is Jang? Jang, who was married to Kim's aunt, was vice chairman of North Korea's top military body and had often been pictured beside the young leader, who is believed to be around 30. He was considered to be the regent who secured Kim's assumption of power after the 2011 death of his father, Kim Jong Il. But in a lengthy article foaming with outraged rhetoric, North Korea's official news agency on Friday accused Jang of trying to overthrow the state, describing him as ""despicable human scum."" One big question is whether Kim acted out of strength, consolidating the power he has amassed over the past two years, or out of fear his uncle was building a rival force inside the regime. Kim already removed the country's top general last year, Cha noted. By taking down Jang, he's axed a powerful figure from the country's dominant Workers' Party. ""It makes you wonder: If he's consolidating his power, what is he building it around?"" Cha said. ""He's basically attacking the two most important institutions in North Korea, which is the party and the military."" A U.S. official said, ""Executing someone with Jang's pedigree would be a dramatic statement that Kim Jong Un intends to be ruthless in consolidating his control. ""The public airing of the power play under way -- which is highly unusual -- is probably sending shockwaves through North Korea's leadership cadre."" Provocative moves . Few analysts interpreted the execution, which took place days after the North had said Jang had been dramatically removed from his government posts, as a healthy sign. ""If two weeks ago, we thought that North Korea was somewhat stable, I think today people feel that it's not as stable as we thought it was,"" said Cha, author of ""The Impossible State: North Korea, Past and Future."" Suh Sang-ki, a lawmaker in South Korea's governing Saenuri Party who sits on a parliamentary intelligence committee, said the decision to kill Jang suggests Kim's power is weaker than that of his father. In a statement issued after a phone briefing from South Korea's National Intelligence Service, Suh said the execution appeared to be a pre-emptive effort to prevent any internal unrest over Jang's ouster. Analysts said North Korea was likely to continue with the provocative moves under Kim that have strained its relations with South Korea, the United States and others. ""I think there's going to be a clear amount of brinksmanship,"" said Yun of the Ploughshares Fund. ""I think if we continue to wait for him to do things, he's going to continue to shoot missiles, and he'll probably at some point decide to test a nuclear weapon."" Missile and nukes . North Korea carried out a long-range rocket launch a year ago and an underground nuclear test, its third so far, in February. The U.N. sanctions that followed were met by a barrage of threatening rhetoric from Pyongyang, directed at South Korea and the United States, which ratcheted up tensions in the region. The situation has calmed since, and the North and South have resumed dialogue. The two sides have agreed to meet next week in their joint industrial zone on the North's side of the border. But with the anniversary of Kim Jong Il's death, last year's rocket launch and now Jang's execution, Seoul is keeping a close eye on Pyongyang's actions, officials said. The South Korean defense ministry said Friday that no unusual activities by the North Korean military had been detected. ""December has always been a month in which something happens with North Korea,"" Cha said. ""And we're only halfway through it."" In Washington, a State Department official acknowledged having seen the report of Jang's execution. ""While we cannot independently verify this development, we have no reason to doubt the official KCNA report,"" deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said in a statement, referring to North Korea's state news agency. ""If confirmed, this is another example of the extreme brutality of the North Korean regime. We are following developments in North Korea closely and consulting with our allies and partners in the region,"" Harf added. China, whose senior officials were considered to have close ties to Jang, described the recent developments as North Korea's ""internal affairs."" Beijing hopes and believes that relations between the two countries ""will continue (to) advance healthily and steadily,"" Hong Lei, a foreign ministry spokesman, said at a regular briefing Friday. Opinion: How Kim Jong Un got rid of his uncle . 'Worse than a dog' The official North Korean report on the execution said a special military tribunal had been held Thursday against Jang, who was accused of trying to overthrow the state ""by all sorts of intrigues and despicable methods."" It added, ""All the crimes committed by the accused were proved in the course of hearing and were admitted by him."" Once his guilt was established, Jang was immediately executed, it said. The KCNA report described Jang as a ""traitor for all ages"" and ""worse than a dog,"" saying he had betrayed his party and leader. Jang and his allies were accused of double-dealing behind the scenes, ""dreaming different dreams"" and selling the country's resources at cheap prices, thereby threatening North Korea's economic development, according to a KCNA statement this week. ""Jang desperately worked to form a faction within the party by creating illusion about him and winning those weak in faith and flatterers to his side,"" the statement said. It also accused Jang of womanizing, drug use, gambling, eating at expensive restaurants and undergoing medical treatment in a foreign country. Friday's KCNA report said Jang distributed pornographic pictures among his confidants and took at least 4.6 million euros ($6.3 million) ""from his secret coffers and squandered it in 2009 alone.""

"Two years after Hispanics rioted against police in a city that Disneyland made famous, Anaheim, California, has hired the first Latino police chief in its 157-year history. Raul Quezada, 44, was sworn in as chief on Wednesday, overseeing a police department that is 56% white in a city that is 53% Hispanic -- and is still reeling from strife that grew out of police shootings of poor Latinos, including at least one resulting in death, sparking the riots. Quezada acknowledges his daunting task. In 2012, two deadly police shootings in one summer weekend led to a protest outside City Hall, just 1½ miles from Disneyland, the city's famous attraction. That protest turned violent and spread throughout the central city for four days. Quezada, who worked his way up in the department after starting as a patrolman in 1996, will seek to regain the community's trust through civil engagement, he said. Anaheim has a population of 336,000 and is also home to baseball's Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and hockey's Anaheim Ducks. ""We have to have an open dialogue,"" Quezada said. ""Last Saturday I worked with a patrol officer out in the field. I want them to see the police chief is out there along with the officers. That way the police officer sees the way the chief is working with the community, and that builds and fosters that mindset."" One of Quezada's programs is called ""Coffee With A Cop,"" where citizens ""just ask any questions they want about any topic whatsoever,"" Quezada said. ""We then answer, and the dialogue happens and then the relationship starts to form. And in my opinion that has released a lot of the stress,"" he said. He knows he has already made history in Anaheim. ""It's very, very prideful for me for me to be able to sit in this capacity and to be the first Hispanic"" police chief, he said. Quezada was born and raised in Pico Rivera, California, which is outside the well-known Latino community of East Los Angeles and is about 17 miles northwest of Anaheim. He was a Los Angeles police officer for three years before joining the Anaheim force. In the past 10 years, Anaheim has had 50 shootings involving police officers, and 22 people died in those shootings, said Lt. Tim Schmidt. That track record worries longtime community leaders such as Amin David of a group called Los Amigos, who said he hopes the police department will improve its relationship with the Latino community. ""The shootings outraged our community,"" David said of the 2012 violence. ""There were demonstrations, and there is still a lot of hurt."" In one of the 2012 fatal shootings that led to the riots, unarmed 25-year-old Manuel Diaz was shot in the back, and, after he fell, police shot him in the head and killed him, the family alleged in a lawsuit. Police acknowledged Diaz was unarmed, but ""based on the actions of Diaz during a foot pursuit, our officer believed Diaz was armed with a gun and posed an immediate threat,"" police spokesman Tim Schmidt said. ""The officer fired his weapon in response to that threat."" In 2012, police also described Diaz as a gang member, but that characterization enraged the community. The second shooting occurred when a man in a car theft case opened fire on police, authorities said. Officers returned fire, killing Joel Acevedo, 21.","Chief Raul Quezada is the first Latino police chief in Anaheim's 157-year history .

"Sen. Robert Menendez, who has been dogged by a federal corruption probe, suggests he was the target of a Cuban intelligence smear plot over allegations -- which the FBI has discounted -- that he had sex with underage prostitutes in the Dominican Republic. The New Jersey Democrat told CNN in an exclusive interview on Tuesday that the Justice Department should look at any evidence it may have that he was the subject of a conspiracy by the regime to spread false allegations. Menendez said he has for years had a ""firm position in opposition to the Cuban regime"" on grounds that it violates human rights. ""The democracy of the people of Cuba -- I have been outspoken in that regard, and I wouldn't be surprised that the regime would do anything it can to stop me from being in a position that ultimately would impede their hopes of getting a different relationship with the United States based upon their interest not the interest of the American people,"" he said. A U.S. law enforcement official told CNN later Tuesday that investigators have been aware of Menendez's allegation about the Cuban intelligence smear for some time. Moreover, they have found no evidence to support the claim that Cuba tried to smear the senator. From his perch as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Menendez has pushed the Obama administration to hold the line on sanctions against the regime of Raul Castro. The Cuban Interests Section in Washington didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. But an article posted on the Cuban government-run website Cubadebate denied Menendez's allegations. ""The senator's strategy is nothing more or less than to blame Cuba, an old recourse of counter revolutionary Cuban politicians to wash away their failings,"" it said. The story added that the Cuban government has ""no ties"" to the Daily Caller which first reported the prostitution story. FBI found no merit in claim . It's a dramatic twist to an already sensational story. The FBI found no merit in the prostitution angle when it investigated previously. But the latest development may complicate an ongoing federal corruption probe of Menendez. His comments on Cuba amount to a legal Hail Mary. Authorities are investigating his relationship with political donors, including one whose ophthalmology practice in Florida has been scrutinized for its billing practices. The Washington Post first reported the latest turn in the story Monday night, saying the suggestion of a Cuban smear is based on a CIA finding that Cuban intelligence agents were behind the prostitution claims. The CIA declined to comment. Such a formal finding by the agency would be unusual -- though not unheard of -- because the FBI, not the CIA, has primary responsibility to investigate foreign intelligence operations against a U.S. government official. A person familiar with the Menendez legal strategy said his attorney, Stephen Ryan, asked the Justice Department in a letter to investigate the Cuba situation. Menendez called any suggestion that he was trying to create a diversion or check the federal corruption probe with his Cuba comments a ""pretty far-fetched idea."" But he said that it ""seems to me"" the government ""has the proof,"" based on the Washington post reporting. ""As far as I am concerned, you know, it is the government that should produce the information that they supposedly have within their own agencies,"" Menendez said. If the CIA finding is true, the person said, then the corruption probe would be tainted by the fact Menendez was a victim of a foreign intelligence smear. 2013: Sen. Menendez faces scrutiny over ties to Florida doctor . Tipster triggered probe, stories . The episode began in April 2012 when a tipster alerted the Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington, a watchdog group, that he had evidence Menendez engaged in sex tourism by traveling to meet underage prostitutes in the Dominican Republic. An FBI agent in Miami attempted to run down the tip, but nothing materialized. The tipster wouldn't provide additional information or talk to the agent, according to e-mail records forwarded to media. The purported prostitutes also recanted their claims. At the time, Menendez was ascending to the top foreign affairs committee post in the Democratic-controlled Senate. The FBI's foray into that allegation dovetailed with the wider, ongoing federal investigation focused on the Florida donor, who for years has fought allegations that he overbilled Medicare. The FBI's investigation is also examining efforts by Menendez to advocate on behalf of two Ecuadorian brothers, whose family members are political donors to him and who are fighting extradition to their homeland to face embezzlement charges. People familiar with the investigation say the overall probe continues, with the FBI and prosecutors still examining whether Menendez broke any laws in his ties to political donors.

"In presidential politics, very little is random. And the recent questions about Hillary Clinton's age and health is anything but. National Republicans, as well as anti-Clinton outside groups and right-wing blogs, have stepped up efforts to redefine Clinton, despite her nearly 40 years on the political stage. At the heart of this effort is one group of voters: young people. Republicans think that young voters -- particularly Americans who were in diapers or listening to N*SYNC during the eight years that Hillary Clinton lived in the White House -- could use a refresher course on all things Clinton. Republicans feel young people could use their version of Clinton's history - and might be impressionable over what might seem like distant history. They have stepped up their message and research efforts to rehash the news of the '90s -- including the policies and scandals that defined the years from 1992 to 2000 -- as part of their wider campaign against her as she mulls another run for president. Democrats charge that the Republican campaign is just ""dredging up"" old news. Republicans describe it as ""citing"" recent history. Rove attack was clumsy but shrewd . ""There is a whole swath of voters out there who obviously know of Hillary Clinton and understand who the Clintons are, but they don't know of her as the politician, they don't know the specifics about her time in the White House,"" Kirsten Kukowski, spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, said. Details about the Clinton White House years is not old news for people who were in ""grade school"" at the time, she said. The strategy has obvious pitfalls. Republicans risk looking petty by bringing up old scandals.  And it hinges on the assumption that young voters will be receptive to Republican views of Clinton, who is liked by nearly two thirds of those between 18-29 sampled in a recent Quinnipiac University Poll. ""Republicans have been good lately at proving they are all about the past while Secretary Clinton is busy looking to the future,"" said Adrienne Elrod, communications director for Correct the Record, a pro-Clinton rapid response organization. ""But, if Republicans want to spend money educating young voters about how strong the economy was under President Clinton's leadership in the 90s and how American broad-based prosperity was was at an all time high, who are we to stop them?"" Clinton under fire for age, health . Clinton is also one of the most recognizable people in America. In recent polls. She has more than 95% name recognition with U.S. voters and is considered the overwhelming favorite to win the Democratic nomination, if she runs. Republicans, however, feel they can still define her on their terms. ""While a lot people assume everyone knows Hillary, people under 30 don't know specifics,"" Kukowski said. ""We need to be out there framing her early."" Republicans pounce on Margolies' defeat . ""What is Hillary Clinton's biggest accomplishment?"" As Clinton weighs a White House run in 2016, Republicans want young voters to think about this: What is Hillary Clinton's biggest accomplishment? ""I think that is going to be a big issue in framing the debate and framing who Hillary is to those voters,"" Kukowski said. Conservative blogs and publications have seemingly taken cues from the RNC on this question. Just last week, PJTV, a ""center-right online news and commentary"" website sent a reporter to George Washington University to question students about Clinton's record. In a three-minute video that has bounced around right wing blogs, students seem unable to answer the question and those who respond offer meager answers (one even cites Clinton's handling of Benghazi as an accomplishment). Other blogs and right-leaning outlets have sent reporters to Democratic National Committee meetings and college campuses to ask questions about Clinton's record and history of political positions. Kukowski said she didn't know if that format comes directly from the RNC, but did say, ""We do have somebody here that works with conservative bloggers all day every day."" The Republican strategy extends beyond the right wing blogosphere, too. Top Republican strategists, like Karl Rove, have shown how Republican might try to bring up Clinton's age and health in a campaign. Rove dropped questions about Clinton's health at an event that was picked up by a newspaper. He doubled down on the comments, drawing condemnation from Democrats. The strategy worked, however, as it dominated news about Clinton for two days. Patrick: All this attention could hurt Clinton . Digging back into the '90s . Although Democrats have called Rove ""sleazy,"" the stepped up attacks have already had an impact on the early 2016 presidential wrangling by solidifying what Republicans have been saying for months: Hillary Clinton is who they see as the most formidable potential candidate. Representatives from a handful of Republican groups said they plan to operate as if she is running or until she says otherwise. But the comments have also forced Clinton into the political fray. She had tried to stay above politics for months by giving high-profile paid speeches and traveling the country. But as Clinton began to raise her profile, Republicans began to step up their attacks and force a response. When she left the State Department, she joked with friends and confidants that she was looking forward to the ""speeches and beaches"" time of her life. That time appears to be over. In the past two weeks, she has dipped her toes into domestic politics, including her first congressional fundraiser of the midterms -- for a candidate who eventually lost, and has started to regularly tout her husband's record in the White House. ""The 1990s taught us that even in the face of difficult long term economic trends, it is possible through smart policies and sound investments to enjoy broad-based growth and shared prosperity,"" Clinton said during a speech at the New America Foundation. She added that her husband's years in the White House showed that ""a rising tide really did raise all boats."" Tim Miller, executive director of the anti-Clinton America Rising PAC, said comments like that are an acknowledgment that she knows their time in the White House from 1993-2001 will be an issue if she runs. ""We are very conscious of the fact that there is a big slice of the electorate that does not have a full picture of Hillary Clintons record,"" Miller said. ""I think that with the Clintons would like to rely on is a nostalgic strategy with regards to their time in the White House in the '90s and don't want to get down into the details."" Miller, whose super PAC has a cadre of researchers diving into the Clinton record, said there will be an obvious focus on what younger voters need to know about her time in the White House. Miller added that while he doesn't think the 2016 election will be won or lost on issues like Whitewater and other Clinton White House scandals, he does think  informing young voters, especially, about them is necessary. ""I do think that for the generation that didn't live through that, that there is some value having the discussion,"" he added. Right now, America Rising has roughly 60 full-time employees working for the organization, many of whom are primarily focused on cultivating research documents about Clinton's world in the '80s and '90s. Solidifying a definition . Defining a candidate early is nothing new in presidential politics, either. President Barack Obama's campaign famously began to define Republican challenger Mitt Romney as out-of-touch early in the race.  His team went up with ads early and spent tons of cash, hoping that Romney would be defined on their terms to many voters by final months of the campaign. ""What happens is often times if you don't introduce yourself, then you are leaving that task to the opposition,"" said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist and Romney spokesman. ""What happens is when the oppositions provides a greater reservoir of information about you and it is negative then it is tough to turn around those perceptions."" Obama prevailed in a campaign that many saw as perilous for him. But defining Clinton before she has said whether she will run or not is somewhat unprecedented. Republicans say that is only because of the unprecedented shadow campaign around Clinton right now. ""The strategy is to force her out of the shadow campaign she is winning by acclimation,"" said Leslie Sanchez, a Republican strategist and the author of ""You've Come a Long Way, Maybe."" ""That is the undercurrent here in bringing out issues about health or legacy. (Republicans aren't) going to allow Hillary Clinton to be anointed without taking the heat."" Opinion: Why I'm ready for Hillary .","Republicans step up efforts to define Hillary Clinton, who hasn't said whether she'll run for president .

"(CNN) -- ""Playing doctor"" and ""I'll show you mine if you show me yours"" are common rites of passage in childhood sexual behavior, according to the experts. If so, did actor and screenwriter Lena Dunham do anything wrong when, at age 7, she peered between her 1-year-old sister's legs and spread her vagina to see if it looked like hers? What about when she tried to bribe her younger sister with candy for kisses -- behavior she likened to that of a ""sexual predator"" -- or when she touched herself while the two girls shared a bed? The Internet has been pondering these questions since National Review correspondent Kevin Williamson accused Dunham of sexually abusing her sister as a child. He based his argument on passages in Dunham's memoir, ""Not That Kind of Girl,"" including ones in which the author describes the episodes above. Williamson, a known provocateur who once argued that women who had abortions should be hanged, pinned much of the blame on Dunham's parents -- whom he called ""self-styled radicals"" who failed to enforce ""even the most lax of boundaries."" He accused them of enabling behavior ""that would be considered child abuse"" in some places. Low blow or not, Williamson's allegations prompted the question: When does childhood curiosity cross the line into inappropriate, abusive behavior? Warning signs? The resulting flurry of tweets, op-eds and blog posts about Dunham's behavior would have you believe it's a black and white issue. While columnists debate whether the ""Girls"" creator and star should be stripped of her feminist credentials, and Twitter activists urge HBO and Planned Parenthood to #DumpDunham, experts say the truth is more complicated because we don't know every detail of the sisters' relationship. What matters more than what Williamson and others make of their childhood relationship is how Dunham's sister, Grace, responded to the events as a child, how their parents addressed them in the moment, and how they continue to affect the younger sibling, now 22. There's no way to know any of that for sure -- even in her book, as Williamson points out, Dunham claims to be an ""unreliable narrator."" But experts say the most useful takeaway for parents is the importance of reinforcing from an early age their kids' right to privacy along with bodily respect for others. Though the Dunham sisters' age difference of six years could raise red flags, experts say the absence of evidence of a pattern of coercion or use of force make the instances cited in Williamson's article, ""Pathetic Privilege,"" seem less troubling than he made them out to be. At the very least, it's not the kind of behavior that warrants branding a pre-pubescent Lena Dunham a child abuser. Nor does it mean that such behavior, even if age appropriate, won't have adverse affects on those involved. ""Parents need to recognize that many children will engage in sexual exploration with siblings or friends of their own age or younger. Although these behaviors can be of concern, it is important to understand that they may not, in itself, indicate a tendency toward sexual aggression or abuse,"" said New York psychotherapist Lisa Brateman, who counsels couples and families. (Neither she nor the other medical professionals quoted in this story have treated the Dunhams.) ""It can be difficult to tell the difference between age appropriate sexual exploration and warning signs of harmful behavior,"" Brateman said. ""Therefore it is imperative to teach your children what is appropriate behavior."" Sexual self-awareness . Appropriate behavior depends on age, changing as children learn society's rules and develop self-control. Very young children are naturally immodest, It's natural for them to express curiosity about bodies by touching themselves and others in public, or asking about the differences between girls and boys. As children get older and their awareness of acceptable behavior increases, they become more modest and seek out privacy while becoming more curious about adult sexual behavior, especially in puberty. For more information about age-appropriate behavior, check out the National Child Traumatic Stress Network's guidelines for parents on sexual development and behavior in children . Such behavior poses a risk when it is clearly beyond a child's developmental stage, like a 4-year-old attempting sexual penetration, said sociologist David Finkelhor, Director of the University of New Hampshire's Crimes against Children Research Center. Parents should also look out for patterns of aggression, physical force or coercion at any age, such as preoccupations with touching breasts or public exposure, especially if the behavior continues with age. What matters most in these circumstances is how parents address these transgressions, without shaming children or making them feel guilty, he said. The act is bad, not the child. ""When children don't have answers to questions on their minds, that's when they'll take matters into their own hands,"" he said. ""It's important to have these conversations early in childhood, and often."" Parental action . Lena Dunham released a statement Monday saying she was dismayed by the interpretations of her book and that her sister had approved of everything published about her. Grace Dunham did not respond to CNN's request for comment, although she said on Twitter, ""I'm committed to people narrating their own experiences, determining for themselves what has and has not been harmful."" Many critics cited the age difference between the sisters as evidence of Lena Dunham's inherently abusive behavior, a valid argument because research shows that the age differential matters. As a rule of thumb, if there's more than five years between children there's a ""fairly reasonable likelihood"" that the older child has more power than the younger one, said Florida clinical psychologist Steve Gold, Director of the Trauma Resolution Integration Program at Nova Southeastern University's Psychology Services Center. That power differential could be used to manipulate or coerce the younger person into unwanted activity, which crosses the line into dangerous territory, he said. It's hard to know what's going on, though, unless a child feels comfortable bringing their concerns to an adult -- again, emphasizing the importance of open communication. ""Ultimately the deciding factor is to sit down with the younger child and get a sense of whether they feel they're being pressured, uncomfortable or coerced; and, to do it in way that makes clear to the child they're not at fault,"" said Gold, whose research focuses on adult victims of childhood sexual abuse. ""It's important when a child does step forward that adults are prepared to listen carefully and not to assume that they're lying or making it up and listen closely and take the child seriously, and be prepared to take effective action to see to that it stops,"" he said. ""Right now, we're teaching children to tell someone, but basically putting the responsibility on the child to make it stop and that can be damaging if (we're) not teaching adults the importance of taking decisive action,"" he said.","Experts: Lena Dunham controversy could be teachable moment for parents .

"Tanzania is far more than just a spot to climb the world's tallest freestanding mountain. The East African country's stunning wildlife, expansive volcanic crater and intriguing islands all set it apart as a unique destination. Massive Mount Kilimanjaro just adds to its allure. The Indian Ocean laps Tanzania's eastern edge between Kenya and Mozambique, and the ""spice island"" of Zanzibar is 22 miles off the mainland. Tanzania's sprawling plains are sparsely populated, by people, at least. About half the world's dwindling lion population lives in East Africa, estimates indicate. Here are five ways to experience Tanzania's splendor. Instagram: Following Bourdain around the world . Roam the Ngorongoro Crater . Sometimes called ""Africa's Garden of Eden,"" some 25,000 large animals live in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, which stretches across 3,200 square miles of the southeastern Serengeti Plains adjacent to Serengeti National Park. The 12-mile-wide Ngorongoro Crater is the area's crown jewel. The largest unbroken caldera in the world, it is thought to have formed after an active volcano collapsed about 2.5 million years ago. Well over a million wildebeest pass through the area during the annual Great Migration, one of the planet's most remarkable natural spectacles. From December to March each year, wildebeest, zebras and other animals gather near Lake Ndutu on the edge of the conservation area. From there they move north, eventually ending up in the Northern Serengeti and Kenya's Maasai Mara in the fall. Beyond the huge wildebeest herds, black rhinos, leopards, gazelles and birds thrive here -- as does that most powerful crowd-pleaser, the lion. 'Parts Unknown': 14 things to know about Paraguay . Get to know the lions . You're bound to be on the lookout for lions in the Serengeti and their conservation deserves a special mention. The tawny lion prides dominating the Ndutu area of the southeastern Serengeti are not your ""Lion King"" variety of big fuzzy kittens. These giant creatures are respected among locals because of their history of asserting dominance when challenged by aggressive hunters. In an attempt to discourage the trend of stalking and killing lions in the Amboseli Ecosystem, conservation organization Lion Guardians recruits young Maasai warriors to instead protect the regal creatures. By naming the lions and developing relationships by tracking them, members of the guardian program recognize that animals like local lioness Selenkay can live in peace with their human neighbors. Safaris throughout the vast Serengeti give visitors the rare opportunity to see these majestic cats in their native territory. The Ndutu Safari Lodge features 34 cottages with porches facing Lake Ndutu. Learn about Maasai culture . For the Maasai, one of the last warrior tribes in the world, cattle are integral to day-to-day life. Besides providing sustenance in the form of milk, and sometimes meat and blood, cows are also currency in the region. The tribes move with their livestock across northern Tanzania and southern Kenya, constructing villages as they go. The settlements generally consist of a ring fence that encloses a group of families, their herds and a collection of mud and dung houses. Where livestock gathers, so do big cats hunting for meals. Relations between the Maasai and the lions that lure tourists by the truckload are tense but evolving. The Maasai are formidable opponents strengthened by a nearly 100% protein diet. A staple is amasi, a lumpy, yogurt-like drink made from fermented milk. Sample the Spice Islands . The semi-autonomous islands off the coast of Tanzania exhibit the rich and varied influences that arrived on their shores. On the island of Zanzibar, African, Arab, Indian and European flavors emerge in the cuisine, the homes, the people and the famous carved doors. Today, 99% of the population is Muslim, compared with about a third of the mainland population. Tourism has replaced the spice and slave trades that shaped the island's history, and delicious street food is part of the local island experience. Every night in Stone Town's Forodhani Gardens, vendors set up stalls selling seafood snacks and the famous Zanzibar pizza. Zanzibar pizza is revered as one of the most delicious foods in the region. With toppings ranging from fresh meats to juicy mango, the crepe-like pizza carries its flavorful toppings on the inside almost akin to a burrito. Unlike traditional pizza crust, Zanzibar's variety has the texture of a pancake. And who doesn't love pancakes? The various carts are piled with fresh seafood skewers, African doughnuts called ""mandazi"" and fried breads. To wash down all  the yumminess, try some honey beer or a mixture of sugar cane water, ginger and lime juice. Nearby Pemba Island, also part of the Zanzibar Archipelago, offers a quieter, unspoiled experience. Known as ""the Green Island"" for its lush vegetation, the delicately sweet fragrance of cloves permeates the air, underlining the ""spice island"" moniker. The rolling hills also produce other fragrant crops like mangoes and coconuts. Pemba's coast is home to some of East Africa's best diving. Go snorkeling or diving in the translucent waters to admire graceful manta rays, stunning live coral and schools of jewel-toned fish. Conquer Kilimanjaro . The tallest freestanding mountain in the world, northeastern Tanzania's Mount Kilimanjaro draws tourists because of its relatively accessible trails. While other towering summits require Spiderman-like agility and climbing skills, conquering Kilimanjaro primarily demands training, determination and a sturdy walking stick. Kilimanjaro is Africa's highest peak at 19,340 feet. Allot a minimum of five or six days of climbing to reach the top. As climbers ascend the mountain, they experience each of Africa's climates, from the tropical heat at the bottom to the clear iciness at the top of Africa.

"MANAMA, Bahrain (CNN) -- U.S. Navy snipers fatally shot three pirates holding an American cargo-ship captain hostage after seeing that one of the pirates ""had an AK-47 leveled at the captain's back,"" a military official said Sunday. Cargo ship Capt. Richard Phillips is shown aboard the USS Boxer shortly after his rescue Sunday. The captain, who'd been held in a lifeboat in the Indian Ocean since Wednesday, was rescued uninjured, Navy Vice Adm. Bill Gortney told reporters. Capt. Richard Phillips' ship, the Maersk Alabama, was stormed by pirates 350 miles off Somalia on Wednesday morning. He was ""resting comfortably"" on the USS Boxer after his rescue Sunday night, according to the Navy. Phillips contacted his family and received a routine medical exam after his rescue at 7:19 p.m. (12:19 p.m. ET), the Navy Central Command said. Video from aboard the Boxer showed a smiling Phillips shaking hands with Navy personnel. ""The captain is in good health. He's showered up and in a clean set of clothes,"" Gortney said in a telephone news conference from Navy Central Command in Bahrain. In Phillips' hometown of Underhill, Vermont, Maersk spokeswoman Alison McColl said Phillips' wife, Andrea, had spoken to her husband by phone after his rescue. ""She was laughing while she was on the phone with him,"" McColl told reporters. ""She was saying his trademark sense of humor was still very much intact, and he's in great spirits. If you guys could have seen her light up when she talked to him, it was really remarkable.""  Watch spokeswoman read statement from Phillips' family » . U.S. forces moved to rescue Phillips after seeing him in imminent danger on the lifeboat, Gortney said. A fourth pirate was negotiating Phillips' fate aboard the nearby USS Bainbridge. ""While working through the negotiations process tonight, the on-scene commander from the Bainbridge made the decision that the captain's life was in immediate danger, and the three pirates were killed,"" Gortney said. ""The pirate who surrendered earlier today is being treated humanely; his counterparts who continued to fight paid with their lives."" The three pirates, who were armed with AK-47 rifles, were killed by shooters who were aboard the Bainbridge, Gortney said.  Watch how U.S. forces believed Phillips was in danger » . The on-scene commander gave the shooters approval to open fire after seeing that ""one of the pirates had an AK-47 leveled at the captain's back,"" Gortney said. Seas in the area were getting rough at the time of the rescue, Gortney said, and the Bainbridge was towing the lifeboat presumably to calmer waters with a towline about 82 feet long. A senior defense official told CNN that each pirate was shot in the head. After the shooting, special operations personnel shimmied along the tow rope to ensure the pirates were dead and freed Phillips, the official said. The official added that the pirates had become increasingly agitated over the past day, and negotiations were not going well. The fourth pirate was aboard the Bainbridge most of the day and told military negotiators that he wasn't going back to the other pirates, according to a defense official with knowledge of the situation. Federal prosecutors would be ""reviewing the evidence and other issues"" to determine whether that pirate would be prosecuted in the United States, Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd said. It's the first time in modern history that the United States has in custody a pirate who carried out an attack on a U.S. citizen, said a senior U.S. official with knowledge of the situation. The source said figuring out what to do with the pirate is a sensitive issue. Phillips' rescue came a day after he dove into the water in an attempt to escape his captors, Gortney said. The pirates ""shot in the water at him"" but eventually recaptured him, Gortney said. Maersk Line Limited President and CEO John Reinhart called Phillips ""a leader of men ... [and] a brave and courageous man."" He said he has spoken with Phillips and said the captain is ""feeling quite good."" Phillips and his family, through Reinhart, expressed gratitude to the U.S. Navy. ""I actually was more concerned for his family,"" said Adm. Rick Gurnon, head of the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, where Phillips had trained. ""As a captain in sea, in a lifeboat, he was comfortable -- even if he was sharing it with Somali pirates.""  Watch Massachusetts Maritime Academy celebrate rescue » . Gurnon stressed that while Phillips was rescued, more than 200 mariners remain captives at sea. ""The pirates have a great business model that works for them: See ships, take ransom, make millions,"" he told reporters. At the White House, President Obama issued a statement saying he is ""very pleased that Capt. Phillips has been rescued and is safely on board the USS Boxer."" ""His safety has been our principal concern, and I know this is a welcome relief to his family and his crew,"" Obama's statement said. ""We remain resolved to halt the rise of piracy in this region."" Obama had given standing orders for the military to take ""decisive action"" if Phillips was in ""imminent danger,"" Gortney said. Phillips offered himself as a hostage after the pirates stormed the U.S.-flagged Alabama Wednesday morning, according to Maersk. Crew members have said that after the pirates stormed the ship, they overpowered one pirate and tied him up. The crew released the pirate Wednesday, hoping to exchange him for Phillips, but the pirates instead retreated to the lifeboat with Phillips, leaving the Alabama to its crew.  View a timeline of the attack and its aftermath » . Maersk Alabama crew members, who guided the ship to port in Mombasa, Kenya, on Saturday, were ""jubilant"" when they received word of the rescue, a statement from the company said.  Gortney said the Alabama had reported being harassed by pirates the day before the pirates' successful attack on Wednesday. When the Alabama crew made the call, ""our closest vessel from all the navies that were out there -- we have 16 navies that are patrolling those waters -- and the closest one was the USS Bainbridge, and it was over 300 nautical miles"" away he said.

"The acting head of the Internal Revenue Service said Thursday that evidence so far shows only conservative groups underwent extra scrutiny cited by an inspector general's disclosure of the agency's targeting of applications for tax exempt status. An initial report on the IRS targeting scandal this week by Daniel Werfel, the IRS principal deputy commissioner, led to the disclosure that IRS workers flagged both liberal and conservative groups when assessing their eligibility for the tax break available to social welfare organizations. IRS screeners used conservative-themed criteria such as ""tea party"" on ""Be on the Lookout"" or BOLO lists to determine if groups underwent further review for political activity that would make them ineligible, according to Werfel and the inspector general who first revealed the targeting. Another category of the BOLO lists also had liberal-themed criteria including ""progressives,"" but that category didn't set off the automatic extra scrutiny for political activity faced by conservative groups, according to a letter to the panel this week by Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George. Under tough questioning Thursday at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing, Werfel acknowledged that the different BOLO categories meant liberal groups avoided the extra scrutiny cited by the inspector general that included processing delays and extensive questions perceived by conservatives as political intimidation. The revelation bolstered the argument of GOP Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, the panel's chairman, that the targeting had a political motive. ""So far, the evidence only shows conservatives being systematically targeted by the IRS, not just flagged through the BOLO, but actually targeted,"" Camp said, later conceding ""we're in the early stages of this investigation."" Werfel repeatedly cautioned that his internal review was incomplete, and that additional information from continuing investigations by the FBI, the inspector general and congressional committees was needed to reach definitive conclusions. He noted that the 80 groups that have waited more than 120 days for a final decision on their applications for a tax break included a diverse range of political leanings. ""I didn't want to leave the committee with the impression that we're not seeing diversity of political labels across the spectrum,"" Werfel said of the IRS targeting. ""What I'm suggesting is more analysis -- significant more analysis -- is needed before we reach conclusions about what that means in terms of an IRS failure or an IRS issue."" The hearing on the still-evolving scandal featured angry accusations and tense exchanges between legislators, with Republicans inferring a government cover-up of high-level wrongdoing while Democrats accused them of political posturing. All involved agreed that Werfel needed more time to figure out exactly what happened, who was responsible and why. That didn't stop Republicans from criticizing his efforts so far. Camp said Werfel's report, filed just over a month after his appointment by President Barack Obama to clean up the mess at the IRS, lacked accountability and reached unsubstantiated conclusions. ""If there is anything this report shows, it's just how much more work must be done,"" Camp said, noting that Werfel had yet to interview principal figures or get other information necessary to determine the origins or scope of the targeting. Another GOP legislator, Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, called Werfel's report ""a sham."" Camp also warned Werfel that the targeting scandal and other IRS controversies, such as wasteful spending in past years, would affect his panel's consideration budget request for more money next year. ""Until the IRS proves that it can responsibly manage its current funds, the IRS will not see one more dime in taxpayer funding,"" Camp said. Werfel noted that the FBI and inspector general were handling interview of IRS officials involved in the targeting, adding that the investigations could involve criminal behavior. He repeated the assertion in his report that no evidence so far suggested intentional wrongdoing by agency personnel or influence from outside the IRS in the targeting. His report released Monday said five managers had been replaced and other steps taken in response to George's audit last month that set off a political firestorm in Washington. Republican leaders contend the targeting uncovered by the inspector general's audit indicated political villainy by the Obama administration to try to stifle opponents, such as groups with ""tea party"" in their names that were flagged for additional IRS scrutiny. Democrats said Thursday that such allegations were politically motivated instead of based on any evidence. Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan, the top Democrat on the panel, asked Werfel if there was any evidence of White House involvement in the targeting, and Werfel answered no. IRS targeting scandal reshaped by new details . On Wednesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters that ""there's been a lot of flagrant, unfounded accusations made by members of Congress in the Republican Party about this issue, accusations that were made without factual foundation."" Obama's second-term blues . Investigations by the FBI, congressional committees, the Treasury inspector general's office and the IRS continue. President Barack Obama appointed Werfel to clean up the IRS mess last month after the inspector general's audit uncovered targeting of applications that contained conservative-themed words such as ""tea party."" George's audit said the targeting resulted in some conservative groups having their applications delayed or stonewalled with requests for answers to inappropriate questions regarding donors, political beliefs and other matters. The targeting of conservative groups ended in May 2012, the audit said. In his first substantive report on the agency, Werfel said Monday that its tax-exempt unit used multiple lists of inappropriate criteria in assessing tax-exempt applications until earlier this month, more than a year later than previously revealed. Werfel said he has suspended the use of BOLO lists in considering tax-exempt applications for now. Boehner on IRS: Who is going to jail? Werfel's report Monday said the five IRS managers replaced included the previous acting commissioner he succeeded, as well as the head of the unit based in Cincinnati that handles tax-exempt applications. In addition, Werfel created an Accountability Review Board to recommend within 60 days ""any additional personnel actions necessary to hold accountable those responsible"" for the targeting disclosed by the inspector general's report. As part of his review, Werfel said 80 groups awaiting IRS action on their applications for tax-exempt status for more than 120 days could self-register with the agency as long as they certified under penalty of perjury that they would comply with applicable laws and regulations. At the heart of the matter is what kind of organization can qualify for tax-exempt status. Regulations limit such status to groups primarily involved in social welfare activities, while political groups are considered ineligible. Confusion over defining what constitutes political activity versus social welfare activity contributed to the targeting by the IRS, Werfel said. An IRS statement Monday said the ""safe-harbor"" option for self-certification would apply to groups that ""certify they devote 60% or more of both their spending and time on activities that promote social welfare."" ""At the same time, they must certify that political campaign intervention involves 40% or less of both their spending and time,"" the statement said. Applicants meeting those thresholds would get approval within two weeks of seeking self-certification, it said. Werfel said the IRS would continue checking on tax-exempt groups to ensure they were following the law.","IRS chief: No evidence that liberal groups scrutinized like conservative groups .

"The ""Blackfish"" controversy that torpedoed SeaWorld's Orlando concert series has now sunk some shows at Busch Gardens Tampa. ""We regret to announce that the Beach Boys and Pat Benatar and Neil Giraldo have canceled their performances at Bands, Brew & BBQ this year, but we respect their decision,"" a Busch Gardens Tampa spokesman said Thursday.  ""We're disappointed that there is a media controversy enacted by animal activists and based on misinformation."" Busch Gardens Tampa is owned by SeaWorld Parks and Entertainment, which has been targeted by animal rights activists since the airing of the documentary ""Blackfish"" on CNN last October. A long list of musical acts have canceled shows that were scheduled as part of SeaWorld's ""Bands, Blues & BBQ"" in February and March. Benatar said in a statement to CNN that she canceled her February 22 show once she realized that Busch Gardens was affiliated with SeaWorld.  ""In light of this we have opted to cancel our February 22, 2014, performance at Busch Gardens in Tampa."" The Beach Boys issued a short statement: ""The Beach Boys have cancelled their performance on February 15, 2014. The band regrets any inconvenience this may have caused their fans and they look forward to returning to Tampa soon."" 'Blackfish' backlash . The entertainers' exodus from SeaWorld's calendar began soon after CNN broadcast the documentary ""Blackfish"" in October. The film tells the story of the killing of a SeaWorld trainer by an orca in 2010. It raises questions about the safety and humaneness of keeping killer whales in captivity. Online petitions and social media postings targeted the acts who had signed on to play at the park. Acts that have canceled SeaWorld shows include Trace Adkins, Trisha Yearwood, Willie Nelson, Cheap Trick, Heart, Barenaked Ladies, Martina McBride and 38 Special.  Only Justin Moore and Scotty McCreery remain from the original list of acts on the event calendar. Their representatives have not responded to CNN's repeated requests for comment. The Canadian rock band Barenaked Ladies was the first to cancel, reacting to a petition posted on Change.org. ""This is a complicated issue, and we don't claim to understand all of it, but we don't feel comfortable proceeding with the gig at this time,"" the band said on its Facebook page. ""I don't agree with the way they treat their animals,"" Willie Nelson said on December 6 when he canceled. ""It wasn't that hard a deal for me."" Sisters Nancy and Ann Wilson of Heart did not elaborate last month when they announced their decision to cancel at SeaWorld, although they acknowledged it was ""due to the controversial documentary film."" SeaWorld's defense . SeaWorld said it would like the musical artists to learn for themselves about SeaWorld. ""The bands and artists have a standing invitation to visit any of our parks to see firsthand or to speak to any of our animal experts to learn for themselves how we care for animals and how little truth there is to the allegations made by animal extremist groups opposed to the zoological display of marine mammals,"" Gollattscheck said. SeaWorld says the documentary ignores the park's conservation efforts and research. ""More than 11 million people a year visit SeaWorld parks and most will see a killer whale presentation during their visit,"" Gollattscheck said.  ""Over the course of our 50-year history hundreds of millions of people have experienced killer whales in our parks.  There is tremendous appeal in that kind of inspirational and educational experience and we anticipate that killer whale display will continue for generations to come."" Thursday's announcement is the first word of cancellations at affiliated parks.  The controversy did not appear to dampen the profits of the parent company.  Propelled by fourth-quarter attendance, SeaWorld expects an estimated $1.46 billion in revenue for fiscal year 2013, the company announced Monday. The results, while preliminary, are expected to be a record for the 50-year-old company. SeaWorld reported total revenue in 2012 of $1.42 billion, according to SEC filings.  Strong attendance numbers at its flagship locations in Orlando, Florida, San Diego, California, and San Antonio, Texas, among others, helped boost the marine park's gains. ""We are very pleased with our fourth quarter performance, particularly for the SeaWorld-branded parks in Orlando and San Diego, which helped us to achieve record revenue for the year,"" said SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. President and CEO Jim Atchison in a news release.","Beach Boys, Pat Benatar and Neil Giraldo cancel Busch Gardens Tampa shows .

"(CNN)Celtic won the first Old Firm clash in nearly three years as two first half goals sunk ailing Glasgow rival Rangers at Hampden Sunday in their Scottish League Cup semifinal. The bitter rivalry between the two clubs which have dominated Scottish football for decades is well chronicled, but Celtic's superiority as Leigh Griffiths and Kris Commons found the target took the heat out of the fixture. It was the 400th competitive meeting, but first since April 2012, shortly before cash-strapped Rangers was liquidated and forced to re-form as a new entity in the bottom flight of the Scottish leagues. The 2-0 win for Celtic reflected the current status of the two clubs, one topping the Scottish Premiership, the other struggling to catch Hearts in the battle for the automatic promotion spot from the second flight. Rangers had hoped for redemption in the cup competition, but it is Celtic who will face Dundee United in the final on March 15. Griffiths headed home the opener on 10 minutes and Commons blasted home the second just after the half hour mark. Celtic was content to soak up sporadic Rangers pressure in the second half, with keeper Craig Gordon barely tested. It left manager Ronny Dalia satisfied with his team's efforts. ""I think 2-0 was a fair result,"" he said. ""In the first half we had four chances and we scored two which was okay. The second half we didn't have many but they didn't have a shot on target either."" Rangers -- without a permanent manager since the departure of Ally McCoist -- and still beset by boardroom wrangles -- will now be left to focus on its bid to win promotion back to the Scottish Premiership. If it succeeds the Old Firm matches will again become regular fixtures -- a welcome boost to the finances of both clubs -- as they are played to capacity audiences with extra television revenues. Sunday's game was beamed live to 54 countries. Arsenal rout . Meanwhile, in the English Premier League, Arsenal continued its recent charge with a 5-0 rout of struggling Aston Villa, without a goal in the last six league games. The match at the Emirates was entirely one-sided and the Gunners took the lead on eight minutes when Olivier Giroud scored after an assist from Mesut Ozil. German international Ozil added the second with the impressive Theo Walcott, watched by England manager Roy Hodgson, grabbing the third. Santi Cazorla scored the fourth from the penalty spot with Hector Bellerin's 30-yard effort completing a fine afternoon for Arsene Wenger's men. Arsenal has now taken 19 points from a possible 24 and risen to fifth, leapfrogging north London neighbor Tottenham Hotspur. Fourth-placed Southampton later suffered a shock 1-0 home defeat to Swansea, ending with 10 men after Ryan Bertrand was sent off in the second half. Jonjo Shelvey scored the Swansea goal after 83 minutes of a tight encounter. Messi magic . Barcelona's title hopes in Spain stayed on track but the Catalan giants had to twice come from behind to beat Villarreal 3-2 in the Nou Camp. Denis Cheryshev put the visitors ahead after half an hour, only for Neymar to level just before the interval. Luciano Vietto restored the Villarreal lead on 51 minutes but it was shortlived as Rafinha leveled two minutes later. Lionel Messi had been involved in that goal and he put Barcelona into the lead for the first time with a fine strike after an assist by Luis Suarez. The win lifts Barca to just one point behind leaders Real Madrid, but having played a game more.","Celtic wins Old Firm clash with Rangers at Hampden .

"A top-secret National Security Agency team uses spyware and hacking to gather intelligence on targets, according to a new report based on internal agency documents. According to Der Spiegel, a German magazine that published some of the documents, the unit's interception techniques are worthy of James Bond: intercepting a computer being shipped to a target and installing spyware before it is delivered; supplying an altered monitor cable that transmits everything on a computer's screen to the NSA; or planting a USB plug with a secret radio transmitter. The unit, called Tailored Access Operations, also uses hacking in addition to spy craft. The most basic method involves phishing, sending an e-mail that lures a target into clicking on it and unknowingly downloading NSA spyware. More sophisticated techniques include identifying exploitable computer vulnerabilities by eavesdropping on a target's error messages; tracking a target's cookies to shadow their Internet use; and even surreptitiously diverting a target's web surfing to phony replica web pages of commonly used sites such as LinkedIn and Facebook. Agents could use such fake sites both to see what a target is typing and to try to insert spyware on the target's computer, according to cybersecurity expert Michael Sutton at ZScaler, a California-based information technology security company. ""Now they have my username and password, they can get into my account and help them in other attacks,"" said Sutton. ""But in this particular scenario, what they really want to do is infect my machine"" by transferring malware to it. ""From an eavesdropping perspective, this is a gold mine,"" he said. ""If I can 'own' your computer, if I can gain access to it and gain a foothold into it, now I have access to all of your secrets."" An NSA spokeswoman declined to discuss specific reports about the unit but said in a statement, ""Tailored Access Operations (TAO) is a unique national asset that is on the front lines of enabling NSA to defend the nation and its allies."" She added that ""its work is centered on computer network exploitation in support of foreign intelligence collection."" The documents in Der Spiegel named targets that were penetrated successfully, including Mexico's security service and an underwater communications cable network. In 2010, TAO counted 279 active operations worldwide. ""This is NSA's hacking organization,"" said Matthew Aid, who wrote a book about the NSA and said he has spoken to members or former members of the unit. ""It's 1,600 men and women, military and civilians, average age mid-20s, maybe early 30s, so it's a very young, very tech-savvy organization."" The hackers focus on foreign militaries, governments and corporations, he said, and they are protected by multiple levels of secrecy. ""Cypher-locked doors. Retinal scanners. You have to have a special need-to-know clearance for access to the TAO spaces at NSA. And the people who work there can't talk to any other NSA employees about what they do and how they do it."" This report follows a string of revelations leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden about privacy and spying, from the tracking of millions of overseas cell phones, to the monitoring of foreign leaders' phones, to the global bulk scanning of e-mails. President Barack Obama commissioned a panel to review the NSA's tactics, and he is expected to address their findings in January. According to the documents posted online by Der Spiegel, TAO programmers develop spyware to infiltrate everything from smartphones and computers to routers, servers, hard drives and firewalls to access global communications traffic. But there is no indication that the companies whose products were targeted, such as Samsung, Dell, and Cisco, cooperated with the NSA's spyware or were even aware of it. ""No commercially available security system can detect a bug implanted by TAO,"" said Aid. ""That's its reputation.""","NSA unit called Tailored Access Operations combines spying and hacking to track its targets .

"(CNN) -- If the moon looks a little bit bigger and brighter this weekend, there's a reason for that. It is. Saturday's full moon will be a super ""perigee moon"" -- the biggest in almost 20 years. This celestial event is far rarer than the famed blue moon, which happens once about every two-and-a-half years. ""The last full moon so big and close to Earth occurred in March of 1993,"" said Geoff Chester with the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington. ""I'd say it's worth a look."" Full moons look different because of the elliptical shape of the moon's orbit. When it's at perigee, the moon is about 31,000 miles (50,000 km) closer to Earth than when it's at the farthest point of its orbit, also known as apogee. ""Nearby perigee moons are about 14% bigger and 30% brighter than lesser moons that occur on the apogee side of the moon's orbit,"" the NASA website says. This full moon will rise in the east at sunset and should look especially big at that time because of what's known as the ""moon illusion."" ""For reasons not fully understood by astronomers or psychologists, low-hanging moons look unnaturally large when they beam through trees, buildings and other foreground objects,"" according to NASA. iReport: Share your photos . Even though it may look close enough to touch, Saturday's full moon will still be at a healthy distance -- some 211,600 miles (356,577 km) away. As rare as it is, it may be worth a look. Miss it and you'll have to wait until 2029 to see it again.","The last full moon so big and close to Earth occurred in March of 1993 .

"(CNN)Now comes the hard part for Maria Sharapova. Having reached the Australian Open final, she'll have to overcome longtime nemesis Serena Williams. To utter that Sharapova is the underdog Saturday is like saying Roger Federer is a decent player. World No. 1 Williams leads the second-ranked Sharapova 16-2 in their rivalry -- but has won 15 matches in a row. During that streak, she has conceded three sets to the Russian. If that's not enough, Williams has never lost a semifinal or final in Melbourne, her record improving to 11-0 after topping fellow American Madison Keys 7-6 (5) 6-2 Thursday in the semifinals. Sharapova, meanwhile, has failed to win a major outside Roland Garros in seven years. But all the imposing statistics don't appear to be fazing the ever steely Sharapova, who last downed Williams at the year-end championships in 2004. ""I think my confidence should be pretty high going into a final of a grand slam no matter who I'm facing, and whether I've had a terrible record against someone, it doesn't matter,"" Sharapova, a 6-3 6-2 winner over compatriot Ekaterina Makarova Thursday, told reporters. ""I got there for a reason. I belong in that spot. I will do everything I can to get the title."" Some would say, too, that Sharapova has fate on her side. She was almost knocked out in the second round, needing to save a pair of match points against qualifier Alexandra Panova. And only last year Li Na took advantage of her second chance in Melbourne, fending off a match point in the third round before going on to capture a second grand slam title a week later. Since the second round, Sharapova hasn't come close to dropping a set. ""Everyone's going to expect me to win, but Maria is playing unbelievable,"" Williams was quoted as saying by the WTA's website. ""She was almost out of the tournament and came back, and she's playing better in every single match. ""She has nothing to lose, once again,"" Williams later told reporters. ""She has only things to gain. And I feel that way, too. ""I've won this tournament several times. I don't have to go out there and have another title. I want it, but it's not life or death for me. I think that helps me relax. So, yeah, she absolutely has nothing to lose, and I have nothing to lose, so it will be fun."" Williams is chasing a 19th grand slam title, which would separate the 33-year-old from retired legends Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert. She ultimately had too much game -- and experience -- for the 19-year-old Keys, who made her debut in a grand slam semifinal after eliminating Williams' older sister, Venus, in her maiden grand slam quarterfinal Wednesday. The big-hitting Keys, continuing to play with tape on her injured left thigh, broke for an early lead in the first set. Once Williams settled, though, she was rarely troubled on serve. It took a little longer than anticipated for Williams to finally oust Keys, with the teenager saving eight match points. ""I was a little frustrated at the end,"" Williams said. ""I had so many match points and just couldn't close it out and that doesn't usually happen. ""But in retrospect, she was playing very well. She served so well. I'm a really big fan of hers. She's so awesome, so positive, just a great player."" Not only did Williams defeat Keys, but she later got a chance to meet one of her favorite singers, Kenny Rogers. Sharapova's win over Makarova, who was appearing in a second straight grand slam semifinal, wasn't as dramatic although the five-time grand slam champion did let a 3-0 first-set advantage fade. The turning point came when Makarova was broken at 3-4 in the opening set. The night match on Rod Laver Arena on Thursday saw two-time grand slam winner Andy Murray beat 2010 Wimbledon finalist Tomas Berdych 6-7 (6) 6-0 6-3 7-5 to reach the men's final. On Friday, top-seed Novak Djokovic battles defending champion Stan Wawrinka in the other semifinal.","Serena Williams to meet Maria Sharapova in women's final .

"(CNN)Rory McIlroy completed his gun-to-tape victory in the Dubai Desert Classic Sunday to cement his position at the top of golf's world rankings. McIlroy carded a two-under-par final round 70 at the Emirates GC for a tournament record equaling tally of 22-under, leaving him three shots clear of Alexander Noren of Sweden. The Northern Irishman's multi-million dollar lawsuit against his former management company -- who are also counter suing him -- is scheduled to begin in a Dublin court Tuesday, but throughout the week McIlroy has shown no signs of being distracted by it. In fact as the protracted legal proceedings have rumbled on without an out of court settlement, McIlroy's form has picked up. His last seven appearances in European Tour events have seen him secure four wins -- including to major titles -- and three runners-up spots. He also starred in Europe's defense of the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles. McIlroy narrowly missed out on winning his 2015 opener in Abu Dhabi, but after a first round 64 in Dubai was never headed, reclaiming a title he last won in 2009 -- then his maiden success. ""It's nice to be able to put my name on that trophy again,"" McIlroy told the official European Tour website. ""It felt like I was coming second every time I was teeing it up so it was time for a change and obviously the only way I wanted to go was one better and thankfully I was able to do that today."" McIlroy started the final round four shots clear and was never seriously challenged despite Noren's superb final round of 65. A solitary bogey at the seventh was mixed with three birdies and he could afford to par home down the stretch with his lead intact. ""I played very nicely all week; I did what I needed to do today. I didn't play quite as well as the first three days but I played a solid round of golf and kept my nose in front,"" he added. Former world number one Lee Westwood looked set to make a move with three birdies in his first five holes, but a double bogey on the ninth ended his charge and he fell away further on the back nine. Defending champion Stephen Gallacher of Scotland carded a closing 69 to finish third on 16 under, with Morten Orum Madsen, U.S. Open champion Kaymer, Abu Dhabi winner Gary Stal, South African Open winner Andy Sullivan and Austria's Bernd Wiesberger tied for fourth.","Rory McIlroy claims Dubai Desert Classic title .

"Brazil may be the only country in the world where the food comes in bigger portions than on American plates. That's particularly true when it comes to the carnivorous side of things. It's meat by the wheelbarrow in the barbecue tradition known as churrascaria. The Brazilian barbecue tradition hails from the southern part of the country, from a gaucho technique of cooking meat in the wide-open country after a long day wrangling cattle. These days the wranglers come to you at the churrascaria, wielding skewers of meat from all manner of beast and bringing the cuts to your table one by one. There can be more than 20 different types of meat to choose from in the course of a meal at one of the big churrascarias. Each skewer-toting server approaches with a particular cut. You inspect and nod, as if it was a bottle of wine, and the waiter then slices off a chunk for you to savor. When a couple of waiters vie for your taste buds, it looks like a fencing match will break out. It can get hectic on the churrascaria floor, but it's worth it, because the slow-grilling Brazilian barbecue style known as rodizio produces some amazingly tasty food. It starts with a fanatical devotion to high-quality meat and special cuts. The hunks of meat are stabbed onto the skewer and then slow-roasted rotisserie-style over charcoal to lock in the juiciness and flavor. When the top layer of the meat is browned, it's sliced off fresh to serve. The barbecuing is tailored to your individual tastes. You get not only a wide selection of cuts, but also styles: rare (mal passado), medium rare (a ponto para mal), medium (a ponto), medium well (a ponto para bem) and well done (bem passado). The star of this meatapalooza is picanha, a top prime sirloin that melts in your mouth. But there's a big supporting cast -- alcatra (top sirloin), baby beef, filet mignon, file com alho (filet mignon with garlic), maminha (rump steak), costela de Ripa (beef short ribs), and pork loin, sausage, chicken and plenty more. Gallery: A look at Brazil's best beaches . Top 5 Brazilian barbecue cuts . Picanha . The hands-down favorite for Brazilians is picanha, a rump cut that's sliced in thin sheets and eaten with rice and beans. For anyone who wants to experience the Brazilian barbecue tradition, picanha is a must. The meat comes from the top of the rump, the rump cap, which has two sides, one that's better known as tri-tip and the other smaller side, which is picanha. Brazilians grill slabs of picanha with the fat on, and slice it off before serving. Good picanha is juicy, tender and triggers taste buds to demand more. It's a premium cut, juicy, tender and out of the normal steak experience. Keep the slices modest and you'll be able to get up from the chair after the feast. Baby beef . Known by the American handle (pronounced ""bebe beefey""), baby beef is the second most popular cut in Brazil, just back of picanha. It's seen as a delicacy and is priced accordingly, the most expensive of the churrascaria cuts. Baby beef, as the name implies, comes from younger cows, though not as young as veal cows. The savory meat comes from the tenderloin section and is more tender and lean than that of mature cows, which is a big attraction for Brazilian palates. It's a super-tasty cut, but will set your wallet back a bit. Alcatra (top sirloin) Alcatra is a top sirloin cut that's a traditional dish in Portuguese homes, served as a kind of pot roast, but the Brazilians reinvented it on the grill to create a flavorful style of sirloin. The right seasoning, grilling and smoky flavoring gives this tender cut a flavor and tenderness you won't be able to stop thinking about. It's a whole new slice of sirloin. Filet mignon . The king of the steaks is part of a pantheon in the Brazilian barbecue universe. It's still a favorite, but has competition from picanha and baby beef. The great thing about the churrascaria style, though, is that you're not restricted to one slab of meat. You can have a couple slices of picanha, filet mignon and more, depending on how many extra belt loops you have. Known for its lack of fat and tenderness, filet mignon can be exquisite in the hands of a great churrascaria chef. Lombo (pork loin) It's not all beef at the churrascaria, where pork, lamb, chicken and even fish are also on the menu. Lombo is a pork cut worth sampling. The loin is sliced into slabs for the skewer dressed in a Parmesan cheese coating. As is done with the beef, only the best cuts of loin make it to the grill, so the pork is as juicy and tender as the high-end beef cuts.

"CNN columnist John D. Sutter recently traveled to Alaska to try to find out why that state has the highest rate of reported rape in the nation -- three times the national average -- and what could be done to change that. He's asking readers to be part of the solution. You voted for him to cover this topic as part of CNN's Change the List project. The truth is even one rape is too many -- in Alaska or anywhere. Women and men who are victims of rape or sexual assault need support from their communities and from you. Here are some CNN-vetted organizations working to reduce the rate of violence against women in America's 49th state: . Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network . The Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, or RAINN, is the organization that runs the National Sexual Assault Hotline: 800-656-HOPE (4673). A caller can be connected a local organization within their communities that can help them find the nearest hospital capable of collecting forensic evidence of a rape. They can also provide an advocate to go to the hospital with a rape victim. RAINN can also assist with counseling and legal guidance. The organization has affiliates all over the country, including several in Alaska. Standing Together Against Rape . One of RAINN's Alaska affiliates is called STAR, or Standing Together against Rape. STAR is based in Anchorage and has several of its own hotlines as well. The local crisis number is 907-276-7273, and statewide, it's 800-478-8999. STAR has served survivors of sexual assault in Alaska for more than 30 years, providing a confidential and safe place to talk through their experience as well as a connection to medical  and social services. STAR also works with Abuse Women's Aid in Crisis or AWAIC to provide a 24-hour shelter where victims of domestic abuse or sexual assault may live for up to a month. Alaska Network on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault . Another group helping sexual assault survivors in Alaska is ANDVSA, or the Alaska Network on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault. This network of programs has served Alaska since 1980, providing survivors with emergency shelter, 24-hour crisis hotlines, food, clothing, confidential advocacy, counseling, support groups and community outreach as well as rural outreach. This group has a presence in much of the state, including more rural and remote areas. The Fourth R . The Alaska Network on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault's community outreach is extensive. It even has a special program for schools called The Fourth R, which is designed to develop skills of students in grades seven through nine on how to handle bullying, personal relationships, peer and dating violence, substance use and other high-risk behaviors. More than 50 schools in Alaska participate in the Fourth R program. Aiding Women in Abuse and Rape Emergencies . Finally, there's Juneau-based AWARE, or Aiding Women in Abuse and Rape Emergencies. The group has two crisis hotlines -- one for Juneau (907-586-1090) and one for the rest of Alaska (800-478-1090). AWARE provides an advocate to listen to survivor's stories and discuss legal options. It also operates a shelter in Juneau, one of the first in the state. While the advocates are not attorneys, they can provide the proper paperwork and support to get a protective order. Rape and sexual assault are problems anywhere they occur, and there are many programs nationwide worthy of support. But as Sutter found in his study, the rate is alarmingly high in Alaska. Even if you live far away from America's ""Last Frontier,"" you can help make the state safer by supporting these organizations.","Alaska is estimated to have the highest reported rape rate in the nation .

"(CNN)  -- Interruptions in the emergency room may exact an unhealthy toll on patient care, a group of Australian researchers reported Thursday. The researchers, from the University of Sydney and the University of New South Wales, found that interruptions led emergency department doctors to spend less time on the tasks they were working on and, in nearly a fifth of cases, to give up on the task altogether. The researchers carried out a time-and-motion study in the emergency department of a 400-bed teaching hospital, observing 40 doctors for more than 210 hours. They found that each doctor was typically interrupted 6.6 times per hour; 11 percent of all tasks were interrupted, 3.3 percent of them more than once. They calculated time on task and found that physicians spent less time on interrupted tasks than on uninterrupted tasks. In addition, doctors were multitasking 12.8 percent of the time. Doctors did not return to 18.5 percent of the interrupted tasks, according to the study, which was published in the journal Quality and Safety in Health Care. ""It appears that in busy interrupt-driven clinical environments, clinicians reduce the time they spend on clinical tasks if they experience interruptions, and may delay or fail to return to a significant portion of interrupted tasks,"" concluded the authors, who were led by Johanna Westbrook, director of the health informatics research and evaluation unit on the Faculty of Health Sciences at the University of Sydney. ""Task shortening may occur because interrupted tasks are truncated to 'catch up' for lost time, which may have significant implications for patient safety."" Other studies have shown that interruptions can result in lapses of attention, memory or perception, they wrote. ""Further, interruptions add significantly to cognitive load, increase stress and anxiety, inhibit decision-making performance and increase task errors,"" they said. The interruptions included a doctor being asked a question while trying to write a prescription. ""Now, most people think it's very acceptable to interrupt,"" but doing so can be dangerous, lead author Westbrook said. She urged hospital emergency department directors to teach hospital personnel when it is acceptable to interrupt and when it may be better to find an alternative strategy. ""We really have to look at ways to try and reduce unnecessary interruptions,"" she said. Though this study did not document any negative outcomes associated with interruptions, Westbrook published a paper two weeks ago that found a direct association between interruptions and the number of medication errors made by nurses. ""I think we have to look at interruptions as a potentially dangerous strategy in clinical work environments,"" she said. On average, doctors completed tasks that were interrupted once in about half the time they would have taken if they had not been interrupted. That perplexed the authors, who speculated that the interruptions led clinicians to try to compensate for the ""lost"" time by working faster and cutting corners. They said there was a strong need to develop processes that minimize unnecessary interruptions and multitasking. ""Our results support the hypothesis that the highly interruptive nature of busy clinical environments may have a negative impact on patient safety,"" they said. If their results are confirmed, they added, clinical work processes should be redesigned. Other industries have recognized interruptions as dangerous, including the airline industry, which has developed strategies to reduce interruptions to the flight crew during takeoff and limited unnecessary communications with the cockpit. ""In our society, we get very used to interrupting each other,"" Westbrook said. ""Sometimes we need to stop and think about that."" Neither the American College of Emergency Physicians nor the American Academy of Emergency Medicine responded immediately to requests for comment. The study was funded by Australia's Health Contribution Fund, Health and Medical Research Foundation and National Health and Medical Research Council.","Australian study looks at 40 emergency department doctors for 210 hours .

"They're three of the world's biggest superstars -- but few would have expected to see them together taking in a football match in Paris. Beyonce and her husband Jay-Z were the stars of the show in the French capital on Tuesday night after turning out to watch Paris Saint-Germain's stunning 3-2 win over Barcelona in the Champions League. While Lionel Messi and Neymar were busy scoring goals for Barca, in a losing cause, it was the celebrities in the stand which were capturing the attention of the photographers by the field. Most tourists visit the Eiffel Tower or take a stroll down the Champs Elysees, but Beyonce and her husband looked quite at home in the company of Beckham. Beckham, who retired from football following a five-month spell with PSG in 2013, watched on as his former teammates claimed an impressive victory. David Luiz, Marco Verratti and Blaise Matuidi got the goals for the home side, which was forced to play without injured talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The Swede, one of the leading strikers, was sat in the stands with a smile on his face as Barcelona suffered a rare defeat. Barcelona had not conceded a goal in any of its six league matches before arriving in Paris but its defensive frailties were exposed for all to see. Nicolas Sarkozy, the former French President, was also in attendance, sharing words with Jay-Z, perhaps even mentioning his wife's music career. Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, the former first lady of France, has released solo albums in the past and has been known to perform in public. But any singing at the Parc-des-Princes was done by the home supporters, who roared their team home to a famous win. Elsewhere, Bayern Munich recorded a 1-0 win over CSKA in Moscow in a game played behind closed-doors. The Russian side was forced to play the game without fans as punishment following their constant breaches of behavior. Thomas Muller's penalty secured Bayern's second consecutive victory in this year's competition. Roma sits second in Group E following a 1-1 draw at Manchester City courtesy of a goal from Francesco Totti. Totti's goal makes him the oldest player to score in the Champions League at the age of 38 years and three days. Elsewhere, Chelsea recorded a 1-0 win at Sporting Lisbon, Athletic Bilbao suffered a surprise 2-1 defeat at BATE Borisov in Belarus and Cypriot side APOEL held Ajax to a 1-1 draw.","Beyonce and Jay-Z in attendance to watch PSG .

"(CNN)At the start of 2014 even Roger Federer's most devoted fans would scarcely have believed he would end it within touching distance of the coveted world No. 1 ranking. Forget the anticlimax of his withdrawal from the title match against Novak Djokovic at the ATP World Tour Finals Sunday, he had shown enough in the tournament to suggest the old Federer magic was back. A straight sets near ""double bagel"" of Andy Murray in the group matches -- not to mention his saving of four match points in his epic semifinal against fellow Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka -- was proof positive of the 33-year-old's renaissance. He also beat world No.1 Djokovic on the way to winning the Masters 1000 event in Shanghai and claimed his fifth title of the year in his hometown event in Basel, the perfect buildup to the year-end showpiece in London. Federer told CNN that his performances in 2013, when he slipped down the rankings to seventh as a result of injury and a loss of form, had left even him with doubts he could return to his best. ""Things were difficult mid-year last year,"" said the 17-time grand slam winner. ""It was a hard year, a long year. I had to put in a lot of effort mentally and physically to get back in shape and find the right solution, how I was going to get back."" Federer parted company with his coach of three years Paul Annacone in his quest to rediscover his best form and replaced him with former grand slam legend Stefan Edberg. Not only that, he switched to a much bigger framed racket -- something of a gamble so late in his career. But with the year only a few days old, Federer reached the final of the Brisbane International, losing to Lleyton Hewitt, and the semifinals at the Australian Open where he was beaten by his old rival Rafael Nadal. ""This year, everything has been really good. Right at the beginning of the year, in Australia,"" recalled Federer. ""I played very well in Brisbane and in Melbourne. ""That was actually quite a surprise for me, because I thought it was going to take until March or April until I was going to find my best game. ""But it came earlier and in the process, I was able to move up the rankings quicker,"" he revealed. That progression quickened with titles in Dubai and Halle, backed up by reaching the final of Masters 1000 events in Indian Wells and Monte Carlo. It left Federer in fine fettle as he headed into his beloved Wimbledon and with a real prospect of adding to his record number of grand slam singles titles. Impressive play saw him reach his 25th grand slam final, but Djokovic stood in his way. It was an epic encounter, Federer so close to causing an upset in a five-set final, but he can now reflect with pride on his achievement. ""I think Wimbledon was definitely a highlight -- getting to the final and getting as close as I did to Djokovic,"" he believes. ""That, to me, cemented that I was literally back -- back maybe where I belong and back where I wanted to be."" Federer also looked set for more grand slam glory at the U.S. Open, until he was surprisingly beaten by eventual winner Marin Cilic. A lesser player might have suffered an adverse reaction to that defeat, but Federer was undaunted and has shown improved form in the closing months of the year. ""I've been able to really shift gears -- and I've had a great finish to the season so far,"" he said. ""And the next thing you know, I'm playing for world No.1, which I quite honestly can't believe."" Federer's hopes of the top ranking were ended when Djokovic beat Tomas Berdych in group play at the ATP World Tour Finals, but he still has one further milestone to contemplate. Paired with Australian Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka, Federer has lifted Switzerland into the final of the Davis Cup for the first time. France will provide the opposition in Lille from Friday, with Federer hoping the minor back problem he sustained -- ironically in beating Wawrinka in a three-set epic at the ATP World Tour Finals -- will clear up in time. A Swiss triumph would cap a remarkable year for Federer, who is already looking towards 2015. With Rafael Nadal sidelined by injury and illness and Murray unable to match his heroics of 2012 and 2013, the way looks clear for the current top two to dominate. But Federer is also wary of the new wave of talent that made their mark this year. ""We definitely have the next wave of generation coming through,"" he considers. ""With Nishikori, Raonic, Cilic, Dimitrov -- there's a few guys there. The younger guys are pushing up as well -- the guys between 17 and 21, right now. ""I think we'll see some big challenges coming from that generation in the next two years."" Federer is particularly impressed by Kei Nishikori, who beat Djokovic in the semifinals of the U.S. Open and pushed him hard in the semifinals in London last week. ""I've known Nishikori since he was 17 years old, and I've always been impressed by how he carries himself, how he handles pressure, how well he can play and how talented he is,"" said Federer of the Japanese rising star. ""So I think for Asia, it's a big deal, a big win, because we haven't had a great Asian player in some time now. "" Federer is also optimistic about the future of his sport as heads into the autumn of his remarkable career. ""I think the tennis tour is doing very well, record numbers in attendance, and facilities being upgraded as we speak, so I think it's really, really good times for tennis right now."" When Federer does decide to hang up his racket the Tour will lose its star attraction. But, based on his 2014 appearances, that moment is still some way off.","Roger Federer reflects on a triumphant 2014 .

"(CNN) -- The sparks of outrage that started in Ferguson, Missouri, have ignited a firestorm of protests across the country and beyond. But the furor isn't just about one grand jury's decision on one shooting case. To many protesters, the death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown -- and the lack of an indictment for the officer who shot him -- are symbolic of racial injustice in America. ""I think that it's important for people to know that the decision not to indict (Officer) Darren Wilson means that the system does not value black lives,"" one protester marching through Los Angeles told CNN. Complete coverage of what's happening in Ferguson . ""I think that it means that a cop can kill a black or brown kid when he's defenseless and unarmed and not get charged. I think that it means that we either fight back and stand up and end police terrorism."" More than 170 protests sprouted up across the country Tuesday. Some crowds blocked bridges, tunnels and major highways. But unlike the violence that erupted in Ferguson on Monday night, most of the demonstrations were peaceful. In New York, a protesters spanning an array of races and ages filled Times Square with their hands up, some chanting, ""Don't shoot."" In Washington, a crowd including prep school students lay silently on a sidewalk, as if dead. And in Boston, even jail inmates joined in the protest silently from a window. Here's what the country looked like late Tuesday and into Wednesday: . ATLANTA . The Public Enemy anthem pumping from mounted speakers at a protest in downtown Atlanta captured the mood of the crowd of roughly 300 Tuesday night. ""Fight the Power,"" the rapper's voice shouted over the speaker. ""Fight the powers that be. ..."" Some Atlanta protesters held signs that read ""Enough"" and ""We are all one bullet away from being a hashtag."" ""It's a travesty; it's just not right,"" ShaCzar Brown said, holding up a sign that read, ""Stop killer cops."" ""Seventy years ago, it was legal to kill black people,"" Brown said, referring to the spate of lynchings that spread through the U.S. in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. ""It's essentially still legal."" BOSTON . About 1,000 protestors marched through the streets of Boston Tuesday night, passing by the South Bay House of Correction where inmates looked on from windows -- many of them holding their hands up in the air. On one window, someone had written ""Mike Brown"" in tape. Even though police said 15 people were arrested, the gathering was peaceful. ""I'm very proud of the young people here,"" Police Superintendent in Chief William Gross told the Boston Globe. ""Do you see any cars burning? Do you see any broken windows? No."" Protester Daniel Jose Older told CNN the demonstration rapidly grew from a small gathering to hundreds of people. ""Folks have taken over the streets,"" Older said. ""It's a beautiful thing to see."" CHICAGO . About 200 members of the Black Youth Project 100 started a 28-hour sit-in outside Mayor Rahm Emanuel's office starting on Tuesday morning. Why 28 hours? According to the group, a black person is killed by a police officer or a person protected by the state every 28 hours in America. Some lay motionless on the City Hall floor, as if they had been shot. But by Tuesday night, the protest was over. After City Hall closed for the day, police threatened to arrest those attempting to stay inside. LONDON . The protests weren't just in the United States. Some were in Canada, and hundreds turned out Wednesday in London -- starting outside the U.S. Embassy before spreading elsewhere in the English city. Waving placards that read ""Justice for Michael Brown,"" ""Solidarity with Ferguson"" and ""Black Lives Matter,"" protesters held candles in the chilly November drizzle in Grosvenor Square. The speakers included Carole Duggan, whose nephew Mark was shot dead by police in 2011, sparking days of riots in London and other cities across England. Marcia Rigg, whose brother Sean died in police custody in London in 2008, said ""institutional racism"" was a global problem. ""We need change,"" Rigg said. ""There needs to be a political will to change, a political will for justice."" LOS ANGELES . A stretch of the 101 Freeway in Los Angeles was temporarily shut down in both directions Tuesday evening after protesters took road blocks from the streets and put them on the freeway, police said. But protesters who gathered outside Los Angeles police headquarters demonstrated peacefully. ""We have detained people. We don't have any property damage to speak of,"" Officer Jack Richter said. ""We are letting (the people) exercise their constitutional rights."" Demonstrators returned to the city's streets again Wednesday. Scores of them began at the federal courthouse, then marched with signs held high through downtown. As of 6 p.m. (9 p.m. ET), the event -- which, by then, had already been underway for hours -- was peaceful, said California Highway Patrol Officer Edgar Figueroa. Police were steering the demonstrators, keeping them downtown and away from freeways, according to Figueroa. MINNEAPOLIS . A woman in a group of protesters blocking an intersection was run over by a car during a demonstration Tuesday. The Star Tribune newspaper reported that the driver honked at the protesters before knocking a few people onto the hood of the car and apparently running over the woman's legs. The woman injured was hospitalized with ""minor injuries."" NEW YORK . A massive protest Tuesday wound its way from Union Square to FDR Drive and to the United Nations, Times Square and Harlem. ""Now it's not clear where we're going,"" said CNN's Miguel Marquez, who was interviewing protesters as they continued marching after midnight into early Wednesday. One demonstrator said he didn't even know about the protest until he saw it pass by his workplace on Times Square. He decided to join in. ""I just want to help bring about change ... sometimes I am profiled based on my race,"" said the protester, who is black. ""I think this is progress ... now we're going to make sure things are going to change."" As they marched, some protesters chanted, ""Mike Brown! Mike Brown!"" Police, who were nearby in large numbers, stayed back and let the marchers go. OAKLAND . Perhaps the most turmoil Tuesday night was in Oakland, California, where vandals smashed the windows of a car dealership and looted several businesses, including a T-Mobile cell phone store. Some also set bonfires in the city. One row of bonfires stretched across a road, blocking off access. At least one person was seen adding more items to the fires. WASHINGTON, D.C. In Washington, protesters lay down on a sidewalk outside police headquarters as if dead, Nikki Burdine of CNN affiliate WUSA tweeted Tuesday. Some had handwritten notes on their chests: ""Black lives matter."" Read what Darren Wilson told the grand jury .

"For centuries, the lush national parks of southern Kenya and northern Tanzania have been called home by the Maasai, one of Africa's most culturally district tribes. Being traditional pastoralists with a nomadic bent, the Maasai have used the sprawling grasslands and forested slopes of the Serengeti National Park, Tsavo National Park and Mkomazi Game Reserve as a grazing ground for their cattle, which provide them with the milk, meat and blood they need to survive. But lately, these rich lands have also lured many outsiders, including large-scale hunting companies, threatening the traditional Maasai way of living. ""The riches and the wealth that come out of it is actually flying away from Maasai land by the rich and powerful people,"" says Martin Saning'o Kariongi, with a wry smile. ""Maasai land is a very rich country, or rich region, but the owners, the inhabitants, are amongst the poorest in the world. It's very sad but that's the reality."" Read this: Maasai tribe's 'last stand' Aware of the precarious position his tribe finds itself in, Kariongi, a well-respected Maasai community leader, has made it his life's work to save his people and their way of life, whilst helping them adapt to a changing world. As one of the few of his generation to make it through high school and further education, Kariongi started his work as a social development activist in the early 1990s, after spending time studying in Europe. Upon his return to Tanzania, he organized a legal campaign opposing a government-forced eviction of Maasai people from the country's Simanjiro plains. The High Court of Tanzania ruled in favor of the Maasai and soon Kariongi was working to improve the economic conditions of his people too. ""Around 2000 we started to think that despite the whole struggle for land rights and human rights of the Maasai people, poverty is growing and so many of our young people are rushing into cities,"" recalls Kariongi. ""That's when we actually said we have to find a way to create opportunities for community economic empowerment."" Read this: 'Education is the road out of poverty' Kariongi's first idea for self-sustainability was to turn the resources available to the Maasai -- their animals and abundant milk -- into an opportunity to create wealth for his people. Working together with a SHGW, a Dutch NGO dedicated to promoting sustainable development in rural regions of the developing world, they launched a company and established five small milk processing units in five locations around the Maasai plains. From milking the herds to processing the milk and producing the dairy products, the business is run entirely by women. The units can process up to 2,000 liters a day, making cheese, yoghurt, butter and ghee. ""We started the milk processing plant as one way of finding a ready market for the women,"" says Kariongi, who's based his social development plan on gender equality. ""As an economic project that will create a market where women can sell milk and engage in a cash economy,"" he adds. ""It has been going on now for the last five years and the life of the people, the life of the families have changed dramatically and women are making so much money."" Today, the company has grown to include many arms, from an energy and water firm, to a media house producing broadcasts tailored for the Maasai, to a community ranch that helps improve access to quality breeds. They are all growing organically, based on a strict business model. ""The social investor who is investing in us is investing as an investor, not as a donor,"" explains Kariongi, who is a strong opponent of handouts. ""This social business mentality is actually creating opportunities to awaken our entrepreneurial nature; that we use our own locally available resources to create wealth and to create sustainability within ourselves to come out of poverty, rather than depending on aid,"" he says. Read this: Good African Coffee wants trade, not aid . It's all part of Kariongi's determination to help his people adapt, intact, to the 21st century and avoid extinction. ""We have created facilities here -- the radio station, the milk processing plant, the energy and water company, the internet, the library -- all these facilities to bring modern life to people, so they don't have to rush to towns,"" says Kariongi. ""When we lost our sons and daughters, rushed into towns, our women going to towns, then our lands will become empty and we might end up in an extinction."" He adds: ""Culture is not static; culture is dynamic, it grows; it's like a fire -- In order for the fire to keep on burning and giving light and heat, somebody has to be putting new fire wood. And the culture is like that -- so generations come and go, and each generation puts its own firewood on the fire and the fire is the culture.""","Maasai activist helping his people adapt to the 21st century .

"Dr. Conrad Murray was sentenced Tuesday to four years in the Los Angeles County jail -- the maximum sentence allowed under the law -- in the death of Michael Jackson. He may serve no more than two, however. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor, in a lengthy statement delivered before sentencing Murray for involuntary manslaughter, said he felt a significant responsibility to determine the appropriate sentence, utilizing his ""sense of fairness and decency."" ""There are those who feel Dr. Murray is a saint,"" Judge Pastor said. ""There are those who feel Dr. Murray is the devil. He's neither. He's a human being. He stands convicted of the death of another human being."" Automatic credit for good behavior lowers the actual time served to two years, which puts his projected release date in late 2013, Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said. Overheard on CNN.com: Is 4-year sentence fair? Murray is not eligible for early release electronic monitoring or house arrest, which some county prisoners get under a federal court order aimed at reducing jail overcrowding, Whitmore said.  ""He does not meet our requirements for any kind of home monitoring,"" he said. Members of Jackson's family, who sat in court for Tuesday's sentencing, appeared pleased with the judge's decision to ignore defense pleas for leniency. A statement from the family, read in court by a lawyer, said they were ""not here to seek revenge,"" but they wanted a sentence that ""reminds physicians that they cannot sell their services to the highest bidder and cast aside their Hippocratic oath to do no harm."" It included a message to the judge from Jackson's three children, Prince, Paris and Blanket. ""We will grow up without a father, our best friend, our playmate and our dad,"" the children said. Defense lawyer Ed Chernoff acknowledged that it was unlikely Pastor would accept probation for Murray, but he still made a case for community service over time behind bars. ""He could do things for the community on probation that he could never do sitting in that little room,"" Chernoff said. Even without jail time, Chernoff said, he will suffer the rest of his life because of the loss of his medical career and the stigma of the conviction. ""Whether he is a barista the rest of his life, whether he is a greeter at Walmart, he's still going to be the man who killed Michael Jackson for the rest of his life,"" Chernoff said. Deputy District Attorney David Walgren, arguing for the maximum four years in jail, said Murray was ""playing Russian roulette with Michael Jackson's life every single night,"" by using the surgical anesthetic propofol to put him to sleep in ""a reckless, obscene manner."" Murray showed his lack of remorse or acceptance of his personal responsibility in an interview nine days before he was found guilty, Walgren said. ""I don't feel guilty because I did not do anything wrong,"" Murray said in a documentary aired days after he was convicted. Pastor delivered a 30-minute explanation of why he was sentencing Murray to the maximum jail time, even though the doctor was technically eligible for probation. Murray's ""faux documentary"" made it appear he was just a ""bystander"" in Jackson's death who was ""entrapped"" and ""betrayed"" by his patient, Pastor said. ""Yikes!  Talk about blaming the victim,"" he said.  ""Not only isn't there any remorse, there's umbrage and outrage on the part of Dr. Murray against the decedent, without any, any indication of the slightest involvement in this case."" Pastor said that while he had considered the entire ""book"" of Murray's life, he also had ""read the book of Michael Jackson's life."" ""Regrettably, as far as Dr. Murray is concerned, the most significant chapter, as it relates to this case, is the chapter involving the treatment, or lack of treatment, of Michael Jackson."" Jackson died ""not because of an isolated one-off occurrence or incident,"" Pastor said. ""He died because of a totality of circumstances which are directly attributable to Dr. Murray ... because of a series of decisions that Dr. Murray made."" Murray, he said, became involved in ""a cycle of horrible medicine."" He cited Murray's ""pattern of deceit and lies. That pattern was to assist Dr. Murray."" A tape recording of Jackson's slurred voice was Murray's ""insurance policy,"" Pastor said. ""It was designed to record his patient surreptitiously at that patient's most vulnerable point. I can't even imagine that happening to any of us because of the horrific violation of trust."" He said he wondered whether that tape would have been offered for sale, had Jackson not died and a rift had developed between the two in the future. One of the 12 jurors who found Murray guilty said in an interview airing Tuesday on HLN's ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell,"" that the recording did not play into the verdict. ""We talked about that audio a little bit,"" Debbie Franklin, known as ""Juror 5,"" said.  ""We didn't really understand why it was presented. I still do not understand what that was about."" Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter three weeks ago after a trial in which prosecutors successfully argued that Murray's reckless use of propofol to help Jackson sleep, without proper monitoring equipment, led to the singer's death. ""We had decided the three issues we were going to focus on were the not calling 911, not having the medical equipment and him leaving the room,"" Franklin said.  ""That was the bottom line for this case."" Testimony during the trial revealed that Murray gave propofol nearly every night in the two months before the singer's death on June 25, 2009, as Jackson prepared for his comeback concerts set for London the next month. The judge set a hearing for January 23 to decide on the prosecution's request that Murray be ordered to pay Jackson's estate and his children more than $100 million in restitution for the ""wage and profits lost,"" as provided under California's ""victim's bill of rights"" law. The singer's ""estate estimates Michael Jackson's projected earnings for the 50-show O2 concert series to be $100 million,"" the prosecutors said. With nearly $2 million in funeral expenses and 10% interest added each year, the prosecution is asking Pastor to order Murray to pay Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson more than $120 million in restitution. While it is doubtful that Murray, who is unlikely to ever practice medicine again, could pay very much of that sum, it could prevent him from reaping financial benefits from any books, interviews or film projects in the future.","Dr. Murray's release date is projected for late 2013, the sheriff's spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- President Obama on Wednesday will visit Phoenix, Arizona, one of the cities hardest hit with foreclosures, where he's expected to outline a $50 billion to $100 billion plan to help homeowners. Economist Peter Morici said $50 billion to $100 billion won't be enough to solve the mortgage crisis. Though administration officials are tight-lipped about details, one idea that has been floated is for the federal government to reduce monthly mortgage payments by modifying loans. Sheila Bair, the U.S. FDIC chairwoman, has advocated reducing payments to between 31 and 38 percent of a family's gross income. ""This crisis in housing has devastating consequences, and our government should have moved more forcefully to help contain the damage,"" Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said Monday. ""You're going to learn about [the administration's plan] as the rollout continues,"" said Jared Bernstein, Vice President Joe Biden's economic advisor. Bernstein said it will be a ""very aggressive plan to help responsible homeowners stay in their homes."" In Phoenix, the median home price is $150,000 -- a significant dip from its peak of $262,000 in recent years. The national rate of foreclosure increased by 79 percent between December 2006 and December 2007, according to RealtyTrac, a company that compiles data on home foreclosures. Foreclosure filings -- default notices, auction sale notices and bank repossessions -- continued to climb in January, though at a slower pace than the month before, according to RealtyTrac. That was still 18 percent higher than in January 2008. ""It's really a toxic mix of higher than anticipated prices on monthly payments combined with house values that have dropped makes it impossible for people to refinance or sell their homes,"" said RealtyTrac Vice President Rick Sharga. Some economists praise federal intervention in the housing crisis. ""You cut down on the ratio to make [home ownership] more affordable,"" said Anthony Sanders, a professor of finance and real estate at Arizona State University. But Sanders cautioned that the president's plan will likely only make a dent in the problem. ""Fifty billion is a good place to start but I'm just saying right now it's not enough,"" he said. ""It'll be enough to save Kansas where they really don't have big negative equity problems."" Economist Peter Morici, of the University of Maryland, agrees with Sanders. ""We are likely looking at a trillion dollars in mortgage losses before it's all over,"" he said. ""And putting $50 [billion] to $100 billion in is not going to solve the problem."" Today is a game of payback for yesterday, said Phillip Robinson, a foreclosure attorney who has been quite busy lately. ""We lived in a culture the last 10 years where mortgage originators said you could use your house as a credit card to pay off your cars, to pay off your credit card bills,"" he said. ""Well, that doesn't exist anymore."" CNN's Mary Snow and Jim Acosta contributed to this report.","Plan is expected to help reduce mortgage payments by modifying loans .

"(CNN) -- The number of Americans killed on U.S. highways last year was the lowest since 1961, the Department of Transportation announced Monday. The number of fatalities on U.S. highways dropped in 2008 to its lowest level since 1961. Last year's death toll was put at 37,313. In 1961, the number of lives lost was 36,285. The numbers were compiled by the DOT's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In addition, the rate of deaths on U.S. highways hit a record low last year --  1.28 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled, down from 1.36 in 2007, the department said in a news release. U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood credited more widespread seat belt use for the drop. NHTSA estimated that Michigan had the highest seat belt use, at 97.2 percent, while Massachusetts registered the lowest, at 66.8 percent. ""States like Michigan are raising the bar on seat belt use, making communities safer and keeping families intact,"" said LaHood. Use rates of at least 90 percent were tallied for 16 states and territories: Michigan, Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, California, Maryland, Iowa, Puerto Rico, New Jersey, Delaware, Indiana, Texas, Nevada, New Mexico, Illinois and the District of Columbia. Massachusetts, Wyoming and New Hampshire had the lowest use rates -- all below 70 percent. States with laws mandating the use of seat belts tended to have higher use rates.","In 2008, death toll on U.S. highways was 37,313 -- lowest since 1961 .

"(CNN) -- The major talking point at the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas this summer was the extent to which experts had got their predictions wrong. In April, the U.S. Department of Justice forced the three largest online poker sites to close their doors to American customers, essentially imposing prohibition on one of the undisputed boom industries of the 21st century. The knock-on effect to poker's flagship tournament series was expected to be profound, with player numbers predicted to plummet, perhaps by as much as 60%. But they didn't. There was almost no change in attendance at all. Despite an industry in turmoil there were still 6,865 players handing over $10,000 for their chance at a near $9m payday at the prestigious Las Vegas tournament known as the ""Main Event"". These are the kind of numbers, and dizzying sums of money, to which poker players have grown accustomed over the past decade, when the game has undergone a sensational explosion in popularity. Although its legality in the United States has been uncertain since 2006, a study in 2009 by Poker Players Research showed that 10 million Americans played online poker, and it had grown into a worldwide industry worth at least $2.5bn dollars a year in revenue. The game in the short term is a combination of skill and luck, but the keen financial acumen of the best exponents meant thousands of people played online poker professionally, making their living solely from the game. When the sites were closed to Americans in April, not only was the single largest market quarantined, cutting the operators' profits, but many professional players essentially lost their jobs. Analysts were fearing the worst. Yet although players in the World Series of Poker (WSOP) came from 85 countries, two thirds of the field was American. It seemed the online prohibition had only enhanced the appetite for poker in the game's traditional capital and the casino poker rooms were packed. The robust numbers, however, put a misleading gloss on an industry still mired in controversy. At the time the Department of Justice closed the poker sites -- on what has become known as ""Black Friday"" -- poker operators' bank accounts were frozen and millions of dollars of players' funds were put out of their reach. The players -- both full time professionals and recreational dabblers -- were initially unsure when they would see their money again and although PokerStars, the largest site, immediately co-operated with the authorities and repaid more than $100m to its American former customers, neither Absolute Poker nor Full Tilt Poker, the two other indicted sites, have yet paid back a penny. Rumors became increasingly voluble that the funds had been diverted into marketing and operational budgets, in contravention of rules governing online gambling sites. Although Full Tilt Poker initially continued to operate outside the United States, it had its licence suspended by the Alderney Gambling Control Commission in the Channel Islands in late June and has not traded since. ""The atmosphere (at the World Series of Poker) was definitely deflated,"" said Dave Behr, a poker industry executive and analyst. ""The continuing fallout from the Full Tilt situation -- notably the total silence from Full Tilt Poker as to when U.S. players might expect to receive their money -- put a damper on the whole Series. Every week that went by, the FTP situation seemed to get worse and that in turn siphoned some of the pageantry out of the World Series of Poker."" In previous years, early losers from World Series tournaments would simply fire up their laptops and replenish funds at the online tables. This year, the only option for poker enthusiasts was the grind of the ""live"" tables: plonking down a bundle of bills and dueling face-to-face. But the relative renaissance may not be sustainable. ""Live"" poker is a far less convenient option than online play: the charges are higher than online; it is only possible to play at one table at once; and human dealers are much slower than their computerized counterparts, and expect tips. Other overheads, including traveling expenses and hotel bills, also sap revenue from bankrolls. It is more trouble than it is worth for many former sofa-based online players. Commentators have suggested that the high turnout in Las Vegas this summer represented one last hurrah for some players, prepared to speculate in full their poker bankroll, which can no longer be parlayed online. ""My prediction is that the steep drop everyone feared this year will become a reality in 2012,"" said Behr. ""Black Friday happened close enough to the start of the WSOP, and PokerStars players were paid out fast enough, that players could take 'one last shot' this year."" PokerStars, and other operators who have never courted the American market, continue to flourish internationally and some Europe-based players are relishing the absence of Americans from the online tables. ""It's actually a good thing from my point of view,"" said Rupinder Bedi, 30, a British online poker player. ""Fields are softer. American players have got a good solid game but now the tournaments are filled with a lot more European players who aren't as good."" Bedi also cautioned, however, that many ""live"" international poker tournaments might suffer from the American lockout. ""If there's not a booming budget in online poker, then the whole poker economy will struggle,"" he said. Legislation for online poker in the United States seems likely in a couple of years, and will probably tempt the major casino chains to expand into cyberspace. Indeed, there is plenty of gossip in poker circles that April's indictments were specifically intended to clear the decks of non-American companies ahead of a concerted push for regulation. But poker at the moment remains a pastime best enjoyed by non-Americans a point perhaps underlined by the cosmopolitan make up of the Main Event final table. When the remaining nine players return to Las Vegas in November to play in the grand final, representatives from the Czech Republic, Ireland, Belize, Germany, Ukraine and the United Kingdom will surround only three Americans, the fewest in the tournament's 41-year history.","In April U.S. Department of Justice shut down numerous online poker sites .

"On a chilly morning in Barre, Vermont, a random act of kindness warmed the hearts of strangers and spurred another -- and another after that. Kathleen Connors stopped at L&M Diner on Saturday after a 12-hour overnight shift at Central Vermont Medical Center, where she works as a surgical nurse. ""She got her usual breakfast,"" L&M manager Tayler Merriam told CNN. ""Hot chocolate with extra whipped cream, a plain pancake and table syrup."" Connors got up to pay her bill, but instead of paying for just herself, she footed the bill for a nearby pair who appeared to be father and son, whom she didn't know. ""I was looking around aimlessly and I had a pocket full of bingo winnings,"" Connors said. ""It's nice to see a family come together on the weekend."" After paying $40 for both meals, she got in her truck and went home without a thought. What she didn't know was that her generosity would be repeated -- 46 times -- in the span of 6 hours.

L&M Diner is a relatively small establishment. Housing just 13 booths and 11 seats at the counter, it's the type of joint that attracts local regulars. Connors is a regular, and she's known around Barre for her ""bubbly"" personality and easygoing nature, according to Merriam. ""I see a lot of people in the restaurant business and she's one of those people you can carry on a conversation with,"" Merriam said. Connors moved to Vermont 10 months ago after living in Massachusetts for the majority of her life. She stops at L&M Diner about twice a week after her shifts at the hospital, just like she did Saturday. ""This is my way of showing my appreciation for Vermont.

"""Here we go again,"" I sigh, browsing news channels. Each one, leading with the chilling buzzwords: ""Islamic State"" and ""Jihadist Murder."" Not since the weeks following the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York has turning on the TV been so demoralizing for Muslims across the globe. I have that same sinking feeling whenever an atrocity takes place which is broadly placed at the feet of the ""Muslim world."" Because, ""Hi, I am Lauren and I am a Muslim"" -- should there be a new support group? What's depressing as a ""revert"" (Muslims believe everyone is born into their faith) to Islam is to witness the casual sleepwalk towards the branding of all Muslims -- wherever we live and whatever our lives -- as the ""same."" As the wider community watches this dangerous pantomime unfold, it is significant that the question asked (again) of Muslim Britons or Americans is not: ""How do we tackle these challenges together?"" but ""what can be done about 'extremism' in your community?"" This question pushes millions of us outside mainstream society, causing fissures where fault lines already exist. Almost a decade ago, as the (Christian) head interviewer at the Islam Channel in the UK, my job put me into contact with some of the Muslim world's most prominent clerics, academics and leaders. My contact with many chilled-out, clean-living and gentle people -- offering me kindness, food and shelter -- led me to research the world's fastest growing faith. I came to embrace its central concept: the ""Oneness of God."" During this time, I also visited Palestine as a reporter. My working life in the Western media had not prepared me for the experience. I realized that I had been misguided about Islam and its people by the political mantra, best summarized as: ""You're either with us or against us."" One day, reporting from a refugee camp in Gaza, I was led by a group of shoeless children to a dark living room, lit only by candles due to a power cut. An elderly lady offered me tea and I found myself alone with a short-bearded young man in jeans and a t-shirt, with a serious expression. ""You are now in the house of Islamic Jihad,"" he said. My eyes took in the impoverished home. My hair was out, my arms on show, and I was in my usual London-style clothes. ""Why aren't you afraid?"" The young man asked. ""Because your mum's making me tea,"" I said. He went on to tell me that whether I was Christian, American, secular or Jewish, so long as I came to Palestine in peace, he and his colleagues would protect me with their lives and treat me (the sister in law of Tony Blair, former UK prime minister -- no friend of Islam) as their honored guest. For the best part of a decade, this has remained my professional experience. I have also interviewed members of Hamas, Hezbollah and the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades. The men I met expressed the same promise to protect my safety. That particular young man in Gaza would no more recognize the aims or behavior of the so-called ""Islamic State,"" in beheading journalists and threatening the mass murder of other faiths, than your own kids or, for that matter, your average Muslim teenager in Los Angeles, London or Lille would. Yet Muslims -- whether involved in genuine armed resistance in Gaza or simply preparing for college in the Midwest -- are labeled as sharing the values of groups I can confidently say do not represent our faith, our many cultures, or much less our hopes and aspirations. In response to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's attempt to link all resistance groups' aims to those of ISIS, Al Falistinya TV in Palestine aired a film clip that better reflects the way ISIS is viewed by most Muslims in the region. It is pertinent to remind ourselves that despite the abject horror of Western journalists being murdered, ISIS, like all extremist jihadist groups, has focused its killing on Muslims first and foremost. The NCTC Report on Terrorism (2012) found that ""In cases where the religious affiliation of terrorism casualties could be determined, Muslims suffered between 82 and 97% of terrorism-related fatalities over the past five years."" So, do you really think we don't care about extremism? That it's divorced from our reality, or unimportant to our community? There is an experience that wannabe members of chilling al Qaeda offshoots and people like me share: the inevitable hurried, ill-thought out policy-on-the-run that politicians in the U.S., UK and France will now make off the back of the regular appearance of murder videos. Every day, Muslims in market places from Kabul to Mosul are more likely to be blown up by ""jihadists."" And in the West, it is everyday Muslims like me who hold our breaths waiting for the next raft of CIA and British intelligence ""measures,"" which will target citizens based solely on the basis of our religion or ethnicity. In the U.S., databases showing where Muslims live, where we shop, what Internet cafes we use and even where we like to watch sport are now accepted practices. Informants -- aptly nicknamed ""mosque crawlers"" by the CIA -- are sent to our Friday services, pretending to share our faith, then reporting back to the secret service. Unsurprisingly as a result, government bodies are viewed as a hostile entity by Muslim voters who are not radicalized -- simply frustrated. A 2012 survey by the Arab American Institute found that 55% of Arab American Muslims experienced discrimination, while 71% were afraid of expected future increases in discrimination. Meanwhile in Britain, as Prime Minister David Cameron grandstands using phrases that inflame tensions on the streets here, mosques have been burned and vandalized. Muslims are the target of countless and increasing hate crimes across cities in the UK and Europe. Those headlines -- the ones that may reassure you -- about ""deradicalization"" and ""crackdowns,"" mean that your quiet, non-drinking Muslim neighbors and I must now prepare for more phone spying, more friends receiving alarming visits from secret agents and more hassle at the airport. For those young men whose inner confusion, drug addiction, mental health problems or yes, even extremist grooming, makes them want to join some murderous group, one of the biggest recruiting lines is ""the West vilifies you and your community."" So why do politicians think more mass surveillance and persecution is the answer? One ingredient for a long-term solution to the brainwashing of a small number of young people is one that is missing from this week's political rhetoric -- yet again. This is the ideal of ""fairness,"" at home and abroad, for Muslims. This may be shocking to read at a time when ""Muslims"" are shown wearing bonnets and carrying long knives for slaughter videos. Yet the answer is staring us all in the face and has been since 9/11 first made Muslims in the West afraid to turn on the TV. Millions felt the same horror watching footage of Bagram and Guantanamo Bay. Are we all humans with rights or are we not? The U.S. and its allies are preparing to re-enter Iraq again by air and perhaps eventually by land. Now is the time to propose a coherent strategy abroad that does not, and will never again, name the mass slaughter of Muslim civilians as ""collateral damage"" in a war they want no part in. A strategy should be proposed at home that includes honest, free debate between the Muslim community and the government on issues such as foreign policy and anti-terror measures, without prompting fear for our own freedom and security. Now that really would be radical. In a good way. MAPS: Where do jihadis come from?","It's depressing to witness the branding of all Muslims as the ""same,"" writes Lauren Booth .

"At 6'3"", he's tall enough to slam dunk, and supporters say that's exactly what Adam Silver did when he announced a $2.5 million fine and banned Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling for life from the NBA. Silver, 52, is just three months into his tenure as NBA commissioner, and the scandal over Sterling's racist comments is the first major test he's faced as the league's leader. In an interview with CNN's partner website Bleacher Report earlier this year, Silver described himself as a subdued basketball fan who was more likely to quietly observe than shout at the court. But he was anything but subdued on Tuesday, leaving no room for interpretation as he announced Sterling's punishment and firmly declared that the Clippers owner's views ""have no place in the NBA."" From inside and outside the league, praise for Silver's swift, decisive move came as fast as the condemnation of Sterling's comments. ""Kudos to Adam Silver,"" Grantland editor-in-chief and sports commentator Bill Simmons said in a Twitter post. ""That was such an important moment for the NBA (and for him, too) and he handled it spectacularly."" Silver is known within the league as a consensus builder, and he commanded respect in various roles with the organization over the past 22 years, according to Bleacher Report. One key part of his philosophy: Basketball is a team game. Growing up a diehard New York Knicks fan, he remembers watching players like Earl Monroe, Bill Bradley and Clyde Frazier play at Madison Square Garden. ""You thought about them as a team,"" Silver told Bleacher Report. ""There was no sense that any individual was greater than the team back then."" Learning from great coaches and general managers over the years has reinforced that idea, he said. ""I believe I've developed a true appreciation of the team concept and one that, sort of as the new commissioner-slash-CEO of this organization, I'm really hoping to put into practice,"" he told Bleacher Report. Silver's also known for favoring transparency. ""As deputy commissioner, he was a driving force behind the decision to publicly announce blown referee calls,"" Bleacher Report's Howard Beck wrote. ""The NBA's move to post videos explaining the league's most misunderstood rules also stemmed from Silver's advocacy."" Silver grew up outside New York City and graduated from Duke University and the University of Chicago Law School. He told The New York Times earlier this year that he never imagined a career in professional basketball. ""I loved basketball, but I never dreamed about playing in the NBA or certainly working for the NBA,"" he told the newspaper. Silver worked as a law clerk and a corporate lawyer before his career took the unexpected turn. He joined the NBA in 1992 as a special assistant to then-Commissioner David Stern. From there, he served as the NBA's chief of staff, senior vice president and chief operating officer of NBA Entertainment and president and chief operating officer of NBA Entertainment. He became the league's second-in-command in July 2006. Silver may have a background as a lawyer and a businessman, but underneath it all, friends say, he's a basketball fan. ""He loves the game,"" Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, who has worked extensively with Silver, told Bleacher Report. ""People can know the game, like the game, but then there are those who love the game. ... He's very proud of the game and his part in the game. He knows he's part of something bigger than him."" Silver has consulted with coaches about changes and made them feel included, Dallas Mavericks Coach Rick Carlisle told Bleacher Report. ""It breeds a real trust with him coming into this as the main guy now,"" said Carlisle, president of the National Basketball Coaches Association. The youngest of five siblings, Silver never played basketball competitively but says he sometimes shot hoops on a basket mounted on the side of his house growing up. ""David Stern always says that 'Adam's a facilitator, because he's the youngest child,'"" Silver told Bleacher Report. ""I think I've always been the defender of whoever it is being yelled at, at that moment.""

"Tuscaloosa, Alabama (CNN) -- Along with the city's power and phone service, the hospital's pager network went down when the tornado hit. But like nearly every doctor in Tuscaloosa, orthopedic surgeon Brian Claytor didn't need his beeper to tell him to head to the trauma center. Claytor said he didn't know what to expect when he arrived at DCH Regional Medical Center on Wednesday. ""The emergency room was just overflowing,"" said Claytor, 38. ""I was just in shock when I walked in to see the sheer volume of injured people and the severity of the injuries."" Patients filled the hallway and every available room. Injuries ranged from minor cuts, lacerations and broken ankles to severe trauma from debris that sliced patients' heads, chests and abdomens. The wounded screamed for help. Others scrambled through the chaotic scene, searching for loved ones. Pickups screeched into the emergency room driveway with injured loved ones helpless and bleeding in the truck beds. Early on, the hospital relied on backup generator power. The fierce tornado clipped the back of the hospital. Water and air conditioning were lost through most of the night. The trauma center turned into a triage unit, much like a war zone hospital. With systems down, doctors, nurses, X-ray technicians and other staff members went into overdrive. ""In the midst of that, we're trying to identify the worst of those injuries and try to get them dealt with as best we could,"" Claytor said. ""It's just impossible to adequately prepare yourself for that situation. But fortunately, after that initial shock wore off, people got down to work."" Over the next six hours, more than 650 patients were treated at the facility. ""That's a staggering number,"" he said. Another 150 patients were treated at a sister hospital across town. At DCH, about eight orthopedic surgeons, another 50 to 75 doctors and surgeons, and dozens more staffers descended on the hospital. Many came to work on that devastatingly historic night despite losing their own homes and cars, or even hearing that cousins and other relatives were missing, he said. ""Everybody showed up and got to work. It was amazing to see. ""Unfortunately, a number of the patients who did get here weren't able to be saved, and that's tough to deal with,"" Claytor said. ""One of the hardest things to deal with was seeing some of the parents carrying in children, babies, infants who had terrible injuries -- some of them clearly unlikely to survive. ""Just watching that unfold in front of you is something no one wants to see."" He said he's amazed by the dedication of staff, not only here but from doctors across the region who offered their services. Claytor, still dressed in scrubs Saturday and having worked nearly every hour since the storm, held back tears. ""It's just an amazing, emotional roller coaster for these people,"" he said. ""Once we were able to take a break from it and think about it, it was heartbreaking.""","Over six hours, more than 650 people treated at Tuscaloosa trauma center .

"The state of New Jersey is taking over administration of the troubled public schools in the city of Camden, Gov. Chris Christie announced Monday. A recent Department of Education investigation found Camden city schools are among the lowest-performing in the state, Christie said at a news conference at Woodrow Wilson High School in the city. ""We're taking the lead because for too long, the public school system in Camden has failed its children,"" he said. ""Each day that it gets worse, we're failing the children of Camden, we're denying them a future, we're not allowing them to reach their full potential."" The poor student performance, a lack of a districtwide curricula, inconsistent and haphazard school staffing, lack of central leadership, and a failure to provide student support services has resulted in ""full state intervention,"" the governor's office said in a news release. Christie said the decision to partner with Camden school officials was not one made easily or quickly. ""I waited three years because I really felt like I wanted to give the folks in the city of Camden the chance without having to enter into a partnership with the state,"" Christie said. The issues with student achievement and institutional administration do not stem from a lack of financial support. Camden is receiving more than $279.5 million in state funding, an increase of $3.6 million from last year. During the 2011-12 school year, Camden spent $23,709 per student, compared with the statewide average of $18,045, the governor's office said. Statistics published by the New Jersey Board of Education show that school graduation rates in Camden are among the lowest in the state.  In 2012, the city's graduation rate fell to 49.27%, down from 56.89% the year before. This is well below the state average graduation rate of 86.46% in 2012. From 2011 to 2012, only 2% of Camden students scored above a 1550 out of a possible 2400 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), compared with 43% students nationally. Only 19% and 30.4% of third- through eighth-grade students tested proficient in language arts and in math, respectively, both numbers well below the state average, the document say. Christie said the state intervention will include close monitoring of school progress as well as guidance in financial decisions. ""We will exert whatever control we need to exert to try and bring success,"" he said. The mayor of Camden, Dana Redd, also spoke at the news conference, affirming her readiness to work with officials on both the state and local levels. ""I welcome this new era in full cooperation and partnership because I want to see our children excel in the classroom,"" Redd said. The president of the school board, Kathryn Blackshear, said she is in the toughest spot she has ever been in. ""I always knew this day was coming,"" she said. ""After I looked at the research and the numbers, and praying over it, I said, 'well, Lord, change is here.'"" Camden is not the first city in New Jersey whose school district has been taken over by the state. Schools in Jersey City, Paterson, and Newark also currently operate under state control, according to Barbara Morgan, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Education. It's unclear how the nearly 14,000 students enrolled in Camden city public schools will feel the impact of new state intervention. ""I can't be a guarantor of results, none of us can,"" Christie said. ""But just because we can't guarantee a positive result or because there have been some mixed results in the past, should not be used as an excuse for inaction.""","Gov. Chris Christie: ""We're taking the lead because ... Camden has failed its children""

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's central bank is introducing a $500 million note -- the highest current denomination -- as the once-prosperous southern African nation battles against spiraling hyperinflation. Zimbabwe's new $500 million note . Finance Minister Samuel Mumbengegwi made the announcement about the new note in a government gazette set for release Friday. On the back, the purple cotton bill will feature pictures of dairy cows being milked mechanically and a miner drilling underground, he said. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) last week introduced a new set of denominations, including a $100 million note, but that has not helped to clear long lines for cash at banks. Some people sleep outside banks after failing to get cash. The RBZ said a $200 million note would be in circulation Friday, together with the $500 million note. The $500 million note is worth about 8 U.S. dollars and enough to buy just eight loaves of bread. Thursday, the greenback was trading around ZW$60 million and is expected to shoot up in light of the new note's introduction. Prices change on an almost daily basis as businesses now peg their prices against the U.S. dollar. Zimbabwe has had higher denominations than the $500 million note in the past. But over the past two years, the country has slashed zeros from the amount of its worthless currency -- the latest being 10 zeros in August. Once one of Africa's most promising economies, Zimbabwe is reeling under its worst humanitarian and economic crisis. A cholera outbreak has killed nearly 800 Zimbabweans, forcing hundreds to cross the border into South Africa and Botswana to seek treatment. The situation has been exacerbated by the closure of government hospitals for more than a month as health personnel demand the government review their salaries and equip the hospitals with medicines and modern machinery. In addition, 5 million people are in need of food aid, the United Nations says, in a nation that once exported food to its neighbors. There has been a spate of protests -- including two by soldiers -- over the past four weeks as people voice their displeasure over President Robert Mugabe's policies. Shortages of most essentials such as electricity, fuel, medical drugs and food have become a common feature in Zimbabwe. That has forced many people to flee the country.","Zimbabwe's central bank introduces $500 million note .

"(CNN) -- At least six people were dead and one critically injured Sunday after a midair crash between two medical helicopters near a hospital in Arizona, authorities said. Rescue workers sift through wreckage from two medical helicopters that collided midair Sunday afternoon. The collision, at Flagstaff Medical Center in Flagstaff, Arizona, set fire to a 10-acre area, according to fire officials, and another two rescue workers were injured by a secondary explosion after the crash. The helicopters collided at roughly 3:45 p.m. local time, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. ""As you can imagine, we've got lots of heaps of metal to go through,"" said Capt. Mark Johnson of the Flagstaff Fire Department. ""It's just difficult right now."" He said a landing pad on the roof of the hospital is used by medical helicopters. Federal Aviation Authority officials originally had reported at least seven deaths and three critical injuries, but they revised those numbers after investigators spent more time on the scene. Flagstaff Police Department Sgt. Tom Boughner said the two rescue workers were not immediately believed to be seriously injured. He said the helicopters crashed into a wooded area near a neighborhood and that no one on the ground was believed to have been injured or killed in the crash. He said the fire had been contained by Sunday evening. FAA spokesman Ian Gregor said at least one of those killed in the collision was a patient. He said three of those killed, including the patient, were aboard a Bell 407 helicopter operated by Air Methods Corporation, an air medical service provider. The other helicopter, operated by Classic Helicopter Service of Utah, also was a Bell 407. The other four victims, including the one critically injured, were on that helicopter. Both helicopters were headed to the hospital at the time of the crash, Gregor said. FAA safety inspectors from Phoenix, Arizona, were en route to the scene Sunday, and additional inspectors from Washington were expected to arrive Monday morning. The National Transportation Safety Board will lead a probe into the crash, Gregor said.","NEW: Six killed includes one patient; one critically injured .

"(CNN)  -- A former NASA astronaut accused of assaulting a romantic rival at a Florida airport can take off her electronic tracking bracelet while she awaits trial, a judge ruled Thursday. Attorneys for former astronaut Lisa Nowak said her ankle bracelet was uncomfortable and inconvenient. The bracelet was uncomfortable, inconvenient and cost Lisa Nowak $105 a week, her attorneys argued. Those reasons alone weren't enough to order the monitor removed, Orange County Circuit Court Judge Marc Lubet said in his ruling. He said the monitoring device was not fulfilling its purpose. Although the alleged victim, Air Force Capt. Colleen Shipman, testified earlier this month that she remains afraid of Nowak and wants the monitor to remain, Shipman ""chose to travel to the defendant's hometown of Houston, Texas, on three or four occasions ... to visit her boyfriend"" since the incident, Lubet wrote. ""During these trips ... the electronic monitoring GPS device afforded no protection or benefit to Ms. Shipman, as the defendant could freely move about Houston,"" Lubet wrote. ""Under these circumstances, it is clear to this court that the electronic monitoring GPS device does not fulfill its intended purpose of protecting Ms. Shipman."" Lubet also cited Nowak's lack of a prior criminal record. Nowak is ""relieved"" to have the device removed, according to a statement issued by defense attorney Don Lykkebak. ""It's a great relief not to worry about safety issues related to the batteries' life while I'm driving,"" Nowak said in the statement. ""I'm also really looking forward to getting back into my former aerobic fitness programs."" Lykkebak's spokeswoman, Marti Mackenzie, said in the statement that Nowak had developed an indentation and abrasions from the device and will now have a chance to heal. Nowak, 44, pleaded not guilty March 22 to charges of attempted kidnapping with intent to inflict bodily harm, battery and burglary of a vehicle using a weapon. Her trial is to begin next month. If convicted she could face a sentence of up to life in prison. Prosecutors say Nowak drove nearly 900 miles from Houston to Orlando, Florida -- wearing diapers to cut down on the number of stops she needed to make -- and went to Orlando International Airport on February 5. She put on a disguise and followed Shipman from baggage claim to the parking lot, according to court papers. Shipman told police that after she got into her car, Nowak feigned distress and knocked on the window. When Shipman cracked it to talk to her, Nowak sprayed her face with pepper spray, Shipman said. Police said Nowak was apprehended later as she was disposing of her disguise in an airport trash bin. Nowak has said she merely went to the airport to talk to Shipman, who had begun dating Nowak's former love interest, Navy Cmdr. Bill Oefelein, who was also an astronaut. Oefelein has since left the astronaut corps. Nowak's attorneys earlier this month filed a notice of intent to rely on an insanity defense, saying in court documents her diagnoses include a litany of more than a dozen psychiatric disorders. In his ruling, Lubet noted that Nowak, a Navy captain, would face additional penalties from the military if she were to violate the conditions of her pretrial release. Nowak has no reason to travel to Florida, where Shipman lives, other than to appear in court, consult with her attorneys or fulfill her military duties, he said, and no reason to travel to Virginia -- where Shipman's boyfriend now lives. He ordered her to have no contact with Shipman or Oefelein and not to travel to Virginia, Washington, Maryland, Delaware or Brevard County, Florida, without court approval. Lykkebak said in his statement that Nowak has no problem adhering to the travel restrictions. E-mail to a friend .","Former astronaut Lisa Nowak can remove ankle monitoring device, judge says .

"Kevin Vickers led the procession solemnly, silently. Yet there was noise all around him -- and all for him. One day earlier, Vickers -- the sergeant-at-arms of Canada's House of Commons -- was credited with gunning down an armed man who'd stormed in minutes after killing a Canadian soldier standing guard at a nearby veterans memorial. Parliamentarians responded Thursday by saluting Vickers with a spirited standing ovation as he walked, in front of the line, as part of his ceremonial duties to usher the start of a new session. Their fervent applause was interrupted only by occasional cheers and pounding of benches. Yet Vickers, carrying a ceremonial sword and dressed in traditional attire, nodded gently to acknowledge the ovation but didn't address the crowd. The only time he spoke, and the only hint of a smile, came when Prime Minister Stephen Harper walked back to the sergeant-at-arms seat in the back of the hall -- at which point the two shook hands and Vickers whispered a few words in Harper's ear. The sergeant-at-arms did offer remarks -- his first since the shootings -- later in a written statement. He said he was  ""very touched"" by the attention over his role in ending the attack, while adding that he has ""the support of a remarkable security team that is committed to ensuring the safety of Members, employees and visitors"" to Parliament. ""Yesterday, during extraordinary circumstances, security personnel demonstrated professionalism and courage. I am grateful and proud to be part of this team,"" he said. Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Bob Paulson said Thursday that Michael Zehaf-Bibeau traded gunshots with an officer before heading down a hall towards Parliament, where Vickers and others engaged him. ""I understood that the suspect and Mr. Vickers were behind pillars and exchanging fire,"" Paulson said. ""The suspect repositioned himself to get a better shot at Mr. Vickers ... We heard (a) multitude of shots, and that Mr. Vickers did shoot."" How do you characterize what the 58-year-old Vickers did that day? Members of Parliament, the media and the public resoundingly settled on one word: hero. As parliamentarian Craig Scott tweeted, ""MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers."" Had a ceremonial and law enforcement role . Vickers isn't a stranger to the spotlight, although he's typically on the edge of it. When world leaders come through Ottawa, he is often right beside them at the House of Commons. Photo after photo from the past few years show him, a handful of Canadian politicians and the international figures -- from Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott to German Chancellor Angela Merkel to South Korean President Park Geun-Hye -- on hand. This is all part of the ceremonial duties of sergeant-at-arms, a position that's been occupied by only 10 people since its inception in 1867. Vickers, for instance, is sometimes charged with carrying a special sword in the commission of his duties. Yet, for all the pomp and circumstance, Vickers is above all a man of the law. That speaks to his bigger role at the House of Commons as its top law enforcement officer, charged with overseeing security on the grounds and safeguarding various officials. To put what he did Wednesday in perspective, consider this: He was like a police chief or sheriff who takes out his weapon and ends a violent attack. On the one hand, Vickers isn't new to law enforcement, having spent 28 years with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Yet despite all that time, his brother believes that Wednesday was the first time Vickers ever exchanged gunfire with anyone. ""For it now to happen at Parliament ... is unbelievable,"" John Vickers told CNN. ""We're just relieved he's OK."" Who was the gunman? Reporter who knows Vickers calls him 'an utmost professional' John Vickers describes his brother as ""an exemplary individual who, throughout ... his career, put his country and his community first."" That includes all his years with Canada's national police force, including a high-profile stint in the province of New Brunswick during a tense time there. ""He was always cool under pressure; he was always respectful and accommodating,"" Andree Lau, a former CBC journalist who is now The Huffington Post's British Columbia news editor, told CNN. Lau remembers Vickers, from the time she met him in the 2000s, as ""a stand-up guy (who is) well-trained."" Asked about his exploits Wednesday, Lau said, ""It's not surprising at all. Because (Vickers) is an utmost professional."" Vickers left the RCMP to become the House of Commons' security director, the CBC reported. He became sergeant-at-arms in 2006, where he has impressed many with his demeanor as much as his professionalism. Tweeted Glenn Thibeault, a parliamentarian from Sudbury: ""Sgt at arms Kevin Vickers-nicest guy you'll ever meet. I am lucky to call him a friend. ""Today he is also our hero and we are 4evr grateful.""","Police official: Vickers exchanged gunshots from behind a pillar .

"(CNN)Congo looks set for the quarterfinals after securing its first victory at the finals of the Africa Cup of Nations for 41 years with an upset 1-0 win over favored Gabon Wednesday. Gabon, who topped Group A after an opening victory over Burkina Faso, fell victim to a Prince Oniangue goal early in the second half and wayward finishing. The vital win in Congo's first appearance at AFCON since 2000 leaves Claude Le Roy's team needing just a draw from its final group game against Burkina Faso to reach the quarterfinals. Oniangue, who plays for Reims in the French top-flight, grabbed his goal after Gabon failed to clear a 48th minute corner. Gabon should have leveled midway through the half when Frederic Bulot sent a shot wide with the goal at his mercy. Bulot's first time volley early in the match had nearly put Gabon into an early lead but it was turned over the crossbar by Christoffer Mafoumbi in the Congo goal. Mafoumbi also made a fine save from Gabon's star player Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang after a free kick, but after the break Congo came more into the game and deserved its victory to move onto four points after two games. Earlier, 2013 runner-up Burkina Faso and host Equatorial Guinea played to a goalless draw, leaving both sides looking for victories in the final round of group matches to advance further in the 16-team competition. Burkina Faso is left with just one point from two games and seemingly out of luck after Alain Traore twice saw first half efforts strike the woodwork. The home side offered little in attack until after the break when Javier Balboa embarked on a brilliant solo run and set up Ellong Viera to shoot wastefully over the crossbar. Home coach Esteban Becker was delighted with his side's display and a second point earned in the finals. ""I'm not just satisfied, I'm very satisfied. I'm very proud of this young team, which is 100 percent Equatoguinean and everyone wants to defend the country's colors,"" the Argentine told AFP. ""Burkina Faso are very strong opponents. They have eight players who play in the French league and we are like ants compared to them,"" he added. Burkina Faso coach Paul Put rued the missed chances.""Our problem is finishing, I can't understand. We created lots of chances. Equatorial Guinea did not have as many,"" he said.","Congo beats Gabon 1-0 in Group A match .

Beginning in January 2011, Dykstra and two co-defendants tried to lease various high-end automobiles from several area dealerships by providing fraudulent information and claiming credit through a phony business, prosecutors said. A criminal complaint contended that Dykstra and Robert Hymers, 27, his accountant, provided information from a man they claimed was a co-signer, but who had not authorized his name to be used. Leases were not approved at two dealerships, but the pair and Christopher Gavanis, 30, a friend of Dykstra's, drove off with three cars at one company by providing fraudulent information to a dealer, said Deputy District Attorney Alex Karkanen. Those cars have since been returned, he said. When Dykstra was arrested in April, Los Angeles police detectives allegedly found cocaine and ecstasy along with somatropin, a synthetic human growth hormone, when they searched his Encino home. In exchange for his plea, prosecutors agreed to drop 21 charges against him, including attempted grand theft auto, identity theft, possession of a controlled substance and unauthorized possession of a syringe. In a separate case, Dykstra was indicted in May on federal charges, including obstruction of justice for allegedly taking more than $400,000 in property that should have gone to his bankruptcy creditors and then lying about it under oath, prosecutors claim. Dykstra, 49, is a three-time Major League Baseball All-Star who led the New York Mets to a World Series championship. His stellar professional baseball career began in 1981, when the New York Mets drafted him out of high school. During his second year in the majors, the player nicknamed ""Nails"" for his tenacity hit a lead-off home run in Game 3 of the 1986 World Series at Boston's Fenway Park after the Mets lost the first two games. That spark rallied the Mets to a seven-game series victory over the Boston Red Sox.","Lenny Dykstra faces federal charges in a separate case .

"(CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama's reference to ""lipstick on a pig"" has Republicans demanding an apology and Democrats accusing Sen. John McCain of a ""pathetic attempt"" to play the gender card. Barack Obama used the ""lipstick"" line at a campaign event in Lebanon, Virginia, on Tuesday. McCain's campaign said Obama's remarks were offensive and a slap at Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin -- despite the fact that the Arizona senator himself used the phrase last year to describe a policy proposal of Hillary Clinton's. Obama shot back Wednesday and accused the McCain campaign of engaging in ""lies"" and ""swift boat politics."" ""I don't care what they say about me. But I love this country too much to let them take over another election with lies and phony outrage and swift boat politics,"" he said in Norfolk, Virginia. ""Enough is enough.""  Watch Obama deliver his harsh words » . The phrase ""swift boat"" comes from the 2004 presidential election, when the group ""Swift Boat Veterans for Truth"" launched an attack ad campaign against Democratic candidate John Kerry. Read more about what Obama said . Obama made his controversial ""lipstick"" remarks at a Virginia campaign stop late Tuesday afternoon.   Watch what happens with politics and lipstick collide » . ""John McCain says he's about change too, and so I guess his whole angle is, 'Watch out George Bush -- except for economic policy, health care policy, tax policy, education policy, foreign policy and Karl Rove-style politics -- we're really going to shake things up in Washington,'"" he said. ""That's not change. That's just calling something the same thing something different. You know you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. You know you can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change, it's still going to stink after eight years. We've had enough of the same old thing.""  Watch how tensions are rising on the trail » . The crowd erupted in applause when Obama delivered the line. The Illinois senator then praised both McCain's ""compelling story"" and Palin's ""interesting story,"" and said his ""hat goes off"" to anyone who's looking after five kids -- ""I've got two and they tire Michelle and me out. ... ""That's why John McCain's campaign manager [Rick Davis] said this campaign isn't going to be about issues, this campaign is going to be about personalities."" Within minutes, the McCain campaign announced a conference call focused on the remark, which they said was a deliberate reference to Palin's line: ""You know the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? Lipstick."" Palin used the line in the opening remarks of her convention speech, and she frequently uses it on the campaign trail. In Iowa last October, McCain drew comparisons between Hillary Clinton's current health care plan and the one she championed in 1993: ""I think they put some lipstick on the pig, but it's still a pig."" He used roughly the same line in May, after effectively claiming the Republican nomination. McCain spokesman Brian Rogers told CNN the campaign saw a ""big difference"" between the two references: ""McCain was referring to a policy proposal. Obama was referring to [Alaska] Gov. Sarah Palin. It's obviously disrespectful and offensive. ... ""Who has been talking about lipstick lately? It was obvious. The crowd went crazy because of it."" It wasn't the first time Obama used the line. In a phone interview with The Washington Post last September, he used it in reference to the situation in Iraq. ""I think that both Gen. [David] Petraeus and Ambassador [Ryan] Crocker are capable people who have been given an impossible assignment,"" Obama told the Post. ""George Bush has given a mission to Gen. Petraeus, and he has done his best to try to figure out how to put lipstick on a pig."" Other politicians have also used the phrase in recent years, including Vice President Dick Cheney, Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington state, Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Rep. John Mica of Florida and Rep. Tom Tancredo of Colorado, among others. Torie Clarke, a former McCain adviser, even wrote a book called, ""Lipstick on a Pig: Winning In the No-Spin Era by Someone Who Knows the Game."" Still, the McCain campaign says Obama's use was intentional, and they want an apology. ""Barack Obama's comments today are offensive and disgraceful. He owes Gov. Palin an apology,"" said Maria Comella, a McCain-Palin spokeswoman. Obama's campaign said ""enough is enough"" and accused McCain of running a ""dishonorable campaign."" ""The McCain campaign's attack tonight is a pathetic attempt to play the gender card about the use of a common analogy -- the same analogy that Sen. McCain himself used about Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's health care plan just last year,"" said Obama campaign senior adviser Anita Dunn. ""This phony lecture on gender sensitivity is the height of cynicism and lays bare the increasingly dishonorable campaign John McCain has chosen to run."" McCain ally Mike Huckabee took Obama's side on the issue, saying he didn't think it was a swipe at Palin. ""It's an old expression, and I'm going to have to cut Obama some slack on that one. I do not think he was referring to Sarah Palin; he didn't reference her. If you take the two sound bites together, it may sound like it,"" he said on Fox's ""Hannity and Colmes."" ""But I've been a guy at the podium many times, and you say something that's maybe a part of an old joke and then somebody ties it in. So, I'm going to have to cut him slack."" But McCain's campaign is not about to let the issue go. They released a Web ad Wednesday that plays Obama's lipstick comments, then asks, ""Ready to lead? No. Ready to smear? Yes."" CNN's Rebecca Sinderbrand, Sasha Johnson and Chris Welch contributed to this report.","NEW: Barack Obama slams Republicans for ""lies"" and ""swift boat politics""

"Steps taken to thwart a public marijuana smoking event Friday at the University of Colorado appear to have worked. Protesters who gathered at a quad on the campus for the customary 4:20 light-up time dispersed without an apparent toke. In past years the Norlin Quad on the campus of the University of Colorado at Boulder had drawn 10,000 to 12,000 people for the event, which falls on April 20 (4/20). Marijuana smokers traditionally wait until 4:20 in the afternoon to light up as a celebration of marijuana culture and a protest against drug policy. This year, the school closed the campus to outsiders and spread an unpleasant-smelling, fish-based fertilizer on the quad before enclosing it in yellow police tape and stationing police officers around the perimeter. Hours before the planned event, three students who crossed police lines and went onto the field were led away in plastic handcuffs. Several hundred students gathered around the quad as the time approached. A man began shouting into the crowd, becoming its de facto leader. When asked his name he replied, ""It doesn't matter."" ""Alright, it's 4:20 who is ready to get weird?"" he shouted. The crowd cheered. ""Who is with me?"" he called out. Another cheer. The crowd seemed to expect him light up a joint, but instead he dashed under the police tape and ran across the quad as police gave chase on foot. None of his encouragers followed. Police ultimately nabbed him and carted him off in plastic handcuffs. Their leader gone, no one in the crowd seemed to know quite what to do. No one could be seen smoking marijuana and by the less legendary time of 4:30 the crowd had gone on their way. The number 420 has become synonymous with all things marijuana, but exactly why is less clear. Whatever the number's origin, ""420"" events across the country have become opportunities to advocate the legalization of marijuana. The expansion of medical marijuana in California, Colorado and other states is making efforts to legalize marijuana more mainstream and making more people comfortable coming out and smoking pot in public, according to Chris Conrad, curator of the Oaksterdam Cannabis Museum in Oakland, California. Boulder's is one of the biggest pro-pot rallies, and attendance had grown from year to year, according to university spokesman Bronson Hilliard. ""People fly in from around the country to participate,"" Hilliard explained.  ""We don't understand why they have to come to (this) campus."" Celebs and the pot culture . Prior to the Colorado event, university police spokesman Ryan Huff said the smoke-ins have become too dangerous. ""It's hard to keep track of that many people high on marijuana,"" he said. Why these marijuana advocates congregate each year on April 20 is a bit of a mystery steeped in the hazy lore of the American pot culture. Some have said 420 is a local police code for someone smoking marijuana. Others have said it refers to the number of active chemicals in marijuana. Another theory holds that 420 is a nod to Bob Dylan and his 1966 song ""Rainy Day Women #12 & 35"" which contains the lyric, ""Everybody must get stoned."" Multiply 12 by 35 and you get 420. Conrad said the leading theory traces the beginning of 420 to the early 1970s when a group of students at San Rafael High School in California would meet at 4:20 each afternoon to smoke marijuana. ""It (was) the time between when classes were over and their parents came home,"" he said. ""The number 420 signifies that somebody is smoking marijuana right now and it becomes a clarion call for others to join."" Eatocracy: When celeb chefs get the munchies . According to Conrad, the story goes that the San Rafael teens named themselves ""the Waldos"" and would meet very day at 4:20 p.m. near a statue of Louis Pasteur to smoke joints. A website that claims to be associated with the Waldos declares them to be ""The Founding Fathers of 420,"" although it doesn't appear to be current.  Attempts to reach the owners of the site were unsuccessful. No matter what the origin, the number now signifies the pro-marijuana culture: Craiglist ads for roommates, or for even so-called ""casual encounters,"" often note ""420 Friendly."" An episode of the animated TV show Family Guy called ""420"" involves a plot in which marijuana becomes legalized and 420 Magazine is devoted to marijuana culture. The 2003 California State Senate bill that became the law that established medical marijuana in the state was called SB420. What began is a secret code word between stoners has gone mainstream. ""It's a form of shorthand essentially. As far as being a secret code, it's one of the least secret,"" explained Conrad with a laugh.","Arrests, foul fertilizer dampen ""420"" enthusiasm .
Crowds turned out, but no one lit up; few crossed police tape .
One man pumps up crowd, enters quad alone, is taken away .
Boulder's is one of the biggest pro-pot rallies on cryptic date ."

"As a polio survivor, World Polio Day is more than a date on the calendar -- it's a reminder that we can and must end this crippling disease. I grew up in the Kano state of Nigeria and contracted polio at age 3. This disease often causes paralysis and left me mostly paralyzed and unable to walk. My brothers had to help me move when we traveled long distances; even traveling to and from school was difficult. Living with polio was not easy when I was younger, but I have found ways to cope and lead an active life. And that has given me a lot of strength. For example, I was very interested in soccer when I was young, and I later went on to found para-soccer, a nationally-recognized soccer-style game for people with disabilities in Nigeria. Why polio hasn't gone away yet . While polio has not stopped me, I am determined to stop polio. Children today shouldn't have to go through what I've been through -- especially when a few drops of the polio vaccine can protect them from the disease. I have committed myself to raising awareness and educating people not just about polio, but about the importance of vaccinations. In fact, to mark World Polio Day in Nigeria, more than 300 polio survivors are actively participating in sporting activities across the country. On an ongoing basis, more than 1,000 survivors are actively campaigning for polio eradication in communities. Empowering people affected by polio will strengthen our campaign against the disease and help spread the message that vaccinating our children is the only way to prevent them from similar fates. At the U.N., money backs up vow to eradicate polio by 2015 . Nigeria is the only polio endemic country in Africa and one of only three remaining countries (the others are Afghanistan and Pakistan) that have not been able to stop the transmission of the disease, according to the World Health Organization. If we fail to end polio in these countries, all other countries are at risk. This contagious disease can be imported, paralyzing children in countries that thought they were done with polio. A recent outbreak in the Horn of Africa is a reminder that we must finish the job. In my country, we must make sure more children are vaccinated and overall immunity is higher, especially in the northern states. Every child that does not get polio drops breaks the circle of protection and exposes him or her and others to contracting the virus. Challenges still exist in Nigeria, especially in reaching children in some communities where security is an issue, like Kano, Borno and Yobe. We are helping to fix this by ensuring local ownership by the government and communities themselves. The good news is that we have made progress against polio in Nigeria and around the world. In Nigeria, the government, partners, and survivors are working hard, and polio cases are down right now compared to this time last year. Globally, polio cases have been reduced by more than 99 percent in the past 25 years. Opinion: Don't fall at the finish line in the race to eradicate polio . Thanks to a worldwide effort of governments and the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, including the United Nations, the number of polio cases has dropped from 350,000 a year in 1988 to just 223 last year, and the number of countries where polio is transmitted has dropped from 125 to 3, according to the eradication initiative. I look forward to the day Nigeria overcomes the devastation of polio and joins the list of polio-free countries. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative has developed a plan to end polio for good; now is the time for all of us to support this effort, educate our communities, and make sure our children are vaccinated. On World Polio Day, my wish is that one day we end polio in Nigeria and in the world. I made my dream of playing soccer come true, and I believe we can make this one come true, too.","Misbahu Lawan Didi grew up in Kano state and contracted polio at age 3 .

"Tracy Morgan remained in critical condition Sunday but appeared to show signs of improvement after a car wreck a day earlier that killed another passenger, the comedian's publicist said. ""He has been more responsive today, which is an incredibly encouraging sign,"" Lewis Kay said. Morgan's limo van was hit by a tractor-trailer on the New Jersey Turnpike at about 1 a.m. Saturday, according to Sgt. Gregory Williams of New Jersey State Police. Morgan suffered several injuries, including broken ribs, a broken nose, a broken leg and a broken femur. He underwent surgery on his leg on Sunday, Kay said, noting any road to recovery would be a long one. ""We expect him to remain in the hospital for several weeks,"" he said. The chain-reaction wreck killed Morgan's fellow passenger, comedian James McNair, who performed under the name Jimmy Mack, and injured several others, according to officials. The truck driver charged in the crash has turned himself in, police said Sunday. Kevin Roper, 35, posted a $50,000 bail Saturday night, according to James O'Neill, spokesman for the Middlesex, New Jersey, district attorney's office. Comedians Ardie Fuqua and Harris Stanton were among the injured, as was Jeffrey Millea, Williams said. One person was released Saturday, but Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Jersey wouldn't disclose that person's name. Two others remained in critical condition Sunday, hospital spokeswoman Zenaida Mendez said. CNN reached Fuqua's agent on Sunday, but he had no comment. Walmart employee charged . Roper is charged with one count of death by auto and four counts of assault by auto after the tractor-trailer he was driving crashed into the limo bus, a statement from Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office said. Walmart spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said Roper is an employee. ""This is a tragedy, and we are profoundly sorry that one of our trucks was involved,"" Bill Simon, president and CEO of Walmart U.S., said in a statement. ""The facts are continuing to unfold. If it's determined that our truck caused the accident, Walmart will take full responsibility."" Chain-reaction crash . The wreck occurred about 1 a.m. ET Saturday on the turnpike in Mercer County, Williams said. ""The driver of the tractor-trailer failed to observe slow-moving traffic ahead,"" Williams said. ""At the last minute, he swerved to try and avoid the Mercedes limo bus but struck it from behind, forcing the limo to rotate and overturn."" Four other vehicles were involved in the crash, the prosecutor's office said, but no one in those vehicles was injured. Williams said he does not believe alcohol played a role in the crash, but that is under investigation. The National Transportation Safety Board will investigate ""safety issues related to commercial trucking and limousine safety,"" said agency spokesman Keith Holloway. ""All I know is I saw traffic ... and I stopped ... and I was upside down and in the vehicle,"" limo driver Tyrone Gale told WCAU. Gale suffered bruises in the crash, WCAU reported. Christopher Thompson, the co-owner of Atlantic Transportation Services, which was operating the limo bus, said he thought the bus was heading to drop Morgan off in New Jersey. From SNL to '30 Rock' Morgan, 45, was a regular on ""Saturday Night Live"" for seven years. He later received an Emmy nomination for his role in ""30 Rock,"" in which he played Tracy Jordan, an exaggerated version of himself. The New York City native made his reputation with over-the-top characters and impressions of celebrities such as Mike Tyson and Oprah Winfrey. Morgan performed a comedy tour act Friday night at the Dover Downs Hotel & Casino in Dover, Delaware, the venue said. The actor received messages of support and concern on Twitter. ""Wishing a speedy recovery to our friend @RealTracyMorgan,"" tweeted SNL Weekend Update. ""Shocked to wake up and read that @RealTracyMorgan is injured. Love to Tracy and wishing him strength,"" said  former SNL cast member Rachel Dratch. ""My thoughts are with Tracy Morgan and his family.

"An onslaught of fast-falling snow, whipping winds and bitter cold socked parts of the Northeast on Thursday, spurring a slew of travel woes, highway closures and worries that the headaches will only get worse as temperatures fall further. This kind of weather, this time of year, in this region is nothing new: Connecticut's governor, for instance, noted the snow totals won't come close to the 40 inches that buried parts of his state last February. At the same time, by Thursday night, it was already causing a mess -- whether you were waiting at an airport, had skidded off a road or were stuck at home hoping that your lights and perhaps your heat wouldn't suddenly stop working. ""Mother Nature has come to wish us happy new year,"" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. The nor'easter, forming off the East Coast of the United States, prompted blizzard warnings from Thursday into Friday for New York's Long Island, Cape Cod, Massachusetts' South and North Shores, plus communities along Maine's coast. Boston, for example, was already getting buried by snow late Thursday afternoon. About one-third of the nation, approximately 100 million people in 22 states, was in the path of the storm, which was expected to be at its fiercest between 8 p.m. Thursday and 10 a.m. Friday, according to CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen. Track the storm: Radar, temperatures . The complicated storm system ""will raise havoc"" this week, dumping a foot of snow and spreading subzero wind chills across parts of the region, the National Weather Service warned. ""Falling and blowing snow with strong winds and poor visibilities are likely,"" the Weather Service said. ""This will lead to whiteout conditions making travel extremely dangerous. Do not travel."" Across the country, the nasty weather has snarled travel plans for many. More than 2,200 U.S. flights had been canceled as of 10:45 p.m. Thursday, reported FlightAware.com, which tracks cancellations due to weather and mechanical problems. It's not like things will suddenly clear up: the same website reports that some 1,000 flights already have been canceled in advance for Friday. Thursday's most affected airport was Chicago's O'Hare, with more than 650 cancellations in and out and about the same number of delays. Newark's Liberty International Airport, New York's LaGuardia and Cleveland's Hopkins also were affected. Many airlines are allowing passengers to make fee-free itinerary changes for destinations expected to be affected by winter storms. Delta, American, US Airways, United, Southwest/AirTran and JetBlue have all posted weather advisories on their websites. Inside some airports, would-have-been travelers scrambled to rearrange flights or find a place to stay knowing that some things were out of their control. ""The warning has been coming for a couple of days, so we expected it,"" a man from South Carolina said from Boston's Logan Airport, as he headed with his family to a hotel and, hopefully, a Boston Bruins game knowing they couldn't fly, reported CNN affiliate WCVB. ""We are stuck, we'll make the best of it."" Brenda Kopytko is luckily home in South Windsor, Connecticut, having ventured out into the snow earlier. A New England winter veteran, she's taking it in stride -- ""This is nothing"" -- if not the possibility of strong winds and power outages, particularly after being in the dark for nine days after last winter's storm. ""Once the winds start going and the branches start snapping, then I get a little nervous,"" Kopytko said. Here's a breakdown of what to expect where: . New York and Long Island . As of Thursday night, New York City was under a winter storm warning, as were many other densely populated areas in seven other states. The city of 8 million people could get 9 inches of snow, subzero wind chills and turbulent winds, forecasters said. New York City is expecting to see 6 to 12 inches of snow overnight, with more possible on Long Island, where Nassau and Suffolk counties will be under a blizzard warning until 1 p.m. Friday, with predictions of 8 to 10 inches of snow, wind chills as low as 10 below zero and sustained winds of at least 35 mph. Bitter cold will follow, with temperatures in the single digits by Saturday morning. Upstate, the capital city of Albany could get buried under 14 inches of snow, with wind chills of 15 to 25 below zero, the National Weather Service said. Cuomo declared a state of emergency for all of New York shortly after 3:45 p.m. Thursday, one of several steps taken to try to minimize the wild wintry weather's toll. Among them is shutting down parts of Interstate 84, an east-west highway that goes from Connecticut to Pennsylvania, to commercial vehicles late Thursday afternoon, with nearby I-87 south of Albany closing at midnight. That's the same time the Long Island Expressway -- in a different part of the state -- will close to traffic at the border between Nassau County and the Queens borough of New York. The hope is to reopen all these roads around 5 a.m., though that timing is very much subject to change. ""We'll make sure no one is in a state of danger on those roads,"" said Cuomo. Massachusetts . By Friday night, Boston is expected to be covered by 10 to 18 inches of snow, about twice the amount forecast just one day ago, and shivering in temperatures as low as 6 degrees below zero. Citing likely ""near blizzard"" conditions Thursday night into late Friday morning, the state's emergency management agency warned that some areas could be hit hard -- including up to two feet of snow on parts of the North Shore and South Shore, as well as Cape Cod. The forecast was so bad for Boston that the city canceled school for Friday two days in advance, with scores of other school districts quickly following suit. ""I guess Mother Nature wanted to give me one more gift,"" Mayor Thomas Menino told reporters Thursday in one of his last days in the job he has held since 1993. ""Take precautions and take public transportation and take care of one another,"" he urged. But, he added, the city was doing its part, with 700 pieces of equipment on city streets. ""Our team is ready,"" he said. The combination of extreme cold, snow and strong winds had officials at homeless shelters preparing. ""Our main emphasis is getting people inside, where it is safer and warmer,"" said Jennifer Harris, a spokeswoman for the Pine Street Inn shelter system in Boston, where a snow emergency has been declared. ""Pine Street Inn is making sure to have extra staff and food and water. We are geared up to provide to a greater number of people."" Blizzard warnings haven't been issued for Boston itself, but are in effect for parts of nearby Essex and Plymouth counties -- including the communities of Gloucester, Brockton and Plymouth -- as well as the Cape. Because of the storm, the state Emergency Management Agency warned that the midnight and Friday midday high tides could produce ""significant flooding"" along the coast. To this point, the towns of Scituate and Duxbury requested voluntary evacuations for residents of certain low-lying areas. Connecticut . Wind chills in parts of Connecticut are expected to range from -5 to -20 degrees Thursday night and Friday; the National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings for most of the state through Friday morning. Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy urged residents to take it slow and give themselves extra time for their commutes Thursday and Friday. He said he expects there will be delays, but not cancellations, in public transit. Addressing reporters, Malloy said the worst time for the state would be overnight -- between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m., when there could be blizzard conditions. Still, the storm's impact could linger well beyond that if roads are blocked or the electricity goes out. He acknowledged that this kind of weather is hardly unprecedented in Connecticut this time of year. Still, the governor added, what sets this system apart is the frigid temperatures forecast for the coming days. That's a big concern throughout the region, especially for the homeless and people stranded -- whether along a road or inside without adequate heat or power -- by the bad weather. ""(This) is not a big New England storm, but it is a particularly cold New England storm,"" Malloy said. Chicago and points beyond . Seven to 11 inches of snow were possible Thursday in Chicago, according to the National Weather Service. Windy City residents will feel frigid temps -- wind chills during the day Friday will creep down to minus 12 -- and emergency director Gary Schenkel said more snow is possible later in the week. Though snow in Chicago in the winter is a common event, it ""can still wreak havoc on daily routines,"" he noted. Next week could be no better for some U.S. residents. A new shot of colder air will start to move into the northern Midwest by Saturday and will dive south Monday and Tuesday, carrying zero-degree cold as far south as Nashville. ""That's the coldest air we've seen that far south in several years,"" said Hennen, the CNN meteorologist. The cold air will kick off a new storm Sunday into Monday that could affect a number of high-profile NFL playoff games this weekend. In Wisconsin, the Green Bay Packers will give a cold welcome to the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday, when temperatures could bottom out at -17. But it will be relatively balmy Sunday in Cincinnati, where snow and rain are possible when the city's Bengals host the San Diego Chargers in another NFL playoff matchup. Of course, while the players might not have a choice, fans don't have to brave the cold for either game. The big worries are for those who travel in the coming days. Authorities in New York, for example, said they may shut the Long Island Expressway if whiteout conditions make driving along the east-west highway too perilous. Kevin Willims isn't taking any chances, nor is he predicting a world-ending storm. The New Yorker said he plans to sit tight and let Mother Nature do her thing. ""There's not much you can do,"" Willims said. ""When it's snowing and these streets lock up, there's really nowhere you can go, so it's best to just stay in."" That sentiment was echoed by James Montford, who told CNN Boston affiliate WHDH that he is looking forward to creating some art in the comforts of home. ""This a great day to kind of hunker down,"" Montford said.","Midnight, Friday's midday high tides could produce coastal flooding in Massachusetts .

"Authorities called off the Mount Rainier search for hiker Karen Sykes after a body was discovered in the area, but its identity has not been established. The body was found in steep terrain in the area where rescuers focused during the search for Sykes, 70. Its identity and cause of death are unclear. The Seattle resident vanished Wednesday while hiking the Owyhigh Lakes Trail with her hiking partner.

"My girls, ages 6 and 8, love sports, but we are not a family that watches much baseball or even follows the Little League World Series. Of course, that was before we heard the name Mo'ne Davis, the 13-year-old pitching phenom. Now we check to see when she and her team, Philadelphia's Taney Dragons, will play again (Wednesday night against Las Vegas) and celebrate her girl power achievements. She's the first girl to throw a shutout in the Little League World Series, the sixth to get a hit in World Series history and the first Little Leaguer to get front-page attention on one of the nation's top sports magazines. ""A girl on the cover of Sports Illustrated for her prowess in a man's sport,"" cheered ""Inside Edition"" host Deborah Norville in an e-mail. ""Mo'ne is wowing not just the sports world but all of us!"" We're not just taken with how this 5-foot-4 inch eighth-grader throws 70-mph fastballs and strikes out batter after batter. We're also blown away by her grace under pressure and how she's just being Mo'ne. ""I never thought that I would be a role model at this age ... so I just have to be myself,"" she said in a recent ESPN interview. She's an inspiration to any little girl who wants to play baseball some day -- and to all the women who know firsthand the doubters and naysayers that Davis has no doubt encountered on her path to World Series history. Stephanie Tuck, a New York media strategist and fitness blogger at TuckTakesOff.com, spent two years as the only girl on her Little League team and the only girl in her league when she was growing up in Newton, Massachusetts. ""I was heckled by the dads: 'Get that girl off the field,' "" she said they would scream. ""I used to literally pray the ball would not come to me in right field as the pressure was so intense."" On her Facebook page, along with a clip of a recent interview that Davis did, Tuck gushed, ""Love her!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" ""Her impact is that she will not only inspire other girls to play but she is helping to remove the 'specialness' of girls playing on that level,"" she said. ""Over time people won't be amazed that a girl is so good. They will simply be amazed that a particular pitcher or catcher or fielder is so good. Gender won't matter."" That will no doubt take some time, but already Davis is sending a message to girls and boys, says Donna Orender, a former president of the WNBA. The message to girls is pursue your dreams no matter what, said Orender, who has created a nonprofit called Generation W focusing on inspiring women and girls. ""Go do what you think you want to do and do your best because you know there's some mound waiting for you to make your best pitch on."" Davis' success teaches boys and men about understanding and realizing that, ""Oh my goodness, there really are girls that can do that."" She also helps do away with those ""gender-based biases we're taught as kids about the boys' role and the girls' role,"" she added. Case in point: When I was recently at a party and my 10-year-old nephew started to make a crack that someone ""throws like a girl,"" he stopped himself. Sure, he knew his aunt frowned on such a negative comment, but then he thought about Davis and actually said her name. ""Throws like a girl"" has a whole different meaning now, he realized. ""It's when a girl pitches a no-hitter (or two) or has a 70-mph fastball (and) is no big deal that we know we have made progress because throwing like a girl is equivalent or better than throwing like a boy,"" said Dorothy Liu, a mom of a soon-to-be middle schooler in Bellevue, Washington. Liu said she tries to instill in her daughter that being a girl is never an excuse for not trying something new. So will Davis open the floodgate of girls playing sports that boys traditionally play, wondered Norville, the television host and best-selling author? ""Unlikely, but it will make it that much easier for the exceptional girl who wants to play with the boys,"" she added. And the more athletes such as Davis who can command the attention of men, women, boys and girls alike, the more success for women's sports, which still don't get the respect, attention and TV contracts that male-dominated sports receive. Elite women athletes ""elevate their support economically, which is what has to happen for women's professional sports to continue to grow,"" said Orender, who is also a former women's professional basketball player. Davis has already increased interest exponentially in the Little League World Series, bringing much needed attention to the national pastime that has suffered, on the major league level, from performance-enhancing drug scandals, declining attendance and few superstar players. ""Mo'ne Davis could actually be (the) antidote to the loss of young people interested in baseball. Isn't there a beautiful irony here that there's a young woman that's attracting all this attention to baseball?"" Orender said. Davis, for her part, has her focus squarely on her next game at the World Series, and not on her future, but when asked her dreams, she has something specific in mind. And if you were hoping she'd say becoming the first woman to take major league baseball by storm, you might be a tad disappointed. Her goal is to be point guard for the University of Connecticut women's basketball team and then play in the WNBA. If she can do on a basketball court what she's proven she can do on the mound, we'll no doubt be hearing Mo'ne Davis' name for many years to come. What do you think Mo'ne Davis' impact will be on girls and sports? Share your thoughts in the comments or tell Kelly Wallace on Twitter or CNN Living on Facebook.","Mo'ne Davis is the first girl to throw a shutout in Little League World Series history .

"Super Bowl XLVIII started out bad for the Denver Broncos. The Seattle Seahawks made sure it got worse. Seattle romped 43-8 by playing a suffocating defense and taking advantage of four Denver turnovers, including two interceptions thrown by quarterback Peyton Manning, the NFL's most valuable player for the season. The game pitted pro football's best offense, Denver, against the best defense, Seattle, but the drama disappeared early at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. On the first play from scrimmage, a bad snap went sailing past Manning and landed in the end zone for a safety, giving Seattle a 2-0 lead without running a play. Denver didn't score until the third quarter, when the game was out of reach. Seattle's defense was so strong that Denver managed only 27 yards rushing, compared with 135 for Seattle. Manning went 34 for 49 to gain 279 yards in the air, but most passes were for short yardage with his receivers quickly taken down. His counterpart, Russell Wilson of Seattle, went 18 for 26 to gain 206 yards and score two touchdowns. Fittingly, a Seattle defensive player, linebacker Malcolm Smith, was named the game's most valuable player. Seattle won its first Super Bowl in franchise history. Manning was thwarted in his quest for a second Super Bowl ring. After the safety, Seattle kicked two field goals, and Marshawn Lynch scored on a 1-yard run for a touchdown. The Seahawks'  Smith intercepted Manning's second interception and returned it for another touchdown. The second half started out bad for Denver, with Seattle's Percy Harvin running the opening  kickoff back for a touchdown. Jermaine Kearse caught a 23-yeard pass from Russell Wilson with 2:58 left in the third quarter for another touchdown. Wilson threw his second scoring strike to Doug Baldwin with 11:45 left in the fourth. Just before the third quarter ended, Denver got onto the scoreboard when Manning threw a 14-yard pass to Demaryius Thomas. Denver went for a two-point PAT to make the score 36-8. Denver, led by the 37-year-old Manning, has the NFL's best offense, statistically, but never got moving Sunday. Richard Sherman, the Seattle defense player who mocked San Francisco after winning the NFC championship, was never really challenged. He left with an injury in the fourth quarter. Balmy conditions on Game Day . Though the game didn't experience the blackout that hit last year's Super Bowl, fans in Los Angeles had their own visual blackout. Some fans lost cable service for a period and missed part of the second half and the halftime show, starring Bruno Mars and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Time Warner cable said in a tweet that the issue was resolved before the end of the game. A man was shot several times during a Super Bowl party at a residence in Denver, police said. The man was found outside the home, but police spokesman Sonny Jackson did not have additional information, such as what led to the shooting. The man was taken to a hospital in critical condition, and authorities do not have a suspect or a suspect description. The experts' picks . History of the Super Bowl: By the numbers .

"After 22 years on a cold case, the New York Police Department finally has a lead. The NYPD was able to identify the mother of ""Baby Hope,"" a little girl whose body was found in a blue and white picnic cooler in a wooded area near the Henry Hudson Parkway on July 23, 1991. The girl, then believed to be 3 to 5 years old, was smothered and sexually molested. Her body was so badly decomposed that several sketches were made to suggest what she looked like. Thanks to a tip, the department has confirmed the identity of the girl's mother through DNA testing, according to Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. The body was exhumed in 2011. ""A DNA match was made with the mother and the mother has been cooperating,""  Kelly told reporters Tuesday. He declined to name the mother or provide details on the case. There have been no arrests. ""Homicide is a distinct possibility here, so it's going to go forward in that direction,"" Kelly said of the investigation. Baby Hope -- named by the police officers and detectives moved by her unknown story -- finally has a name and an age. The NYPD, however, is not ready to release this information so as to not disturb the ongoing investigation. NYPD hasn't given up on Baby Hope . The girl was never reported missing and police could not track down anyone who might have known her. The NYPD Cold Case Apprehension Squad never gave up hope, continuing to hand out flyers and canvas nearby neighborhoods every year on the anniversary of the discovery of the body. ""We have been able to identify the mother of Baby Hope as a result of, in my judgment, outstanding detective work,"" Kelly said. Detective Robert Dewhurst, a member of the squad, told CNN in July that several detectives were still on the case and that people with information may speak many years later for many reasons, such as feeling safer after moving to a new area where they don't see the person responsible every day. Sometimes people ""want to get it off their chest,"" said Dewhurst. For months after Baby Hope's body was found, police went back to the site hoping whoever was responsible, driven by guilt, had left some type of memorial that would have helped police. Baby Hope, two years after she was found, was laid to rest in a donated plot. She was buried in a white dress bought by a detective's wife. ""This is what my squad does,"" Dewhurst said. ""Twenty years is not uncommon for a cold case."" ""I have hope. Otherwise I wouldn't be doing this.""

"A man who allegedly was with Aaron Hernandez the night Odin Lloyd was killed pleaded not guilty Friday to a single count of being an accessory to murder after the fact. As members of his and Lloyd's family looked on, Carlos Ortiz uttered only those two words -- ""not guilty"" -- during his brief arraignment in Bristol County Superior Court in the southeastern Massachusetts city of Fall River. His next court date is set for November 20. Ortiz is one of several people who have been charged in connection with Lloyd's death, though only one person -- Hernandez, who was a standout tight end for the New England Patriots before being released by the team the day of his arrest -- faces a murder count. Like Hernandez, Ortiz hails from Bristol, Connecticut. During Friday's court hearing, Ortiz's lawyer John Connors did not contest the $500,000 cash bail set for his client, though he could do so later. ""We don't have the grand jury minutes, we don't have a lot of the discovery statements, etc. So I think it's prudent to wait for the next date until we argue (bail),"" Connors said. Authorities have said that Hernandez, Ernest Wallace and Ortiz picked Lloyd up from his Boston apartment in a rental car shortly before he was found shot to death June 17 in a North Attleborough, Massachusetts, industrial park. Surveillance cameras then captured the rental car leaving the crime scene and Hernandez carrying a gun as he returned to his home minutes later. He was with two other people. Lloyd -- a 27-year-old semi-pro football player himself -- was not among them. Ortiz first told investigators both Hernandez and Wallace had gotten out of the car with Lloyd at the industrial park, before shots rang out. But prosecutors say he later changed his story to claim Wallace remained in the car, while Hernandez and Lloyd got out. Asked last month about Ortiz changing his account, his attorney said, ""Almost every case I've ever been involved in, the story changes during interrogation. ""When a professional interrogation takes place, at the end of it sometimes you have trouble remembering your own name."" Connors said his client had ""limited means"" and would seek a relatively low bail. ""He's a young guy who got caught up in a situation,"" Connors said. ""And when all this came about, he was frightened and confused, as you can imagine anyone would be. I believe he's an honest guy.""","Authorities say Carlos Ortiz was with Aaron Hernandez when they picked up Odin Lloyd .

"The sister of the Boston Marathon bombing suspect was arrested in New York City on Wednesday for allegedly making a bomb threat, police said. Ailina Tsarnaev, 24, sister of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was charged with aggravated harassment after a bomb threat was made by phone to another woman Monday. The recipient, whose name was not released, notified police of the threat, according to New York Police Department Lt. John Grimpel. Ailina Tsarnaev, a resident of North Bergen, New Jersey, turned herself in to authorities Wednesday. Her boyfriend shares a child with the woman who was threatened, Grimpel said. Alina Tsarnaev is no longer in custody and is expected to report to Manhattan criminal court on September 30, according to Grimpel. Calls to her attorney were not immediately returned to CNN. Her brothers were accused of planting pressure-cooker bombs at the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon that killed three people and injured more than 260. They also were accused of killing a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer.

"Singapore ranks as Asia's most innovative city in Asia-Pacific, according to a new survey by Solidiance, a strategy consulting firm based in the Southeast Asian city-state. Singapore ranks number one for innovation in the Asia-Pacific because ""it has made dramatic and perpetual improvements for the past 25 years,"" said Solidiance, transforming itself from a trading port to high-tech and financial hub. After Singapore, the top five cities are Sydney, Melbourne, Hong Kong and Auckland. The report examines six links between what a city has to offer and the amount of talent that relocates to that city: the availability of a skilled talent base; a strong higher education system; the livability of a city and environmental sustainability; technological advancement and government regulations that support financial freedom and global integration. With Singapore, the city has pushed an 'open door policy' welcoming professional talent from around the world. In 2000, 8% of the country's 4 million residents were foreigners. In 2012, the foreign population made up 14% of the city's 5.3 million people. Strong government regulations have provided for a structured and stable environment with which to conduct business, the report said. The World Bank ranked Singapore as the best place to do business in the world for 2013, unchanged from 2012. But to keep its top spot as best Asian city for innovation, Singapore needs to stay open to new ideas, new cultures, and new entrants, adds Solidiance. ""Singapore has no other choice; it must adapt, stay opened and lead change if it is to remain relevant in the 21st century,"" says Damien Duhamel, Managing Partner Asia of Solidiance. Sydney scored highest in the categories of global integration, having a skilled talent base and for its technological advancement. Sydney has been able to attract a wide range of professionals from industrialists to artists and information technology experts, the survey found. Melbourne ranks as the third most innovative city in the Asia-Pacific because of its superiority in the human talent category. Half of the city's population comes from immigrant backgrounds, Solidance notes, and the city supports a ""good level"" of diversity acceptance. Hong Kong ranks fourth thanks to its technological and regulatory leadership. Solidiance points to the city's tech cluster of Cyberport, envisioned in 1999 and built to help develop Hong Kong's IT industry. However, as reported in local Hong Kong media,  critics complain Cyberport has been a failure with office occupancy never reaching full capacity. Hong Kong is also known as one of Asia's most prominent financial hubs thanks to its regulatory framework and lack of corruption. In 2012, the city ranked at number 14 in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index. Hong Kong also has the lowest tax rates in Asia -- 16.5% for corporations -- which attracts business to move and stay in the city. Auckland took the number five spot largely on its ability to attract skilled talent -- and its tolerance for diversity, the report said. The ease of doing business also expatriate to settle in the city.  In the category of livability, however, bad infrastructure for public transport is one of the Auckland's largest detractions.","Singapore is Asia-Pacific's most innovative city, says marketing firm Solidiance in a new report .

"The New York Police Department has identified the father of ""Baby Hope"" and want to speak with him as part of their 22-year investigation into the girl's death. Police stopped short of calling the man a suspect. ""He is someone we definitely have to talk to,"" NYPD Assistant Chief Joe Reznick told CNN on Thursday, ""But can we arrest him for this right now? The answer is no, definitely not."" Investigators are looking for the father and believe he is in New York City. ""We're very interested in him,"" a law enforcement official told CNN.

"When President Barack Obama said that U.S. strategy to combat the terror group ISIS could follow the models of strikes in Yemen and Somalia, it drew a swift rebuttal from some top Republicans. Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona took to the Senate floor Thursday to say the administration's tactics in both of those countries had not succeeded and would be even less effective when used against ISIS. ""That is so disturbing, to think that a strategy against ISIS would be the same as against al Qaeda in Somalia and Yemen,"" said McCain. ""Yes, we have been killing with drones. But we have by no means defeated them,"" he said. He was responding to Obama's speech Wednesday night: ""This strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us, while supporting partners on the front lines, is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years."" Another Republican, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, told CNN Thursday that not only had the administration's strategy in Yemen and Somalia come up short, but also that it was not the right template to apply to Syria. ""ISIL poses a risk very different from the risk posed by terrorists in those two countries,"" Rubio told CNN, using an alternate acronym for the militant group. ""ISIL is a terrorist group, but it has insurgent elements to it. They are working with people on the ground. They control territory. They've got funding, and they carry out military-style operations. They pose a much different risk."" CIA: ISIS can 'muster' between 20,000 and 31,500 fighters . But the White House defended the comparison, saying that there have been some successes against both groups, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen and  Al-Shabaab in Somalia. ""There is still more work to do in those countries. But what has been put in place is a counterterrorism strategy that has succeeded in degrading the threat, and making those organizations less capable of threatening the American people,"" said spokesman Josh Earnest. ""In both of those situations, the President has selectively and strategically brought American military might to bear in support of those ground troops to mitigate and counter the threat."" Over the past few years, the amount of territory that extremists control in Yemen and Somalia has indeed been rolled back. And several terrorist leaders in both countries have been killed by American strikes, including Al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Godane, and AQAP's No. 2, Said Ali al-Shihri, and top propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki. A frightening, far-reaching new world of terror threats since 9/11 . But Thomas Joscelyn at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies maintains the fight against AQAP has been no success story. ""AQAP is still planning attacks against the U.S. homeland,"" Joscelyn said. And the group's top leadership is still mainly intact, he said. ""Naser al-Wahishi, who was groomed by Osama bin Laden to run an al Qaeda branch, has in fact been the emir with that organization for years now. He is still in place,"" he said. ""Many of his top lieutenants are still in place, including the chief theologians and the chief military officers."" Boehner hits Obama for ruling out boots on the ground . Also still at large is AQAP's master bomb-maker, Ibrahim al-Asiri. He is believed to be behind the nearly successful printer-cartridge bombs placed on American-bound planes in 2010, and the underwear bomb on a plane to Detroit in 2009. ""There's concern now he may be sharing his bomb-making technology with jihadist groups in Syria,"" said terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank. Carrying out air strikes against ISIS could be even more difficult than against AQAP and Al-Shabaab, because while the governments of Somalia and Yemen have complemented American airstrikes by deploying ground forces against extremists, the U.S. has no such partner in Syria's government. And according to Cruickshank, ISIS fighters are more inextricably mixed in with civilian populations in Iraq and Syria. But he added that military action against extremists can be successful, even if it does not produce total victory. ""The more you can shrink the space they can operate, the more you can take out training camps so they can't provide bomb-making instructions to Western recruits, you're clearly then limiting their ability to plot terrorist attacks against the West."" Still, he warned, ""It's going to be a long time before that capability to theoretically plot attacks against the West is going to be wiped out.""

"Authorities in Mexico City say they've rescued 46 women in a human trafficking bust. The women rescued included 27 Mexicans and 19 foreigners, Mexico City prosecutors said in a statement. Forty people were detained after a raid at the Cadillac table-dance club in the country's capital over the weekend, prosecutors said. Fourteen of them face charges of human trafficking for sexual exploitation, the statement said. In 2011, Mexico City's human rights commission found there were ""alarming"" human trafficking figures in the sprawling metropolis. While an estimated 10,000 women were victims of human trafficking in Mexico's capital in 2010, there were only 40 investigations of the crime and three convictions in the city that year, according to a report from the organization. Since then, the country has changed its constitution to combat human trafficking. The measures make human trafficking a federal crime, punishable by up to 40 years in prison. And it targets not only those involved in sex trafficking but also other forms of modern slavery, including forced labor and child pornography.","Prosecutors say 46 women were rescued after a weekend raid in Mexico City .

"NATO has scrambled fighter jets more than 400 times this year to intercept Russian military flights close to alliance members' airspace in Europe, the alliance's secretary general said this week. That's a 50% increase in Russian air activity over last year and the kind of activity that harkens back to the days of the Cold War, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said during a visit to NATO member Estonia on Thursday. ""This pattern is risky and unjustified. So NATO remains vigilant. We are here. And we are ready to defend all allies against any threat,"" he said at Amari Airbase in Estonia, where U.S., German and Estonian troops were gathered. Stoltenberg said few of the Russian flights had actually violated the airspace of NATO nations, but he said the way the Russian planes operate threatens civilian aviation in the region. ""They are not filing their air flight plans. They are not turning on the transponders. And they are not communicating with the civilian air traffic control,"" he said. ""We are calling on Russia to conduct their military air activities in a responsible way and respecting international norms for this kind of air activity,"" Stoltenberg said. In a report earlier this month, the European Leadership Network listed more than 40 ""close military encounters between Russia and the West"" that took place in the eight months from March to October of this year. Three of those, including a near collision between a Russian military plane and a Swedish passenger aircraft carrying 132 people, were classified as ""high-risk"" incidents that could have led to direct military confrontation between Russia and the West, according to the report, titled ""Dangerous Brinksmanship."" Russia also has said it will expand its military flights, with Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu saying this month that Russian military aircraft would be flying along U.S. coasts and even into the Gulf of Mexico. ""We have to maintain (Russia's) military presence in the western Atlantic and eastern Pacific, as well as the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico,"" including sending bombers ""as part of the drills,"" Shoigu said. Stoltenberg, continuing his Baltic trip in NATO ally Lithuania on Friday, said the alliance is not standing idle as Russian activity increases. Visiting the Karmelava Airspace Control Center, he said NATO's air policing mission in the region ""has been significantly strengthened in the recent months."" ""And we have also deployed more ships in the Baltic Sea. And since the start of this year, NATO allies have conducted over 200 exercises,"" Stoltenberg said .","That's a 50% increase in Russian air activity over last year, secretary general says .

"New York Mayor Bill de Blasio on Friday started the third day of his new administration with a predawn conference call to decide whether to close public schools after a major storm walloped the city with up to 6 inches of snow. ""I had a great night; it was not the most sleep-filled night,"" de Blasio, an admitted night owl, told reporters Friday morning during what's seen as the first challenge for a new mayor pushing a progressive agenda that promises to serve all of the city's 8 million residents. ""I must say I have never done a 4 a.m. conference call in my life."" For the moment at least, de Blasio's vow to tackle a range of issues, from economic inequality to police and community relations, was superseded by a meteorological phenomenon that has famously haunted mayors in the past. ""We are working in all five boroughs equally,"" said de Blasio, surrounded by a small army of sanitation workers at a garage in Queens. ""I believe that that is not only a philosophical idea I believe in strongly; it is also the fundamental belief of each member of this department to help each and every neighborhood equally."" De Blasio said sanitation crews were working 12-hour shifts to clear the city's 6,200 miles of roadways with 2,500 plows from various departments. He said 100% of primary roads and 92% of secondary roads had been plowed. About 93% of tertiary roads were plowed with the help of private contractors. Emergency response times were delayed about a minute because of snow and traffic, he said. In 2010, Mayor Michael Bloomberg was heavily criticized for his handling of a blizzard that shut down several subway lines for days. He was accused of allowing snow to pile up in Queens and letting large parts of Brooklyn go unplowed for days. Bloomberg defended city efforts to clear snow amid a swell of frustration by some snowbound residents, particularly outside of Manhattan, who wondered why their streets were still clogged days after the massive holiday storm. ""I was here in 2010 and it was a disaster,"" Kathy Nobles, a teacher and Brooklyn resident. John Doherty, sanitation commissioner since the administration of Mayor Ed Koch in the early 1980s, said de Blasio has handled the storm no differently from his previous bosses. ""He wants the job done, and he wants the streets clear,"" he said. ""That's what we do."" ""It would have been nice to talk about how to handle a snowstorm in an abstract exercise, but we didn't get to do that,"" de Blasio told Doherty. ""We got the real thing."" De Blasio said the decision to close schools was made in the predawn hours because of the deceptively cold temperatures. ""With this kind of bitter cold,"" he said, ""we did not want children out there, exposed."" Friday morning, de Blasio emerged from his row house in Park Slope, Brooklyn, with a shovel to clear his own sidewalk, something he said he has done for years. ""I'm a proud Brooklynite,"" he told reporters later. ""I'm an outer borough homeowner."" That populist approach was well received during his first real challenge as mayor. ""We just consider him from our neighborhood and we expect he's going to keep our interests at heart,"" Brooklyn resident Kathleen Axen said. ""I like his emphasis on middle-class people."" A virtual unknown nationally, despite 25 years in New York politics, de Blasio defied critics who questioned whether his experience as a city councilman from Brooklyn and, most recently, as a public advocate -- a sort of civic watchdog -- sufficiently prepared him to run the Big Apple. He also ran Hillary Clinton's first U.S. Senate campaign. The new mayor admitted that his son, Dante, a high school student, lobbied heavily for closing the city's schools. On social media, Dante said friends were asking him to pull strings to get the shutdown done. But de Blasio's wife, Chirlane McCray, tweeted a photo of a shovel and snow salts Thursday night to illustrate ""what Dante will be doing if he does not go to school."" ""If Dante was not lobbying me, there would be something wrong with him,"" de Blasio said. ""Of  course, he's 16. But unfortunately the decision takes more factors into account than Dante's opinion.""","Weather seen as the first challenge to a new mayor pushing a progressive agenda .

"The investigation into the actions of former NFL tight end Aaron Hernandez, who is accused of killing friend Odin Lloyd, has turned to Hernandez's fiancee as law enforcement searches for the .45 caliber gun used in the slaying. Lloyd's bullet-riddled body was found in a Massachusetts industrial park on June 17, Father's Day, about a mile from Hernandez's Massachusetts home. He was shot five times, and the gun has not been found. Prosecutors have accused the former New England Patriot of orchestrating what they call Lloyd's execution-style slaying. Hernandez, 23, has pleaded not guilty to murder and is being held without bail. Search warrant affidavits obtained by CNN contain new details about fiancée Shayanna Jenkins. In them, authorities alleged that Hernandez, Jenkins, his cousin Tanya Singleton and Ernest Wallace ""have all made overt attempts to hide evidence, render assistance for suspect to elude law enforcement, and to hinder and mislead this investigation."" Shayanna Jenkins has not been charged in connection with the investigation, and lawyers representing her fiancé, Hernandez, have not responded to requests for comment. Official: Lake search didn't turn up weapon . Wallace has been charged with accessory after the fact to murder. The documents indicate investigators became suspicious of Shayanna Jenkins after they spoke with her sister Shaneah Jenkins. Shaneah Jenkins was Lloyd's girlfriend. The court papers describe the following allegations: . The day after Lloyd's body was found, Shaneah Jenkins told authorities she was with her sister, Shayanna, and two uncles at Hernandez's home. During that time, Shaneah Jenkins said she saw her sister go into the basement with an empty trash bag. Shayanna asked Shaneah to borrow her car and had a cell phone ""communication"" with Hernandez. The women's uncle told Shayanna that ""Mr. Hernandez wanted weapons taken out of the house"" and told Shaneah that weapons ""were discarded into 'the woods.'"" Did Hernandez store guns in a box after killing? The documents go on to describe a mysterious, if not cryptic, text message obtained by investigators from Hernandez to his fiancée that allegedly read: ""Go back in back of the screen in movie room when u (sic) get home an (sic) there is a box...jus (sic) in case u (sic) were looking for it!!!  Member (sic) how you ruined the big tv Imao WAS JUST THINKIN bout that lol wink wink love u TTYL....K"" ""TTYL"" is common shorthand for ""talk to you later."" According to the court papers, Jenkins allegedly answers: ""ok-that was awful...Perfect tv...Love u."" About an hour later, a home surveillance video shows Jenkins leaving the house carrying something ""rigid"" and ""consistent to a lock box or safe"" placed inside a garbage bag and covered with clothing, according to the documents. Police state Jenkins drove away and returned an hour later, but she was not carrying the ""rigid"" item back into the house. Prosecutors have said no lock box was found in the home. A search of a rented storage unit in Bristol, Connecticut, allegedly paid for by Hernandez, did not locate the weapon used to kill Lloyd, according to law enforcement officials. Singleton, Hernandez' cousin, remained jailed on a contempt of court charge for failing to cooperate with a grand jury, according to two law enforcement sources. Grand jury indictments are expected in the case as early as next week, officials have said. Hernandez responds from jail to fan letter .","Search warrant: Aaron Hernandez's fiancee and others have tried ""to hide evidence""
