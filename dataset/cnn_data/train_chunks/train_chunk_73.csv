"(CNN) -- A death row inmate who says he did not commit the murders he was convicted of asked the Arkansas Supreme Court on Thursday to grant him a new trial. Damien Echols maintains his innocence 16 years after he and two other teens were convicted of murdering . three Cub Scouts -- Michael Moore, Christopher Byers and Steven Branch. The court, which heard his request for a new trial Thursday morning, is likely to rule in two or three weeks, court representative Stephanie Harris said. Echols spoke to CNN from death row recently about the new evidence that he says will prove his innocence. ""I miss the things that most people take for granted, things people don't want, like rain,"" Echols told CNN in a face-to-face interview. ""To go out and touch it and get wet, or to feel snow. I loved snow my entire life, and I haven't had that in almost 20 years now."" On May 6, 1993, police in the rural community of West Memphis, Arkansas, found the bodies of the young boys, bruised and mutilated, their arms and legs hogtied with their own shoelaces. Echols, along with 16-year-old Jason Baldwin and 17-year-old Jessie Misskelley, were found guilty a year later. Echols received a death sentence, while Baldwin and Misskelley were sentenced to life in prison. The three teens became known as the West Memphis 3. His lawyers want to present DNA evidence not available at the time of the trial, as well as testimony that supports arguments that Echols and the two others did not commit the crime. Meanwhile, no execution date is set for Echols. ""We are asking the Arkansas Supreme Court to right a terrible wrong, overturn their convictions and grant Damien as well as Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley a new trial,"" said Dennis Riordan, the lead attorney on the case. The West Memphis 3 have gained advocates, including unexpected support from some of the parents of the victims. Last year, Pamela Hobbs, mother of victim Steven Branch, told CNN that she was once convinced of their guilt. Then she began to consider the DNA evidence. She now says she believes the prosecution's case was flawed. Capi Peck formed Arkansas Take Action, a Little Rock-based group trying to raise awareness about the West Memphis 3. In the past few weeks, the group has brought in celebrities such as Eddie Vedder of the rock group Pearl Jam and actor Johnny Depp to a public rally. Echols says police questioned him a day after the bodies of the second-graders were found in the woods, near where they used to hunt turtles. A month later, the teens were arrested. Prosecutors successfully argued the defendants were involved in a satanic cult. They said that punctures and cuts on the boys' bodies indicated a ritual sacrifice. In addition, prosecutors secured a confession from Misskelley, although his defense attorneys argued that he had a learning disability and an IQ of 70. They also claimed that it was not only riddled with inconsistencies but was coerced. Neither his parents nor his attorney was present when he was questioned. His confession came during the last hour of a 12-hour police interrogation. His attorneys tried to convince the Arkansas Supreme Court that new evidence not available during the trial exonerates Echols. DNA testing indicated that a hair found on the shoelace used to tie up one of the victims is consistent with a hair from Terry Hobbs, the stepfather of victim Steven Branch, Echols' lawyers said. Police have never considered Hobbs a suspect and Hobbs maintains that he had nothing to do with the murders. Asked whether he killed the boys, Echols responded, ""To constantly have to answer that question and to constantly have people asking you that question is like being kicked in the stomach over and over again.""

"(CNN) -- Gene Robinson, the first openly gay bishop in the Episcopal Church, said Saturday that death threats and continued worldwide controversy about his selection contributed to his decision to retire in January 2013. Robinson's announced retirement surprised many of those attending the annual diocesan convention in Concord, New Hampshire. The bishop, who has served in the post in New Hampshire since early 2004, said he is energized about his next two years of ministry and support of clergy and congregations as the process of naming his successor moves forward. But turning 66 in 2013 and the ""constant strain"" from the church schism were factors in his decision, Robinson said in prepared remarks. The bishop said he is in his fifth year of sobriety after receiving treatment for alcohol abuse. ""The fact is, the last seven years have taken their toll on me, my family, and you,"" he told those attending the convention. ""While I believe that these attitudes, mostly outside the Diocese, have not distracted me from my service to you, I would be less than honest if I didn't say that they have certainly added a burden and certain anxiety to my episcopate."" Conservative factions in the Anglican Communion, a 77 million-member denomination worldwide that includes the Episcopal Church, have opposed the ordination of gay bishops. Robinson's appointment prompted a semi-official moratorium on naming new gay bishops, but they revoked that ban last year. In May, the Episcopal Church consecrated its first openly lesbian bishop in the face of objections from some conservative Anglicans. A number of Episcopal dioceses broke with the official church structure, forming the breakaway Anglican Church in North America in protest of the church's stance on homosexuality. After his selection in 2003, Robinson told CNN he was prepared to serve as bishop. ""The only thing that is sort of weighing on my heart is knowing this is very difficult for many people in our church, and for those people for whom this is confusing or disturbing,"" he said. ""I'm very sorry about that. But I am feeling very calm about moving forward, that this is in fact what God wants for me. Although he has often spoken about his sexual orientation, the bishop told the audience Saturday that he doesn't always wanted to be identified with it. ""New Hampshire is always the place I remain, simply, 'the Bishop,'"" he said. ""This is the one place on earth where I am not 'the gay Bishop.' I believe that you elected me because you believed me to be the right person to lead you at this time. The world has sometimes questioned that, but I hope you never did."" Robinson, who is in a same-sex relationship, said he has evangelized gay and lesbian people in order to ""make the case for God and God's Church."" He also made reference Saturday to the recently publicized suicides of gay and lesbian teenagers. ""[They] have taken their own lives because religion tells them they are an abomination before God and who believe their lives are doomed to despair and unhappiness,"" the bishop said. ""I go tell them a different story.""","Gene Robinson, openly gay bishop in New Hampshire, announces retirement .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Australia warned its citizens Monday that next month's Commonwealth Games in India carry a ""high risk of terrorism."" Australia issued the travel advisory a day after two Taiwanese nationals were wounded in a shooting at a popular tourist site in India's Old Delhi. ""Australians in New Delhi should be aware that the Commonwealth Games will be held in a security environment where there is a high risk of terrorism,"" the advisory said. Commonwealth Games building goes to wire . It added that New Delhi has seen at least 14 major terrorist attacks since 2000 in public places, such as markets and train stations. Police in New Delhi insist Sunday's shooting was not targeted at the games. ""It was a local mischief,"" police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said Monday. Security has, however, been stepped up in the Indian capital, he added. ""We assure full security not only for the Games but also for the city,"" Bhagat said. The games will be held from October 3 to October 14. Meanwhile, two of India's largest cities -- Delhi and Mumbai -- are on red alert after the shooting. Gunmen on a motorcycle fired multiple rounds at a tour bus, Karnail Singh of Delhi police told CNN-IBN. Police said the shooting happened near a mosque in one of the most populated parts of Old Delhi. The two gunmen fled, prompting the red alert. ""Both the injured are Taiwanese nationals,"" Singh said. ""One of the bullets grazed the head of one tourist, and one has been hit in the stomach."" A media outlet in India received a claim of responsibility for the attack, but police are treating the claim with caution. Police think the attack is more likely to be the work of a criminal gang than a terror attack, they said. Police are still searching for the attackers, authorities said.

"(CNN) -- The latest legal battle over same-sex marriage is in the hands of a panel of California federal appeals court judges. Proposition 8, a 2008 measure approved by California voters that defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman, was the focal point of Monday's Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals hearing. Opponents of the measure want the court to uphold a federal district judge's August decision, which ruled that the proposition violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. Supporters note that the proposition was approved by 52 percent of voters, and argue that it protects the ""institution of marriage."" ""I believe it's to preserve the institution of marriage for the purposes that it has always served,"" attorney Charles Cooper said, arguing that the key reason marriage exists in society is ""that sexual relationships between men and women naturally produce children."" Attorney Theodore Olson, representing opponents of Proposition 8, argued that the measure is unconstitutional and denies ""the fundamental right of...citizens to marry."" ""California has engraved discrimination on the basis of sex and sexual orientation into its fundamental governing charter,"" he said. Ultimately, the judges' decision could hinge as much on who's arguing the case as what their arguments are. The first half of Monday's hearing focused on the legal standing of the parties appealing the federal district judge's decision. That's because Proposition 8 is in a ""paradoxical situation,"" CNN legal analyst Jeff Toobin said. ""The usual defendants when you challenge a law of the state are the governor and attorney general of that state. But the governor and attorney general of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jerry Brown, both agree with the plaintiffs that Proposition 8 is unconstitutional,"" he said. So in their place, other groups have stepped in to defend the measure. The question, Toobin explained, is ""do they have the legal right to be there?"" Along those lines, the three-judge panel opened Monday's hearing with tough questioning of parties seeking to appeal the decision, including ProtectMarriage.com and Isabel Vargas, deputy clerk and deputy commissioner of civil marriages for Imperial County, California, where voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 8. ""What's your best case to allow for your standing in federal court?"" one judge asked attorney Cooper, representing ProtectMarriage.com. ""Your honor, I don't have a case,"" Cooper responded, referring to relevant past court decisions. Cooper later urged the panel to consider the California Supreme Court's earlier ruling in favor of Proposition 8 ""if you don't agree with me that we have standing."" Later Judge Stephen Reinhardt questioned attorney Robert Tyler, who represented Vargas, about how a deputy clerk, instead of the clerk, could have legal standing in the appeal. Tyler told the court that the county clerks are local officers, but they perform state functions such as civil marriages. Monday's hearing was the latest in a long-running battle over same-sex marriage in California. The state's high court had allowed same-sex marriage, but then the 2008 Proposition 8 voter referendum passed with 52 percent of the vote. The California Supreme Court subsequently allowed that initiative to stand, saying it represented the will of the people. Two same-sex couples filed a federal challenge, saying the law violated 14th Amendment constitutional protections of due process and equal protection. On August 4, U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker agreed, ruling that the voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. ""Proposition 8 fails to advance any rational basis in singling out gay men and lesbians for denial of a marriage license,"" Walker, who was appointed to the federal bench by former President George H.W. Bush, wrote in his 136-page opinion. ""Indeed, the evidence shows Proposition 8 does nothing more than enshrine in the California Constitution the notion that opposite-sex couples are superior to same-sex couples."" Same-sex marriage is currently legal in five states and in the District of Columbia. The five states are Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, Iowa and New Hampshire. Walker's landmark ruling led to a swift federal appeal that could ultimately reach the Supreme Court. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","A panel of judges hears arguments over whether the measure is constitutional .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Norway have launched an investigation into whether the United States conducted illegal surveillance in the Nordic country, the Ministry of Justice told CNN Thursday. Officials from Norway's Ministry of Foreign Affairs talked to the number two at the American Embassy in Oslo, James Heg, about the allegations on Wednesday, a spokeswoman said. ""Because here at the Foreign Ministry, we have not been informed about this"" alleged surveillance, she said, asking that her name not be used. ""We wanted to know.... what these activities included,"" she said. ""These questions were, however, not fully clarified in this meeting, which is why we now have to seek further clarification of the matter,"" she said. ""Any violation of Norwegian law is not accepted, regardless of who may be responsible,"" she told CNN. The investigation follows a report by Norway's TV2 claiming that the U.S. Embassy in Oslo has been conducting an ""illegal systematic surveillance of Norwegian citizens."" The channel claims the embassy has hired former police officers and defense staff to take pictures and register people who behave in a suspicious way in order to stop attacks on American targets in Norway. U.S. State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley acknowledged the surveillance program at a press briefing in Washington on Monday, but said Norwegian authorities had been informed. ""The surveillance detection program is something that we've put in place over the last decade. We recognize that our posts around the world are prospective targets and tragically there's a lot of intelligence and actual attacks to back that up,"" he said. ""All of our activities in Norway are fully consistent with and with the cooperation of the host nation government,"" he added. But some key Norwegian authorities deny they had any knowledge of the operation. Justice Minister Knut Storberget has asked the Norwegian police and the Norwegian Security Police to clarify if they had any knowledge of the U.S. Embassy's alleged surveillance program. ""I wish to bring as many facts as possible to the table. On Norwegian soil, Norwegian law must be followed,"" Storberget said in a statement. Martin Bernsen, a spokesman for the Norwegian Police Security Service, told CNN that they knew of ""a certain surveillance activity taking place, but not at this scale. ""What we can say is that it is only Norwegian police that should conduct police work on Norwegian territory,"" he added. The U.S. Embassy in Oslo responded to the allegations by saying: ""Norway is a friend and ally. We are prepared to work intensively to address any questions the Norwegian government might have on this or any other matter."" TV2's report on Wednesday came after a two-year investigation, it said. The station reported that for the last decade, around 15 to 20 individuals have been working in shifts, 24 hours a day at a secret location in Oslo, located close to the embassy. The Surveillance Detection Unit (SDU) is said to have been collecting personal information such as vehicle registration numbers and personal information about individuals behaving suspiciously. These reports were then collected in a database called SIMAS, where information is shared between different U.S. authorities and posts, TV2 reported. A TV2 reporter asked Crowley about SIMAS at the State Department briefing on Monday. Crowley did not specifically acknowledge its existence, but said information was shared. ""It is possible when you look at a networked entity like al Qaeda that they might be casing a post in Europe, in the Middle East, in Africa, and so we have a database that shares intelligence and assessment,"" Crowley said. Several hundred Norwegian individuals may be in the SIMAS database, according to TV2, which said those people may encounter problems if trying to enter the U.S.","The Nordic country asks the U.S. Embassy to explain the alleged surveillance .

"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Three and a half years ago, I ran a mile with nine men who were living at the Sunday Breakfast Rescue Mission in Philadelphia,. Wanting to start a running club at this homeless shelter came from passing this facility on my morning run and seeing a group of men congregating outside on the corner. I was quickly drawn to them as they reminded me a lot of my dad, who I love dearly but unfortunately has suffered from addiction to drugs, alcohol and gambling for much of his life. My dad and I have always had a very special, sarcastic rapport and one of the hardest things I have gone through was being a teenager and not being able to figure out a way to save my dad from his gambling addiction, which ended up tearing apart our family. Chilean miners to attend CNN Heroes tribute . To save myself from the despair, I ran a lot, and 10 years later is when I finally found the road that made my life make sense and it started with these nine guys. I thought in some spiritual cosmic way that I could vicariously help my dad by helping these men. Running doesn't discriminate. It doesn't matter whether you're white, black, rich, poor, homeless or not. I wanted to share this sport with these guys in hopes they would reap the same benefits I did -- better self-esteem, confidence and discipline. But, it didn't take long to see that it was turning into so much more. An environment had been created where people, regardless of race, religion or socio-economic status, were treated with respect, appreciation and genuine care and concern for each other. It was an environment that had been missing from their lives, and it was amazing to watch the changes in attitude and behavior that were occurring. A vision quickly formed about building a program. It would start with running, and through dedication, hard work and commitment, we would connect our members to job training and educational programs, employment partners and housing opportunities, but only when our members were ready for those steps. Each person would also have the opportunity to earn approved grant money to move his or her life forward. Today, Back on My Feet has operations in five cities (Philadelphia;  Baltimore, Maryland;  Washington; Chicago, Illinois; and Boston, Massachusetts) and works with 29 homeless shelters. The organization has more than 400 active members and has helped close to 450 individuals find a better road in life. We are expanding to five more cities in 2011, of which four have been chosen -- Indianapolis, Indiana; Dallas, Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Atlanta, Georgia. It's amazing how we forget that as people, we have similar traits, whether we're homeless or not. Maslow's hierarchy of needs explains this best. When we are hungry, our No. 1 priority becomes looking for food. When it's cold outside, we seek shelter. Right above those needs is an innate desire to be recognized, valued, appreciated, loved and cared for. These desires, just like those of food and shelter, do not become less important as we grow older. Think about the reasons why you may have quit a job or a relationship. Chances are feeling unappreciated or undervalued is one of them. The only way for real change to happen in someone's life is for that person to voluntarily participate in making those changes. Many programs try and force people to do things, but when does forcing anyone to do anything ever have long-lasting sustainable results? Take this simple example. Let's say you have a 6-year old who hates vegetables and won't eat them. So, you tell him if he doesn't eat his vegetables that he won't be able to play with his favorite toy. As long as you are there to enforce that rule, your 6-year old may very well eat his vegetables. But what happens when he is at a friend's house and that rule doesn't apply? This method does not solve the problem. You have to figure out a way to get your kid to want to eat his vegetables and that is done by giving the vegetables value in a way that your child can relate to. What if instead you told your child that it is vegetables, not candy or soda, that will make him big and strong like his dad or older brother? Back on My Feet takes this approach to the homeless community. We do not offer food or shelter, which in turn means we don't use threat tactics around those basic human needs. The choice to get up at 5:30 a.m. and come out to run is one that is voluntary. Everyone -- those who are homeless and those who are not -- are there because they want to be. They are there because they have found an environment that offers them respect, value, appreciation and friendship. When you offer that to someone, it is extraordinary what can happen. While Back on My Feet's first priority is to help people discover their potential and capabilities to get them on a road filled with hope, happiness and prosperity, its mission is to also remind us that while there are many differences between us, there are more similarities. By focusing on those similarities, we are reminded that we are all on the same team. I am humbled every day by the people invested in Back on My Feet's mission, and together we have the ability to make real, positive, sustainable change in the world ... one mile at a time. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anne M. Mahlum.","Anne M. Mahlum founded Back on My Feet to help the homeless in Philadelphia .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- At least 63 people were killed and 285 others were wounded in a series of explosions across the capital Tuesday, police said. The blasts included 14 car bombs, two roadside bombs and mortar attacks in at least 17 neighborhoods of the capital, most of them in Shiite neighborhoods, police said. In an earlier report, police said there had been three roadside bombs and a sticky bomb: a device typically placed on a vehicle. Explosions struck the Shiite neighborhoods of Kadhimiya in the northwest; Amil, Bayaa and Shulaa in the southwest; Ur and Zuhour in the northeast; Sadr City, Kamaliya and Amin in the east; and Abu Dhsir in the southern part of the city. Other blasts struck mixed Sunni-Shiite neighborhoods, including Waziriya, Yarmouk, Jihad and Eghraiat. ""We are aware of multiple explosions in the Baghdad area with resultant casualties,"" the U.S. military said in response to a query from CNN. ""At this time, no request for [U.S. Forces - Iraq] support has been made but we are providing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance coverage over some of the explosion sites."" A U.S. military spokesman, Lt. Col. Eric Bloom, said the strikes are typical of al Qaeda in Iraq attacks. During the height of the Iraq war, sectarian violence tore through Baghdad on a daily basis in Sunni and Shiite neighborhoods. Also Tuesday, the Committee to Protect Journalists protested Iraq's move -- carried out Monday -- to close Al-Baghdadiya TV's offices in Baghdad and Basra. The decision came after the Cairo, Egypt-based satellite channel broadcast demands of gunmen who attacked a church in Baghdad on Sunday. The hours-long standoff ended after Iraqi security forces stormed the Sayidat al-Nejat church. In all, 58 people died, and 75 others were wounded; most of the casualties were women and children, the officials added. The Al-Baghdadiya bureau chief in Cairo, Abdelhamid al-Saih, told the journalists group that the shutdown was illegal since there was no judicial order and that he believed authorities were using the broadcast as a pretext to close the offices because the channel had previously given Iraqis the opportunity to criticize the government. ""We are concerned by the closure of Al-Baghdadiya TV and demand that [the government's Communications and Media Commission] explain under what authority it has stormed the station's offices and censored it,"" said Mohamed Abdel Dayem, Middle East and North Africa program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists. ""We call on the authorities to allow the station to resume its operations immediately."" According to the committee, the government commission said in a statement that the attackers had ""contacted the station and selected it to be the exclusive platform for their inhumane practices with the purpose of disrupting Iraq's national unity and to inflame religious discord."" It said, ""the station's broadcast of demands 'amounts to incitement to violence' and that Al-Baghdadia's coverage was not objective, creating a threat to the military operation by providing attackers with information about ongoing operations to rescue the hostages.""

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- President Obama praised ""the father of your nation"" Mahatma Gandhi and noted his influence on Martin Luther King and the non-violent resistance that typified the American civil rights movement in his address to the Indian Parliament Monday. ""I am mindful that I might not be standing before you today, as president of the United States, had it not been for Gandhi and the message he shared and inspired with America and the world,"" the president said. Earlier at a joint news conference with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in India's capital, New Delhi, Obama said the relationship between the United States and India is ""stronger, deeper and broader"" than ever. The opportunities for cooperation between the nations will only grow as India gains economic power, Obama said. ""India isn't emerging. It has emerged,"" the president said. He described a ""growing trust"" between the two largest democracies in the world, as they work to boost trade. ""We make some of the best products in the world and we want to sell them to a growing Indian market,"" Obama said. At the same time, those economic exchanges offer Indians the opportunity to build their businesses as well, he said, citing solar technology as an example for the potential to create jobs in the United States and India. ""We shouldn't be resorting to protectionist measures. We shouldn't be thinking of it as a one-way street,"" added Obama, who said India is not an economic ""bogeyman."" Singh said likewise: ""India is not in the business of stealing jobs from the United States of America."" He called economic ties between the countries a win-win situation, as Obama did. On Saturday, the president unveiled about $10 billion in contracts for U.S. exports to India. It is Asia's third-largest economy and one of the world's few growth markets. Promoting broader trade relations with India is a delicate balancing act for Obama, given American frustration with the outsourcing of jobs to the country. India's biggest challenge is infrastructure, said Singh, who said his country will need $1 trillion in infrastructure investments over the next five years. He expressed hope that United States will contribute toward that. He also lauded American technology, saying that India needs U.S. know-how in the civilian as well as military fields. Obama praised India's military support, saying that it had contributed to the war in Afghanistan and efforts to leave terrorists no haven. The president and first lady Michelle Obama arrived New Delhi on Monday, with the prime minister greeting them on arrival. The Obamas had a full day of events scheduled, starting with a wreath-laying at a memorial for Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi and ending with a state dinner with Indian President Pratibha Devisingh Patil. In between, Obama is slated to address Parliament. The Obamas are on the third and final day of their visit to India. After India, Obama will travel to Indonesia, then to the G-20 meeting in South Korea and APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) summit in Japan. The Obamas are on a 10-day Asian tour.","NEW: Gandhi inspired Martin Luther King, Obama says .

"(CNN)  -- Ethiopian distance running legend Haile Gebrselassie has shocked the world of athletics by announcing his retirement. The 37-year-old dropped out of Sunday's New York City marathon with a knee injury then told reporters he had run his last race. ""I never think about to retire. But for the first time, this is the day,"" he said. ""Let me stop and do other work after this."" Gebrselassie, a two-time Olympic 10,000 meters champion, is the world marathon record holder after setting a time of two hours three minutes 59 seconds in Berlin in 2008.

"(CNN) -- Somali pirates have released two vessels they've held for several months, apparently after ransoms were paid, officials and news agencies reported Saturday. On June 28, pirates hijacked the MV Golden Blessing, with 19 Chinese sailors onboard. They took control of the vessel, which flew under the Singapore flag, about 60 nautical miles off the northern coast of Somalia. The 14,445-ton tanker, carrying a load of glycol ethylene, was released Saturday, according to the European Union Naval Force Somalia (EUNAVFOR). The vessel had been en route from Saudi Arabia to India. EUNAVFOR provided no other details. There were conflicting numbers on the paid ransom, but Andrew Mwangura, programs coordinator of the Kenya-based Seafarers Assistance Programme, said it was less than $7 million. China's transport agency, however, said on its website that the Golden Blessing had been ""rescued."" Meanwhile, a South Korean oil tanker and its 24 crew members seized April 4 also were released Saturday, according to Yonhap, the South Korean state news agency. The pirates said they had been paid $9.5 million, Mwangura said. Somali pirates captured the Samho Dream about 600 nautical miles (690 miles, 1,111 km) north of the Somali coast -- 300 nautical miles (345 miles, 556 km) outside the area in which EUNAVFOR operates. The Combined Maritime Forces -- a cooperative effort by several countries to patrol international waters -- has warned that pirates in the Somali Basin and Gulf of Aden are venturing further from their home waters, ""revealing their desperation to find easier commercial targets."" The 300,000-ton Samho Dream was seized in the Indian Ocean while en route to the United States from Iraq. The ship was carrying five South Korean and 19 Philippine crew members along with about $170 million worth of oil. The freed vessel is now en route to Louisiana, Mwangura said.","Two vessels released by Somali pirates .

"Washington (CNN) -- Senate Democrats conceded Thursday they don't have the votes to pass the DREAM Act, a bill that would have offered a path to citizenship for some illegal immigrants who entered the United States as children. Democrats voted to pull the measure from consideration, a move that jeopardizes the chances for passing the hotly contested bill during the current lame-duck session of Congress that ends in early January. While supporters say the measure that passed the House on Wednesday could still come up, each passing day reduces the likelihood for introducing and debating the act as legislative leaders battle over priorities in the waning days of the session. Senate Republicans opposed the bill, standing by their pledge to block any legislation during the lame-duck session until the chamber approves bills to extend the Bush tax cuts and fund the government. The so-called Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act would have affected immigrants who entered the United States illegally as children under the age of 16 and have lived in the country for at least five years.  Other requirements include graduating from high-school or obtaining a General Education Development diploma and demonstrating ""good moral character."" Even then, only a six-year conditional status would be awarded. Before moving to the next phase, the students would need to meet additional requirements -- attending college or serving in the military for at least two years, and passing criminal background checks. Proponents, including President Barack Obama and Democratic leaders, say the bill offers legal standing to young people brought to the United States who have bettered themselves and served their new country, while opponents claim it is a form of amnesty for illegal immigrants. A White House statement Thursday praised Senate Democratic leaders for pulling the bill so that the chamber can take up the version passed by the House. Noting that eight House Republicans voted with Democrats to pass the measure, the statement by Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said the proposal ""should get bipartisan support in the Senate as well, and in light of the vote in the House, this is the right way to move forward to get that."" Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, a major supporter of the DREAM Act, said Thursday that ""we now have the weekend and into next week to launch a national mobilization to get the votes to enact this important bill.""

"London (CNN) -- Protesters enraged by a Parliament vote to triple university tuition rate caps, attacked a car carrying Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Thursday night. The demonstrators broke a window and tossed paint on the car, however neither royal family member was injured in the attack. 'We can confirm that their Royal Highnesses' car was attacked by protesters on the way to their engagement at the London Palladium this evening,"" a spokesman for the prince said. ""Their Royal Highnesses are unharmed."" A wire photo of the royal couple, dressed in evening wear, shows startled expressions on their faces as they sit in their Rolls-Royce before exiting for a Royal Variety Performance. The high-profile incident came late in day of violent protests that left at least 12 officers and 43 demonstrators hurt. The attack followed a vote in the House of Commons to approve a plan to raise the existing cap on tuition rates charged by universities from £3,000 to £9,000. In U.S. dollars, that's a nearly $10,000 increase -- from roughly $4,700 to $14,000. Lawmakers approved the plan in a 323-302 vote. The measure awaits approval by the House of Lords and a signature by the queen before it can become law. The vote ended hours of debate inside Parliament and an all-day protest by thousands of demonstrators outside who said the plan will price many students out of a university education. Supporters say the tuition cap hike is needed to cut the government's massive deficit. Parliament Square was relatively quiet late Thursday as mounted police pushed back the last knot of protesters. ""Extreme violence currently being directed towards officers is hindering attempts to allow nonviolent protesters to leave the containment area,"" police said. Prime Minister David Cameron said the level of violence was unacceptable. In recent weeks, the proposal has spawned multiple public protests, set off tremors within the nation's coalition government and prompted a back-seat revolt among some Liberal Democrats in Parliament. Liberal Democrats are lesser partners in a coalition government ruled by Conservatives. The London protest started out peacefully Thursday, but grew more tense with the winding down of debate in the House of Commons. By late afternoon, police on horseback attempted to push back throngs of protesters moving on Parliament. Students reacted by throwing sticks and setting off fireworks. After the vote, riot police were called out to quell disturbances in Trafalgar Square, including the setting afire of a Christmas tree. Before the fire was set, a demonstrator was seen climbing the tree. One officer was hospitalized after falling from his horse and another suffered a serious neck injury after being knocked unconscious, the Metropolitan Police said. Four other officers required unspecified hospital treatment. The police service announced the arrest of 26 protesters on charges ranging from arson and assaulting a police officer to drunk and disorderly conduct. London's Metropolitan Police condemned many of the protesters. ""This has nothing to do with peaceful protest. Students are involved in wanton vandalism, including smashing windows in Oxford and Regent Streets,"" the department said late Thursday on its website. ""Innocent Christmas shoppers are being caught up in the violence and disruption. Protest organizers had urged demonstrators to show restraint. Earlier this month, police arrested a total of 153 people following another protest at Trafalgar Square during which students damaged a police van, set small fires and spray painted and smashed government building windows. One final-year student, standing in front of police lines outside Parliamen on Thursday, told CNN he was there out of solidarity with students who may be priced out of a place at university. ""We're all here because we're passionate about this. We feel betrayed,"" he said. Prior to vote, another protester screamed, ""Nick Clegg ... you're a sellout! You have betrayed us!"" The protester was referring to the British deputy prime minister and Liberal Democratic Party architect of the coalition government. The government is headed by Prime Minister David Cameron, a conservative. Clegg supports the tuition increase plan. At least a dozen other party members, including deputy party leader Simon Hughes, said they oppose it. Supporters say the tuition cap hike is needed to help pay down the government's massive debt. They argue the increase is not mandatory, that universities would not be bound to charge university students the full £9,000. Under the new plan, students wouldn't have to start paying off their school loans until they begin earning at least £21,000, about $32,600, a year. Students currently must start paying off their loans once they reach a £15,000 (roughly $23,300) threshold.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama arrives in Mumbai Saturday morning for three days of deal making, cultural engagements and talks on regional and global security. He and Manmohan Singh, the Indian prime minister, have much to discuss. America is the world's most powerful democracy; India is its largest and most vibrant. America needs India to stabilize a rough neighborhood; India needs America to counter China's growing power. America wants to develop a strategic military alliance by arming India with the modern tools of war; New Delhi prefers a more limited transactional relationship with Washington to replace its depleted Soviet-era fleet that avoids making India the operating base of a future conflict. America wants less outsourcing and more trade to create badly needed new jobs at home; India, whose protectionist economic tendencies have given way to a meritocracy driven by entrepreneurial spirit, wants more U.S. visas to train its bright minds and can't understand why American innovation has given way to a defeatist closed-door, anti-immigration mentality. President Obama's electoral defeat in Tuesday's midterm elections assures domestic gridlock for the remainder of his first term in office. Prime Minister Singh's government -- racked by corruption and a bloated bureaucracy -- has shown little interest in executing the reform mandate it was elected to undertake last year. Roads have not been built. Taxes have not been streamlined or collected. Health care is no better. A hallmark nuclear pact reached with Washington in 2005 to make India energy self-sufficient threatens to be derailed five years on by reactionary legislation introduced in Singh's own party. Kashmiri separatists riot in the north. Maoist rebels surge in the east. India, Singh must think to himself at times, is nearly ungovernable. Yet crippled domestic agendas offer both men an opportunity to lead in foreign policy. Obama must strike a grand bargain with Singh that commits both leaders to take steps that create an open-architecture security environment for South Asia. Intelligence needs to be gathered, analyzed and shared communally to combat threats facing the entire region, not just any one country within it, so the landscape for economic revitalization and political reconciliation improves. India, President Obama should tell his hosts, must now assume the responsibilities imposed upon it by its growing political stature and economic power. Pakistan, the epicenter of Islamist extremism, is the obvious place to start. Singh refuses to engage Pakistan beyond superficial matters because he argues, with cause, that whatever is left of his political clout would evaporate if one more Mumbai-style terror attack was launched from Pakistani soil. As Hamas often did during the course of Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, South Asia's terror groups would surely attack at any sign of rapprochement between Islamabad and New Delhi. What are peacemakers to do? Obama must offer to bridge the trust gap that keeps India and Pakistan apart on security, economic and political issues. He should start by asking his military commanders to bring Indian and Pakistani army and intelligence chiefs together in secret at a neutral location (Geneva, Switzerland; Oslo, Norway; or Stockholm, Sweden) so they can reformulate conditions for sharing critical intelligence. The countries' former intelligence chiefs, Chander D. Sahay of India and Gen. Ehsan ul Haq of Pakistan, did just that from 2003 until 2005 with stunningly effective results. Afghan military and intelligence officials could join in after the primary Indo-Pakistani relationship is framed. Through such cooperation, India might find grounds for taking Pakistan into confidence on its operations to stabilize Afghanistan's economy and to assist in rebuilding its domestic police and paramilitary forces, allaying Pakistani army enmity and fears of an east-west squeeze play on their borders by New Delhi. Pakistan could commit, in return, to close down or starve from an operational standpoint camps that support the Haqqani terrorist network in northern Waziristan, from which many who would attack India are trained and ideologically nurtured. India might also get significant, albeit nonpublic, assistance from Pakistan to douse the flames of revolt in Kashmir by encouraging Pakistan-backed separatist leaders to engage with New Delhi in dialogue -- at a minimum, fewer people would then die. Done correctly, such earnest dialogue could form the basis for a long-term peace contract in the Himalayan enclave. Obama could then offer U.S. support for India's permanent seat at the United Nations Security Council if India demonstrated it was ready to play a major regional role as economic big brother to lesser economies, starting with a trade pact for Pakistan. Jobs to employ today's extremists in Pakistan through bilateral trade would reduce tomorrow's pool of would-be bombers who could threaten Indian centers of commerce. To incent Pakistan to open up, Obama could ask his friends in the U.S.-India Caucus to lobby for congressional passage of textile tariff relief for Pakistan that fuels growth in an industry critical to India-Pakistan trade: Indian-Americans helping Pakistani trade get off the ground -- detente indeed. Finally, Obama could lean on his Indian host to invite Pakistan's president over for a summit. Asif Ali Zardari, inept and ineffective as he might seem to outsiders, is perhaps in greater control of Pakistan's political machinery than most give him credit for. And while Pakistan's generals despise what they consider his corrupt ways, Zardari's commercial instincts will serve him well in using trade as a cornerstone for peace with his eastern neighbors. If Singh reaches across the divide and offers a political breakthrough that gives Zardari a face-saving reason to say ""yes"" to peace, he might be surprised at how fast the Pakistani leader accepts the chance to rise above the politics of distrust and dissension and engage in making peace across the array of issues that divide both nations. India must learn, as America did long ago, that with power comes responsibility to take care of those less fortunate around it. In a region where ultra-power (China) and ultra-poverty (Afghanistan) co-exist, India must take advantage of America's experience and its energetic president to bring peace and prosperity to the region in a manner befitting its rising global stature. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mansoor Ijaz.","Obama will visit India with a group of American business executives .

"(CNN) -- The latest release of White House tapes from the Richard Nixon Presidential Library shows how Watergate increasingly consumed Nixon as his second term was getting underway, the library's director said Thursday. Much of Nixon's tapes about Watergate have long been made public, but on Thursday, the library released additional White House recordings from February 1973 to March 1973, plus some from early April 1973, director Timothy Naftali said. The Watergate political scandal, resulting from a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters, eventually led Nixon to resign, the only president to ever do so. ""Watergate is truly heating up for the administration by the end of this particular release of tapes, in March of 1973, and you can see it taking more of the president's time,"" said Naftali, who was a Cold War and presidential historian before joining the National Archives, which runs the Nixon library. ""The tapes are a magnificent aural history of two very busy and important months in the life of President Nixon's second term,"" Naftali added. On Thursday, the library opened a trove of records at the facility and online, and the new information includes 265 hours of White House tapes. The library, in Yorba Linda, California, also released more than 140,000 pages of presidential records and 75 hours of video oral histories. About 2,500 pages of formerly classified national security records have also been made public, and some of them have been posted on the library's website (www.nixonlibrary.gov), including one about covert actions in Chile and another about an understanding with British Prime Minister Edward Heath on the use of British bases and U.S. nuclear weapons. ""I am agreeable to the amendments as proposed and shall consider the understandings existing between our governments with regard to consultation on the use of nuclear weapons, as so amended, to remain fully in effect,"" Nixon said in a letter to Heath. One memo is written January 17, 1973, by current anchor and former Nixon aide Diane Sawyer, who says she understands that a decision is forthcoming on the ""fate"" of Donald Johnson as administrator of Veterans Affairs (now Veterans Administration). Johnson resigned in 1974 under pressure from Congress and veterans' groups for alleged mismanagement. ""Do you have information which would enable us to provide the Star with a leak?"" Sawyer wrote to Larry Higby, assistant chief-of-staff. The memo contains handwritten notes stating ""Approve saying ..."" or ""Disapprove because...."" The newly available materials are pieces to a larger mosaic about the Nixon presidency, Naftali said. ""This release is significant for people interested in how our government thought about the Vietnam cease-fire and its durability, and it's very significant about the release of American POWs from southeast Asia,"" Naftali said. ""It's sort of the first release that has materials relevant to the U.S. government's handling of the Wounded Knee incident,"" when followers of the American Indian Movement seized the South Dakota town for 71 days starting in February 1973, Naftali said. ""And there's very significant material about the management of U.S. policy toward the Middle East,"" Naftali said.","NEW: Some of the 2,500 pages of formerly classified records are now online at the library website .

"(CNN) -- Most Americans probably still believe the biggest threat to our national security is terrorism. We're debating increasingly intrusive security measures, and not long ago we heard about a homegrown terrorist in Oregon who wanted to cause a huge explosion at a Christmas tree-lighting ceremony. Yet Mexican drug cartels are arguably as dangerous and deadly as terrorists, and they were operating far inside our borders well before 9/11. The decision to go into Afghanistan was an easy one to make; or at least it was in 2001.  Shortly after the 9/11 attacks, America learned all about al Qaeda. We were prepared to do whatever it took, spend whatever it cost, and deploy tens of thousands of our soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen to effectively and efficiently do the job. It seems like the job they've been doing is working, to an extent. We haven't experienced a large terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11 and al Qaeda is a shadow of its former self. But do we know for a fact that our presence in Afghanistan is the exact thing that's preventing more terrorist attacks? Maybe, and maybe not. Most people don't want to take chances, and most people would say that terrorism is still the biggest threat to our national security. I beg to differ. Let's switch gears for a minute to the drug war in Mexico, where more than 30,000 people have been killed since President Felipe Calderón came into office and the annual body count goes up every December. Granted, most of the people being tortured, kidnapped or killed have historically been criminals involved in the drug trade. However, that's changing. We're seeing more and more innocent bystanders, including children, being gunned down as collateral damage. The big concern, of course, is whether the violence is going to spill over into the United States. But there are two real problems with this debate. First, no standardized definition exists as to what constitutes border violence spillover. It really is in the eye of the beholder, which means that if you ask a Texas city mayor and an Arizona rural border county sheriff whether they're seeing it, you're likely going to get two very different answers. The second problem is that we're too focused on spillover in the border area to realize that Mexican drug cartels have deeply infiltrated every corner of the United States, and they did so well before terrorism and religious extremists entered our national consciousness. According to the U.S. Department of Justice's National Drug Intelligence Center, members of Mexican cartels are operating in more than 270 U.S. cities and thousands of smaller communities. Those same cartels dominate drug trafficking operations in places like Los Angeles, Phoenix, Houston, Chicago, Detroit, Denver, Atlanta and Newark, New Jersey. Violent gangs across the country act as their proxies and sell Mexican drugs like marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, brown powder and black tar heroin, and Colombian cocaine in our cities and neighborhoods from San Diego to Syracuse, New York. So why don't we hear more in the media about the activities of Mexican cartels on U.S. soil? Mostly because cartels like to keep a low profile and blend in. Drawing attention to cartel operations in the United States is very bad for business and our law enforcement officers can generally be depended on to do their jobs. A big shootout in a San Diego shopping district or downtown Houston between dozens of heavily armed cartel gunmen and the U.S. Army isn't going to happen any time soon. But that doesn't mean drug-related violence isn't happening in the United States, and sometimes well away from the border. In 2009, five mutilated bodies were found outside a drug stash house in a well-to-do northern Alabama county. Dozens of law enforcement officers have been shot at and many severely injured by heavily armed men who work for Mexican cartels defending marijuana crops in states like Oregon, Tennessee and North Carolina. Closer to the border, last year, gang members from ""Los Palillos"" were indicted in the kidnapping, torture and murder of nine people in San Diego County. Two of those victims were dissolved in vats of acid after they were killed. This is the real and current major threat to our national security -- tens of thousands of violent Mexican cartel members who are living and operating under our noses in our cities, communities and public lands. We've spent more than $365 billion on the war in Afghanistan since 2001, and about 1,400 military members have lost their lives in the process. We've committed only $1.6 billion to the drug war in Mexico -- only a few hundred million of which has actually been spent since 2007 -- and our military isn't allowed to step one foot in-country unless it's for training purposes. In a time when our national deficit is skyrocketing and the collective belt is tightening, we need to take a good look at our priorities when it comes to national security. So can our commitments to Afghanistan and Mexico be compared? Maybe, maybe not. We know the number of innocent Americans who died as a result of terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. But we also have a rough idea of how many Americans die every year as a result of using drugs being peddled by Mexican cartels operating in our country. I can assure you that the number of American drug casualties is much higher. We also need to take into account the cost of interdicting even a small percentage of those drugs at the border, as well as the environmental toll that domestic marijuana cultivation is taking on our nation's landscape. Afghanistan and Mexico can't be compared in the ways we're fighting those wars, but they certainly can in the ways our government chooses to assess and protect us from the threats they pose. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sylvia Longmire.","Sylvia Longmire: Huge number of Mexican drug cartel members in U.S. since well before 9/11 .
We fight in Afghanistan, she writes, but should fight deadly and dangerous cartels at home .

"(CNN) -- Virginia police detectives talked Sunday for the first time with a 12-year-old Virginia girl and the man who allegedly kidnapped her and has been deemed a prime suspect in her mother's death. Roanoke County police Detective John McPhail said that Sunday morning he and three colleagues discussed the death of 41-year-old Tina Smith with Jeffrey Scott Easley, currently in police custody in San Francisco, California, on warrants for abduction, credit card theft and credit card fraud. While police are investigating Tina Smith's death as a homicide, they have not said how she died. They also talked with Brittany Mae Smith, Tina's daughter, who police had been searching for since Monday. McPhail said the girl ""will be heading back to Roanoke soon,"" but did not disclose when exactly that might happen. McPhail addressed reporters in front of San Francisco's Hall of Justice at 2 p.m. (5 p.m. ET) Sunday, a day after he and his three fellow detectives arrived in California from Virginia. All four have been assigned a particular aspect of a case that involves both the abduction of Brittany Smith and the death of her mother. He did not disclose what police talked about with Easley or Brittany Smith, saying that the investigation was still ongoing. Roanoke County Police Chief Ray Lavinder said Saturday that Easley is a ""very good suspect"" in the death of Tina Smith -- his girlfriend and Brittany's mother -- who was found dead inside her Salem, Virginia, home last Monday. Police believe that Tina Smith was killed sometime between the morning and evening of December 3, Lavinder has said. On that same day, surveillance video shows Easley and Brittany Smith shopping for a blue, domed tent at a Walmart in Salem. Lavinder said that authorities believe the two left Virginia, heading west toward California, on that night or early Saturday, December 4. They traveled more than 2,300 miles in Tina Smith's silver 2005 Dodge Neon four-door sedan, later located in a parking lot adjacent to San Francisco International Airport after authorities had found Brittany Smith and Easley. A tipster in a Safeway supermarket in San Francisco spotted the pair after seeing their images earlier on CNN, said San Francisco Police Officer Albie Esparza. The two had been holding up a cardboard sign and asking for money, Lavinder said. On Sunday, McPhail said that he and the other Virginia detectives visited the supermarket, as well as the area within walking distance where the tent had been found and Easley and Brittany Smith had been staying. Esparza said Brittany was turned over to California's Child Protective Services division after she was found. She has no visible injuries and has been in touch with family members, according to Lavinder. Easley did not resist arrest, he added. The chief has said Easley met Tina Smith online this summer, then moved into the family home in October. Police issued an Amber Alert for Brittany on Monday after finding the body of her mother. Tina Smith's co-workers had called to express concern that she hadn't shown up for work. Authorities in Florida and Alabama followed suit with Amber Alerts in subsequent days, and notices went out to law enforcement nationwide. Authorities said they do not know if the girl went west willingly with Easley. Regardless, with Brittany Smith safely located, Virginia authorities say they have now turned their focus to the homicide investigation. They are also trying to get Easley back east, though an extradition hearing hasn't taken take place in California courts. He could go to Virginia relatively soon if he waives extradition, or the process may be delayed weeks if he contests his return.","Virginia police meet with Jeffrey Easley and the girl he allegedly abducted .

"(CNN) -- A Qantas passenger jet landed safely in Singapore on Friday after turning back due to engine problems shortly after takeoff, Australian Transport Safety Bureau spokesman Neville Blyth told CNN. ""I saw flames five minutes into flight and we could see flames through the left-side window,"" said passenger Terence Sim. It is the second Qantas jet in two days to return to Singapore as a result of engine trouble. In Friday's incident, the Boeing 747-400 was carrying 412 passengers and 19 crew members and was headed to Sydney, Australia, according to a Qantas spokesman, who would not provide his name, citing company policy. On Thursday, a Qantas Airbus A380 jet made an emergency landing at Changi Airport after one of its four engines shut down as it started a flight to Sydney.  As the plane headed back to the airport, part of the engine's covering, or cowling, tore off. Airbus announced Friday that it asked all operators of A380s with Rolls-Royce engines to inspect them as a precaution. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau says it has deployed investigators to examine the cause of Thursday's engine failure on the Airbus A380 and is currently gathering more information regarding Friday's incident. None of the passengers aboard the Boeing 747-400 also had been aboard the Airbus A380, according to the Qantas spokesman.","NEW: Passenger says he saw flames outside the jet's left-side window .

"(CNN) -- Arsenal have secured their passage to the knockout stages of the Champions League with a 3-1 win over Partizan Belgrade in Group H. Theo Walcott came off the bench to score a crucial second-half goal for the Gunners as they made sure of second place in the group. Arsene Wenger's team dominated possession for much of the match but their finishing lacked precision against a poor Partizan side. Robin Van Persie opened the scoring for the home side after half-an-hour smashing home a penalty kick after he had been brought down by Jovanovic. Samir Nasri should have doubled their lead two minutes into the second half after the ball broke to him in space in the penalty area, but he fired high over the bar. Arsenal were made to pay for the French midfielder's profligacy four minutes later when Cleo scored for the visitors when his deflected shot beat keeper Fabianski. Wenger responded by sending on Theo Walcott who then delivered the vital second goal, taking advantage of some sloppy Partizan defending to volley home from six yards in the 73rd minute. Nasri made up for his earlier miss three minutes later, driving the ball low past Stojkovic after some neat work from Alex Song. The only disappointment for Arsenal was Bacary Sagna's red card -- for a foul on Aleksandar Lazevski -- with four minutes remaining. Second half goals from Razvan Rat and Adriano ensured Shakhtar Donetsk claimed top spot in the group as they beat Braga 2-0 at home. The Ukrainian champions finished with 15 points. Arsenal has to settle for second place with 12 points. In Group E, Bayern Munich finished top of the table with 15 points after a comfortable 3-0 home win over Basel. The Swiss side's hopes of progressing to the knockout stages were ended by two quick goals by Bayern in the first period. Franck Ribery opened the scoring after 35 minutes with Anatoliy Tymoschuk doubling the lead two minutes later. The French star made it 3-0 five minutes after the break when he side-footed home after Thomas Muller's low cross from the right. Roma, who only required a point to secure second spot behind Bayern, were on course to grab all three until their hosts CFR Cluj scored a late equalizer. The Serie A side took the lead after 21 minutes as the Romanian side gifted them possession in their own half. Fabio Simplicio then sent through Marco Borriello who slotted the ball past Eduard Stancioiu in goal. But Lacina Traore equalized for the home side with only two minutes of normal time remaining. But the point couldn't stop Cluj finishing bottom of the group with only four points from their six games. Chelsea's slump in form continued as they lost 1-0 to Marseille at the Stade Velodrome, but still topped Group F with 15 points. Marseille, who had already secured second place, scored a late winner as Brandao turned the ball past Petr Cech in the 81st minute. Spartak Moscow beat their hosts MSK Zilina 2-1 to finish the group stage in third place with nine points. Slovakian champions Zilina took the lead in the 48th minute with a goal from Tomas Majtan, but Spartak struck back six minutes later as Alex struck home confidently, while Ibson made sure of three points in the 61st minute. Meanwhile in Group G, Real Madrid hammered Auxerre 4-0 as Karim Benzema scored a hat-trick. The Frenchman striker opened the scoring after 12 minutes heading home a Cristiano Ronaldo cross. Ronaldo then made it 2-0 shortly after halftime smashing the ball into the roof of the net after latching onto a pass from Marcelo. Benzema bagged his second in the 72nd minute firing low past Olivier Sorin and claimed a third two minutes before time. The win means Madrid finish on top of the group with 16 points, while AC Milan were second with eight points. In the other match in Group G, caretaker manager Frank de Boer registered his first win for Ajax as they overcame AC Milan in the San Siro. Jol quits Ajax amid Newcastle rumors . The visitors were unlucky not to be ahead at half time as the Serie A leaders failed to find any rhythm. But Ajax made the breakthrough 12 minutes into the second half thanks to a goal from Demy De Zeeuw.

"(CNN) -- Protection from the Sahara's howling dust storms may have helped the Sphinx maintain its steady gaze over the millennia. Newly discovered walls on the Giza plateau were part of an enclosure to protect the Sphinx from wind-borne sand, Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities says. According to some texts, the walls were built by King Thutmose IV (1400-1390 BCE) because of a dream he had during a hunting trip, the council's secretary general, Zahi Hawass, said Tuesday. ""In the king's dream the Sphinx asked the king to move the sand away from his body because it choked him,"" Hawass said in a written statement. For the favor, the Sphinx promised to make Thutmose IV king of Egypt. Until the discovery of sections of the walls buried in the sand on the eastern and southern side of the giant figure, archaeologists believed there was a wall only on its north side. The new sections are part of a larger wall, Hawass said. One wall runs north-south and is 282 feet (86 meters) long, while the other runs east-west and is 151 feet (46 meters) long. Both walls stand about 3 feet (1 meter) tall. Researchers also may have found the remains of a wall dating to the time of King Khafre, whose pyramid is the second largest in Giza. Khafre's burial complex boasted an unprecedented profusion of statues, among them the Sphinx, according to National Geographic. Carved from bedrock in front of Khafre's pyramid, the Sphinx depicts the pharaoh as a human-headed lion, wearing the headdress of the pharaohs.","Walls are found along two more sides of the Sphinx .

"London (CNN) -- A British businessman who is accused of having his wife killed during their honeymoon in South Africa will be allowed to leave jail on bail, a judge decided Friday. Shrien Dewani is accused of hiring a crew of hitmen to kill his wife during a taxi ride in Cape Town, South Africa in November. British Judge Duncan Ousely rejected concerns from the South African government that Dewani would use his funds and international connections to flee before an extradition hearing. Ben Watson, a lawyer for the South African government, cited hotel surveillance video that he said showed Dewani twice meeting with a cab driver as the sort of evidence indicating Dewani's involvement in a plot against his wife. But Ousely ruled that Dewani, who did not attend the hearing, had a genuine interest in clearing his name and said he has cooperated with investigators from both England and South Africa. Dewali's solicitor, Andrew Katzen, said he was ""delighted"" with the outcome but declined further comment following the court hearing. Dewani, who is jailed in London's Wandsworth Prison, will be allowed to stay at his parents' home. He will be required to report to a police station in Bristol every morning. A court hearing has been temporarily scheduled for Jan. 20, but it is unclear when South Africa will submit a formal extradition request. Dewani's lawyers say he is innocent and will fight extradition. Dewani's wife, Anni Dewani, died in an apparent carjacking as the couple took a taxi ride in a crime-ridden neighborhood of Cape Town. Dewani was allowed to leave South Africa, but this week prosecutors there accused him of hiring a crew of hitmen to kill his wife. ""The alleged hijacking was in fact not a hijacking, but part of a plan of subterfuge which Shrien Dewani, the husband of the deceased and the accused, had designed to conceal the true facts ... that the deceased was murdered at the instance of the husband,"" South African prosecutors wrote in court documents. In the documents, prosecutors detail meetings that Dewani had with the taxicab driver where where he allegedly paid the driver 15,000 South African rand ($2,170) to have a crew of hitmen kill his wife and make it look like a carjacking. The court documents do not say why Dewani allegedly wanted his wife dead. The driver, Zola Tongo, was sentenced to 18 years in prison in South Africa after admitting to taking part in the killing.

"(CNN) -- A judge could decide next week whether some or all of the details in search warrants related to the death of a 10-year-old disabled North Carolina girl will be made public. Police found some of Zahra Baker's remains on November 11, just over a month after her stepmother Elisa Baker reported her missing. While Elisa has been charged with obstruction of justice -- for writing a fake ransom note and leaving it at the family's Hickory home -- no one has been charged directly in her death. Meanwhile, the investigation has continued, with detectives requesting numerous warrants related to the case. They asked for an additional 15 sealed warrants on Wednesday in Catawba County court, on top of the many they requested previously. A motions hearing is scheduled for Monday, December 13, to determine if details of any, some or all of the sealed warrants will be released. Some of the search warrants obtained by the Hickory, North Carolina, police were made public earlier this month, giving a glimpse into the grisly events that could have led to the death of the freckled-face girl, who lost part of her left leg at age 5 to cancer. According to one of the search warrants, a tipster told police that Zahra had been at a North Carolina home with two men and one of the men said ""he had done something very bad and needed to leave town."" One of the men was associated with Zahra's stepmother but was not Zahra's father, the tipster said. The tipster also told police that Zahra had been raped by both men and that she had blood on her private area and legs, the search warrant said. The tipster told police that he got the information about the alleged rape from a friend who was told about it from his sister. Police went to the home to see if they could confirm the fourth-hand information and found a mattress at the side of the house that ""had a large dark stain in the middle,"" the search warrant said. The tipster said the men did not admit to killing the girl but did say that they ""might have hit her in the head,"" the search warrant said. Police were also told by an attorney for Elisa Baker that the girl was dismembered. In one search warrant, dated October 27, police say they were looking for ""latex gloves used while the body of Zahra Baker was dismembered."" They also were searching for ""white trash bags used to store body parts,"" the warrant said. In that warrant, police were seeking to search the Hickory home that Zahra lived in with her stepmother and father Adam Troy Baker. Besides the obstruction of justice charge, Elisa Baker is accused of writing worthless checks. Police have said she had been cooperating with investigators, including going with them to a search site. Adam Troy Baker was arrested in late October in nearby Catawba County on eight charges: five counts of writing bad checks and three counts of failing to appear in court. Authorities said the charges were unrelated to Zahra's disappearance, and he was later released on bail. InSession's Jessica Thill contributed to this report.","A key hearing related to the investigation of Zahra Baker, 10, will happen Monday .

"(CNN) -- Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher is ""flawed,"" according to ex-Formula One star Stirling Moss, who claimed the German will not be in the hunt for motor racing's biggest prize in 2011. Schumacher returned to F1 this year with the new Mercedes team, having retired in late 2006, but the 41-year-old struggled to make an impact as he finished the season in a disappointing ninth place. Moss, 81, wrote off Schumacher's chances of winning an eighth world title, and stated the former Ferrari racer's previous triumphs devalued the achievement of becoming world champion. ""He's flawed, we've seen that all over the place,"" Moss told reporters at the British Racing Drivers' Club's (BRDC) annual awards. ""The fact he is carrying on next year is interesting, although quite frankly, I wouldn't be worried if I was up against him, The fact he was a seven-time world champion ruins what being a world champion is all about."" The BRDC vice-president, who never won the drivers' championship in his 10-year racing career as he finished runner-up four times in a row, also cast aspersions on Schumacher's success. ""We've never seen him at his best when he had a really good driver alongside him. We've never seen him with a driver of similar talent,"" the Englishman said. Schumacher has expressed his determination to improve next season, and said the whole Mercedes team is focused on winning in 2011. ""There is really only one goal, and that's winning,"" the former Benetton driver told Swiss newspaper Blick. ""We are extremely motivated to come into a position to be able to win, that is the basic requirement [for next season]. I said already at the start [of 2010] that I don't want to drive around in the midfield.""","BRDC vice-president Stirling Moss has criticized Michael Schumacher as ""flawed""

"(CNN) -- An Antarctic cruise ship was under way again Wednesday after spending a day slowed by electrical malfunctions in rough weather and crashing cold waves, the organization that promotes the southernmost cruises said. The MV Clelia II was making its way northbound back to Argentina Tuesday when a large wave crashed over the 290-foot ship, ""breaking the starboard bridge window and dousing some electrical circuitry,"" the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators said. ""This caused a temporary loss of communications and affected engine performance,"" the organization said. ""Both engines remained operational and speed was reduced."" No passengers were injured, but a member of the crew suffered minor injuries, the group said. Another Antarctic cruise ship, the National Geographic Explorer, stayed with the Clelia II while repairs were made, and the ship resumed its journey across the Drake Passage when the repairs were complete. The association said all 88 of the Clelia's passengers were Americans and that most of the ship's 77 crew members were Filipinos. The Clelia II is expected to join with an Argentine channel pilot Thursday evening and arrive in Ushuaia, Argentina, early Friday.","The Clelia II is returning on its own power to Argentina .

"Raleigh, North Carolina (CNN) -- More than 1,200 mourners, including hundreds who loved and admired Elizabeth Edwards from a distance, packed a Raleigh church Saturday to pay respects to the activist and estranged wife of a failed aspirant to the presidency. Elizabeth Edwards died Tuesday at the end of a six-year battle with cancer. She was 61. ""She has been a lighthouse to all of us. She's always been that source of light to us. Every lesson she has taught us has become part of our ethic,"" said Edwards' oldest daughter, Cate, in a eulogy to her mother. Among those lessons, Cate Edwards jokingly said, was ""you'll always regret prints, you'll never regret solids."" Cate Edwards read from a letter her mother wrote her children in anticipation of death. She said her mother was always more concerned about others than she was herself, and had even tried to cheer up friends and family about her cancer fight and impending death. Mourners included Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry, who in 2004 picked Edwards' husband, John, to be his vice presidential running mate in an unsuccessful bid for the White House. John and Elizabeth Edwards separated earlier this year after the former North Carolina senator admitted to fathering a child out of wedlock while the couple was married. John Edwards entered the church Saturday, holding hands with Cate, and the Edwards' two other children, Jack and Emma. Cate Edwards was preceded at the lectern by her mother's longtime friend Hargrave McElroy, who made the audience laugh with tales of Elizabeth's competitive nature, particularly with games. She also noted Edwards' love of Christmas, describing how the Edwards family, including John Edwards, decorated their Christmas tree last Saturday, just three days before she died. A friend of Edwards' family said Saturday that Elizabeth Edwards did not plan the funeral or instruct on many details. One family friend said the mood has been somber: ""We all thought we'd have more time to say goodbye."" In addition to the eulogies by McElroy and Cate Edwards, another friend, Glenn Bergenfield spoke, remembering when Elizabeth Edwards told staffers about her cancer. According to Bergenfield, she rubbed their backs as they sat on the couch, then turned to them and told them they had on awful shoes, and outlet shopping was necessary, right then and there. Others in attendance included North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue; U.S. Sen. Kay Hagan (D-North Carolina); Vicki Kennedy, the wife of the late Sen. Ted Kennedy; John Podesta, a former Clinton administration chief of staff and current head of the Center for American Progress; members of North Carolina's congressional delegation; and more than 100 former campaign staffers. It was a public ceremony because Edwards was known for insisting, much to the dismay of staffers, that all of her events be open to the public, according to a friend. Edwards did not plan the funeral or instruct many details, so the family decided a public funeral was what she would have wanted, even it added some chaos to the ceremony. The ""public"" mourners included several hundred people who packed a balcony inside the church, as well another 150 supporters who gathered a few blocks away from the church for a counter-demonstration against a group of picketers from the controversial Westboro Baptist Church. The Kansas-based congregation is known for its extremist opposition against homosexuals, Jews and other groups and regularly holds protests at funerals for fallen U.S. service members, saying the war's dead are God's punishment for the country tolerating gays and lesbians. In the end, only five Westboro congregants showed for the protest, which took place in a cold, steady rain. Following the service at Edenton Street United Methodist Church, Edwards was to be buried at Raleigh's Historic Oakwood Cemetery, according to the cemetery's office manager Sharon Freed. That ceremony was private, according to a memorial website for Edwards. Earlier this week, Freed told CNN about the proximity of the burial to Edwards' son Wade, who was buried at the cemetery after dying in a 1996 car crash. ""He is already interred there in a space. And she will be interred there beside him,"" Freed said. Four of Elizabeth Edwards' pallbearers were childhood friends of her son. They include Tyler Highsmith, Michael Lewis, Charles Scarantino and Ellis Roberts, who was an aide to John Edwards when he was in the U.S. Senate. Other pallbearers include longtime friend Bill Spiegel, B.A. Farrell, an Edwards confidant and adviser, and her hospice doctor, Michael Chernier. Trevor Upham, Cate Edwards' fiance is also a pallbearer. Edwards, who had four children and had worked as a bankruptcy lawyer in Raleigh, was diagnosed with breast cancer shortly after her husband lost his bid for vice president in November 2004. In 2006, after her initial cancer diagnosis, she wrote ""Saving Graces: Finding Solace and Strength from Friends and Strangers,"" which chronicled the aftermath of her son's death and her battle with the disease. In 2008, months after withdrawing from the presidential race, John Edwards admitted that tabloid claims about an extramarital affair with former campaign videographer Rielle Hunter were true. Eventually, he also admitted to fathering a child with Hunter -- an allegation he initially vociferously denied even after conceding the affair. John Edwards said the affair happened in 2006 while his wife's cancer was in remission. He claimed he informed his wife at the time and asked for her forgiveness. In an interview with the Detroit Free Press after her husband admitted to his affair, Elizabeth Edwards said the incident helped her focus on resuming her role as an advocate for the poor and for health care reform. She also said it pushed her to refocus on her role as a mother. In a September interview on ""The Nate Berkus Show,"" Edwards was asked what she sees when she looks at her estranged husband, John Edwards. ""I see the father of my children, and that's very important to me,"" she said. ""Particularly since I have a terminal disease, this is the person who at some point will take over the primary parenting, and it's important to me that he heal, if he needs to."" The memorial website for Edwards states, ""In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Wade Edwards Foundation, which benefits the Wade Edwards Learning Lab."" According to the site, the learning lab is a computer and learning center in Raleigh that provides services free of charge. CNN's Jessica Yellin, Martin Savidge, Bill Mears, John King, Shannon Travis, Sarah Baker and Raelyn Johnson contributed to this report.","Edwards eulogized by her daughter, friends .

"(CNN)  -- Kim Clijsters beat the returning Justine Henin in a special exhibition match in their native Belgium Thursday. The pair were playing in the Diamond Games in Antwerp with Henin testing herself after being out since mid-season with an elbow ligament injury. Her last competitive match was her fourth round loss to Clijsters at Wimbledon in June. Clijsters, fresh from retaining her U.S. Open crown then rounding off her season by claiming the WTA Championships in Doha, proved too sharp for Henin. She won the first set 6-1 in just 25 minutes, but Henin recovered from falling an early break down to win the second 6-3 to level. That set in train a super tiebreaker, with the first player to 10 points winning the match and it was Clijsters who pulled ahead. She set up four match points at 9-5 and closed it out at the first attempt. The pair will now stop up their preparations for the opening grand slam of 2011 in Australia with Henin taking part in next month's Hopman Cup in Perth. Before their match, both players hinted that they may pair up to play doubles for Belgium at the 2012 Olympics in London. ""2012 is still far away and we have not seen each other since July,"" Clijsters told the official tournament website. ""But we will certainly talk about it."" Meanwhile, Andy Roddick has confirmed he will turn out for the United States Davis Cup team next year after being unavailable in 2010. New U.S. captain Jim Courier will field Roddick in their opening World Group first round tie in Chile on March 4-6. ""I'm very excited to be back,"" said Roddick who helped the U.S. to win the Davis Cup in 2007 and has a 31-11 record in the competition. ""Having Andy commit to the 2011 campaign is huge for our team,"" Courier said.","Kim Clijsters beats Justine Henin in special exhibition match in Belgium .

"(CNN) -- Australian Formula One driver Mark Webber has aimed a verbal attack at his own Red Bull team, saying they are giving more support to teammate Sebastian Vettel as the pair both scrap for the 2010 world title. Webber has led the world championship for large parts of the season, although he now sits in second and trails leader Fernando Alonso by 11 points with just two races of the season remaining. The 23-year-old Vettel is also among a group of five drivers who are still in the race to claim the sport's biggest prize. The German is in fourth place, 14 points behind Webber and 25 behind Alonso. However, 34-year-old Webber believes his world championship challenge has been ""inconvenient"" for his team, who are bidding to win both their first constructor's and driver's championships. Is Ferrari's Fernando the fastest on the grid? ""I think I wasn't supposed to be in the hunt at all, so it's been maybe quite inconvenient, but I've enjoyed every minute of it,"" Webber told a news conference. Webber was in a frank mood, and pulled no punches when asked whether he believed his team gave the 23-year-old more support. ""It's f****** obvious, isn't it? Of course,"" he said. ""When young, new charges come on to the block that's where the emotion is. That's the way it is. ""I have had a great opportunity with a great car to do some great things this year. I've got favorites in life. Favorite people I like to be with. That is human nature."" Webber is also not expecting support from his teammate in pursuit of his first driver's championship. ""If it hasn't happened by now, it's never going to happen. Nothing has changed between Seb and I over the last five or six races. The only thing different is that Fernando is leading."" ""Obviously Seb has never led this year and I have. We'll see on the Monday after Abu Dhabi if we have taken the right approach."" The relationship between the pair has been under scrutiny all season, with the issue coming to a head after they crashed when Vettel tried to pass Webber at this season's Turkish Grand Prix. Both will line up on the grid for the Brazilian Grand Prix, which takes place on Sunday at the Interlagos circuit in Sao Paulo.","Mark Webber believes his Red Bull team favor his teammate Sebastian Vettel .

"Beijing (CNN) -- A day before the Nobel committee honors an imprisoned Chinese dissident with its peace prize, China ratched up the rhetoric calling the award ""an interference"" in its internal affairs. ""The Nobel committee has to admit they are in the minority,"" said Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu on Thursday. ""The Chinese people and the overwhelming majority of people in the world are against this."" ""This is not an issue of human rights; it is an issue of interference of internal affairs,"" she said. China has responded furiously since the Nobel committee announced its Peace Prize winner on October 8. Officials have repeatedly called Liu Xiaobo -- currently serving an 11-year sentence for ""inciting subversion"" -- a common criminal and the award a Western plot against China. ""Liu Xiaobo broke Article 105, a crime of instigating the subversion of state power,"" Jiang said Thursday. ""He went beyond general criticism of the state."" ""Developing country to country relations should follow certain principles,"" she added. ""I think the Norwegian government should give careful thought to this."" Meanwhile, several foreign news websites -- including CNN and BBC -- appeared to be blocked in mainland China Thursday. Also, Amnesty International said it had received report that Chinese diplomats in Norway have been pressuring Chinese residents into joining anti-Nobel demonstrations when the award ceremony is held Friday. However, the human rights group did not say how it learned of this, only offering that it has been ""informed by reliable sources."" Several nations have indicated they will not attend the ceremony in Norway. The Nobel committee, which said it had sent out 65 invitations to embassies in Oslo, counted 19 countries that had declined so far -- including China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iraq and Iran. It is unclear, officially, how China's stance has affected nations who have said they are not attending the award ceremony. But some have speculated that some nations are not attending the ceremony in an effort not to offend China or complicate business relationships it has with Beijing. Russian officials have said they are not going to attend the ceremony because its ambassador has a previous commitment. An official from the United Nations said the U.N. is not going to attend the ceremony, but said that is not unusual. The U.N. was not formally invited and usually does not attend the ceremony unless someone from the organization wins the award, the official said. Despite the Nobel committee's announcement that Iraq will not show up at the ceremony, an official said that might not be true. Labeed Abawi, Iraq's deputy foreign affairs minister, said officials had not yet decided if they would attend the ceremony. -- CNN's Jo Kent, Richard Roth, Jomana Karadesh, Matthew Chance and Steven Jiang contributed to this report .","China has responded furiously since the peace prize was announced .

"(CNN) -- A woman convicted of murder and adultery and sentenced to die by stoning confesses to her part in the plot to kill her husband on an Iranian television program aired Friday night. But the family of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani has steadfastly denied that she played any role in her husband's death -- and a human rights organization that is trying to help Ashtiani called the program ""a theatrical melodrama."" ""There was a complete disregard for due process, bringing her out and making her a part of this theatrical melodrama is an attempt to try to convince the international public opinion that she is guilty,"" said Hadi Ghaemi, director of International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. Iran has drawn sharp criticism from the international community after Ashtiani's 2010 sentence to death by stoning. Officials ranging from Pope Benedict XVI to the European Union's top foreign policy official, Catherine Ashton, urged Iran not to carry out the sentence. ""Since the international outcry, the Iranian government is tap-dancing, trying to justify executing her,"" said Ghaemi. Press TV, Iran's government-backed English language station, aired the half-hour special on ""Iran Today."" The program included interviews with -- among others -- Ashtiani and her son. The program brought Ashtiani back to her home in Osku ""to produce a visual account"" of the death of her husband ""at the crime scene."" ""This is highly unusual because according to Iranian authorities this is a woman who is in prison convicted of adultery and murder and now she has apparently been plucked out of her jail cell and featured in this documentary,"" said CNN's Reza Sayah . ""This was a program designed to promote the government's position,"" said Sayah. This is not the first time Ashtiani has been brought out in front of cameras for an alleged confession. The program also condemns the public campaign to free her. ""It was a very disturbing piece, it was the Iranian government turning a judicial case into a public relations case,"" said Ghaemi. Press TV's release of still photographs of Ashtiani and her son from the interview, which took place on Sunday, fueled some speculation that they had been released, but there was no evidence or confirmation to support that conjecture. Ashtiani was convicted of adultery in 2006. She also received a 10 year prison sentence for her alleged cooperation in the plot to kill her husband. ""The key point here is not just about Ashtiani, but about abolishing stoning in Iran. That is what the Iranian government is trying to diverge attention from. They don't want to talk about abolishing stoning or Iran's human rights record,"" said Ghaemi. Two German journalists who interviewed Ashtiani were arrested in October and charged with espionage. Ashtiani's son and lawyer also were arrested, but it was not clear on what charges.","Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani confesses to her part in the death of her husband .

"(CNN) -- Auburn quarterback Cam Newton won the 2010 Heisman Trophy on Saturday night, his on-field heroics enough to overcome off-the-field questions about his role in a purported pay-for-play scheme. Newton bested a field that included Oregon running back LaMichael James, Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck, and Boise State quarterback Kellen Moore. The award, given in New York City, is voted on by hundreds of media members and past winners. The junior from College Park, Georgia, leads Auburn, the nation's top-ranked team. The Tigers will play likewise undefeated Oregon on Jan. 10 in the Bowl Championship Series title game for what amounts to a national championship. Newton has thrown for 28 touchdowns and run for another 20 scores this season, helping the Tigers win the Southeastern Conference Championship. His performance came despite his being dogged all fall by allegations that his services were being shopped around before he landed at Auburn. On November 30, the NCAA cleared him to play -- one day after Auburn declared him ineligible because the interscholastic sports body had determined there had been a violation of amateurism rules. The NCAA changed course, it said, after concluding that Newton wasn't aware that his father, the Rev. Cecil Newton, and an unnamed owner of a scouting service tried to market the star quarterback ""as a part of a pay-for-play scenario in return for Newton's commitment to attend college and play football."" It has been widely reported that the school involved in the attempt was Mississippi State. The NCAA said that, given the information it had at the time, it did ""not have sufficient evidence that Cam Newton or anyone from Auburn was aware of this activity."" Auburn did limit Newton's father's access to its athletic program and Mississippi State has cut off relations with the other person, the NCAA said. The Rev. Newton did not attend Saturday's Heisman presentation, though Cam's mother, Jackie Newton, was in the audience.","Auburn's Cam Newton wins the Heisman Trophy as college football's best player .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea conducted its largest-ever nationwide civil defense drill Wednesday afternoon to prepare the public for a potential military attack from North Korea after Pyongyang shelled a South Korean island less than a month ago. ""After the bombing, we believed it was important for the public to know where to take shelter since the South is within five-minute-distance from a North Korean air raid,"" Kim Kwang-hee, the director of civil defense said. The drill involved 12 fighter jets which flew over the airs of Seoul and the country to mock an enemy air drill. More than 250,000 public workers helped civilians take shelter in underground facilities and subway stations, according to the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA). Traffic was stopped all across the country, and students were escorted out of school buildings into underground locations. Office workers were asked to move into basement parking lots for cover. Civil defense drills take place on a regular basis and in the past have been ignored by many. However, the threat of war is felt at a greater degree after North Korea shelled the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong in November which resulted in the death of four people. ""We actually don't participate very well, because nothing happened between North Korea and South Korea. But recently it has happened, so it's very serious for us to think about these kinds of events,"" said Chung Woo-sub, a university student. South Korea plans on boosting its underground shelter facilities along the border regions and in the island areas in the Yellow Sea where the island attack occurred, according to NEMA. Also the Defense Ministry announced Wednesday that it has nominated Gen. Kim Sang-ki, commander of the Third Army, for the newly vacated post of South Korea's Army chief, Yonhap news agency reported.

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A firefighter who was trapped in a fast-moving forest fire in eastern Spain Tuesday and hospitalized with severe burns, died Friday near Barcelona, the Catalan regional government said on its Web site. Spain is plagued by forest fires every summer, when dry weather sets in along with high temperatures. He was the sixth firefighter this week to die from forest fires raging around Spain. The 31-year-old man was with a group of firefighters battling a forest fire in Horta de Sant Joan in eastern Tarragona province Tuesday, when winds suddenly shifted, trapping them. Four firefighters in the group were killed immediately, authorities said, while several others were injured. The 31-year-old firefighter, who worked for the regional Catalan government, had burns on more than 50 percent of his body. The Horta de Sant Joan fire was brought under control midday Friday, the Catalan government said, after burning 1,020 hectares, or 2,520 acres. On Thursday, a 44-year-old firefighter died while driving a fire truck to fight a forest fire in eastern Teruel province, the regional Aragon government said on its Web site. The Aragon region borders the Catalan region. Some 7,000 hectares (17,300 acres) have already burned in Teruel province and Friday there were still various fronts to the fire, CNN partner station CNN+ reported, from the scene. Aircraft, including planes and helicopters, were being used to fight the fires in the Aragon region, along with hundreds of firefighters in the hilly terrain, much of it with difficult access. On Thursday, more than 800 Spanish troops were also fighting numerous forest fires across Spain, the Environment Ministry said. Spanish media reported that a fire in the town of Mojacar, in southern Almeria province, forced the Thursday night evacuation of 3,000 people. Spain is plagued by forest and brush fires every summer, when extremely dry weather sets in along with high temperatures. In 2005, 11 people were killed when they were trapped by a fast-moving fire in Guadalajara province, east of Madrid.

"(CNN) -- A Georgia youth football coach who made disparaging  comments on Facebook about ethnic groups and women wants to continue coaching and hopes people accept his apology, his attorney said Wednesday. Frank Samuelson, who coached 10-year-old athletes at the Brookwood Football Association in suburban Atlanta, made an apology Tuesday night to members of the association. But some parents were unmoved. ""Frank Samuelson, by name, is a racist,"" said Joseph Clark, who said he is taking his son out of the program in the upscale area in Gwinnett County. The coach should have stepped down, Clark added. Blake Fleming, a parent of a player in the association, told HLN Wednesday night that he heard complaints from other parents earlier this fall and sent complaints to officials. The postings stayed up and there was no immediate action, he said. Samuelson eventually resigned from the association board after the comments went public. Attorney Chris McClurg, who said he also has been Samuelson's friend for about five years, said the coach made a public apology and ""is a nice guy"" who made ""insensitive"" remarks. The coach said in a statement the comments were meant for friends and in some cases he was responding to comments. The coach described south Asians as ""Red Dots"" and Hispanics as ""Beaners,"" according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which said he mocked other ethnic groups and women. Samuelson told the newspaper one posting represented inside jokes between friends: ""How to solve illegal immigration: Arrest the 30+ million illegals that are here first. Have them build a huge brick wall across the border [those guys do great brick work], and make them build it from the Mexican side of the border. Mount 50 calibre machine guns across the top and shoot anyone trying to climb over."" According to the newspaper, another posting, also with spelling errors, read: ""I was dining in an Asian buffet today [big surpise], and I heard this morning how Asian students are suppodely so much smarter than American kids. My personal observation is that those fishheads still eat with chopsticks. It took Western ingenuity to invent the fork. I'm just saying. ... they a'int that friggin' smart."" The coach's Facebook page was not visible to the public Wednesday and McClurg would not release its contents. He would not comment on specific allegations in the Journal-Constitution report, but said that his client acknowledged making inappropriate remarks. ""He wants to move on,"" said McClurg, indicating Samuelson was not available for comment Wednesday. Samuelson told CNN affiliate WSB in a statement that the ""things I remarked about were meant to be humorous or at least thought provoking in front of the eyes of my friends who make up a variety of different people ... it was meant to either respond to some of my friend's posts or poke at them in turn."" CNN affiliates WSB and WXIA broadcast video from Tuesday night's meeting, including Samuelson's apology and Clark's comments. ""If there is somebody offended by it I definitely apologize from the bottom of my heart,"" the coach told WSB, adding some of the posts were ""locker room talk"" among friends. And he said, many of his postings, were taken out of context. After Samuelson's speech to the association, a large number of those in the crowd stood and applauded. ""All you need to know is that 90 percent of the audience stood up and gave him a standing ovation,"" McClurg told HLN. Samuelson hopes to continue coaching at Brookwood next year, McClurg said. ""Frank is loved by all those kids,"" the attorney said. The association on Tuesday night passed a new bylaw that gave board members the power to ""expel from the membership"" anyone whose activities are considered detrimental, according to the Journal-Constitution. A message left with the Brookwood board president was not immediately returned Wednesday.

"London (CNN) -- WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was granted bail Tuesday after a hearing at Westminster Magistrate's Court in London, but a lawyer representing Swedish prosecutors immediately filed an appeal. That means Assange will remain in jail until the next hearing, which should be before the High Court within 48 hours, lawyers said. The 39-year-old Australian handed himself over to London police last week to answer a European arrest warrant over alleged sex crimes in Sweden. Assange is facing accusations of rape, sexual molestation and illegal use of force in separate incidents in August in Stockholm. He could be sentenced to two years in prison if convicted. His lawyers deny the allegations and have vowed to fight any attempts at extradition. The magistrate agreed to grant bail Tuesday after Vaughan Smith, a former British army officer who founded London's Frontline Club, testified that Assange could stay at his mansion in Suffolk. Smith will keep Assange ""if not under house arrest, at least under mansion arrest,"" said defense attorney Geoffrey Robertson. At that, Assange, dressed in a white shirt and a blue jacket and sitting in a glassed-in corner of the court with three security guards, smiled wryly. The magistrate set bail at 200,000 pounds (about $315,000) plus two sureties of 20,000 pounds each (about $31,500). Assange's passport must remain with police, and he will be monitored by a location tag. Assange must be at Smith's mansion, about two hours outside of London, for at least four hours overnight and four hours during the day. He will be required to report to police daily between 6 and 8 p.m. The next court hearing was scheduled for January 11. After the conditions were set, Assange stood and said, ""I understand,"" with a neutral expression. His mother Christine told reporters after the hearing that she was ""very, very happy"" and thanked ""the media for all your support of my son."" But several hours later, Sweden filed its appeal. Outside the court, about 100 people demonstrated in support of Assange, holding signs saying ""Julian Assange is a political prisoner"" and ""Why are you shooting the messenger?"" and  ""This is not 1984."" During the hearing, Assange's team of attorneys argued that since he is only wanted for questioning and has not been formally charged, he is presumed innocent. The magistrate agreed. But, said Gemma Lindfield, the attorney representing the Swedish prosecution, ""The court has already found that Mr. Assange is a flight risk. Nothing has changed in this regard."" She said if the alleged offenses had occurred in Britain, ""it undoubtedly would have been a charge of rape in this jurisdiction."" Robertson disputed that. Celebrity supporters of Assange at the hearing included Bianca Jagger, who sat next to Fatima Bhutto, niece of the late Pakistani politician Benazir Bhutto and current Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari, and prominent left-wing journalist John Pilger. Socialite Jemima Khan came to court but it is not clear she got into the very crowded hearing room. Many were turned away for lack of space. Judge Howard Riddle denied Assange's first request for bail at a hearing on December 7 on the grounds that there was a risk he would fail to surrender. On Tuesday, he cited four reasons for his insistence a week earlier on keeping Assange in jail: his lack of fixed residence, confusion over when and how he last entered the United Kingdom, the evidence against him in Sweden, and a dispute over whether Assange is wanted only for questioning or for prosecution. Smith's offer of his mansion satisfied Riddle on the question of an address, and testimony from someone who arrived in the U.K. with Assange from Switzerland answered that question, he said. He said he was not taking a position on the Swedish evidence against Assange, and that a future hearing would have to determine whether Assange was wanted for questioning or prosecution. WikiLeaks' release of thousands of secret U.S. diplomatic and military documents is under criminal review in the United States. Almost half of Britons believe that the sex charges against Assange are ""an excuse"" to keep him in custody so that the U.S. government can prosecute him for releasing secret diplomatic cables, a new poll for CNN shows. The ComRes poll of British opinion, released Monday on the eve of Assange's bail hearing, finds that 44% of respondents in Great Britain believe that Sweden's sex charges are just a pretext, while only 13% flatly disagree. The remaining 43% say they don't know. Last week, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said he had authorized ""significant"" actions related to a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks' publication of the materials but has declined to elaborate. WikiLeaks inflamed U.S. authorities last month by publishing the first of a large group of confidential U.S. diplomatic cables. Only a small fraction of the 250,000 U.S. State Department documents have been released and more are being published daily. U.S. authorities and other Western leaders say the documents' publication threatens lives and national security. WikiLeaks and its supporters say that the public has a right to know what is going on behind diplomatic doors.

"(CNN) -- Jeff Peterson and his 30 volunteer comrades with the Community Fire Department in suburban Charlotte, North Carolina, were enjoying an early Christmas dinner Sunday afternoon when someone looked out a window and saw smoke, thinking it might be a car fire. A few donned gear as others rushed outside the North Belmont station house to find it was an SUV that had struck a tree. Video taken at the scene showed flames shooting out of the engine compartment and the driver's white door blackened from the fire. Local resident Kathy Lamberth apparently had lost control of the Suburban, CNN affiliate WSOC reported. ""You couldn't see in the vehicle,"" which was about 35 yards from the station, Peterson, 36, told HLN on Wednesday. Within moments, Peterson and fellow paramedic Neil Jones, along with firefighter/EMT Jake Beatty, found the doors were jammed. They opened the rear swinging doors of the vehicle and saw Lamberth, whose seat had been pushed back by the impact, trying to reach her 3-week-old son, Landen. ""We knew while it was an urgent situation we could make the rescue without harming ourselves,"" said Peterson, who provided aid to the mother and son after Jones and Beatty brought them out of the burning vehicle. ""I thought as long as he made it I was happy,"" Lamberth said, referring to her son. Landen did not suffer injuries, WSOC said. Lamberth, 23, who was treated at a hospital and released, had gratitude for the firefighters. ""They were our guardian angels,"" she said. Officials credit part of the quick response to the fact they had gathered for the meal. ""We were miraculously all there for dinner,"" Peterson said.

"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Pivotal elections will proceed as planned in Haiti despite the cholera outbreak that has now sickened more than 60,000 people and threatens to keep spreading. The death toll now stands at 1,415, the Ministry of Public Health and Population reported Wednesday, citing data collected as of November 20. More than 25,000 people have been hospitalized. Some of the 19 presidential candidates have urged a postponement of Sunday's vote. But Ken Merten, the United States ambassador to Haiti, said the election process was on track. He said 250,000 new voters were registered and more than 11,000 voting stations have been identified in the fifth presidential election since the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship and the first key moment at the polls since the devastating earthquake in January. ""We have a cholera problem here, which is something that the Haitians and we are all grappling with, which is a major public health challenge here,"" Merten said at a news conference Tuesday. ""And we have the elections which should take place, need to take place, and we are here to support that effort."" Meanwhile, the Pan American Health Organization said it was planning to treat 400,000 cholera cases within the next year, up from a previous estimate of 270,000 over several years, as a result of the outbreak in Haiti. ""We need to plan for up to half of those cases occurring in the next three months because of the explosive nature of this epidemic,"" the organization's deputy director, Dr. Jon Kim Andrus, told reporters in Washington on Tuesday. ""We need more of everything,"" he said. ""More training for staff in Haiti, more doctors, more nurses, more treatment centers, more medications, more toilets, more clean water.""

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- The Nigerian army has arrested a militant gang leader believed to be behind the kidnapping of 19 people, authorities said Saturday. Fifty-one of his followers were also arrested, said Lt Col Timothy Antigha, a spokesman for the military taskforce in the Niger Delta. Nigerian authorities on Wednesday freed the 19 hostages seized in the oil-rich Niger Delta region. They were 12 Nigerians, two Americans, two Frenchmen, one Canadian and two Indonesians. Nigeria has launched an offensive targeting Delta, Bayelsa and Rivers states, the largest military campaign in the Niger Delta region since the government offered an amnesty program in 2007. The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta is one of several militant groups in the region that has been battling the government for years over the distribution of the country's oil wealth.

"(CNN) -- A California man who spent a month of the run with his 15-year-old niece is now in a San Francisco jail, and the girl back is home with her parents, according to police and relatives. Charles David Berlinghoff, 44, was caught this weekend, four weeks after the Shasta County Sheriff's office urged the public and law enforcement to be on the lookout for him. At that time, the police issued statements indicating his niece, Jean Marie Berlinghoff, was with him and ""is believed to be endangered."" The girl, meanwhile, was reunited with her family at 8 a.m. Sunday, according to police. Her father called the meeting very emotional, full of hugs and tears. ""I was able to put my arms around her and hug her,"" Jake Berlinghoff told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell on Monday. ""Amazing is an understatement. I can't put to words how happy I was to see her again, and how happy her mom was to see her."" That feeling was the opposite of the parents' feelings in previous weeks, while their daughter's whereabouts and condition were unknown. Charles Berlinghoff had been in and out of his extended family's life, even losing regular contact for a full decade, his brother told HLN. In 1998, Charles Berlinghoff pleaded no-contest to one count of child molestation -- part of a deal in which three other child molesting counts were dropped, according to California court documents. But his brother said that the extended family didn't know about that sex offense, a charge that the judge in 2002 expunged from his record. On November 12, the Shasta County Sheriff's Office issued a statement saying that Jean Marie and her uncle were missing, having last been seen in North Redding, California, traveling together in a 1987 gray Oldsmobile. A felony arrest warrant for child stealing -- when a person entices, takes or hides a child from his or her lawful guardian -- was put out soon thereafter for Charles Berlinghoff. Police said that an additional arrest warrant, details of which were not released, was obtained December 6 by Shasta County detectives. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children got involved, helping publicize information about the girl and her alleged abductor on transit and other signs in northern California. A $10,000 reward was offered for information leading to Jean Marie's recovery and her uncle's arrest, and authorities were on the look-out for the car. While on the run, Charles and Jean Marie spent much of their time staying in homeless shelters and eating in soup kitchens, Jake Berlinghoff said. Their run ended when one of Jean Marie's cousins, who lives in San Francisco, spotted the pair Saturday while shopping for a jacket, said Jake Berlinghoff. The cousin called 911 and trailed the pair from a distance before police arrived. Jake Berlinghoff said that he was ""ecstatic"" when he got word that Charles was in custody and his teenage daughter was safe, adding that a tearful Jean Marie told him ""she was happy to be home.""","Charles David Berlinghoff, 44, is in a California jail on a child-stealing warrant .

"(CNN) -- Americans around the world paused Thursday to pay tribute to the country's military veterans and honor their ongoing sacrifices in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere. Vice President Joe Biden led remembrances at the Veterans Day National Ceremony in Virginia's Arlington National Cemetery, participating in a wreath-laying ceremony under clear blue skies at the Tomb of the Unknowns. ""I look out at all of you who have served our nation ... and I see the most tested among us, the most tested of all Americans,"" Biden said. The more than 23 million surviving veterans today are ""the heart and soul, the very spine of this nation,"" the vice president added. Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki, a retired U.S. Army general, called it a day for ""promises that returning warriors will not bear their wounds alone."" They will be ""embraced and cared for by a grateful nation,"" he declared. President Barack Obama, participating in the G-20 economic summit in South Korea, marked the day with a visit to the U.S. Army garrison in Yongsan, near Seoul. In remarks to U.S. military personnel and their families, the president praised both American and South Korean troops who fought during the 1950-53 Korean War. ""Their service, through six decades, is a powerful reminder that security, democracy, and prosperity reinforce each other,"" he said. Other civilian and military leaders also took part in ceremonies honoring veterans. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano was scheduled to assist in a wreath-laying and deliver remarks at the Coast Guard's World War I Memorial in Arlington. Countless mourners made their way past the Vietnam Memorial on the National Mall. Parades and commemorations -- large and small, boisterous and quiet -- were held in cities and towns across the country. Birmingham, Alabama, was scheduled to hold its 63rd annual Veterans Day parade. Concerts were planned in Durham, North Carolina; Bath, New York; and Tucson, Arizona, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs. New Haven, Connecticut, prepared to hold its third annual Veterans Run/Walk. Twenty-five veterans were scheduled to take the oath of citizenship at Fort Sam Houston Cemetery in Texas, the VA noted. Over three million disabled veterans played a prominent role in this year's remembrances. On Wednesday, ground was broken for a new monument in Washington -- the Americans Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial. The memorial, to be located on 2.4 acres near the U.S. Capitol, will center around a star-shaped reflecting pool with an eternal flame. Roberto ""Bobby"" Barrera, a severely injured Vietnam-era Marine who now heads the Disabled American Veterans, called the groundbreaking ""a direct reflection of all disabled veterans and their journeys that began when they answered the call to duty."" ""Those journeys continue throughout their honorable service, through the trauma of injuries, and it continues today through their recovery and their renewal of purpose."" Veterans Day originated as a commemoration of Armistice Day, which marked the conclusion of World War I. President Woodrow Wilson, America's commander-in-chief during the conflict, called it a day to ""be filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country's service.""

"Sydney, Australia (CNN) -- More than 4,000 people were isolated by flood waters and as many as 1,800 have been evacuated in the Australian state of New South Wales after a week of heavy rains, the government said Monday. As a result of this week's rains, the government has so far issued disaster declarations in 17 of the state's rural and suburban districts, predominantly in the south and west. They join 17 other districts declared disaster areas after flooding in October. The flooding, which is expected to continue as a new storm front is forecast to bring extended heavy rains through Friday, has already destroyed an estimated $500 million in crops in the region, according to a statement issued by New South Wales Emergency Services. The hardest-hit communities include Wagga Wagga and Coonamble, both located in the southern part of North South Wales, which is located in Australia's southeast. The community of North Wagga Wagga was completely isolated on Monday, the emergency services agency said. Some evacuated residents of Eastern Coonamble have been allowed to return to their homes, although the government warned further flooding expected from the rains forecast for later this week could renew the danger. Flood warnings remained in effect Monday for communities along 13 rivers in New South Wales, including Castlereagh River, MacQuarie River and Murrumbidgee River. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology issued a flood watch Monday for northwest, southwest and central New South Wales, warning that another significant storm approaching the region could cause additional flooding. Since the most recent flooding began Nov. 29, emergency workers have executed 67 flood rescues and received more than 1,300 requests for assistance, the emergency services agency said. Most of the requests involved damage caused by flash flooding.","Heavy rains this week have resulted in major flooding in parts of New South Wales .

"(CNN) -- New Indian Premier League franchise Kochi has been given 30 days to resolve issues over its ownership or be thrown out of cricket's lucrative Twenty20 competition. The Board of Control for Cricket in India held an emergency meeting on the matter in Nagpur on Wednesday, and president Shashank Manohar said the dispute between Rendezvous Sports World and a group of investment firms who share the ownership must be resolved. ""The governing council has invoked clause 12 (1) against the Kochi team and served a 30-day notice. If they fail to provide a satisfactory reply the franchise would get cancelled on the 31st day. This was an unanimous decision,"" Manohar said, the UK Press Association reported. Rendezvous owns 26 percent of the $333 million franchise, which was bought at a public auction in March, and the five other firms hold 74 percent. Both parties had filed separate replies to a 10-day notice from the BCCI, PA reported. ""We discussed both. The board felt that the dispute still exists,"" Manohar said. Rendezvous spokesman Satyajit Gaikwad told Indian television channel NDTV that he believed the matter could be resolved. ""We are thankful that they have given us enough time to tie up our differences. We had asked for a grace period of 10 days but we got 30, so I am sure we will do it at the earliest,"" he said. Manohar insisted that the issue was different to that which saw the Rajasthan Royals and the Kings XI Punjab thrown out of next year's IPL, leaving the limited-overs tournament with just eight teams. ""Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab had changed their shareholding pattern without informing the BCCI. There is no such breach in this instance,"" he said. ""There is no transfer of control issue here, and this is only a dispute within the owners. Therefore, this is a remedial case."" The Royals, who won the inaugural IPL in 2008, have taken their case to the high court in Bombay and it has been adjourned until October 29. Meanwhile, Australia expect Doug Bollinger, Simon Katich and Ryan Harris to be fit for the first Ashes Test against England starting on November 25. Fast bowler Bollinger suffered a stomach strain in the first Test in India and was ruled out of the rest of the tour plus the upcoming home one-day series against Sri Lanka. Batsman Katich also returned home with a thumb injury and quick bowler Harris had knee surgery in July. However, Cricket Australia physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said all three should be ready to play for their state teams next month and be available for the first match of five against the tourists in Brisbane. The Australians are seeking to win back the Ashes following last year's 2-1 series defeat in England.","Ownership issue threatens Kochi's introduction to Indian Premier League .

"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Already devastated this year by a killer earthquake and a deadly cholera outbreak, Haiti felt the brute force Friday of Hurricane Tomas, which could dump up to 15 inches of rain and trigger flash floods and mudslides. The hurricane's punishing rain continued to pound Haiti even as the storm churned away from Hispaniola. As of 8 p.m. ET, the storm's center was about 135 miles (220 kilometers) east of Guantanamo, Cuba, and about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Great Inagua island in the Bahamas, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida. Earlier Friday, Tomas had passed within about 140 miles (230 kilometers) of Port-au-Prince. In the westernmost tip of Haiti, which juts into the Caribbean Sea and is closest to the hurricane, there were reports from the town of Jeremie of destroyed houses, downed trees and flooded rivers, said Francois Desruisseaux, an emergency team leader with CARE in Haiti. Also, he said, CARE workers near the coastal city of Leogane reported the area has been inundated with several feet of water. Downtown streets turned into rivers, said Desruisseaux. Tomas was also felt in Port-au-Prince, the nation's capital, but the worst of the storm appeared to have passed there after rain pounded the city overnight. By Friday afternoon, rain had stopped falling. It started again in fits and spurts later. ""We were expecting something perhaps a little larger, but it's still quite significant,"" Desruisseaux said about Hurricane Tomas, adding that rescue teams throughout Haiti are still working to assess the damage. ""In the capital so far, we've been relatively lucky, all things considered."" The threat of ongoing rain remains real, as does the possibility of the spread of waterborne diseases, Desruisseaux said. Relief worker Roseann Dennery of Samaritan's Purse was near Cabaret, about 20 miles north of Port-au-Prince, on Friday morning, touring camps that hold some of the 1 million people left homeless by January's 7.0-magnitude earthquake, which killed some 250,000 people. ""It's almost eerie,"" she said. ""It's rainy, it's dark and there's really not a lot of movement."" The few people moving from tent to tent were wrapped in sheets and cloth to provide some protection against the constant rain, she said. The ground was soaked and some low-lying areas had minor flooding. Some people rode out the storm in open-air community centers with supposedly sturdy roofs, she said. But many just huddled in their tents, waiting for the wind and rain to pass. Most didn't have anywhere else to go. ""A lot of them do not have families or relatives,"" said Dennery. Many structures that would usually be used for storm shelters -- schools and hospitals -- are no longer standing. She said her agency, an international Christian relief organization, evacuated 30 staff members from Leogane out of fear of mudslides there. Michael Dockrey, the director in Haiti for the International Medical Corps, also expressed his deep concern Friday. ""Particularly,"" he told CNN, ""with mudslides that can cut off whole communities. We have pre-positioned medical supplies, tents, tarps and staff in areas that we know will be isolated."" Aid workers already were struggling to keep up with the cholera outbreak, which has killed nearly 450 people and hospitalized about 7,000. The bacterial disease causes diarrhea and vomiting that can lead to deadly dehydration within hours. ""It's obviously stretched us all real thin,"" Dockrey said. ""We could certainly use more help ... as can all the other responders."" The hurricane will likely only make matters worse. ""Even if Tomas only brushes Haiti, it may exacerbate the epidemic, facilitating the spread of the disease into and throughout metropolitan Port-au-Prince, where a third of the population remains homeless and in camps,"" the International Organization for Migration said. Tomas became a Category 1 hurricane as it approached Haiti early Friday, forecasters said. It was previously a Category 2 hurricane and then weakened to a tropical depression before reintensifying. Forecasters predict the storm could strengthen during the next 24 hours before weakening again Saturday night and Sunday. The biggest threats were mudslides and flash flooding, said CNN meteorologist Reynolds Wolf. Port-au-Prince is bounded on three sides by hills, and rain runoff could cause flooding, Wolf said. The low-lying port city also borders the Caribbean Sea. Winds from the storm had slowed to 75 mph (120 kph), the Hurricane Center said Friday evening, adding that Tomas was moving northeast at 14 mph (22 kph). The eye of the storm was expected to pass near or over the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos islands Friday night or early Saturday. Rain associated with the storm started falling on Haiti on Thursday as aid agencies scrambled to move as many people as possible into storm shelters. As it did after the earthquake, the United States offered its assistance. The U.S Agency for International Development had pre-positioned supplies, but rushed more into the country before the airport closed ahead of the storm, said Mark Ward, acting director of the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance. Citing Haitian authorities, Ward said at a Friday briefing for reporters that about half the residents at temporary camps left those facilities overnight to stay with family or friends. He said the Haitian government has confirmed one fatality. In addition, the U.S. Navy redirected the USS Iwo Jima to Haiti from Suriname, where the ship's crew was conducting a four-month humanitarian mission. In addition to search-and-rescue-trained helicopter crews, the ship is carrying more than 200 medical personnel and 60 Navy construction engineers who can help with recovery efforts. The ship is also carrying a 500-member Marine task force and personnel from nongovernmental relief agencies. Negus, who participated in the Navy response to the earthquake, said he did not expect the fallout from Tomas to be anywhere near as severe. ""It's everyone's prayer here that our capabilities will not be required,"" Negus said. ""But everyone should be very confident that we are prepared if they are.""

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- Nepal's former crown prince was arrested Tuesday on charges of firing a pistol in a public place and threatening others, authorities said. Paras Shah allegedly fired several rounds at Rubel Chaudhary, a Bangladeshi national and the son-in-law of Nepal's deputy prime minister Sujata Koirala, after an argument Saturday in a wildlife resort in Chitwan, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) south of Kathmandu, according to reports. No one was injured. ""The ex-prince took out a pistol and started to open fire, accusing the Koirala family of conspiring to abolish the monarchy in this country,"" Chaudhary said Monday, according to media reports. Police spokesman Bigyan Raj Sharma told CNN the investigation is ongoing. Koirala's Nepali Congress party, the nation's second-biggest political party, demanded Shah's arrest on Monday. He was arrested in the tourist resort of Pokhara, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) west of Kathmandu, and police were questioning him, according to Ramesh Kharel, superintendent of police. Shah, 39, traveled to Pokhara from Chitwan on Sunday following the incident. Nepal abolished the monarchy in 2008, and members of the royal family became commoners. At the time, Koirala's father, Girija Prasad Koirala, was the prime minister. The hard-partying Shah reportedly has a history of reckless behavior. There have been previous reports of his using firearms in public places in the past. He was also believed to have killed a popular singer, striking him with his car, about a decade ago, when Nepal's monarchy was in place. However, Tuesday was the first time police have arrested Shah, who splits his time between Kathmandu and Singapore.","Paras Shah allegedly fired a pistol at the son-in-law of the deputy prime minister .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The first commercial spacecraft to return from a low-Earth orbit landed in the Pacific Ocean Wednesday about 500 miles off the coast of southern California. SpaceX launched the spacecraft, called the Dragon, atop a Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 10:43 a.m. Wednesday. The spacecraft orbited Earth at more than 17,000 mph and then splashed down at 2 p.m. Eastern. The successful mission marked the first time a commercial firm recovered a spacecraft from a low orbit -- a feat performed by only six nations or government agencies: the United States, Russia, China, Japan, India and the European Space Agency. The landing was also the first flight under NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program to develop commercial supply services to the International Space Station. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said he deemed the mission a success. ""These new explorers are to spaceflight what Lindbergh was to commercial aviation,"" Bolden said. ""While rocket launches from the Cape are considered a common occurrence, the historic significance of today's achievement by SpaceX should not be lost. ""This is the first in a new generation of commercial launch systems that will help provide vital support to the International Space Station and may one day carry astronauts into orbit. This successful demonstration flight is an important milestone in meeting the objectives outlined by President Obama and Congress, and shows how government and industry can leverage expertise and resources to foster a new and vibrant space economy,"" Bolden said.","NASA official cites ""historic significance of today's achievement by SpaceX""

"(CNN) -- The last couple of weeks have been busy ones for news about Facebook. ""The Social Network"" movie hit theaters, CEO Mark Zuckerberg donated $100 million on Oprah and, if rumors are correct, the world's biggest social-networking site will be partnering with online phone service Skype to help you chat with your Facebook friends through the site. According to All Things D's Kara Swisher, Facebook and Skype are about to announce a partnership that includes ""integration of SMS, voice chat and Facebook Connect."" It's not clear exactly what this deal would entail, but possibilities include Facebook Chat over a browser to cell phones, and video chat among Facebook friends. The question is: Do people actually want to interact with their Facebook friends on a more intimate level? According to Facebook, the average user has 130 friends. But these connections likely include your ex-boyfriends or ex-girlfriends, casual acquaintances and maybe even that weird person who sat behind you in seventh-grade biology -- in other words, not necessarily people you'll want to chat with on the phone. Skype already has a huge following, but a connection to a 500-million-member social network wouldn't hurt. Skype's appeal overseas also would make Facebook much more attractive abroad. But to truly succeed, the partnership will have to go beyond voice chat, because people already can use Skype to talk to people they really care about.","A rumored deal would enable Skype calling between Facebook friends .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- The Spanish government put the military in control of air space late Friday to get commercial jets flying again after a surprise air traffic controller strike stranded tens of thousands of travelers, the deputy prime minister announced. ""The prime minister has signed an order giving the Ministry of Defense control of air space in the whole nation until there are guarantees that (civilian) air traffic controllers will provide normal service,"" Deputy Prime Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba announced in a nationally televised statement. He said the measure was taken because of the ""extraordinary circumstance of the closure of air space, provoked by the air traffic controllers"" and added the government is acting in accord with ""the Constitution and existing legislation."" Many of the stranded passengers sent twitters or called in to newsrooms describing how they were stuck on planes on airport tarmacs. This included families with young children trying to set off on a vacation over the long holiday that continues in Spain through next Wednesday. CNN affiliate CNN+ reported that military officers had moved to take control at towers at 10 airports before midnight. There are about 47 airports in Spain. The months-long dispute between the government and the air traffic controllers over conditions and pay reached a climax around 5 p.m. (11 a.m. ET) on Friday when controllers at airports in Madrid and Spain's Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean walked off en masse. Just a few remained to guide a some remaining planes in the air toward safe landings, officials said. The wildcat strike soon spread to most airports across the nation, affecting hundreds of flights. The airport authority AENA estimated up to 250,000 people might be affected, including those at airports and those waiting to go on flights that would be delayed or canceled. AENA advised travelers to stay away from airports until they were sure their flights would take off. The prime minister's Cabinet earlier Friday approved a measure regulating the controllers' shifts and work conditions. In addition, the new rules allow the government to put the military in control of air space in case of a wildcat air controller strike. As the strike carried on late Friday, the government assessed whether controllers were showing up for the late shifts, a senior aide to Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero told CNN. When it was determined the controllers were not returning in significant numbers, except at Barcelona's airport, Zapatero signed the order giving the military control, and the deputy prime minister announced it soon after. Many people holding tickets on the commercial flights scheduled for Friday afternoon and evening said they had little hope of getting out, since Saturday flights were expected to be fully booked for the long holiday. The government apologized for the inconvenience to travelers in repeated statements and added extra trains from the state-run railway, but not enough to handle everyone who was stranded at airports. CNN+ reported the government was holding a crisis meeting over the walkout and leaders of the air traffic controllers union were headed to the meeting for talks with the government. At a news conference, AENA President Juan Ignacio Lema apologized to Spaniards for the disruptions. ""This irresponsible decision is provoking grave consequences across Spain,"" he said. ""It could lead to firing and could be a crime under the criminal code for abandoning a post for unjustified reasons."" He called on controllers ""to immediately return to work and stop holding Spaniards as hostages."" Lema added that since many controllers had alleged medical reasons for leaving their posts, AENA was sending doctors to the airports to attempt to verify the medical conditions of those controllers. Concha Garcia Campoy, a Cuatro television show host and journalist, said she and her family were stuck aboard a plane on the tarmac at the Madrid airport. ""We entered the plane at 4:50 p.m.,"" Garcia Campoy told CNN+ by phone at 7 p.m. (1 p.m. ET). ""We were going to London. The plane is full of families and children.""","NEW: The Spanish military is called in to replace striking air traffic controllers .

"New York (CNN) -- A former Guyana parliament member was sentenced to life in prison Wednesday after he was convicted of plotting to detonate explosives at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. Abdul Kadir is one of four people who faced charges in a 2007 plot to explode fuel tanks and the fuel pipeline under the airport, according to a statement from the U.S. Eastern District Court of New York. ""The sentence imposed on Abdul Kadir sends a powerful and clear message,"" U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said. ""We will bring to justice those who plot to attack the United States of America."" A federal jury convicted Kadir and co-conspirator Russell Defreitas in July after a nine-week trial, the statement said. Defreitas, former JFK cargo worker, was found guilty on all six counts: conspiring to attack a public transportation system, to destroy a building or other real property by fire or explosive, to attack aircraft and aircraft materials, to destroy or damage international airport facilities and to attack a mass transportation facility; and surveillance of a mass transportation facility. Kadir was found guilty on five counts but not guilty of surveillance of a mass transportation facility. His attorney, Kafahni Nkrumah, was not immediately available for comment. A third defendant, Abdul Nur, pleaded guilty in June to providing material support to terrorists; a fourth man, Kareem Ibrahim, faces the same charges as Defreitas and Kadir, the statement said. Prosecutors have said the men tapped into an international network of Muslim extremists to develop the plot and start work toward carrying it out. A criminal complaint accused the men of obtaining satellite photos of the airport and using DeFreitas to conduct surveillance and identify potential targets and escape routes. An informant secretly taped conversations in which DeFreitas described the symbolic importance of targeting JFK, the complaint says.","Former Guyana parliament member convicted of plotting to blow up airport fuel tanks .

"Sydney, Australia (CNN) -- Qantas is considering legal action against engine-maker Rolls-Royce after one of the manufacturer's engines sparked a fire on a flight last month, the airline said Thursday. The Federal Court of Australia granted the Australian carrier an injunction Thursday allowing it to pursue legal action against Rolls-Royce in Australia if a commercial settlement is not possible, Qantas said. Qantas said it has already started discussions with Rolls-Royce. A Sydney, Australia-bound Qantas Airbus A380 was forced to turn back to Singapore on Nov. 4 when an oil fire badly damaged one of the plane's four Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines. The fire resulted in part of the engine casing falling off in flight. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau issued a safety recommendation Thursday about the Trent 900 engines, which are installed on some A380 superjumbos, the world's largest airliner. The ATSB said it had identified a potential manufacturing defect with the Trent 900 on some A380s that could have been a factor in last month's fire on the Qantas flight. ""The problem relates to the potential for misaligned oil pipe counter-boring, which could lead to fatigue cracking, oil leakage, and potential engine failure from an oil fire within the HP/IP bearing buffer space,"" the ATSB said in a statement. Rolls-Royce said checks conducted immediately after the Nov. 4 incident showed the problem was specific to the Trent 900 and that it was confined to a specific component in the turbine area of the engine. That in turn caused an oil fire, Rolls-Royce said. A Rolls-Royce spokesman said Thursday the ATSB recommendation was consistent with those findings. ""We have instituted a regime of inspection, maintenance, and removal which has assured safe operation,"" the spokesman said. ""This program has been agreed in collaboration with Airbus, our airline customers, and the regulators."" Qantas grounded its A380 fleet for several weeks while it inspected the problem. It said Thursday it is doing further one-off inspections of the engines for possible tubing defects. The ATSB plans to hold a media briefing Friday when it releases its preliminary report into the mishap. CNN's Melissa Gray contributed to this report.","NEW: Australian court grants Qantas permission to pursue legal action .

"Washington (CNN) -- Rep.  Mike Rogers, a former FBI agent and vocal critic of the Obama administration's  dealing with terrorists, will head the House Intelligence Committee when  Republicans take control of the House next year. Incoming House Speaker  John Boehner announced Wednesday his choice of the Michigan Republican to lead the panel which oversees the  secret work and the budgets of the 16 agencies and departments which make up the  intelligence community. Rogers is not one to mince words. He has made it clear where he stands on a number of  fronts which could be a thorn in the side of the Obama administration. He  doesn't think the Guantanamo  Bay detention facility in  Cuba should be closed. Rogers wants terror suspects to be considered enemy combatants who would not be read their Miranda rights and would be put on trial before military tribunals held at Guantanamo. Rogers has accused the  administration of treating terrorism as ""lawfare"" instead of warfare. ""We do not need Eliot Ness on the battlefield; what we need is Gen. George S. Patton,"" said  the lawmaker. The five-term congressman  is a former FBI agent and has been critical of the bureau for its failure to solve  its computer problems and its inability to integrate its 2,800 analysts. Rogers beat out Rep. William ""Mac"" Thornberry, R-Texas, for the  job. In a prepared statement,  Boehner said, ""Mike Rogers' experience and expertise has proven invaluable  throughout his tenure on the Intelligence  Committee."" The outgoing ranking  member of the committee called Rogers the right man at the right time for the  job. Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Michigan, said ""intelligence is at the tip of the  spear in the fight against terrorists and America's foreign adversaries, and Mike is a  strong leader to conduct oversight of such a critical issue to the  U.S."" Since the Intelligence  Committee is considered a select committee, the speaker has the sole  responsibility of appointing its chairman. But Boehner did seem to  offer Thornberry a possible consolation prize. The speaker-elect said he will  recommend to the Republican Steering Committee that Thornberry be appointed the  vice chairman of the powerful Armed Services Committee.","Rep.

"(CNN) -- There is one thing people seem to like about flying: Southwest. In a new survey from Zagat, Southwest Airlines swept several satisfaction categories, including best value among domestic airlines for the third year in a row. The airline also got nods for best luggage policy, best check-in experience, best consumer on-time estimates, and most eco-friendly -- the most top finishes of any airline. ""Customer service is the core of our business,"" said Whitney Eichinger, a spokesperson at Southwest. ""Bottom line, we have fun. Southwest takes our business very seriously, but is known for having employees who care about our customers which, in this industry, separates us from our competitors."" Eichinger added that Southwest will continue to offer customers the chance to check their first two bags free, a major draw for the airline since other popular carriers began charging up to $25 to check one bag. The survey, conducted on Zagat.com, includes 8,000 opinions from frequent fliers and travel professionals, flying an average of 17 times per year. It covers 16 domestic airlines and 74 international airlines, as well as 30 airports within the United States. Continental Airlines and JetBlue Airways topped the survey for premium seating and economy seating, respectively. This is Continental's third year winning the premium seating category among large domestic airlines. Singapore Airlines was the top-rated international airline for both premium seating and economy seating, receiving a survey-high score of 28 out of 30 for its premium seats. As for airports, Portland International topped the Overall Quality ratings with 22.47 out of 30, while New York's LaGuardia stayed at the bottom with 6.18 out of 30. This is LaGuardia's fourth year as America's least favorite airport. ""It's very, very crowded. ... They're having trouble keeping up with the traffic,"" said Tim Zagat, co-founder, co-chair and CEO of Zagat Survey. ""I think a lot of the infrastructure is out of date."" In order to move up in the rankings next year, Zagat said they should ""knock it down and start over."" Travelers said that direct routes were the most important factor when choosing a flight, followed by ticket price and past experience with an airline. Forty-five percent of people try to avoid flying airlines that charge for checked luggage. ""My bags get better service, but they pay extra,"" one survey respondent joked.

"Ciudad Juarez, Mexico (CNN) -- In one of Mexico's most violent cities, it was a startling scene: clinics closed, with no doctors to treat patients. Doctors in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, said Monday that they would stop working for 24 hours to demand that the government do more to deal with the violence ravaging their city. ""Many of us have been asked to save the lives of burglars, extorters and kidnappers of our own colleagues. It's outrageous that we are saving the lives of people that are attacking and killing us, and we are going to look for the legal means to avoid doing that,"" said Alejandro Flores, a member of the Citizens' Committee of Ciudad Juarez Doctors. Banners hanging outside hospitals and clinics in Ciudad Juarez -- located across the border from El Paso, Texas -- read: ""Stop impunity. We demand justice."" ""We know that patients have the right to healthcare, but nonetheless, we the doctors cannot offer our services if we live trapped in our homes for fear of going out to work, if we are kidnapped, or even worse, if we lose our lives, killed with impunity,"" a statement from the doctors' organization said. The statement noted the recent deaths of three colleagues -- one who died in a car bomb explosion, and two others who died after being kidnapped. The group also issued a list of demands that they asked authorities to meet within seven days, including releasing more information about an investigation into the recent killings of two doctors and bringing more federal agents to the city to investigate unsolved crimes. ""The doctors feel that there is no protection. There are no guarantees of security from the police or the government,"" attorney Angel de la Torre said. Journalists Arturo Chacon and Edgar Roman contributed to this report.","Doctors say they are increasingly the victims of violence .

"(CNN) -- The South Korean navy began live-fire exercises on the seas surrounding the Korean peninsula Monday in the midst of bristling tensions with the North, South Korean state media reported. The military exercises are taking place in the waters off all three coasts of the Korean peninsula, officials at the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff told the Yonhap news agency. They are scheduled to last through Friday and come on the heels of joint military drills between the United States and South Korea that ended last week and nearly two weeks after the North's November 23 shelling of South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island. The attack killed four South Koreans -- two civilians and two military personnel -- and the South returned fire. The live-fire drills are a routine monthly exercise aimed at securing the safety of ships in the area, the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff told CNN last week. But they come amid rising tensions on the divided peninsula. North Korea's official news agency, KCNA, lambasted the planned exercises in an article Sunday -- claiming South Korea's government was trying to orchestrate another clash around the border island ""at any cost and ignite a war come what may under this pretext."" South Korea's new defense minister said Friday his country would respond with airstrikes if North Korea attacks it again, in some of the strongest rhetoric since the conflict broke out late last month. ""We will definitely air raid North Korea,"" Kim Kwan-jin said at his confirmation hearing when asked how the South would respond if struck again, according to Yonhap. Kim was appointed defense minister last week amid growing tensions on the Korean peninsula following an exchange of gunfire between the two sides. He took office on Saturday. His comments reflect a potential shift in South Korea's policy toward provocations from the North. Previously, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak warned of severe consequences if the North launched another attack, but declined to name specifics. ""If the North commits any additional provocations against the South, we will make sure that it pays a dear price without fail,"" he said in a nationally televised address a week ago.","The exercises are scheduled to last until Friday .

"London, England (CNN) -- Britain's second-largest airport was closed for a second day Thursday because of unseasonal wintry weather that was also affecting the European continent. All flights into and out of London's Gatwick Airport were canceled until 6 a.m. (1 a.m. ET) Friday, the airport said. It asked passengers to check with their airlines before heading to the airport. Planes sat at the gates covered in snow and a spokesman said the snow was falling on the airport's lone runway faster than crews could clear it. ""We are doing everything we can to resume operations,""the airport said in a statement. ""Our teams are working around the clock to make the runway safe for aircraft to use and get our passengers flying again."" Thursday, airport officials handed out 1,000 blankets along with food and water to stranded passengers who had little to do but sit around and hope for the weather to improve. The United Kingdom has seen the heaviest and most widespread amount of snow since 1993 and the deepest November snow since 1965, the Met Office, Britain's weather forecaster, said. Forecasters issued severe weather warnings Thursday, predicting heavy snow for many parts of the country including Scotland, northeast England, parts of central England, and the entire south from Cornwall to London and the southeast. Edinburgh Airport in Scotland was closed because of heavy snow, the airport said. London's Heathrow Airport was open, but said some airlines were experiencing delays and cancellations because of snow disruptions at other airports. Eurostar, which operates trains between London and the continent, said it was operating a ""significantly reduced"" timetable on Thursday with a number of cancellations, along with delays of as much as 90 minutes. It said disruptions were expected through the weekend, and it advised passengers booked to travel through Sunday to postpone their journeys if not essential. The main reason for the snowfall is the cold polar air sweeping across the North Sea, said Mari Ramos of the CNN World Weather Center. The sea is still relatively warm, at 9-10 degrees Celsius (48-50 degrees Fahrenheit), so as the water evaporates and is hit by the cold polar air, it turns to snow. ""You normally have this change in the wind pattern later in the season, but it won't bring snow because the ocean will be colder,"" Ramos said. Snowfall has also been widespread across Europe, with unseasonably low temperatures -- easily 10 degrees below average for this time of year -- lasting much longer than normal, Ramos said. Snow was expected across France, from the northern part of the country into the southern parts, near Switzerland and Italy, Ramos said. As much as six centimeters (2.4 inches) were expected in some areas. Meteo France issued an orange weather warning -- it's second-highest -- across central France, and forecasters predicted icy conditions and heavy snowfall. A quarter of flights out of Roissy Charles de Gaulle airport and 10 percent of flights out of Orly were canceled Thursday, air traffic control said. Trains were delayed throughout France but were expected to run regularly Friday. The snow was stretching into northern Portugal and central and southern Spain, with an unusual snowfall in Grenada earlier in the week, she said. Temperatures were another big concern. ""The temperature will be in many cases 8-12 degrees below the average, and that's not factoring in the wind,"" Ramos said. The chilly weather began over the weekend and is scheduled to last for a week, she said. CNN's Alex Felton in London, England, and Saskya Vandoorne in Paris, France, contributed to this report.","NEW: Forecasters issue severe weather warnings .

"(CNN) -- After a rough night spent wrapped in tablecloths and dozing on floors, stranded showboat passengers walked to safety Sunday from their disabled vessel via a 30-foot plank, a spokeswoman for the company that owns the boat said. By noon Sunday, all 567 passengers and 76 crew members had been escorted off the Showboat Branson Belle, according to Lisa Rau, a spokeswoman for Herschend Family Entertainment. Marine experts onboard the ship Sunday afternoon were focusing on the boat's propulsion system, including its paddle wheel, as a possible reason the ship ran aground the previous day in a remote area of Missouri's Table Rock Lake, Rau said. The grounding left all those trapped and forced to spend the night on a boat without any sleeping accommodations. Earlier, the arduous task of reaching the boat's remote location involved bulldozing vegetation to create a pathway. Gusty winds and freezing temperatures made that and the disembarking process difficult, according to Rau. ""We are moving heaven and earth to get to them,"" Rau said earlier Sunday,. The boat left the dock in Branson, Missouri, at 4 p.m. Saturday and ran aground after the captain had problems with the thruster during the cruise, which was scheduled to last two and a half hours. The boat did have heat and electrical power, Rau said, and passengers were provided food and beverages. ""It's not the best case scenario, but we're doing everything we can to make sure everybody's as comfortable as possible,"" Rau said earlier. Jim Wellborn, a passenger stranded in the boat, said that they were in the middle of a comedy show when the captain interrupted and told the audience that the boat 's propellers had hit something under water. ""We were almost back to the dock, when we heard a couple of loud noises. The comedian said something funny and we all laughed,"" he said. The Showboat Branson Belle is a 750-seat paddle boat with no gambling or alcohol, she said. Its featured ""Showstoppers"" performance includes 30 songs, according to the cruise website. All those passengers stranded overnight will get annual passes to the Silver Dollar City theme park in Branson that, like the boat, is owned by Herschend Family Entertainment, along with a full refund for the cruise, said Rau.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers offered support Monday to state and local officials in western Washington battling fast-moving floodwaters and rising rivers. Six teams, including 39 flood fighters, were sent to the Olympic Peninsula and the Chehalis, Nooksack, Skagit, Snohomish and Puyallup river basins to monitor areas of concern and provide real-time river condition observations to the local and federal emergency operations centers, officials said. The Corps also supplied two pumps to the city of Orting at its request and 15,000 sandbags to Snohomish County. Monday morning, the National Weather Service was reporting major flooding on the Snoqualmie River at Carnation and moderate flooding on the Snohomish River at Snohomish. Flooding also was occurring or was predicted for areas along the Green, Nooksack, Skagit, Skokomish and Chehalis rivers, according to the weather service's Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service. The Stillaguamish River, which Sunday evening rose to a record level at Arlington, had receded below flood stage Monday morning and will continue to drop, the prediction service said. The rain that led to the flooding also triggered mudslides that shut down passenger trains north and south of Seattle over the weekend. About 300 people are staying in shelters after homes flooded in several cities north of Seattle, said Rob Harper an emergency management spokesman for Washington. He said they evacuated voluntarily. ""Swift-water teams were called out Sunday,"" Harper said. ""Rescue operations are still being mobilized to be available if needed."" Rivers in nine counties had crested at or above flood stage by Sunday morning, the state Emergency Operations Center reported. And a mudslide north of Vancouver, Washington, just across the state line from Portland, Oregon, shut down Amtrak's Cascades train route until Tuesday morning, Amtrak said. ""They have to make sure where the mudslide occurred or anywhere else along that track, that the slope is stable enough to where there will not be any chances of an additional mudslide occurring before they release passenger traffic back onto the track,"" said Washington Department of Transportation spokeswoman Vickie Sheehan. Mudslides occurred north of Seattle as well, shutting down train service that connected the city to Canada, Sheehan said. But shutting down the Portland-to-Seattle run has ""a much bigger impact that affects a lot more people,"" she said. Amtrak will provide bus service for all ticketed passengers throughout the weekend and until the rail line reopens, Amtrak spokeswoman Vernae Graham said.

"(CNN) -- Police said Thursday that evidence and a surviving victim tie a man killed while trying to rob an Illinois tanning salon to a two-state shooting spree earlier this year. Gary Amaya, 48, was killed Saturday after he walked into LA Tan salon in Orland Park, Illinois, brandishing a .38 Colt revolver. A customer, Jason McDaniel, rushed at Amaya and killed him after turning the gun on him, according to surveillance video. Will County, Illinois, Sheriff Paul Kaupas said Thursday that the weapon used by Amaya in this weekend's botched robbery was similar to the one used in two shootings October 5 along the Illinois-Indiana line. One person was killed and three were wounded in those shootings, police have said. In addition, Amaya's vehicle outside the Orland Park shooting matched one seen in Washington Township, Illinois, and Lowell, Indiana, where the October incidents took place, Kaupas said. The Indiana survivor, too, told detectives it was Amaya who shot him. ""The evidence at this time ... tells us that the suspect that was killed in the armed robbery at Orland Park ... does match the information from the previous homicide-slash-shooting in Lowell, Indiana,"" Kaupas said. Yet Kaupas did not go as far as saying definitively that Amaya was behind all three shootings, noting that he was awaiting results of more forensic tests. Police on Thursday did not expand on widespread reports that the gunman in the first two shootings randomly discussed honey bees before shooting his victims -- leading media to brand him ""the Honey Bee Killer."" But Kaupas did say Amaya previously worked at a hunting lodge in rural Grundy County, Illinois, where he cared for honey bees. Authorities also elaborated on Saturday's botched robbery and shooting. Orland Park Police Chief Tim McCarthy said McDaniel, who was in the shop with a worker, offered Amaya his money and explained that he had a young child. ""The comment by Amaya was, 'Whatever,'"" McCarthy said at the Thursday news conference. ""At that point, both feared for their life, that this was going to be more than a robbery."" Video shows McDaniel, 29, rushing at robber and, during the struggle, Amaya being shot. McDaniel told CNN affiliate WGN that he acted after coming to the conclusion that there was something wrong with Amaya. ""There was no ... hurry,"" McDaniel said. ""He was very calm, like he wanted to hurt somebody -- like that was his intended goal."" This weekend's shooting come more than two months after a gunman killed one construction worker and hurt two in Washington Township. An hour later and about 10 miles away in Lowell, Indiana, authorities believe the same gunman struck again -- this time firing on a farmer. Keith Dahl was shot in the left shoulder, arm and elbow, and then was robbed. The farmer talked with police detectives after this weekend's incident. ""Mr. Dahl has unequivocally identified Gary Amaya as the person who shot him,"" Lake County, Indiana, Sheriff Roy Dominguez said at Thursday's news conference. Amaya is not the first person arrested in connection with the October shootings. Lynwood, Illinois, police officer Brian Dorian was charged with first-degree murder, but four days later was released from jail after authorities were able to verify his alibi. ""I feel horrible that Brian Dorian went through this,"" said Will County State's Attorney James W. Glasgow. ""At no time did we stop looking for exculpatory evidence.""","Gary Amaya was shot and killed Saturday while trying to rob an Illinois tanning salon .

"(CNN) -- Police have ratcheted up charges against the girlfriend of an Alabama father, days after searchers found fragmented remains they say are of the second of the man's young children, tossed along the side of a remote highway. Mobile, Alabama, police spokesman Christopher Levy said Monday that Heather Keaton would be charged with two counts of aggravated child abuse and two counts of abuse of a corpse -- one count each for the deaths of Jonathan DeBlase, 3, and his sister Natalie, 4. The children's father, John Joseph DeBlase, 27, was arrested December 3 and is now charged with two counts of murder and two counts of abuse of a corpse. John DeBlase's lawyer, Jim Sears, said Monday that his client maintains ""his innocence in regards to the death of the children."" Sears added that DeBlase might consider pleading not guilty by reason of disease or mental defect (equivalent to an insanity plea in other jurisdictions). The investigation kicked off November 18, when Keaton told Louisville, Kentucky, police that she needed protection from DeBlase, who she claimed was holding her against her will. She was arrested in early December and charged, at the time, with two counts of willful abuse and neglect of a child. Around 1 a.m. Monday, Keaton arrived from Kentucky to face the four additional charges, according Levy. By early in the afternoon, she had not been questioned by Mobile police. Her arrest followed the discovery Saturday morning of remains that authorities believe are those of young Natalie DeBlase. Searchers had planned to canvas woods abutting a six-mile stretch of highway just northwest of Citronelle, Alabama, about 50 miles north of Mobile, based on information provided by John DeBlase. But they found the remains -- less than half of a young body, including a skull and miscellaneous bones -- around 9 a.m., within 30 minutes of starting the search. ""We didn't cover hardly any of it, because we found her so quickly,"" said Levy. ""She was where he said she would be."" Levy said the girl was not buried, but had been laid ""in the woods, not far from the roadway,"" just as DeBlase had told authorities. The Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences is examining the remains to confirm that they belonged to Natalie. The girl was last seen in March, when authorities believe she was killed. Jonathan DeBlase had not been seen since June, police said. Investigators believe he was slain around that time. Remains that police believe are those of the young boy were found last Wednesday near Vancleave, Mississippi. The cause of death for both sets of remains has not yet been determined, police said. DeBlase and Keaton blame each other for the siblings' deaths, authorities said. Police, who did not know the children were missing until November 19, contend that DeBlase allowed Keaton to abuse the children by restraining them with tape, putting socks in their mouths and confining them. A day earlier, Keaton signed a domestic violence petition in Louisville that said, ""I feel he may have murdered his children, because he said they were non-responsive. He would not let me check on them."" She said DeBlase had told her ""choices were made ... and he had to do what he had to do."" According to a police complaint, DeBlase between March 1 and November 19 allowed Keaton to tape Natalie's hands and feet, put a sock in her mouth and place her in a suitcase that was put in a closet for 14 hours. He also allowed Keaton to tape Jonathan's hands to the side of his legs, tape a broom handle to his back, place a sock in his mouth and then make the child stand in a corner all night when the couple went to bed, according to the complaint. DeBlase and Keaton have one infant daughter together, according to Keaton's account in the Kentucky police report. Police said one reason Keaton claimed she needed protection from DeBlase was that she feared for the safety of the infant, who was with her in Kentucky. HLN's Natisha Lance contributed to this report.","NEW: John DeBlase maintains his innocence in his children's deaths, his lawyer says .

"Washington (CNN) -- New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an Independent, joins several leading Democrats, Republicans and other Independent political leaders in the launch of a new group that hopes to find non-partisan solutions to some of the nation's problems and to impact the next Congressional session. The organization, known as No Labels, kicked off Monday in New York with a series of panels discussing some key political problems in America, such as hyper-partisanship and electoral reform. During the day the group's leaders and speakers explore how it can help find common ground to help solve those and other issues. Besides Bloomberg, among those participating in the kick-off: Sens. Evan Bayh, D-Indiana; Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York; Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia; Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut; Reps. Mike Castle, R-Delaware and Bob Inglis, R-South Carolina; former Republican congressman Tom Davis and Republican Florida Governor Charlie Crist, who ran for Senate this year as an Independent. Later in the day during the kick-off event Bloomberg is expected to speak about non-partisan redistricting. ""Parties have a place, but party loyalty, I don't think, should get in the way of doing what you as an elected official believes what's right. I think that's what most of the public wants,"" Bloomberg told NBC's Meet the Press Sunday. Led by columnist and CNN contributor John Avlon, Republican political consultant Mark McKinnon, Democratic consultant Kiki McLean, and veteran Democratic fundraiser Nancy Jacobson who conceived the idea, the No Labels group aims to look at politics through a new prism and wants to urge political leaders not to abandon their political labels but set them aside in order help find solutions. ""No Labels will create a space where ideas can be judged on the merits, not their conformity to pre-fabricated stereotypes. The point is not whether America moves left or right; it's whether we move forward. And that's what the majority of Americans are yearning for,"" the group described as its mission. Veteran political analyst Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution said it will be difficult for this type of group to change the political dynamics. ""They are obviously confronting very strong head winds,"" he told CNN but added ""why not throw something into the mix."" Bloomberg grabbed national headlines and renewed talk he might mount an independent run for the presidency in 2012  with a high profile speech last week saying government needs to chart ""a middle way"" to help fix the economy and criticized the partisanship in today's government. ""The country is growing more and more frustrated with government's inability to keep America prosperous and fair and more skeptical that the jobs we need are coming soon. As families struggle to get by, they have seen little but partisan gridlock, political pandering and legislative influence-peddling,"" Bloomberg said as he outlined steps to tackle unemployment, spur job creation and push growth. ""Both parties follow the mood of the moment -- instead of leading from the front. They incite anger instead of addressing it -- for their own partisan interests."" Bloomberg's participation in the No Labels group is helping to stoke the speculation. ""You can see why Bloomberg is involved,"" Mann told CNN. It helps ""to create a market for an independent candidacy."" ""We have seen these efforts before to explore some alternative, a third party candidacy ...they haven't gone anywhere,"" Mann added. On Sunday Bloomberg denied any intentions of seeking the presidency. ""I'm not going to run for president, the job.  I have a great job. I'm going to finish my 1,100 whatever number of days it is left go to, and I'll leave the politics to the experts,"" he told NBC's Meet the Press. When pressed he repeated his stance. ""I'm not looking at the possibility of running. I've got a great job.  And I'm going to stay with this."" Recently there have been some bipartisan initiatives in Washington to try to come up with solutions particularly regarding the nation's growing debt, including the presidentially appointed commission. However, political experts are doubtful those initiatives will result in any concrete action in the near future. ""I am skeptical of any short-term agreement between the two parties on the big fiscal questions confronting the country. There are real differences"" that will have to be argued out in the political process, Mann said. With the Republicans taking control of the House next month, it is unclear whether Washington's partisan atmosphere will improve because of necessity or get worse. Princeton University political science professor Fred Greenstein pointed to the compromise for the temporary extension of the Bush-era tax cuts reached by the White House and congressional Republicans as a sign compromise is possible. As for the new No Labels group, Greenstein for one said it could help. ""If they are trying to join the crowd let's work together rather than sink together, I think they will be widely perceived as doing something useful,"" he told CNN. ""I think they add to kind of a groundswell of recognition"" that government officials should strive for that type of cooperation. Both Mann and Greenstein said any effort that could help bring some honesty and clarity to the political debate will help the process. Group officials say they expect more than 1,000 ordinary citizens from all 50 states to participate in the launch event Monday. They are aiming to build chapters in all 435 congressional districts. Polls after the mid-term election show Americans want political leaders to reach across the political aisle to get things done. Forty-seven percent said it is more important to compromise to get things done than to stick to their beliefs, according to a USA Today-Gallup poll last month. According to state registration statistics, about a quarter of Americans on average consider themselves as independent. In several states the number of people registered as independents tops those affiliated with either political party: Alaska, Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island .","The group kicks off Monday with a series of panels .

"(CNN) -- A group of Chilean miners who spent 69 days trapped underground have traveled to Britain as the guests of football team Manchester United. A collapse at the San Esteban mine in Chile on August 5 left 33 men stranded, but they were rescued amid jubilant scenes as the world's media watched in October. Twenty-three of those miners are visiting England, having been invited to cities around the world after becoming international celebrities. They took part in a training session with United manager Alex Ferguson at the club's Carrington headquarters on Monday ahead of watching that night's Premier League visit by title rivals Arsenal. ""It's fantastic that they're coming,"" the 68-year-old told United's website. ""These are people who showed real substance and perseverance to make sure they survived. There are examples in life which you should always take note of. ""I mean, the life of a miner, having to work in the bowels of the earth and not being able to see anything. That's a great sacrifice to earn your living. I'm sure they'll enjoy themselves on their trip."" Former United star Bobby Charlton also met the club's South American guests. ""I can't believe these are the same people the whole world dropped everything for,"" Charlton said. ""You took it in your stride and everyone around the world is very proud of you."" Last month the miners were saluted with a standing ovation at the CNN Heroes event in Los Angeles, California. Heroes show opens with salute to Chilean miners . In October Manchester United invited them to visit, while Spanish football star David Villa sent two shirts from his club team Barcelona to the families of the men while they were still trapped to show his sympathy. Former Chile defender Elias Figueroa, who played in three World Cups and collected 47 caps for his country, accompanied the miners on their trip.","Manchester United have welcomed 23 of the rescued Chilean miners to the club .

"(CNN) -- A California county sheriff said on Friday that a couple executed what he called a ""cold, calculating plan"" to lure a mother to their home, strangle her, then run off with her baby. Merced County sheriff's deputies Wednesday arrested Teresa Ceja Robles, 33, and her husband, Jose Augustine Velarde, 37, and charged them with murdering Ana Lila Diaz DeCeja inside their Planada house. The victim's infant boy reunited with his surviving family members, including his father and grandmother, the following night -- nine days after being abandoned in frigid conditions on a stranger's front stoop. Sheriff Mark Pazin told HLN's ""Nancy Grace"" that the pair killed the 26-year-old woman because they wanted to have her two-month-old boy, a desire that began after Diaz let Robles hold the baby in a medical clinic shortly after his birth. ""That's when she fell in love with the infant and had to have that baby,"" Pazin said of Robles. ""The only word I can use to categorize (their actions) is despicable. It's just bizarre."" Neighbors last saw Diaz and her young son together December 2, getting into a blue 2002 Chevrolet Avalanche in Planada, the sheriff's office said. Pazin said that Robles and Velarde got Diaz to come over to their house, where the mother ""was ""immediately attacked by the husband, savagely strangled ... and lit on fire to hide the evidence."" A charred body, identified using dental records as that of Diaz, was found later that day in an almond orchard in Snelling, less than a 30-mile drive to the north. Pazin said Friday that the couple had ""an absolute plan (for) every move they made."" Beyond befriending Diaz, the sheriff said that store surveillance video shows Robles shopping for baby items on the same day -- December 2 -- that she and her husband allegedly kidnapped the boy and killed his mother. Robles had three children of her own before the incident, and she and her husband even introduced the baby to them. But eventually, the couple decided to change course. The couple told detectives that they planned to tell Robles' children that the infant had gone to a nearby Fresno hospital and, in a few days, ""were going to then tell the children that the little infant had died,"" according to Pazin. ""They were compounding what they had already done,"" the sheriff said. ""And here, they had wanted to raise this little infant."" Pazin credited ""intense media scrutiny"" with turning up the heat on Robles and Velarde, who eventually dropped the baby off on a doorstep four days after allegedly kidnapping him. On Thursday, members of Diaz's family -- including her husband and mother -- gathered for a bittersweet reunion with the baby boy, whom they had not seen in nearly two weeks. ""This is really a joyful moment, and we are really happy to have (the baby) here,"" the victim's brother Rodolfo Diaz told CNN affiliate KPGE. ""But still, we want justice for my sister.""","NEW: A California sheriff says a couple schemed to kill a mother and steal her baby .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was in Haiti on Sunday, urging the U.S government and other Americans to do more to help the earthquake-ravaged country. ""Not to get political, but if some of the politicians would come here and see the conditions perhaps they would see the need for, say, a military airlift to bring the supplies that are so needed here,"" she said. Palin spoke at a brief press conference at a warehouse owned by the Samaritan's Purse organization north of Port-au-Prince. ""(I) don't want Americans to forget the need that is here,"" she said. ""More importantly, for Americans and people across the world to know what an individual can do to make a difference, to contribute, to kind of get out of your comfort zone and volunteer to help."" Palin praised Samaritan's Purse for ""doing God's work."" Samaritan's Purse describes itself on its website as ""a nondenominational evangelical Christian organization providing spiritual and physical aid to hurting people around the world."" Palin said she would not take questions from reporters. ""The reason I won't be answering questions is because we don't need to be getting political here today,"" Palin said. The former Republican vice-presidential nominee thanked her husband and daughter Bristol for joining her on the trip and said she hopes Bristol could help raise awareness of Haiti's needs among young people. As she was whisked off the makeshift stage to her waiting car, Palin answered one question from CNN's Gary Tuchman, who asked what was different from what she expected to find in Haiti. ""Much harsher than I had expected, the conditions are much rougher,"" Palin replied. Palin is widely thought to be considering a run for president in 2012. Her visit comes as Haiti is fighting a massive cholera outbreak that has killed more than 2,000 people and sickened nearly 100,000. The country has been struggling to recover from January's massive earthquake that left more than 220,000 dead. A disputed presidential election has threatened to plunge the country into further chaos.","Palin holds a brief press conference outside Port-au-Prince .

"(CNN) -- If recent trends are any indication, cartoon self-caricatures are becoming more popular than the clichéd photo in the mirror headshot. Cartoon avatars, both classic and new, are hot right now. The cartoon-spawning series ""Mad Men"" is back. The critically and commercially successful AMC show about 1960s ad execs has revived its popular ""Mad Men Yourself"" campaign, which lets you create an animated doppelganger that smokes like a train and wouldn't be out of place in a film noir. Since ""Mad Men Yourself"" launched a year ago, thousands of people adorned their Facebook profiles with the retro caricatures. The trend was not unlike the personalized knockoffs of Shepard Fairley's striking Obama Hope design during the 2008 presidential election. The Wall Street Journal, which is mentioned in the ""Mad Men"" season opener, created an iconic ""hedcut"" of the show's lead character, Don Draper. In other words, the WSJ made a real hedcut of a fake person on a TV show, just as ""Mad Men Yourself"" encouraged real people to make fake versions of themselves. One artist, David Lanham, uses Apple's iPhone 4 video-chat capabilities to create user avatars. For $50, Lanham will do a cartoon portrait of you after chatting with you for about 20 minutes via the phone's FaceTime app. Lanham is not basing the portraits on photos but on videos -- although he will snap a screen shot of you for reference if he needs it. Will this cartoon-avatar trend last? Probably not for long, as people may get sick of looking the same as all their Facebook friends. But it may return with the next easily modifiable cartoon-portrait app. In the meantime, feel free to pre-emptively block the return of the bathroom mirror self-portrait -- there's a Facebook group for it.","The AMC show ""Mad Men"" has revived its popular ""Mad Men Yourself"" campaign .

"Washington (CNN) -- Leaders around the world Tuesday mourned the death of the diplomat who spearheaded the end of the Bosnian war on the 15th anniversary of the peace deal he helped design. Richard C. Holbrooke, 69, died Monday after doctors performed surgery to repair a tear in his aorta. He most recently served as the Obama administration's point man in the volatile Afghan-Pakistani war zone. ""You've got to stop this war in Afghanistan,"" he told a Pakistani surgeon at George Washington University Hospital as he was being sedated for surgery, according to a senior administration official. That was one of his final comments, the official said. Holbrooke was perhaps best known for his role as the chief architect of the Dayton Peace Accords -- signed December 14, 1995 -- which ended the deadly ethnic conflict that erupted during the breakup of Yugoslavia. ""I had the honor and privilege of working with Richard through many international crises over several decades, most particularly the wars in Bosnia and Kosovo,"" former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said. ""He could always be counted on for his imagination, dedication and forcefulness."" After President Barack Obama took office in 2008, Holbrooke took one of the toughest diplomatic assignments -- U.S. special  representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, the region Obama regards as critical to the fight against terrorism. Holbrooke's assertive style worked in the Balkans, but it brought perils for diplomats in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where long stretches of chatting and tea-drinking are the norm. He was frank in his assessments about the region and officials in both countries regarded him as abrasive, including Afghan President Hamid Karzai. In April 2009, there were reports of a heated argument between Holbrooke and Karzai after charges of fraud surfaced in the Afghan presidential election. Karzai's office issued a brief statement Tuesday, describing Holbrooke as ""a veteran and seasoned diplomat who had served greatly to the government and the people of the United States."" ""Achieving peace and stabilization of a country with complex realities on the ground, as well as in the region, is not an overnight task, but there was no doubt that he was pursuing his mission not only objectively, professionally and patriotically as an American, but at the same time as a friend of Afghanistan,"" said Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, Afghanistan's former foreign minister. ""That was what we admired most."" In an interview with CNN, Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari called Holbrooke an ""extremely hard-working man"" who can ""get things done which would otherwise take weeks to get through."" One of the world's most recognizable diplomats, Holbrooke's career spanned from the Vietnam War era to the war against the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, coinciding with presidencies of the past five decades, from John F. Kennedy to Barack Obama. He also worked as a journalist and an investment banker. But as a diplomat, he was plain-speaking, accessible, and known for his tough-mindedness. Obama called Holbrooke ""a true giant of American foreign policy who has made America stronger, safer, and more respected."" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the nation had lost ""one of its fiercest champions and most dedicated public servants."" ""He was the consummate diplomat, able to stare down dictators and stand up for America's interests and values even under the most difficult circumstances,"" Clinton's statement said. ""Few people have ever left a larger mark on the State Department or our country."" A statement appearing on numerous radical Islamist websites used Holbrooke's death to condemn the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan. ""People cannot turn a blind eye to the presence of (U.S. and allied) troops and cannot be fooled by (Gen. David) Petraeus, Holbrooke and others who should know that their fate is a scandal, madness, fainting, or worse than that,"" the statement read. Shortly after taking office, Obama appointed Holbrooke to the special representative job and Holbrooke dove in headfirst to tackle the challenges. In an October interview with CNN, Holbrooke cautioned patience in the struggle against the militants and for democracy in the so-called AfPak region, a mission that he said was of the ""most vital importance to our national security interests."" ""We are determined to see it through,"" he said, and he made reference to the Vietnam War and the Dayton Accords in his insights. He noted that dealing with so many foes on both sides of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border made the process difficult. ""A peace deal requires agreements, and you don't make agreements with your friends, you make agreements with your enemies,"" he said. Holbrooke mentioned a range of militant groups, such as the Afghan Taliban, the Pakistani Taliban, the Haqqani Network, and Lashkar-e Tayyiba, and noted that ""an expert could add another 30."" ""There's no Ho Chi Minh. There's no Slobodan Milosevic. There's no Palestinian Authority. There is a widely dispersed group of -- of people that we roughly call the enemy. There's al Qaeda, with which there's no possibility of any discussion at all."" ""There is no clear single address that you go to,"" Holbrooke said. CNN's Jill Dougherty, Nic Robertson, Joe Sterling and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","President Obama calls Holbrooke a true giant of U.S. foreign policy .

"(CNN) -- England's Lee Westwood showed no signs of buckling under the pressure of his new status as golf's world number one, hitting a round of 70 to sit one shot behind leader Francesco Molinari after day two of the HSBC Champions challenge in Shanghai, China. The Italian led the field on Friday, after a two-round score of nine-under-par gave him a one-shot lead over Westwood, with the man who was displaced at the top of world rankings, Tiger Woods, five shots off the lead. South African Ernie Els was the day's big mover, his round of 65 put him within two shots of the lead on seven-under-par, alongside compatriot Jaco Van Zyl and Richard Ramsay of Scotland. The English pair of Luke Donald and Ross Fisher are currently on six-under and five-under respectively, with Westwood's rivals for number one status, Martin Kaymer, and defending champion Phil Mickelson, both six shots off the lead on three-under. Westwood had no complaints over his form, and was pleased with his performance given his recent lack of competitive action and injury problems. ""It's a good performance the first two rounds to come back to,"" Westwood told the PGA Tour's official website. ""I didn't know what to expect, and I'm pleasantly surprised with how well I've played."" Woods was in philosophical mood when discussing his round, admitting his score could have gone either way.

"(CNN) -- On my last day on a visit to Beirut, Lebanon, I participated in a long conversation with a Hamas political leader. I agreed that the conversation would be off the record, but without direct quotation, I can summarize what was said. The peace process between Israel and the Palestinian Authority is dead, in the view of Hamas. Likewise, economic growth in the West Bank is illusory, a product only of Western aid. The Palestinians are divided, and the international community has lost interest in us. That might sound like a negative assessment. Yet my Hamas interlocutor insisted that today's desperate outlook would soon yield to tomorrow's glorious victory. With the peace process dead, the Palestinian Authority would break apart. West Bank Palestinians would realign themselves with Hamas. Those who refused would be eliminated as collaborators. The Hamas man did tacitly acknowledge that Palestinian attacks on Israel have failed in the past. He declined to agree that the 2000-2003 intifada was a failure or that Hamas had been defeated in the December 2008 Gaza war. But he did not argue that these wars were successes either. But next time, things would be different, the ""resistance"" would be global: Hamas, he suggested, would call Muslims around the world to join the fight against Israel, just as Muslims worldwide joined together in Afghanistan in the 1980s to fight the Soviet Union. This next fight -- he said -- would force Israel to rethink its continued existence. He said that just as his generation was more radical than his father's, so the next generation would be more radical than his own. The Hamas man asked with sinister humor: ""If you Americans care so much about the Israelis, why don't you give them California?"" The tone was defiant, belligerent, confident. Yet through it all, I also heard a despairing undertone. The Hamas man lamented that nobody understands Hamas. Those who try to talk to them -- like U.S. president Jimmy Carter -- end up paying a heavy political price. He veered from boasting that they would never negotiate with the Israelis to complaining that Israel had ignored their offer of a truce in 2004. He claimed the flotilla organizers who tried to bring aid to Hamas-controlled Gaza had achieved a great success -- then later complained that nothing had changed, that Israel controlled the flow of goods into Gaza as tightly as ever. The plan seemed to be: for Hamas and the radical Palestinians to suffer defeat after defeat until finally Israel collapsed. That does not sound like a very good plan. Earlier on the trip, another Hamas representative had explained this point of view very succinctly: ""To emerge from the fight with your steadfastness undiminished: that is victory."" But actually ... no it's not victory. Fighting and losing, followed by more fighting and more losing is a formula for prolonging the pain of defeat. Hamas promises its supporters a far-off day of apocalyptic retribution and redemption. If my source is right, there will be another outburst of violence soon. Almost certainly it will end the way the previous rounds of violence have ended. Israel will be left standing more strong and secure and prosperous than ever - and its attackers will be more frozen in their refusal to do the thing most necessary to end this conflict: recognize Israel, reject war, and make the best deal they can get based on today's realities. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Hamas political leader expects peace process to fail .

"(CNN) -- Chinese President Hu Jintao has topped the list of Forbes magazine's list of the world's most powerful people, besting U.S. President Barack Obama who slipped to the second spot. The magazine said it used four criteria to define power -- whether the person has influence over a lot of people; whether they have significant wealth compared to their peers; whether they are powerful in more than one sphere and whether they actively wield power. In that respect, said the magazine, the editors picked Hu as the most powerful man in the world. The annual list was released Wednesday evening. As the leader of China, Hu presides over 1.3 billion people -- one-fifth of the world's population, and over the world's largest army. Under him, China has become the world's second-largest economy. And, says Forbes, ""Unlike Western counterparts, Hu can divert rivers, build cities, jail dissidents and censor Internet without meddling from pesky bureaucrats, courts."" Julian Assange, the editor of WikiLeaks, makes the list (No. 68), as does Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg (No. 40). In addition, several accused criminals do too, including al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden (No. 57). The top 10 most powerful people, according to the magazine: . 1. Hu Jintao, president of China . 2.

"(CNN) -- The Liberian president dismissed all but one of her Cabinet ministers this week in a move she says will help give her administration a fresh start. President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf announced Thursday that she has asked her Cabinet to ""take administrative leave effective immediately."" She made the announcement during an emergency meeting the night before. The administration is entering a critical stretch and this provides an opportunity to start with a fresh slate, she said in a news release. Johnson-Sirleaf -- currently the only elected female head of state in Africa -- is up for re-election next year. The mandate will not create a power vacuum, she said. Designated deputies will take over until Cabinet leaders are asked to return or their successors appointed, according to the statement. ""Cabinet restructuring will be made in the shortest possible time and ... several ministers could be reappointed,"" she said. The president urged commitment from those who will make it to the next phase. ""I want this administration to be the most effective going forward,"" she said. Ministers who are overseas on assignment will not be affected by the directive until they complete their missions. One minister retained his position amid the shakeup. Edward McClain, the minister of state for presidential affairs, will work with Vice President Joseph Boakai while the president is out of the country. Other government agencies may also undergo a shakeup, according to the president. The Harvard-educated economist and grandmother of eight took the helm in 2006 after a bloody civil war that left her country in shambles. Liberia faced 14 years of civil war and strife under the Charles Taylor regime that ended in 2003. Johnson-Sirleaf has said she is rallying world support to get the nation back on its feet. The president's political resilience and tough reputation have earned her the nickname ""Iron Lady.""

"Sydney, Australia (CNN) -- A design issue rather than poor maintenance is likely to blame for the mid-flight failure of a Qantas airliner's engine, the CEO of the Australian carrier said Friday. One of the four engines on the Qantas Airbus A380 shut down six minutes after takeoff Thursday from Singapore's Changi Airport, forcing it to return and make an emergency landing. The plane -- with 440 passengers and 26 crew members -- was headed to Sydney, Australia. But while above the western Indonesian island of Batam, part of the engine's covering, or cowling, tore off. ""This issue does not relate to maintenance; this is an engine issue,"" CEO Alan Joyce told reporters Friday. ""And the engines have been maintained by Rolls-Royce since they've been installed on the aircraft."" ""So we believe that this is probably most likely a material failure or some sort of design issue that we're tracking and trying to understand,"" he added. ""We don't believe this is related to maintenance in any way."" On Friday, Airbus announced that it had asked all operators of A380s with Rolls-Royce engines to inspect them as a precaution. Following the Qantas CEO's comments, a Rolls-Royce spokesman referred back to his company's earlier news statement, which said: . ""Since Qantas QF32 suffered an engine failure and returned safely to Singapore Changi Airport, we have been working closely with our customer and the authorities. In situations like these, Rolls-Royce has well established processes to collect and understand information relating to the event and to determine suitable actions."" After the incident, Qantas -- Australia's national airline -- grounded its Airbus A380 fleet. The airline said flights of the twin-deck planes -- the world's largest airliners -- will remain suspended until an investigation is complete. On Friday, Joyce said Qantas hopes to resume A380 flights within 48 hours, after completing engine safety checks. ""We believe over the next 24 to 48 hours, those checks will be complete on all of the A380s, and if we don't find any adverse findings out of the checks, the aircraft will resume operations,"" he said. Qantas has six A380s in its fleet of 191 planes. Airbus will at some point deliver 14 more, the airline said. Passengers on the detoured Qantas flight spent the night in Singapore, then flew to Australia on Friday. ""Passengers left on a special Qantas flight at 10:30 a.m. local back to Sydney,"" said airline representative Ashley Edwards Knapp. CNN's Zain Verjee and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","NEW: Airbus requests inspections on all 380s with Rolls-Royce engines .

"(CNN) -- The Swedish security police have launched an investigation into ""unlawful intelligence activities"" conducted by the U.S. Embassy in Stockholm, according to a statement released Saturday. The investigation was opened one day after the U.S. Embassy there told authorities its employees had been conducting surveillance activities, similar to what was recently discovered in Norway, according to the security police statement. The work was primarily aimed at protecting the American embassy, the security police said. The scale of surveillance is not known, but according to the statement, operations have been ongoing since 2000. They were conducted without the knowledge of the Foreign Affairs office, the Justice Department, the security or the local police in Sweden, the statement said. ""I think it's regrettable they have conducted these activities without informing Swedish authorities,"" Sweden's Justice Minister Beatrice Ask told reporters Saturday, as reported by CNN affiliate TV4. ""I think it is very serious if these activities have been carried out in breach of Swedish law,"" she added. The U.S. Embassy in Stockholm released a statement Saturday that recognized the existence of a program to detect suspicious activities around U.S. facilities, and pointed to past terrorist attacks as evidence for why such a program is necessary. ""It is not a secret program, nor is it an intelligence program,"" the embassy said. ""The United States fully respects Swedish law, and welcomes Justice Minister Ask's remarks at her press conference. The U.S. stands ready to answer any questions the Government of Sweden might ask us on this program."" Anders Thornberg, head of the security measures department at the security police, said it is too soon to say whether the work was a breach of Swedish law or not. ""We have contacted the head prosecutor and are now working on gathering more information to see if the activities have been a breach of Swedish law, and if so, whether we need to open a formal criminal investigation,"" Thornberg said. Also Saturday, officials from the Swedish foreign ministry met with the U.S. Ambassador to Sweden to discuss the operations, Teo Zetterman, a spokesman for the foreign ministry told CNN. ""I don't want to go into any details of what was discussed, but it was regarding their surveillance activities,"" he said. ""Sweden has good ties with the United States and it is still too early to say whether this will affect our relationship,"" he added. ""We will continue to talk with the Americans about this."" Earlier in the week, authorities in Norway launched an investigation into whether the United States engaged in illegal surveillance in the Nordic country. The investigation there followed a report by Norway's TV2, which claimed the U.S. Embassy in Oslo has been conducting an ""illegal systematic surveillance of Norwegian citizens."" The channel reported the embassy hired former police officers and defense staff to take pictures and register people who behave in a suspicious way in order to stop attacks on American targets in Norway. Without specifically mentioning TV2, the U.S. Embassy in Stockholm said it was disappointed by the story's impact. ""We regret that inflammatory and inaccurate press reporting which began in Norway about this program has caused unease and concern among some of our friends,"" the embassy said in its statement. Earlier in the week, U.S. State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley had said Norwegian authorities were fully informed of the program. A similar kind of surveillance has been reported by media organizations in Denmark and Germany. Danish TV2 has said the same kind of group operating in Oslo has also been working for a number of years at the American Embassy in Copenhagen. Frankfurter Rundschau, a German newspaper, reported American and German security experts have monitored activities around the American Embassy in Berlin.","Security police say it's too early to say whether the activities broke Swedish law .

"New York (CNN) -- Rapper Ja Rule will face two years in prison after pleading guilty to attempted criminal possession of a weapon on Monday, according to a Manhattan District Attorney statement. The 34-year-old hip-hop star, whose real name is Jeff Atkins, faced a single second-degree weapons charge after police found a loaded semi-automatic firearm -- with the serial number scratched off -- hidden in the backseat of his luxury Maybach sedan, the statement said. The incident occurred on New York's Upper West Side in July 2007, it said. Atkins, who was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2001, will be registered as a gun offender, according to the statement. ""Despite having some of the strongest anti-gun laws in the nation, gun violence continues to plague this city,"" District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said. ""Gun crimes are serious offenses, and today's guilty plea should send a serious message to anyone thinking of illegally bringing a gun into New York City."" Atkins' attorney, Stacey Richman, called the deliberations ""unreasonable"" after the rapper ""stepped up and took responsibility"" for the violation. Monday's ruling comes less than a week after a months-long police sting led to the arrest of a 20-year-old accused of dealing cocaine and guns; he was charged with selling 25 illegal firearms to an undercover detective, prosecutors said. Shootings, and homicides by way of shootings, increased slightly in Manhattan this year, while nearly a quarter of the 240 defendants indicted on gun possession charges in 2010 were identified as 18 years old or younger, according to the district attorney's office. ""These are kids that should be headed to school, not a prison cell or an early grave,"" Vance said. ""So we have a full-court press on those who possess loaded firearms in Manhattan, or who those sell loaded firearms.""","Ja Rule will face two years in prison after pleading guilty to gun charges .

"(CNN Student News) -- April 16, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Blacksburg, Virginia  • Iceland • Kyrgyzstan . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Some fast facts to get us going today: I'm Carl Azuz. This is CNN Student News. Fridays are awesome! Today's show is out of this world, or at least, that's where it starts. First Up: Space Strategy . AZUZ: Space. What parts of it are we going to explore? How much money are we going to spend to get there? President Obama has a new strategy that answers those questions. He talked about it in a speech at the Kennedy Space Center yesterday. The president says he is 100 percent committed to NASA and its mission. He's proposing that the agency get an additional $6 billion over the next 5 years, with a goal of sending humans to Mars by the 2030s. But under this plan, what you won't see is this: people walking on the moon. President Obama's strategy would cancel plans to send astronauts back there. He says, ""We've been there before. There's a lot more of space to explore."" Buzz Aldrin, one of the first men to walk on the moon, agrees with the president. But Aldrin's NASA crewmate, Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, disagrees. He's part of a group of astronauts that have criticized the president's plan. Other NASA officials argue that the proposal could cost thousands of people their jobs. The president believes it's a way to move forward. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: This is the next chapter that we can write together here at NASA. We will partner with industry, we will invest in cutting-edge research and technology. We will set far-reaching milestones and provide the resources to reach those milestones. And step by step, we will push the boundaries, not only of where we can go, but what we can do. Mine Safety . AZUZ: The president's also ordering a review of mines that have bad safety records. This comes after last week's tragedy at the Upper Big Branch Mine in West Virginia. President Obama has criticized the company that owns the mine, specifically because of its safety record. The company called that criticism ""regrettable"" and said the president may be misinformed about the mine's safety record. Meantime, the governor of West Virginia has asked all of the state's miners to show up for work today. But instead of producing coal, he wants them to spend the day re-evaluating safety procedures. GOV. JOE MANCHIN, (D) WEST VIRGINIA: What better honor can we give those fallen miners than to say we're gonna dedicate this day, re-evaluate, have seminars, re-inspect. And those that have repeated violations will be heavily inspected. That's all we can do in honor of those miners, so that we never have another family or miner go through this. Tea Party Rally . AZUZ: Switching over to politics, the Tea Party movement is getting ready for the midterm elections coming up in November. The group has released a list of ""heroes and targets."" The ""heroes"" on the list are candidates that the Tea Party plans to support in the elections. The ""targets"" are anyone that the group would like to see voted out of office. Of course, lists are not the only way that the Tea Party gets its message out. Rallies are the group's bread and butter. This one in Washington, D.C. yesterday was wrapping up a three-week tour across the U.S. The timing: no coincidence. Yesterday, of course, was Tax Day, and the group is opposed to what it sees as government overspending. VA Tech Remembrance . AZUZ: In Blacksburg, Virginia and all over the U.S., people are taking time today to honor the victims of a deadly shooting. It happened on the campus of Virginia Tech University three years ago today. Police say a student at the school went on a shooting spree, killing 32 people before killing himself. Today, Virginia Tech and the local community are holding memorial ceremonies like this remembrance run from last year. Candlelight vigils and a community arts project are also scheduled to mark the day. Word to the Wise . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: A Word to the Wise... dormant (adjective) temporarily inactive, or in a state of no external activity . source: www.m-w.com . Iceland Volcano . AZUZ: A volcano in Iceland had been dormant for more than 180 years. But then a few weeks ago, this started. The volcano is erupting, and some scientists say it could last for more than a year. That's about how long it went the last time this happened. That was back in the 1820s. This time, the impact is being felt all across Europe. Here, you see London's Heathrow Airport, planes on the ground. Where you don't see them is in the sky. The UK is not alone in this. More than half a dozen countries canceled flights yesterday; up to 6,000 total across the European continent. The problem is ash. When the volcano erupted, it sent this huge cloud of smoke and ash high up into the air. If a jet were to fly through that, it could cause the plane's engines to shut down. So, that's why there are so many cancellations. Rob Marciano looks at how weather and winds are playing a part in all of this. ROB MARCIANO, CNN WEATHER ANCHOR: The way the weather pattern is set up right now -- and Iceland, obviously, to the north -- but we've got this funky upper air pattern about 30,000 feet, which is where that ash went to, up where the jets fly. And it's scooting around towards Scandinavia, back through parts of the UK and also into other parts of Western Europe. Here is the, here it is on the infrared satellite picture. You see it right there kind of heading this way. That's the cloud itself. Kyrgyzstan Unrest . AZUZ: Major political change in Kyrgyzstan. The president of the central Asian country has resigned. Kurmanbek Bakiev left for neighboring Kazakhstan yesterday after he was forced out of power last week. This was all part of a deal between Bakiev and Kyrgyzstan's new government. Russia, the United States and several international groups helped in the negotiations. Kyrgyzstan's temporary government told the U.S. State Department that it plans to hold elections in six months. The U.S. says it hopes that Kyrgyzstan will become a model for democracy in the region. The country is important to the U.S. because there's a military base there. And that base supports NATO operations in Afghanistan. Shoutout . MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: As we wrap up National Library Week, today's Shoutout goes out to all the librarians out there! Where would you find the largest library in the world? Is it in: A) Athens, B) London, C) Washington, D.C. or D) Cairo? You've got three seconds -- GO!

Who she shares them with, and why, are what make Mackenzie a CNN Hero. (BEGIN VIDEO) MACKENZIE BEARUP, CNN HERO: I was in the fifth grade when I hurt my knee. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ready? BEARUP: Yeah, I'm ready. The doctor diagnosed me with reflex sympathetic dystrophy. When something touches it, it's like a bomb goes off in my knee. Even though I've tried many different treatments, the only thing able to get my mind off the pain was reading. Do you guys like to read? My pediatrician told me about a home for abused children. Any child being in horrible pain like this, they need something, and something that I knew that helped me was books. OK. This is called ""Screaming Millie."" But the people in these shelters are just like you and me. They need things to get their mind off of whatever they're going through. I put flyers in mailboxes and I set up a Web site. Thank you so much for donating. My original goal was to get 300 books. Before I knew it, I had 3,000 books. My total right now is 38,000 books. And I've delivered books to libraries and reading rooms in 27 different shelters in six states. And take as many books as you want. If one child finds a love of reading through books I've given them, then that will help them in school and just turn their life around entirely. I really think that reading can do that for someone.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Senate approved a controversial $858 billion tax cut package Wednesday, overwhelmingly voting to extend the Bush-era tax reductions despite a series of objections from both the left and the right. The measure passed 81-19 to advance to the House of Representatives, which will take it up on Thursday, according to Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland. The package includes a two-year extension of the Bush-era tax cuts set to expire December 31. It also would extend unemployment benefits for 13 months, cut the payroll tax by 2 percentage points for a year, restore the estate tax at a lower level and continue a series of other tax breaks. President Barack Obama praised the vote and urged the House of Representatives to quickly approve the bill, which the White House negotiated with Senate GOP leaders. The Senate vote is ""a win for American families, American businesses, and our economic recovery,"" Obama said in a written statement. ""As this bill moves to the House ... I hope that members from both parties can come together in a spirit of common purpose to protect American families and our economy as a whole by passing this essential economic package."" House Democrats, however, have repeatedly warned that they may change the measure, particularly a provision dealing with the estate tax. Currently, the estate tax is scheduled to exempt inheritances up to $1 million and tax amounts above that at a rate of 55%. Under the tax package, it would be reduced to a rate of 35% on amounts above a $5 million individual exemption. Conservatives argue that a full return of the estate tax would, among other things, make it nearly impossible for many family-owned small businesses to be passed down from one generation to the next. Liberals contend that a lower or nonexistent estate tax would merely benefit the wealthy while doing little to aid the economy. A number of House Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, want to change the estate tax to levels previously approved in a separate House bill that would exempt inheritances up to $3.5 million and tax amounts above that at a 45% rate. Pelosi said Wednesday the change would bring in an additional $25 billion instead of providing tax protection to only 6,600 more families through the lower rate and higher exemption in the negotiated tax deal. However, more than two dozen moderate House Democrats submitted a letter to their House leadership Tuesday, calling for the tax package to be passed unchanged so it can go directly to Obama to be signed into law. ""This bipartisan compromise is by design a temporary measure and, with its passage, we must acknowledge that our work is not done,"" said the letter signed by 27 House Democrats as of Tuesday evening. ""We must continue to work together in a bipartisan fashion -- with a sense of shared responsibility -- toward solutions that address our economic and fiscal challenges. It is time for us to put aside the partisan talking points and accomplish what the American people sent us here to do.""","NEW: The House Rules Committee will allow a vote on changing the measure .

"London (CNN) -- A court in central London this week found itself in the world's spotlight, as a small army of celebrities staked their reputations by turning up to offer support -- and bail money -- to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. The 39-year-old Australian, who handed himself over to British police last week to answer a European arrest warrant over alleged sex crimes in Sweden, remains in custody pending an appeal by Swedish authorities against a judge's decision to grant him bail. Assange has vowed to fight attempts to extradite him, arguing that the charges against him are politically motivated and designed to deflect attention from the sensitive material exposed by his whistle-blowing website. Sweden to appeal bail decision Thursday . This stance has won him some high-profile backing, as was shown during the hearing Tuesday when some notable faces trooped into Westminster Magistrates Court determined to demonstrate their solidarity, even if it meant staking part of the £200,000 ($315,000) bail or a spare room in your country mansion. Despite having never personally met Assange, Ken Loach, the veteran British director of movies including ""Kes"" and ""Sweet Sixteen,"" said he had offered £20,000 ($31,444) towards his bail. ""I think the work he has done has been a public service,"" he told reporters, in quotes carried by Britain's Guardian newspaper. ""I think we are entitled to know the dealings of those that govern us."" Jemima Khan, British socialite and ex-wife of former Pakistani cricketer Imran Khan, offered a similar amount before releasing the following statement: ""I make no judgment of Julian Assange as an individual as I have never met him. I am offering my support to him as I believe in the universal right to freedom of information and our right to be told the truth."" The daughter of the late financier and politician, James Goldsmith, Khan has also been active on Twitter, and tweeted: ""What happened to innocent until proven guilty? He hasn't even been charged, let alone convicted."" Assange also found prominent support from across the Atlantic, as controversial U.S. filmmaker Michael Moore pledged $20,000 from ""his own pocket."" The director of thought-provoking documentaries such as ""Bowling for Columbine,"" which looked at U.S. gun control in the wake of 1999 Columbine High School massacre, wrote on his website that he would be offering the assistance of his website, servers, domain names and ""anything else I can do to keep WikiLeaks alive and thriving as it continues its work to expose the crimes that were concocted in secret and carried out in our name and with our tax dollars."" He added: ""We were taken to war in Iraq on a lie. Hundreds of thousands are now dead. Just imagine if the men who planned this war crime back in 2002 had had a WikiLeaks to deal with. They might not have been able to pull it off."" Meanwhile, Vaughan Smith, the founder of London's Frontline Club which claims to ""champion independent journalism,"" offered to accommodate Assange, who has no British address, at his sprawling family home in order to meet another of the bail conditions issued by the court Tuesday. Assange would also be electronically tagged and required to report daily to a police station close by. In a statement on his website he explained that his support was being offered ""on a point of principle."" He added: ""In the face of a concerted attempt to shut him down and after a decade since 9/11 that has been characterized by manipulation of the media by the authorities, the information released by WikiLeaks is a refreshing glimpse into an increasingly opaque world. ""I am suspicious of the personal charges that have been made against Mr. Assange and hope that this will be properly resolved by the courts. Certainly no credible charges have been brought regarding the leaking of the information itself."" Other prominent supporters at the hearing included award-winning Australian journalist and documentary-maker John Pilger, British gay rights activist Peter Tatchell, and human rights activist Bianca Jagger. Pilger, a long-time critic of U.S. foreign policy, has been particularly vocal in his support for Assange and the work of WikiLeaks. However he questioned why Assange had reportedly been held in solitary confinement in London's largest prison. ""He called me from Wandsworth Prison at the weekend and his state of mind seemed pretty good,"" he told reporters, in quotes carried by Britain's Press Association. ""He is in solitary confinement. He is in what is known as a punishment block and we are not quite sure why. He is an innocent man who has not been charged with anything, sitting in solitary confinement -- what is going on?"" Tatchell, meanwhile, also appeared outside the court on Tuesday to express his support for the work of WikiLeaks. He told reporters: ""It's quite clear that the U.S. government and other governments have kept secrets hidden from us. And we the people have a right to know. These revelations are in the public interest. It's shocking that it's taken a whistleblower to bring them to our attention."" When asked about the allegations against him he replied: ""No one can know. But he is innocent until proven guilty."" However in a post on his Twitter page the previous week, he wrote: ""Julian Assange might be guilty of sex crimes. But the charges look like a fix to silence & discredit him. The US is out to destroy him."" In another post he claimed the U.S. government tried to discredit Vietnam War whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg in the 1970s. Ellsberg, a former military analyst, famously leaked the ""Pentagon Papers"" in 1971, a classified study into U.S. decision-making during the conflict. Bianca Jagger, human rights advocate and former wife of Rolling Stones singer Mick, also gave her support to Assange, telling reporters in central London that she was concerned that the case had become politicized. ""If the police have any accusations they should let him answer for them,"" she said, adding that he should be treated fairly.","Juilan Assange has vowed to fight attempts to extradite him amid sex crime claims .

"(CNN) -- Manchester City captain Carlos Tevez has revealed that he wanted to leave the English Premier League club in the previous transfer window. The Argentina forward handed in a transfer request at the weekend, which was rejected by the club -- who claimed his representatives had been seeking to renegotiate the 26-year-old's lucrative contract, which expires in 2014. British media have widely speculated that Tevez, whose family live in South America, will leave Eastlands when the transfer window reopens in January. ""I wanted to leave in the summer, but was convinced to return to the club,"" Tevez said in a statement. ""Sadly, my feelings have not changed. ""I hugely resent the management's suggestions that I have been unduly influenced by others. I am disappointed that the management should now see fit to try to portray the situation in another light."" Manchester City reject Tevez transfer request . Manchester City released a statement on Sunday to confirm that Tevez's transfer request had been rejected. ""The written transfer request is in stark contrast to Carlos' stated position in both public and club contexts,"" it said. ""Significantly, over recent months, the club has also received numerous requests from Carlos' representative to renegotiate and improve his playing contract, as well as more recently a request to extend that contract by another year."" The former Manchester United player, who has scored 10 league goals this season, made his announcement on Saturday, hours after his team's 3-1 win over West Ham lifted City to second place in the table. Toure on target for Man City . He missed that match due to suspension, and had appeared to clash with manager Roberto Mancini after being substituted against Bolton earlier this month. Tevez said he had no problems with Mancini, but wanted to leave because his relationship with ""certain executives and individuals at the club"" had broken down ""beyond repair."" Since September 2008, the club has been owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, an Abu Dhabi billionaire who has financed many high-profile player acquisitions including Spain midfielder David Silva and Ivory Coast's Yaya Toure. Tevez has been in sensational form since his arrival from United, scoring 39 goals in 59 appearances for the Citizens. His move across Manchester in mid-2009 angered his former manager Alex Ferguson, as Tevez turned down the offer of a new contract to join the club's fierce rivals.","Carlos Tevez says he wanted to leave English club Manchester City in pre-season .

"(CNN) -- The New York Jets on Monday suspended a strength and conditioning coach through the 2010 season's playoffs for intentionally tripping a Miami Dolphins player during Sunday's Jets-Dolphins game, the Jets said on their website. The Jets said they suspended Sal Alosi without pay and fined him $25,000 for tripping Dolphins rookie cornerback Nolan Carroll on the Jets' sideline as Carroll was covering a punt in the third quarter of Miami's 10-6 victory. ""After reviewing the facts and consulting with the league office, we determined that this was the most appropriate discipline,"" Jets General Manager Mike Tannenbaum said on the Jets' site. ""I have spoken with Sal. He understands the severity of his actions and has apologized to all parties involved in the incident."" Alosi, who will be barred from the Jets' practice facility until the end of the season, said in a statement that he accepts responsibility for his actions and respects the team's decision. Carroll, covered by two Jets players, was running along the sideline toward the Jets' punt returner when the incident happened at the New Meadowlands Stadium in New Jersey. Video shows Carroll was out of bounds and trying to run back in the field of play when Alosi -- standing with his hands in his pockets -- leaned his left knee forward. The knee caught Carroll, who tumbled to the ground. Carroll was shaken up but eventually walked to his sideline on his own power. He returned to the game in the fourth quarter. Before the suspension was announced, Alosi told reporters Monday that he was sorry for the incident, and that he wasn't thinking during the play. ""If I could go back and do it again, I sure as heck would take a step back. It was just a situation where I wasn't thinking,"" Alosi said during a news conference Monday afternoon at the Jets' facility in Florham Park, New Jersey. He said he apologized after the game Sunday to Carroll, Dolphins head coach Tony Sparano and Jets owner Woody Johnson, among others. He said he hadn't offered to resign but would accept whatever disciplinary action he received. ""I let everybody down yesterday with my actions. My actions were inexcusable and irresponsible. I'm extremely thankful that my actions yesterday didn't result in any significant injury to Nolan or any other player,"" he said. Noting that the Dolphins had been penalized earlier in the game for running out of bounds, a reporter asked Alosi whether someone had instructed him and other Jets personnel to stand close to the sidelines to prevent such moves. ""No, that wasn't anything that was instructed,"" Alosi said. ""Our inactive players -- guys that don't play -- we try to keep those guys focused on the game, root those players on. ... We wanted to cheer on our guys."" Meeting with reporters before the suspension was announced, Jets head coach Rex Ryan said the Jets and the NFL were working together on Alosi's punishment. Ryan said he wanted to apologize to Carroll and the Dolphins. ""That's a thing that has no business in this league or anywhere else. Sal made a huge mistake. He knows that. He's apologized for it,"" Ryan said. Sparano, before he had a chance to review the tape, told reporters after the game Sunday that his coaches upstairs were telling him that Carroll had been tripped. ""I talked to the referee at that point ... [and] I told him at that point that it was on tape and that the people upstairs are telling me that that's what they see,"" Sparano said. Carroll told South Florida's Sun Sentinel newspaper that he wasn't angry. But some of his teammates were. ""Come on, man. That's dirty! ... There's no place for that in football,"" Dolphins linebacker Karlos Dansby said Sunday, according to the Sun-Sentinel. ""Hopefully they'll be fined for it. I'll leave it up to the league."" Alosi, who played linebacker at Hofstra, joined the Jets as an intern in 2002 before serving as their assistant strength and conditioning coach from 2003 to 2005. He worked one year with the Atlanta Falcons before returning to the Jets as their head strength and conditioning coach in 2007.","Jets suspend strength and conditioning coach Sal Alosi without pay, fine him $25,000 .

"(CNN) -- The mayor of Springfield, Illinois, was found dead in his home Tuesday morning, the day he had been ordered to present an accounting of his cousin's estate to a judge. Illinois State Police say they are looking into the death of Mayor Tim Davlin, and no cause of death was disclosed Tuesday. Frank Kunz, a Springfield alderman who serves as mayor pro tem, said investigators ""didn't say much of anything"" at a news conference held shortly after Davlin was found dead in his home. ""Basically, what they confirmed was, it was the mayor, and he's dead,"" Kunz said. ""They actually didn't say much of anything."" The 53-year-old, two-term Democrat was scheduled to appear before a judge Tuesday morning and account for the balance of his cousin's $845,000 estate, for which he served as executor. Margaret Ettelbrick, who died in 2003, had willed the remainder of her estate to Springfield Catholic Charities after leaving $635,000 to other beneficiaries, court documents show. In May, Catholic Charities told the court it had received only a partial payment of $25,000. The same month, the Internal Revenue Service filed a lien against Davlin's home, seeking nearly $90,000 in back taxes from 2003, 2005 and 2006, according to property records. In September, Davlin's lawyer quit, telling the court that the mayor had not provided him with the needed paperwork to account for the balance of the estate. Davlin told the judge last week that he had hired a new attorney, and he was ordered to report back to court Tuesday. In November, Davlin announced that he would not seek a third term in 2011. Kunz said the city of about 115,000 was ""stunned"" by news of his death. ""Even when they had a press conference, they weren't sure all the relatives had been notified,"" he said. ""But he was the mayor, so they had to do something."" Kunz said city council members would name a new mayor at some point, but officials were still examining the laws governing mayoral succession. The city's administrative staff remains intact, and ""If they had to sign anything, I can sign it,"" he said. Davlin was divorced and had four children. Police were called to his home about 8:50 a.m. and found the mayor ""unresponsive,"" Springfield Police Chief Robert Williams said. He was declared dead soon afterward, and the investigation was turned over to state police, he said. ""It's very early,"" Illinois State Police Capt. James Wolf said. ""And as information develops and we are in a position to provide the media with more information, we will do so."" CNN's Kara Devlin contributed to this report.","The mayor was found dead in his home Tuesday morning .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- A series of parcel bombs targeting embassies in Greece and officials across Europe ""are not related to international terrorism and groups like al Qaeda,"" Greek government spokesman Giorgos Petalotis said Wednesday. Police spokesman Maj. Thanassis Kokkalakis added that two suspects arrested in the case are ""domestic terrorists without international connections."" The country suspended air shipments of all mail and packages for 48 hours after the parcel bombs were sent from the capital, the Public Order Ministry announced Wednesday. European authorities discovered packages Tuesday addressed to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Neither package reached its target and police destroyed both in controlled explosions. Both packages had arrived on flights from Athens, Greece, authorities said. Two other parcels containing explosives were discovered in the cargo section of the Athens airport on Tuesday, Kokkalakis said. They were addressed to the European Union law enforcement agency Europol, based in The Hague, Netherlands, and the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, he said. Authorities detonated both parcels, he said. At least nine bombs or suspicious devices have been sent in recent days to various embassies in Athens. Police intercepted and destroyed most of them, though one person at a courier office was wounded when a package addressed to the Mexican Embassy exploded, and another device was thrown at the Swiss Embassy and exploded in its courtyard. Kokkalakis described the bombs as ""booby trap bombs. They are hidden in books and some of them are hidden in files, in dossiers."" Two men arrested after the explosion at the courier office have been charged in connection to terrorism. The Citizens Protection Ministry named them as Panagiotis Argyrou, 22, and Gerasimos Tsakalos, 24. Both are Greek nationals, police said, and one of them is a suspected member of the Greek leftist militant group Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire. ""Now we have a good start to continue our efforts to disarm these terrorists,"" said Kokkalakis, who said there was a warrant on one of the arrested men, saying he was a member of the militant group. ""The other one is an anarchist,"" he said. ""We just know he is an anarchist. ... They want to disturb the daily life of Greek society. They try to disturb everything we have built as a country."" Police said they are looking for five other men in their 20s who seem to have links to the same group, but they have not yet linked the group to the spate of bombings. Vassilis Papadimitriou, a spokesman for the prime minister, called the suspects ""amateurs."" ""You have to call them terrorists, but what they were trying to do no doubt is something symbolic,"" he said. ""They were caught with bus tickets and cards to make telephone calls.  A professional wouldn't do this."" Kokkalakis and Papadimitriou both said that private air-mail shipping companies are responsible for security of packages.

"(CNN) -- Richard Holbrooke believed in Bosnia. As we mourn his passing, we also mark the 15th anniversary of the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords, the agreement that culminated his efforts in the Balkans. The physical damage of the war has been largely repaired. While many psychological scars linger, progress is evident in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Ambassador Holbrooke knew that progress here was attainable. He was not only a great diplomat but also a true friend to our country. We should honor him by living out his dream for us to succeed and flourish as a nation. As we reflect on the past 15 years, there are still skeptics and critics who express their concerns about political stability. The country has challenges ahead, including the difficult task of changing its constitution. But the world should not have a short memory -- the political situation has improved tremendously since the official end of war on December 14, 1995. Tributes to Richard Holbrooke, architect of Bosnian peace . Bosnia has signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU and is well on its way to NATO membership. On December 15, the citizens of Bosnia will gain visa-free travel to the EU countries covered by the Schengen agreement. And Bosnia currently serves as a nonpermanent member of the U.N. Security Council and assumes its presidency in January 2011. That's a significant achievement for a post-conflict country. These are all clear signs of improvement. There is one key element required for further progress -- economic growth. Productive foreign investment will open markets, encourage stability and speed government reform. Bosnia's pre-war industries were destroyed, and a lack of domestic capital has meant that the country's export and hard currency earning potential in agriculture and food processing, lumber and wood working, hydroelectric power and tourism remain untapped. Most analysts expect foreign investment will be stimulated by the country's entry into NATO and eventually the EU. It is true that after the war, Bosnia entered into a transitional phase with a corrupt administration and an economic environment that discouraged foreign investment, but many difficulties with post-war corruption are behind us. The investment environment has improved with foreign investments peaking at $1.7 billion in 2007 just before the global recession. That's an impressive number considering Bosnia has only 4.6 million residents. Bosnia and Herzegovina has a stable macro-economic environment that includes a strong convertible currency, low inflation and the most developed banking system in southeastern Europe. The fact that investments in Bosnia and Herzegovina have grown indicates that investors have confidence in Bosnia, even before NATO membership, and these early investors will reap the greatest rewards. Bosnia will become a member of the EU, an ally of the west and follow the path of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. I was born in Bosnia and Herzegovina to an ethnically mixed family. After surviving the war, I immigrated to the United States in 1994. I lived for 14 years in Rochester, New York, started a family, studied business at Monroe Community College and electronic business management at Rochester Institute of Technology. My first job was as a stack clerk at the liquor store, and I later applied my schooling and worked in technology companies, higher education and for an industrialist, Dutch Summers, who later became one of the chief sponsors of American University. After gaining a valuable education and work experience, I decided that I wanted to return to Bosnia to help rebuild a country and region by providing others the opportunity I had to gain a quality education. I wanted to help the people of Bosnia and region to build better lives and a better future. With the support of people I had met during my time in the states, I started the American University in Bosnia and Herzegovina (AUBiH), partnering with State University of New York at Canton. In 2006, the school opened its doors with 21 students, and today AUBiH has more than 500 students at three campuses. Our goal was to overcome ethnic differences and allow young people to learn and work together to build the future of their country. We were committed to building a university with a multi-ethnic body of students who will be future leaders in business and government and who have a shared vision of the country's successful integration into Europe. We are building a work force of educated leaders for the new century will be able to support and implement investments in Bosnia. Their ability to prosper with expanded employment will drive the necessary reforms to modernize government. Bosnia is a relatively small market, but it offers some unique resources, a favorable geographic location and, as a member of the Central European Free Trade Agreement, access to millions of consumers in the region. And it offers a diaspora motivated to return and ready to help their homeland by taking positions in the government and opening their own businesses. The readiness of a new generation of Bosnians to commit to their country over a more comfortable life in the West is proof that young Bosnians are very optimistic about the nation. With increased investment and a new multi-ethnic generation of educated leaders Bosnia and Herzegovina will have the bright future Richard Holbrooke believed in.

"(CNN) -- A huge winter storm was affecting the West Coast on Sunday, poised to dump up to 10 feet of snow in some higher elevations, and causing flooding and potential mudslides in lower spots while impacting driving conditions and air travel, forecasters said. A winter storm warning remained in effect through Monday afternoon for California's Sierra Nevada mountains, from Yosemite to Kings Canyon, according to the National Weather Service. ""Storm totals of 5 to 10 feet above 7,000 feet are likely,"" the weather service said, and periods of heavy snow will continue through Monday. High winds are also forecast for the region. ""Travel into the high country of the southern Sierra Nevada may be difficult, if not impossible,"" according to forecasters. That  possibility exists for the northern Sierras as well. At 3:56 p.m. PST, the National Weather Service was predicting blizzard conditions with winds of up to 70 mph along the higher mountain passes. That could shut down traffic along Interstate 80, state Highway 50 and state Highway 88. The Weather Service was urging residents in the higher mountain areas to check their generators and buy extra food and supplies. ""It's going to be an all-day onslaught,"" said CNN Meteorologist Reynolds Wolf. Areas from Denver westward will see rain, he said. At lower elevations, heavy rain was causing flash flooding in a number of locations. Flood advisories and watches were posted almost the entire length of California, from Redding to San Diego. Los Angeles had received 2 to 3 inches of rain as of about 2:30 a.m. Sunday (5:30 a.m. ET), and ""more significant rain"" was on the way, forecasters said. Flooding in the San Joaquin valley, which includes Fresno and Sacramento, is a ""firm possibility,"" said Wolf. Footage from Sacramento showed drivers creeping through water on roadways. As of Sunday afternoon, the California Emergency Management Agency was reporting localized flooding across the state, prompting road closings in San Luis Obispo, Fresno, Tulare, Amador, Venture County, Kern County and Humboldt County. And with the heavy rain comes the threat of mudslides, especially in areas near Los Angeles affected by this year's wildfires, where there is no vegetation to hold the soil in place, Wolf said. The soil becomes saturated and gravity pulls it downward. ""Some minor debris and rock slides have already been reported early this morning,"" said a southern California flood advisory issued by the National Weather Service, ""and this threat will likely continue through this morning."" The threat could also be delayed, meaning it will not abate when the rains stop and could occur later, Wolf said. In Placer County a minor mudslide forced the closing of one of two lanes on Interstate 80 on Sunday. The storm -- actually a series of storms -- were triggered by ""deep persistent moisture"" originating from the subtropical Pacific and surging northeastward, said CNN Meteorologist Sean Morris. The phenomenon is often called the ""Pineapple Express,"" he said, because the moisture originates near the Hawaiian islands. The series will affect the region through Wednesday, with the strongest portions yet to come, Morris said Saturday. Rainfall amounts could reach 10 to 12 inches in some spots, and up to 18 inches in some isolated areas, he said. The storms could be the strongest to hit southern California since January 2005, he said, when up to 32 inches of rain came in a five-day period. On Saturday, there were more than 260 freeway crashes in Los Angeles County and unincorporated areas because of the rain, said California Highway Patrol Officer Ed Jacobs. That is compared to 48 last Saturday, when it was not raining, he said. Most of the crashes were ""minor fender benders,"" he said, but two people died in a crash in Santa Clarita. ""We think the driver was just going too fast in that case,"" he said. About 5,000 customers lost power in southern California, said Steve Conroy of Southern California Edison, but noted that is a small percentage of the company's 5.4 million customers. The biggest problem the company faced on Saturday was drivers traveling too fast and sliding into poles, causing some service interruptions, Conroy said. The company serves some of the mountain areas, and have crews in place there, he said. ""Overall, we're in good shape."" About 2,100 customers lost power early Sunday in the Highland Park area of Los Angeles, but power had been restored as of about 6:30 Sunday morning, said Maychelle Yee, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. The outages were likely weather related, she said. Further north, high winds affected Seattle, downing trees and power lines, and knocking out power to about 100,000 people. Most of those had been restored as of Sunday. Footage from Spokane, Washington, showed drivers crashing as they slid down a snowy hill. Besides the potential for road closures, air travel could be affected in cities including San Francisco; Los Angeles; Seattle; Portland, Oregon; and Salt Lake City, Wolf said. Those delays could have a ripple effect elsewhere as a busy holiday travel week approaches.

"(CNN) -- Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been named TIME magazine's Person of the Year. Rick Stengel, the magazine's managing editor, made the announcement Wednesday on NBC's ""Today"" show. Zuckerberg created the widely popular and influential social networking site, which reflects a major transformation in the way people communicate and do business. ""Facebook has merged with the social fabric of American life, and not just American but human life: nearly half of all Americans have a Facebook account, but 70% of Facebook users live outside the U.S. It's a permanent fact of our global social reality. We have entered the Facebook age, and Mark Zuckerberg is the man who brought us here."" TIME noted that in less than seven years, ""Zuckerberg wired together a twelfth of humanity into a single network, thereby creating a social entity almost twice as large as the U.S."" If the service were a country ""it would be the third largest, behind only China and India,"" TIME wrote. ""It started out as a lark, a diversion, but it has turned into something real, something that has changed the way human beings relate to one another on a species-wide scale. We are now running our social lives through a for-profit network that, on paper at least, has made Zuckerberg a billionaire six times over.""  Read the TIME essay explaining ""Why We Chose Him."" The annual Person of the Year award is a staple of American journalism. Others considered for the honor this year were Afghan President Hamid Karzai, the trapped Chilean miners, the Tea Party movement in the United States, and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Film-goers got a taste of Zuckerberg and the early days of the site in this year's movie, ""The Social Network."" Zuckerberg grew up in Dobbs Ferry, New York, and graduated from high school at Phillips Exeter Academy. There, he studied Latin and became a fan of the classics. At Harvard University, which he attended for two years before dropping out to pursue Facebook, Zuckerberg ""was known for reciting lines from epic poems such as ""The Iliad,'"" writes Jessica Vascellaro in The Wall Street Journal. From Shakira to ""ending desire,"" the interests Zuckerberg has listed on his private Facebook page are certainly unexpected. Among the others are ""Eliminating Desire, Minimalism, Making Things, Breaking Things, Information flow, Revolutions, Openness."" His favorite musicians include Daft Punk and Lady Gaga. Among his favorite TV shows, he lists ""The West Wing,"" which, as The New Yorker's profile of Zuckerberg points out, was written by Aaron Sorkin, who wrote the screenplay for ""The Social Network."" Friends and co-workers call him ""Zuck."" But Zuckerberg has earned other nicknames, too. The Wall Street Journal says his mom used to call him ""Princely"" when he was young. When he joined the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity at Harvard, his friends took to calling him ""Slayer,"" writes Rebecca Davis O'Brien, who attended Harvard with Zuckerberg and wrote a piece about him in The Daily Beast.","The annual award is a staple of U.S. journalism .

"(CNN) -- Formula One drivers will face tougher penalties for improper driving in the 2011 season, while race stewards will have more power to hand out sanctions. Stewards were already able to issue drive-through and 10-second penalties or a drop of any number of grid positions, and they will now be able to exclude drivers from race classification and suspend them from future grand prixs. The changes were released by ruling body the FIA in the wake of last Friday's World Motor Sport Council meeting in Monaco, at which the 2011 regulations were set. The FIA also released details of driving practices it considers improper, including more than one change of direction when defending track position. It also announced that backmarkers -- cars at the rear of the field who have been lapped by faster drivers -- will have to move aside for leading racers, or face being reported to the stewards. F1 bosses drop ban on team orders . Another change for the forthcoming season is the introduction of a curfew on team personnel, which will prevent mechanics working on their cars through the night on a race weekend. The curfew will be between midnight and 6 a.m. ahead of practice on a Friday and between 1 a.m. and 7 a.m. before qualifying on a Saturday. Each team will be allowed to break the curfew on four occasions throughout the season.

"(CNN) -- A Nigerian man accused of attempting to detonate an explosive device in his underwear aboard a flight to Detroit last Christmas pleaded not guilty Thursday to new charges, authorities said. Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab was indicted on two new counts -- conspiracy to commit an act of terrorism transcending national boundaries and possession of a firearm or destructive device in furtherance of an act of violence. He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison on the new charges and on six counts brought against him in early January if he's convicted. During a 20-minute hearing Thursday, AbdulMutallab stood mute when asked his plea, so U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds entered a not guilty plea on his behalf, said Rod Hansen, court spokesman. ""The government asked for a trial date, but the judge said that because the superseding indictment had just been filed the day before, she wanted to give the defendant and his standby attorney time to look it over,"" Hansen said. A pretrial conference was set for January 12. The initial charges against AbdulMutallab included attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and willful attempt to destroy and wreck an aircraft within the jurisdiction of the United States. However, the first batch of charges did not include the specific word ""terrorism."" AbdulMutallab entered a not guilty plea in January. In September, AbdulMutallab told Edmunds he did not want to be represented by the public defenders assigned to his case and would like to act as his own lawyer. Edmunds agreed but appointed a standby counsel for him in case he needs help. Asked on Thursday by Edmunds if he still wants to represent himself, a calm AbdulMutallab answered, ""Yes, ma'am,"" according to Hansen. The defendant was wearing a khaki-colored prison jumpsuit. He was handcuffed and shackled as he was led into court, but the cuffs and chains were removed before the judge entered. Also in September, AbdulMutallab asked Edmunds how to proceed if he would like to plead guilty to some charges. The judge told him that was something his standby lawyer could assist him with. AbdulMutallab was a passenger on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 en route from the Netherlands to Detroit on Christmas Day. According to the indictment, he went to the bathroom shortly before the plane was to land. When he returned to his seat he said his stomach was upset and he pulled a blanket over himself. Prosecutors allege he then tried to ignite an explosive device made of PETN and TATP that was hidden in his underwear. Passengers and flight crew members subdued him. U.S. officials say the terror group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was behind the alleged bombing attempt.

"New York (CNN) -- The son of an Oscar-winning composer was indicted Thursday in the strangulation death of his girlfriend, whose body was found last week in a New York hotel bathtub. The details of the indictment of Nick Brooks, 24, are sealed and will not be revealed until his next court appearance, on January 4, said Manhattan District Attorney spokeswoman Joan Vollero. Police say the bruised body of swimsuit designer Sylvie Cachay, 33, was found at the exclusive Soho House club and hotel. Brooks, whose father, Joseph Brooks, is the music director who produced the song ""You Light Up My Life,"" was arraigned on charges of attempted murder and strangulation, police said. He pleaded not guilty. His attorney, Jeffrey C. Hoffman, said Brooks believes at least one other person had been in the room. ""I believe he is, in fact, not guilty,"" Hoffman said. According to court documents, police said the only person in the hotel room with Cachay, besides Brooks, was a hotel employee who delivered ice and was inside for about one minute. Brooks escorted the employee into the room and remained after the worker left, police said. Authorities said they relied on interviews with hotel employees and surveillance videos from the location. On Sunday, Cachay's brother said -- in comments issued through her spokeswoman -- that his parents ""are devastated by the loss of their daughter, so much so that they cannot make a coherent statement at this time."" ""Nobody should have to make arrangements to bury a child,"" Patrick Orlando-Cachay said in the statement. ""It's a day-by-day grieving and healing process."" Police said they are investigating a time frame in which the killing occurred. Cachay's body sustained bruising on the neck and bite marks, and was found clothed in the hotel room bathtub, the spokesman said. An autopsy indicated that the designer suffered injuries that were consistent with neck compression, court records show. Cachay suffered internal hemorrhaging, injuries to her scalp and cuts to her lips and mouth. The medical examiner's office will provide more details surrounding Cachay's death ""pending toxicology and tissue testing, which would take a few weeks,"" spokeswoman Grace Burgess said. ""Sylvie Cachay was one of those rare individuals who truly sparkled when she spoke,"" said publicist Kate Godici. ""She will be deeply and painfully missed, yet celebrated, honored and never forgotten.""","Son of an Oscar-winning composer was indicted in the strangulation of his girlfriend .

"(CNN) -- Following the shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, in November 2009, the attempted car bomb in Times Square in May and a number of other domestic cases, including the recent arrest of a Somali-American teenager in Portland, Oregon, U.S. security agencies are sharply focused on the potential ""radicalization"" of American-Muslims and how to prevent it. Many look across the Atlantic to the experience of Britain. Following the July 2005 attacks on London's transport system, a ""counter-radicalization"" strategy known as Preventing Violent Extremism was introduced. Dubbed Prevent for short, the strategy aims to intervene in the dynamics of Muslim communities to win over hearts and minds and secure allegiance to Western liberal democracy. Prevent has two prongs. First, it seeks to sponsor moderate Muslim organizations to oppose ""the ideology of violent extremism"" (a British government phrase that is deliberately obscure) and promote accommodation with the West. Hundreds of millions of pounds of government funding have been made available to those willing to take on this task. Second, it seeks to profile individuals suspected of drifting toward ""radicalization,"" that is, the adoption of extremist ideas. Through an elaborate system of surveillance involving teachers and youth workers among others, would-be radicals are identified and given counseling, mentoring and religious instruction in an attempt to divert them from their extremist views. Many in Washington tout a Prevent-like program as an essential weapon in what they see as the ""war within,"" the next phase of America's War on Terror. Governments cannot wait, they argue, until terrorist ideas turn into terrorist actions; there has to be some form of intervention earlier in the process to discourage those ideas from circulating. And in a liberal society, where ideas themselves cannot easily be criminalized, something like Prevent is a viable and necessary alternative, they argue. With the U.S. government already dedicating vast resources to profiling would-be extremists and recruiting Muslim groups as homeland security partners, the building blocks of an American version of Prevent are already in place. But in Britain, the harm done by Prevent has far outweighed any advantages. I spent a year researching the effects of Prevent on England's Muslim communities. I got documents detailing the full extent of the surveillance involved and spoke to community leaders, grassroots activists, women and young people. There was overwhelming concern that the policy construed the entire British Muslim population -- roughly two million citizens -- as uniquely and collectively responsible for preventing terrorist incidents. That perception was graphically illustrated by Preventing Violent Extremism funding, which was allocated in direct proportion to the number of Muslims in each local authority area, counted according to the 2001 census (the first to include a question on religion). As it became clear that the program constructed Muslims as a suspect community, more and more of the government's Muslim community partners began to disengage. In addition, sponsoring moderates to promote the government's anti-extremist message meant, in practice, funding religious scholars and imams to advance an official interpretation of Islam. In this way, Prevent involved state intervention in theological debates about the true meaning of religion, a paradoxical violation of the very secular principles that Muslims were otherwise being exhorted to uphold. More generally, the government's search for moderate Muslims often seemed like a search for Muslims who agreed with it, which meant that ""moderate"" Muslims were quite hard to find. The vague language of ""moderate"" and ""extremist"" was easily exploited to silence nonconformist views, whether from an Islamist ideological viewpoint or simply individual opinions about Britain's foreign policy. This in turn undermined precisely the sort of radical democratic dissent that might have been helpful in winning people away from those who said democracy was pointless, particularly as teachers and youth workers were pressured to inform the police of young Muslims expressing radical views. The level of distrust and alienation that Prevent generated among British Muslim communities has by now become clear, leading to the recent announcement of a review of the policy by the new coalition government. But it remains to be seen whether policymakers in London and Washington will interpret Prevent's failures as resulting from the bad implementation of a fundamentally sound idea or as the inevitable product of the program's flawed assumptions. The underlying problem with the Prevent strategy is that it assumes that a democratic government can impose political or religious opinions on its own citizens. In the 21st century, such an approach is bound to backfire. Western governments are right to recognize that political legitimacy is a key asset in countering terrorism. After all, in the majority of cases since 9/11, including the recent Oregon arrest, the original intelligence has come from Muslim communities. But governments will find it easier to gain the allegiance of Muslims if they take democratic principles more seriously when it comes to criticism of their foreign policy and refrain from demonizing whole communities. If, on the other hand, they launch ideological campaigns against a minority among their own citizens, they inevitably conjure memories of the last century's witch hunts of communists and black nationalists.

"(CNN) -- When Ryan Arnold died after donating a piece of his liver to his brother, Chad, his friends and family mourned the loss of a hero who risked his life to save his brother. The death affected someone else, too -- someone who'd never met the Arnolds. Her name is Laura Fritz, and when she learned about Ryan's death in August in an online television news piece, she was ""devastated."" ""It hit really close to home,"" she told CNN. ""Because I knew that could have been me."" Four living liver donors have died in the United States since 1999, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, including Arnold and another patient who died earlier this year at the Lahey Clinic in Massachusetts. About 38% of liver donors have some kind of complication, according to the Adult-to-Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation Cohort Study, a project to disseminate information about living donor liver transplants. Some experts think some of these deaths and complications could have been prevented if there was a change the way hospitals exchanged information about complications with organ donations. ""My body was just shutting down"" Like Ryan Arnold, Laura was young and feeling great when she gave away part of her liver. Both had surgery at the University of Colorado Medical Center, one of the world's most respected transplant centers. In Laura's case, it was her mother, Jane Fritz, who had a debilitating liver disease and needed a transplant. Laura was 26 and her mother 59 when Laura had 60% of her liver surgically removed and given to her mother on September 30, 2009, less than a year before Ryan Arnold had the same surgery. At first, everything seemed fine. The surgery went well, and both were discharged from the hospital without complications. When Laura Fritz got home, everything changed. ""I realized I wasn't doing as well as I was supposed to be doing,"" she remembered. ""I wasn't eating anything. I wasn't keeping anything down, fluids or anything."" Jane Fritz took her daughter back to the hospital, where doctors admitted her and diagnosed a small bowel obstruction, which meant a section of her intestines was blocked. After three days of treatment in the hospital, she was able to eat and move her bowels, and she was discharged. Back at her home in Denver once more, Laura again started to feel ill, and three days later, she went back to the hospital. ""I was really pale. My lips were turning blue, and they couldn't find a blood pressure on me,"" she said. ""My body was just shutting down. ... No one at the hospital said I was going into organ failure, but my mom's a nurse, and she put two and two together."" Laura was rushed to surgery. Afterward, the doctors told her parents that Laura had a hole in her intestines, a medical emergency because if the hole isn't repaired in time, bacteria inside the intestines leak out and cause deadly infections. Laura fought for her life in the intensive care unit, and she spent the next 36 days in the hospital. ""There was a time when the doctors came to [my mother] and my father and said if this infection doesn't clear up within 24 hours, I'm not going to make it,"" she said. ""They went to the chapel and prayed."" Laura recovered completely, and she hopes doctors learn from her complication and from Ryan Arnold's death, which happened about 10 months apart. She added that she'd donate to her mother again in a heartbeat. ""It was a terrible, terrible situation, but what came out of it is my mom is alive, and I'm alive,"" she said. Surgeon: ""A devastating feeling"" Laura Fritz and Ryan Arnold had the same surgeon: Dr. Igal Kam, chief of the division of transplant surgery at the University of Colorado. In the past 22 years, the University of Colorado Hospital has performed 142 living liver surgeries, and Kam says he's been the surgeon for nearly all of them. Out of those 142 surgeries, there's been one death -- Ryan Arnold's -- and three major complications, including Laura's. He says Arnold's death and Fritz's complications are unrelated. Ryan Arnold was fine after surgery, and he was up and walking around just two days later. ""I checked on him personally at 8 o'clock on the third evening after his surgery, and everyone said he was doing great,"" Kam said. Then at midnight, he said, he received a call saying Arnold needed to be resuscitated. ""By that time, he was already dead,"" Kam said. ""He went to sleep and never woke up."" After Arnold's death, the University of Colorado issued a statement saying it was conducting a ""thorough review"" of his case. Kam said Laura Fritz's complication was ultimately caused by a pre-existing condition that was impossible to detect before the surgery. In her case, he said, one loop of her intestines ""kinked on itself"" and stuck to another loop of her intestines, and this adhesion caused swelling, which caused the hole in her intestines. Sometimes in abdominal surgery, a surgical instrument can poke a hole in the intestines, but that wasn't the case with Fritz, Kam said. He said the hole was in a section of the intestines far from her surgical site. Plus, he said, the pathologist who looked at the adhesion after it was removed reported that it was chronic and existed before the surgery. Kam says he gets a ""devastating feeling"" whenever there's a major complication or death of a living liver donor. ""I don't wish anybody, good friends or enemies, to have this type of feeling,"" he said. ""It's hard to live with."" He said Arnold's death hit him especially hard. ""I've lived with it every day, every minute of my life, since then,"" he said. After Arnold's death, the University of Colorado stopped doing liver transplants that involved living donors, but it expects to start up again in the next few weeks with new procedures for monitoring patients after the surgery, Kam said. Velvet Kelm, a spokeswoman for Ryan Arnold's widow, Shannon Arnold, declined comment when asked if they planned legal action. A call for a living donor death task force . When a donor has a complication, the hospital is expected to do its own investigation and report to the United Network for Organ Sharing, or UNOS, which oversees transplants for the federal government. ""This isn't acceptable,"" says Dr. Lloyd Ratner, director of renal and pancreatic transplant surgery at Columbia University. ""Never in a million years would we say to BP, 'Oh, you had an oil spill in the Gulf, why don't you do your own investigation and just tell us about it?' "" he said. ""That would be just crazy. It's not acceptable in other industries to do that, so why is it acceptable in ours?"" In an article published recently in the American Journal of Transplantation, Ratner said that a national living donor death task force should be established to systematically review organ donor deaths, and that these findings should be disseminated to all hospitals that perform live donor transplants. He says that right now, the lessons a hospital learns from the death of a donor are not disseminated to other hospitals, and that surgeons tend to learn from one another based on ""serendipity."" For example, in 2006, he and colleagues from another hospital were having lunch when they started discussing patients who'd died, or had severe complications, when a certain type of surgical clip was used. He said the clip would fall off the stump of a renal artery after the kidney had been removed from the donor. They  published their observations in a medical journal, and the major manufacturer of the clips alerted hospitals to stop using them for kidney donors. ""We found a suboptimal surgical technique, but it never would have happened if we hadn't just gotten interested in this and started to talk about it,"" he said. ""There should be a system for reporting these problems and learning from each other."" UNOS told CNN that its Operations and Safety Committee recently advocated a process similar to the one that Ratner suggested in his article, but it might not be adopted. ""While promising, we must weigh procedural and legal issues in determining whether and how to develop such a system,"" according to a statement from UNOS. Sharing data with the public . Transplant centers are required to inform UNOS when they've had a death or major complication, but UNOS doesn't share that information with the public, which means patients can't look up a hospital's transplant safety record. Donna Luebke, a registered nurse who donated a kidney to her sister and once served on the board of UNOS, says the organization ought to share that information with the public. Donors can make a fully informed decision only ""if all the data is out there, and we don't have that data,"" she said. In a statement to CNN, UNOS emphasized that serious complications and deaths are rare, and that ""through data collection and the input of many who have personal experience with living donation, we will do our utmost to minimize risks for future potential donors."" CNN's John Bonifield contributed to this report.","Ryan Arnold died after donating a piece of his liver to his brother, Chad .
He and Laura Fritz, who also donated part of a liver, had the same surgeon .

"(CNN) -- One of the nightmare scenarios of the 21st century is a ""rogue state"" or terror group getting its hands on nuclear material that could be sufficiently enriched to make a weapon. And diplomatic cables obtained by WikiLeaks show that from central Africa to central Asia, it's a constant preoccupation of U.S. officials. Two cables from 2007 detailed the discovery of uranium in ""multiple containers"" in the Democratic Republic of Congo. ""All items have marking and labels indicating that they were produced in Belgium,"" one says. The cables, written by the U.S. Embassy in neighboring Burundi, quote an unnamed informant as saying the uranium was found in a fortified bunker. ""It took four months to open the bunker. In the process of opening the bunker two men were killed by a grenade booby trap. There were also land mines planted around it,"" one cable says. The informant, described by the Guardian newspaper as a local elder, added: ""One container weighing 3 kg is currently located in Bukavu and another 3 kg container is located in Goma,"" two towns in eastern Congo. And he said he knew of ""someone who has 3 containers who would be willing to sell them."" Regarding the motivation of the man and his associates, the cable quoted them as saying ""they did not want these items to fall into the wrong hands, specifically mentioning that they did not want Muslims to possess the items."" And they were reluctant to notify the Congo authorities because ""they were afraid that the corrupt Congolese police would steal the items and sell it themselves."" For U.S. diplomats, one of the challenges is to work out what might amount to a real danger, and what might be a scam. The Congo informants were ""anxiously waiting for some sort of indication from us that we are willing to pay for it,"" according to the cable. ""The men did not know if the uranium was weapon-usable fissile material, highly enriched uranium, what the percentage of uranium-235 isotope or other isotopes were, or how its content was determined."" In the end U.S. diplomats concluded: ""This case fits the profile of typical scams involving nuclear smuggling originating from the eastern DRC."" In 2006, another cable -- from Dar es Salaam in Tanzania -- discussed the possible shipment of African uranium overseas. It says that ""according to a senior Swiss diplomat, the shipment of uranium through Dar es Salaam is common knowledge to two Swiss shipping companies."" The uranium was supposedly from Democratic Republic of Congo and was destined for Iran -- though embassy officials pointed out that the reports were unsubstantiated. Security at nuclear installations has been another cause for alarm. In 2006, U.S. diplomats toured a non-functioning nuclear research center that included two reactors in the Congo capital, Kinshasa. One, according to the director of the center, contained ""5.1 kilograms of enriched uranium,"" which is U-235, enriched to 20 percent. The visitors noted: ""External and internal security is poor, leaving the facility vulnerable to theft. The fence is not lit at night, has no razor-wire across the top, and is not monitored by video surveillance. There is also no cleared buffer zone between it and the surrounding vegetation."" As for the guards, ""some are elderly, and some are occasionally caught sleeping on the job,"" the cable adds. ""It is relatively easy for someone to break into the nuclear reactor building or the nuclear waste storage building and steal rods or nuclear waste, with no greater tool than a lock cutter."" In fact, two fuel rods had vanished from the facility in 1998. One was subsequently found when the Mafia in Italy tried to sell it to unidentified buyers from the Middle East. The other was never recovered. Guarding nuclear materials appears to have been a problem in Yemen, too. A cable from the U.S. Embassy there earlier this year noted, ""The lone security guard standing watch at Yemen's main radioactive materials storage facility was removed from his post on December 30, 2009, according to (name redacted)."" And it adds, ""Very little now stands between the bad guys and Yemen's nuclear material."" U.S. President Barack Obama has made it a priority to secure vulnerable nuclear stocks within four years in a global drive to pre-empt nuclear terrorism. While some progress has been made, data from the International Atomic Energy Agency show there is plenty of nuclear material on the loose. In the year to June 2010, the IAEA reported 61 incidents involving theft or loss. Five of the incidents involved high enriched uranium or plutonium, including one of illegal possession. Several cables refer to attempts to sell nuclear and radiological materials stolen in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union. One of the more bizarre incidents occurred in Portugal in 2008, when a man walked into the U.S. Embassy to try to help sell ""uranium plates"" owned by an unidentified ex-Russian general living in Portugal. ""The material was allegedly stolen from Chernobyl,"" the cable says. ""The walk-in stated he is not on any medications and has not consulted any mental health specialists."" Several incidents are reported in cables from the Caucasus nations -- the most recent so far published referring to an incident last year. A car carrying three Armenians set off a gamma alarm as it crossed into Georgia. ""The driver of the vehicle said that he had recently had surgery, during which time a radioactive isotope was injected into his body,"" an explanation that apparently satisfied the Georgian border guards. But the alarm sounded again when the car crossed the border at a later date and an inspection ""determined that the car was contaminated with Cesium-137,"" a radioactive isotope frequently found in the low-level waste from medical or research labs which in the wrong hands could be an ingredient for a ""dirty bomb."" However, a search of the vehicle failed to produce any radioactive material and the occupants were allowed to go. The Cesium-137 had apparently been delivered. One interesting aspect of that incident was that the alarm was set off by a ""radiation detection portal monitor,"" hundreds of which have been installed at border crossings in many parts of the former Soviet Union as part of a program run by the U.S. Department of Energy. However, the effectiveness of the devices has been questioned. One cable on the incident says it ""reveals that some training gaps remain within the patrol police on how to appropriately handle alarms."" In another case that is not covered by the leaked cables published so far, two Armenians pleaded guilty last month to smuggling highly enriched uranium into the nation of Georgia, hiding it in a lead-lined box on a train from the Armenian capital, Yerevan, to Tbilisi in Georgia. Their illicit cargo was not detected by alarms, but they were eventually caught by a good old-fashioned sting operation. The two Armenians, a physicist and the former owner of a dairy business, are now serving long jail terms in Georgia .","WikiLeaks cables show U.S. concerns about nuclear material on the world market .

"(CNN) -- A test of the United States' only long-range missile defense system failed Wednesday -- the second failure this year in two tries. The Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency said both the intermediate-range ballistic missile target and the long-range interceptor missile launched successfully, radar and sensors worked properly and the ""kill vehicle"" deployed. But the ""kill vehicle"" didn't hit the target. ""Program officials will conduct an extensive investigation to determine the cause of the failure to intercept the target,"" the agency said. ""The next flight test will be determined after identification of the cause of the failure."" The last test, in January, failed because of a problem with the sea-based X-band radar, the agency said. The X-band radar sits atop a modified floating oil platform and provides information about incoming missiles so military officials can launch a response. In both Wednesday's test and the test launched earlier this year, the target missile launched from Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the interceptor launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. The $100 billion missile shield program has had numerous problems. In December 2008, an interceptor launched from Vandenburg ""killed"" a target launched from Kodiak, Alaska. But the test wasn't able to determine a key aspect -- whether the interceptor could tell the difference between a decoy and a real missile -- because the decoy failed to launch. Riki Ellison, chairman and founder of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for the deployment of missile defense systems, said the failure ""is a tremendous setback,"" noting three major test failures in the past two years. Ellison said many of the country's interceptors are nearly identical to the one that failed Wednesday, and he questioned the military's confidence in the ground-based system deployed in Alaska and California. So far, the Defense Department has deemed eight of the program's 15 tests successful.","Missile Defense Agency is investigating how the ""kill vehicle"" missed the target .

"Los Angeles ((CNN) -- Federal agents have arrested a California man who allegedly attempted to export a U.S. military fighter jet to Iran, authorities announced Friday. The arrest followed a seven-month government sting operation, authorities announced. Marc Knapp, 35, also was charged in a criminal complaint with two felony counts of attempting to export other aircraft parts and controlled technology. Knapp has agreed to plead guilty to the charges, according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Kravetz, who is prosecuting the case. According to unsealed court documents, the case began to unfold after ""a cooperating defendant"" in the operation introduced Knapp to an undercover agent. As part of the sting, the agent met with Knapp on several occasions at locations in California, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Budapest, Hungary, the court papers say. The documents say Knapp broached to an undercover agent the idea of obtaining an F-5B fighter jet from a source in California. Knapp allegedly told the agent that the ""Iranians"" might be interested in the fighter jet and other items, and allegedly said he wlould not be concerned if the jet or the other items ended up in Iran. In July, Knapp allegedly sent a contract for the fighter jet to the undercover agent and demanded a $3.25 million purchase price. Knapp was arrested in Delaware in July while negotiating plans to fly the aircraft from California to the East Coast, where it subsequently was to be crated and shipped to Hungary and eventually Iran, the documents state. The Northrop-designed supersonic fighter jet is part of a group of aircraft used by the U.S. Air Force during the Vietnam War and by the Navy and Marines as a stand-in for ""aggressor"" fighters in training exercises. But it has primarily been an export plane sold to other militaries. During their meetings, Knapp also informed the agent that he had various defense parts and allegedly admitted procuring an F-14 ejection seat, which was sold to the agent by another source. Over the course of their interaction, Knapp provided the agent with various lists containing items for sale, including fighter jet emergency manuals, survival radios and antigravity suits, according to court documents. ""Homeland Security Investigations will continue to pursue those who are willing to put America's national security at risk,"" John P. Kelleghan, special agent in charge of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said in a news release. ""The export of technology to Iran is prohibited so that our innovations cannot be used to harm Americans or our allies."" If convicted, Knapp would face a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison and a $2 million fine.","The arrest came after a seven-month sting operation, court papers say .

"(CNN) -- Researchers in Germany are reporting that they may have cured a man of HIV infection. If true, that would represent a scientific advance, but not necessarily a treatment advance, said researchers familiar with the work. In the study, published last week online in the journal Blood, researchers at Charite-University Medicine Berlin treated an HIV-infected man who also had acute myeloid leukemia -- a cancer of the immune system -- by wiping out his own immune system with high-dose chemotherapy and radiation and giving him a stem-cell transplant. Stem cells are immature cells that can mature into blood cells. At the time of the transplant, which occurred in February 2007, he stopped taking anti-HIV medications. Why HIV advance isn't a universal cure . Thirteen months later, after a relapse of the leukemia, he underwent a second round of treatment followed by another stem-cell transplant from the same donor. The donor's stem cells contained a rare, inherited gene mutation that made them naturally resistant to infection with HIV, according to the authors, led by Kristina Allers, who hypothesized that HIV would nevertheless rebound over time. But that has not happened. After three-and-a-half years off of anti-HIV drugs, the patient shows no sign of either leukemia or HIV replication and his immune system has been restored to normal health, the researchers reported, concluding, ""our results strongly suggest that cure of HIV has been achieved in this patient."" But AIDS researchers predicted the report will have little impact on practice. ""This probably is a cure, but it comes at a bit of a price,"" said Dr. Michael Saag, professor of medicine and director of the University of Alabama at Birmingham AIDS Center. ""For him to receive the donor cells, his body had to have all of his immune system wiped out"" and then receive a bone marrow transplant, Saag noted. ""The Catch-22 here is that the best candidates for a cure, ideally, are people who are healthy"" and don't have leukemia. The treatment associated with wiping out the immune system ""is very hazardous,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""Even if somebody doesn't die from a transplant, there are complications that make it very unpleasant for people to live with,"" he said, citing graft-versus-host disease, where the infused donor cells attack the body. In a number of cases, the transplant proves fatal. The study is a proof of the concept ""that our understanding of HIV biology is correct, and that if you eliminate -- not just in theory but in practice -- all of the cells in the body that are producing HIV and replace them with uninfected cells, you have a cure,"" Saag said. But remaining infected with HIV is not always associated with the same grim outcome that was the norm prior to the mid-1990s, when more effective anti-HIV drugs were developed, he said. ""We can keep people alive for a normal life span,"" he said. ""That means a 25-year-old diagnosed today with HIV has a reasonably good chance of living to 80, 85, 90."" Further limiting the treatment's potential appeal is the fact that it could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for each patient who gets it, he said. ""It's not going to be applicable unless they develop leukemia or lymphoma and need a bone-marrow transplant,""Saag said. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, called it impractical. ""It's hard enough to get a good compatible match for a transplant like this,"" he said in a statement. ""But you also have to find (a) compatible donor that has this genetic defect, and this defect is only found in 1% of the Caucasian population and 0% of the black population. This is very rare."" But HIV itself is not. According to the World Health Organization, 33.4 million people worldwide have the virus that causes AIDS.","A Berlin man has been off anti-AIDS medication for 3-1/2 years .

Despite the setback of playmaker Wesley Sneijder limping off injured early in the match, Inter were always in control and took the lead in just the third minute when Dejan Stankovic coolly slotted the ball home from the edge of the area. And that advantage was doubled in the 32nd minute when same superb interplay between Argentine duo Javier Zanetti and Diego Milito resulted in captain Zanetti sliding the ball past Seongnam goalkeeper Jung Sung-Ryong. The victory was sealed 17 minutes from time when Milito, making his return to action after five weeks on the sidelines, stabbed home a rebound after Samuel Eto'o's shot was parried by Jung. Meanwhile, the fifth-place play-off was won by Mexican side Pachuca, who rallied from going two goals behind to defeat local side Al-Wahda on penalties, after the match finished 2-2. A late double from Dario Cvitanich sent the match into extra time, where no further goals were scored.

"Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN) -- New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson said Saturday he is concerned about escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula, where he is urging ""maximum"" restraint ahead of scheduled military exercises. ""This is a tinderbox,"" he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer, who is traveling with the governor in North Korea. ""Right now, my objective is to say -- tamp things down."" Both Koreas have traded tough talk and conducted aggressive military drills in the weeks after North Korea shelled a South Korean island last month. The tough talk continued Friday as North Korea warned it would launch a military strike against the South if Seoul goes ahead with live-fire drills near Yeonpyeong Island during the next few days, North Korea's state-run KCNA reported. The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said Thursday that the exercises would take place in the seas southwest of the island between December 18 and 21. Richardson, a former U.N. ambassador, arrived in North Korea Thursday on a four-day trip he hopes will help to ease tensions in the region. ""Let's cool things down. No response. Let the exercises take place,"" said Richardson, who added: ""On all sides, I'm urging restraint."" He met with a vice minister of North Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday and is scheduled to meet with North Korea's senior nuclear negotiator Kim Gye Gwan on Saturday. The governor is also expected to meet with a top military leader while in North Korea, though he did not say who. ""Meeting a top military person is significant,"" said Richardson, who has hosted a North Korean delegation in New Mexico in the past. ""Hopefully, we can keep things from firing up."" ""My sense from the North Koreans is they are trying to find ways to tamp this down ... Maybe that will continue today. That's my hope,"" he said. Richardson is not in North Korea as an official U.S. envoy. Tensions mounted between the Koreas on November 23, when North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island, which lies in South Korean territory. The attack killed two marines and two civilians and injured 18 people. The North has accused the South of provoking the attack because shells from a South Korean military drill landed in the North's waters. Last month's attack was the first direct artillery assault on South Korea since 1953, when an armistice ended fighting. The U.S. military has said it is concerned that South Korea's scheduled exercises could spark an uncontrollable clash with the North, but the State Department said the exercises are not meant to be threatening or provocative. Still, the Obama administration and South Korea have established contingency communication plans in the event North Korea retaliates against the South for holding military exercises, a U.S. military official said Friday. The scheduled South Korea exercise has sparked concern from Washington to Moscow. Russia asked South Korea to cancel the drills after North Korea vowed to strike back if they proceed. ""It's obviously a very, very tense situation,"" said CNN's Blitzer. ""People are very very worried that one miscalculation could cause a disaster.""

"Fall River, Massachusetts (CNN) -- In a coastal city south of Boston, a community often known for its veterans is grappling with the loss of four young men who died this year while on active military duty. Army Sgt. Robert Barrett and Army Spec. Scott Andrews were both 21 years old when they were killed in Afghanistan, according to the city's official veterans agent, Manuel DaPonte. Marine Cpl. Paul Fagundes, 29, died in a swimming accident earlier this year near the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. And the city's latest casualty, Army Spec. Ethan Goncalo, succumbed to injuries suffered in Afghanistan last week, just days before his scheduled return home, DaPonte said. He was also 21 years old. ""The city of Fall River has never ended its grieving process with this being the fourth military funeral this year,"" Fall River mayor William Flanagan told CNN affiliate WHDH. ""Especially given this news around the holiday season."" Specialists Barrett and Andrews died within two months of each other. Like many grieving families across the country, their mothers at times question the war that has claimed both their sons' lives. ""I know that our sons did not die in vain. Ours sons fought for freedom,"" said Andrews' mother, Jo Ann Mello. ""They believed in what they were doing. But I'm not so sure that I believe."" Mello's comments came as America's top military official announced that the U.S. review of strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan ""shows us that we are on the right track,"" offering a personal glimpse into the homeland costs of a near-decade long conflict often fought in the harsh terrain of a country accustomed to war. ""I think we're tired,"" said Barrett's mother, Carlene. ""Enough's enough, and it's time for this to come to an end."" Her son died from a suicide attack just south of Kabul International Airport earlier this year, according to icasualties.org, which notes military deaths. ""They say we're fighting a war. We're not fighting a war,"" she said. ""My son wasn't fighting when he got killed. He was leaning against a truck and a suicide bomber got in on the base."" Scott Andrews died from a bombing near Forward Operating Base Lagman, considered a key outpost for U.S. forces in eastern Afghanistan. ""It's not always someone else's son,"" Mello said. ""It's ours."" Her kitchen refrigerator is covered with photographs of the two men, recalling parades the city organized in efforts to honor the fallen soldiers. ""Remember that there are parents, families, mothers and fathers that are hurting individually,"" DaPonte said. ""The rest of the country need not forget, please don't forget that we're at war."" On Thursday, President Obama said the United States is making significant progress in the nine-year war in Afghanistan, but warned that the conflict ""continues to be a very difficult endeavor.""

"(CNN) -- Afghanistan and several African nations are the most at risk to have a food shortage, an organization that works with the United Nations said in a report Thursday. Afghanistan was named as the country with the most vulnerable food supply, according to the study by Maplecroft, a British-based research agency. After Afghanistan, African nations were on the rest of the top 10 list. In order, the next were the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Eritrea, Sudan, Ethiopia, Angola, Liberia, Chad and Zimbabwe. In all, African nations were 36 of the top 50 on the list. ""Sub-Saharan Africa is particularly vulnerable to food insecurity because of the frequency of extreme weather events, high rates of poverty and failing infrastructures,"" the organization said. Maplecroft said it worked with the U.N.'s World Food Programme to develop the criteria to judge 163 countries. The group came up with 12 categories to help make evaluations. Those categories included the nutritional and health status of populations, cereal production and imports, Gross Domestic Product per capita, natural disasters, conflict and the effectiveness of government, the group said. The United States was ranked No. 158. Finland got the best rank and was considered least at risk.","Group works with the United Nations .

"(CNN) -- North Korea attempted to reach out to the United States through Mongolia in 2009, suggesting that the Mongolians host disarmament talks between Washington and Pyongyang, American diplomats reported in a document obtained by the website WikiLeaks. A Mongolian diplomat passed that information to the U.S. Embassy in Ulaan Baatar after an August 2009 meeting with Kim Yong Il, North Korea's vice foreign minister, a leaked embassy cable recounts. ""There are no eternal enemies in this world,"" the Mongolian official quoted Kim as saying. ""VFM Kim said the DPRK is spending too much on weapons rather than on its children, but that the current reality dictates that they cannot get away from weapons for now,"" the cable states, using shorthand for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. ""Kim said the DPRK is not a threat and was only interested in self-protection."" The document is among the vast cache that the website WikiLeaks began releasing Sunday to widespread condemnation from the United States and its allies. The Mongolian diplomat who recounted the meeting described it as ""notable"" since the North Koreans ""did not read from a prepared script, they were not aggressive and made no criticism of the United States, and they criticized China and Russia 'three or four times' for supporting recent U.N. resolutions aimed at the DPRK,"" the cable states. The North Koreans repeated their insistence that they would not return to the six-party regional talks aimed at convincing Pyongyang against dismantling its nuclear weapons program, according to the document. As they had in the past, they indicated that they wanted to discuss disarmament and the normalization of relations with Washington in one-on-one talks, which an embassy official suggested could be held in Mongolia, according to the Mongolian diplomat. The cable quotes Kim as saying that former President Clinton's visit to North Korea ""has greatly improved the prospects for such talks.""

"(EW.com) -- ""TRON,"" the original 1982 light-show video-game thriller starring Jeff Bridges as a software programmer trapped inside a brave new computer world of his own devising, is a movie that I, like many others, found to be such a tinny, dehumanized piece of techno-kitsch that I was shocked to learn it has since become a cult film. Seeing it again, though, I think I know why. Twenty-eight years later, ""TRON"" exerts a campy-surreal, here's what the future looked like before it arrived fascination that it never enjoyed during its initial run. In 1982, when it was the closest thing Disney had to a picture for adults, it was basically a demo reel of special effects in search of a movie. Yet if you see it today, it can stand as the first prehistoric Hollywood version of cyberspace, and it's fun to behold the eager, at times shockingly primitive ways that it imagines the ''wondrous'' computer future: as a frictionless Colorforms grid that looks like the most analog of head trips. Few science-fiction films have been simultaneously so ahead of their time and so instantly, touchingly dated -- so behind the eight ball of their own technology. ""TRON"" made the virtual almost leadenly literal. It was the soul of a new machine locked inside the hardware of an old one. The cult of ""TRON"" is hardly so big that you could accuse ""TRON: Legacy"" of being a cynical attempt to cash in on a franchise. (More than just a bomb, the first ""TRON"" was a major embarrassment for Disney; out-of-print DVD copies are now about as hard to hunt down as VHS head cleaners.) That said, the studio has had a long time to ponder its mistake, and ""TRON: Legacy,"" unlike its predecessor, really does make novelty look cool. It's a sleeker, sharper, far more visually intoxicating machine dream of a movie, with a darkly liquid electronic texture all its own. When Sam (Garrett Hedlund), the son of the now mysteriously vanished Kevin Flynn (Bridges), visits his dad's dusty, abandoned Flynn Arcade and ends up getting sucked -- through a ""TRON"" videogame! -- into the virtual world of the Grid, he gets outfitted for action (black uniform with neon piping), and then is thrust onto the combat stage of a gladiatorial thunderdome. There, he faces off against assorted digital soldiers, all wielding lethal Frisbees of light. The kitsch element is still there -- basically, this is the story of what it's like to be turned into a kill-or-be-killed videogame icon -- but the director, Joseph Kosinski, stages the extreme fighting with a fleet and threatening charge. The FX in ""TRON: Legacy"" have an almost Einsteinian elegance: They infuse light with gravity. If one of the discs hits a combatant, he'll shatter into glassy fragments, and Sam, absorbing the physics of the game, must learn to treat his body almost as part of the surrounding architecture. He becomes a ruthless digital specter. As long as it's engaged in light-hurling bouts of force, or motorcycle chases through a landscape so ominously enveloping it looks like ""Blade Runner"" after gentrification, ""TRON: Legacy"" is a catchy popcorn pleasure. The movie has a seductive, percolating, what's-old-is-new-again musical score by the French electronica duo Daft Punk, and for lengthy swatches of it I grooved on the look and the atmosphere. Joseph Kosinski's direction is just intriguing enough to leave you hoping that when Sam finally locates his father amid all those irradiated bytes and bits, the story will really take off. But ""TRON: Legacy"" turns out to be a little too much like one of those logy trapped-on-Planet X sci-fi movies from the 1950s: There's a lot of dramatic stasis undergirding the visual wow. It transpires that Bridges' Flynn hasn't been doing much for 20 years but sitting around -- the portal that would allow him to leave has been sealed off -- and his fascist nemesis, returning from the first film, is once again Clu, now played by a digitized version of the young Bridges. In his rubbery Botox-android way, he's creepy to look at (and he makes you wonder if this will be the future for aging movie stars), but there isn't much to Clu besides his telegenic blank stare. Here, as in ""TRON,"" there are limits to how much technology can really express. As Flynn, Bridges acts very beatnik Zen, like a weary cyber version of the Dude, and Michael Sheen is on hand as a sinister nightclub impresario who primps and soft-shoes like an albino Davy Jones wearing David Bowie's Aladdin Sane shag. Olivia Wilde, as Sam's cybernetic love interest, does some pretty standard punk-arm-candy posing. One reason the original ""TRON"" was greeted with so much hostility is that it seemed, in its cheesy synthesized way, to represent a brave new world not just of digital outer space, but of movies consumed by their own effects. At the time, this was a future a lot of people didn't want to see Hollywood embrace. But, of course, it's the future that won out. And that may be the true legacy of ""TRON."" The sequel, more successfully (if less innocently), injects you into a luminous action matrix and asks you to be happy with the ride. But it's easier now not to object. At the movies, the fantastical-synthetic has become a state of mind that we're never allowed to escape. EW.com rating: B . See more at EW.com.

Mayweather was arrested just before midnight Thursday, police spokeswoman Barbara Morgan said. He was released from the Clark County Detention Center on Friday, police said, and is expected to appear in court Tuesday, according to Clark County court spokeswoman Jillian Prieto. Mayweather's legal representation declined to comment. He last fought in May, beating Shane Mosley, but has since been embroiled in domestic violence claims from his former girlfriend. He faces criminal charges in court in January.

"(CNN) -- An Obama administration initiative that aims to create jobs and economic growth has been derailed in some states while it speeds along in others. The loss of a total of $1.2 billion in high-speed rail funds in Wisconsin and Ohio means the promise of thousands of new jobs in those states will not be realized, according to proponents of the fast passenger trains. The Obama administration wants to use large-scale infrastructure projects like high-speed rail to boost the economy much in the way that public works projects put people back to work during the Great Depression. Mayor Ron Krueger was hoping a high-speed line that was planned to go through Watertown, Wisconsin, would spur development of retail and apartments in his town of about 23,000. But some newly elected officials have put the brakes on those plans, raising questions about whether it's still possible to build big in the United States. Citing two incoming governors' opposition to high-speed rail projects in the Midwest, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood redirected $810 million away from Wisconsin and $400 million from Ohio to other states. California is getting the lion's share, $624 million for its link between Los Angeles and San Francisco. $342 million is going to Florida with the remainder divided among Washington and 10 other states. Is the U.S. turning a corner on high-speed rail? Along with the money comes jobs. In Wisconsin, the outgoing governor Jim Doyle claimed over 4,700 jobs directly related to the high-speed rail line between Milwaukee and Madison would have been realized at the height of construction. Proponents claimed thousands of indirect jobs would have been created as a result of the projected economic growth along the line. ""Rail creates value,"" said Petra Todorovich at the Regional Plan Association, a transportation and public policy think tank in New York. She's the director of America 2050, a national initiative to meet the needs of the country over the next 40 years based on a projected population growth of 100 million. ""It's a permanent investment both residential and commercial investors can look at. There are the construction jobs in working on the railroad,"" Todorovich said. People in the area are also put to work building the locomotives and rail cars. There are also indirect benefits that come with a new rail line, according to Todorovich. ""There are jobs related through real estate and commercial investment. These are long-term jobs."" But Wisconsin's Republican Governor-elect Scott Walker said he has serious doubts about the projected job benefits related to the project. ""The estimates, I think, are woefully optimistic."" Scott Walker campaigned on a promise to kill high-speed rail in Wisconsin, saying that it would leave the state with an annual operating cost of anywhere between $7.5 million and $15 million. ""There are plenty of examples of federal Interstate Highway projects in the state of Wisconsin that have terrible, terrible needs right now that are being unmet that to me would be a much better use of transportation dollars,"" Walker said. Officials at the U.S. Department of Transportation said that up to 90% of the operating costs could have been covered by federal grants. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood tried unsuccessfully to change Governor-elect Walker's mind before the funds were pulled. ""There is no shortage of enthusiasm and energy in almost all 50 states in America for some form of high-speed inter-city rail,"" LaHood said. Some of that enthusiasm was found in Florida which put out a request for proposals for a high-speed rail line to link Tampa with several locations in and around Orlando. Even though Florida received an additional $342 million from the Department of Transportation for the project, Governor-elect Rick Scott, a Republican, hasn't made up his mind on whether he'll allow it to proceed. Scott has said he is concerned that the price tag for the line would exceed estimates. He is also concerned about operating costs, he said. Florida's Department of Transportation claims close to 10,000 people would be employed in jobs directly related to the high-speed rail line during the height of construction and thousands more would be employed in indirect jobs. Meanwhile, work is beginning on a section of a high-speed rail line in California that planners hope will one day link Los Angeles with San Francisco.","Wisconsin, Ohio lose $1.2 billion in high-speed rail funds .

"(CNN) -- A 65-year-old man's remains were stashed in containers across South Florida, police said Thursday, releasing the victim's identity one day after charging another man in his murder. Police began looking into the case last month after finding body parts strewn around three counties in the southern part of the state. On Thursday, Fort Lauderdale police said in a statement that those remains belonged to Warren Danzig, whose last known mailing address was in Davie, about 10 miles southwest of downtown Fort Lauderdale. Police contended a day earlier that Jamie Saffran killed Danzig sometime between November 2 and November 5 and then dismembered his body. Saffran then stole Danzig's credit card and used it to pay his own daughter's college tuition and buy tires for his Jeep, authorities said. According to the Broward County Medical Examiners Office, Danzig died from ""blunt force trauma."" The police affidavit says the gruesome discoveries of his remains began in Fort Lauderdale on November 6, when police responded to a call about a suspicious container. Inside that bucket they found human legs and arms, poorly masked by concrete. Additional agencies became involved in the investigation as more body parts -- which included the victim's head and torso -- were found in similar containers in three counties, the affidavit says. ""As the multijurisdictional investigation progressed, further evidence led investigators to suspect Saffran's involvement in the homicide,"" Fort Lauderdale police said. During a search at Saffran's home, authorities discovered a shovel covered with concrete and a sledgehammer ""that presumptively tested for human blood,"" the affidavit says. They also found two bags of cement and several sharp tools, it says. DNA testing conclusively linked the strewn body parts to Danzig, authorities say. Saffran told detectives that he and the victim had been friends for several years. He added that the two even shared a home mailing address, although Saffran claimed that Danzig more recently lived in the Dominican Republic. According to the police report, Saffran said the two last saw each other about October 31. InSession's Adam Blank contributed to this report.","Fort Lauderdale police say Warren Danzig wasa killed and dismembered .

"(CNN) -- A late equalizer from Jo ensured Manchester City got the draw they needed at Italian giants Juventus to top their Europa League group, but holders Atletico Madrid are out. The English Premier League side, deprived of Argentina striker Carlos Tevez who handed in a transfer request last week, fell behind on 43 minutes when Niccolo Giannetti tapped home Alessandro Del Piero's cross. But England winger Adam Johnson found Jo with a defence-splitting pass in the 77th minute and the Brazilian made no mistake from inside the penalty area. It meant Juventus, who were already out of the competition, drew all six of their matches. After the game City manager Roberto Mancini told reporters: Mancini said: ""I am very happy, because we wanted this, and it was very important to finish top of the group. ""We have a chance to go all the way, but it is important to have a good draw for the next round, and after that we will see."" City's point sees them finish top of Group A, ahead of Lech Poznan on goal difference. The Polish side won 1-0 against Salzburg, of Austria, thanks to Semir Stilic's goal. Atletico Madrid, who won last year's Europa League, were knocked out after a 1-1 draw in Germany with Bayer Leverkusen. Patrick Helmes put the hosts in front before Fran Merida leveled shortly after. The Spanish club had to better Aris Salonika's result against Rosenborg to go through but failed on both counts after Aris triumphed 2-0 and clinched second place. Lille took second place in Group C from Belgian side Gent with a 3-0 victory in France. Ludovic Obraniak, Pierre-Alain Frau and Moussa Sow all found the net. Levski Sofia, from Bulgaria, claimed their second victory in the competition with a 1-0 win over Sporting Lisbon. The Portuguese club had already qualified as group winners. In Group G, Russian outfit Zenit St Petersburg maintained their perfect record with a 3-0 win over AEK Athens of Greece. Alexander Bukharov, Alessandro Rosina and Igor Denisov were all on target. Belgian club Anderlecht compounded AEK's misery by securing qualification in second place after a 2-0 victory over Hadjuk Split of Croatia. They went through by virtue of a better goal difference. Matters had already been decided in Group H and German side VfB Stuttgart maintained their impressive form with a 5-1 thumping of Odense, from Denmark. Russian striker Pavel Pogrebniak was on target as they finished top. Switzerland's Young Boys were beaten 1-0 in Spain by Getafe thanks to Adrian Corpa's goal but finished two points clear in second place. In Group I, Sampdoria's miserable run continued as the Italian side went down 2-0 to Debrecen of Hungary. Peter Kabat grabbed both goals.

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Helen Gym threw her arms around Duong-Nghe Ly. ""We did it,"" she said, before pulling back to look at Ly, a Vietnamese immigrant and senior at the South Philadelphia High School named in the complaint. ""We did it."" The Philadelphia School District on Wednesday signed a 2½-year civil rights agreement with the U.S. Justice Department to address anti-Asian immigrant violence at South Philadelphia. The agreement requires the school to submit an anti-harassment action plan and continue implementing policies and procedures to prevent harassment based on race, color and/or national origin. The action serves as a nationwide standard for bullying prevention at schools, said Maureen Costello, director for Teaching Tolerance at the Southern Poverty Law Center. ""Every school needs a policy, but a policy isn't always enough,"" Costello said. ""Everyone needs to know what to look for and how to respond."" Looking at the school system as a whole, versus creating policies that focus solely on perpetrators, is a more beneficial way to combat the issue of bullying, Costello said. ""Bullying doesn't occur in a vacuum, it occurs where it's allowed,"" Costello said. ""What this (agreement) says to schools is don't wait until there's a problem, every school should be self-auditing."" Complaints were triggered by events on December 3, 2009, during which large numbers of Asian immigrant students from South Philadelphia High School were assaulted in and around the school throughout the day. Several students were sent to the hospital. The attacks followed years of harassment against Asian students at South Philadelphia High School, according to the complaints filed with the state and federal government. In the days after the incident, more than 50 Asian students organized an eight-day boycott of the school in efforts to draw attention to what they felt was an inadequate response by the school staff to the ongoing harassment and violence. The December 2009 boycott brought nationwide attention to the violence against Asian students at South Philadelphia. Months later, a federal investigation was launched after a formal civil rights complaint was filed by the Asian American Legal Defense Fund. The Justice Department, which announced its investigation in August, instructed the school system to improve the treatment of Asian students. ""We will always remember December 3, but we will refuse to be defined by that day,"" Wei Chen, who was a senior at the time of the melee, told the members of the Philadelphia School Reform Commission when the settlement was announced. ""A year ago we came to you as victims. Today we come to you as youth activists, as organizers and leaders who have shown the power to make change."" According to the complaint, ""the district and the school acted with 'deliberate indifference' to the harassment against Asian students and 'intentional disregard for the welfare of Asian students' "" at the school. The settlement proves the violence at South Philadelphia High School was racial, not gang related as once rumored, making it a bittersweet accomplishment, because the school district failed the students, said Gym, a board member for Asian Americans United, a nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering the Asian American community. ""We celebrate the lasting gains of these agreements,"" said Gym, who helped many Asian students document their experiences. ""We hope that they are also welcomed with a measure of abiding humility and deep sorrow for the lack of action that required it."" The settlement agreement, which holds the district responsible for implementation and oversight, resolves eight discrimination complaints alleging widespread harassment of Asian students at South Philadelphia High School, and will remain in effect until June 2013. The settlement terms ""will in no way impact what is happening"" unless the individuals who have been doing the bullying are brought to justice, said Steve Perry, CNN Education Contributor and principal at Capital Preparatory Magnet School in Hartford, Connecticut. ""It's not going to change anything,"" Perry said, adding that a coordinated, united front must be in place between school and home. ""Parents need to monitor what happens at home, and schools need to monitor what happens at school."" It is important to understand what bullying is, Perry said, adding that school administrators are responsible for knowing how to detect it. ""To be bullied is to have an individual or group experience systematic or focused actions,"" he said. ""Bullying is that behavior that makes you not want to go to school, or not want to live anymore."" Additional settlement terms require the school and/or district to retain an expert consultant in the area of harassment and discrimination based on race, conduct training of faculty, staff and students on discrimination and harassment based on race; to maintain records of investigations and responses to allegations of harassment; and to provide annual compliance reports to the department and Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, as well as makes harassment data publicly available. Litigation is not the solution to prevent bullying, said Michael Josephson, founder of the Josephson Institute Center for Youth Ethics. ""You can make the district police it, but as soon as they go off campus it's not dealt with,"" he said. In order to combat bullying, students and schools need to do more than translating correspondence into designated languages or submitting annual compliance reports to officials, Josephson said. ""The reality is we have to create a sense of solidarity. We need a kinder, gentler society where respect is the norm,"" he said. ""Yes, we have to pay attention to this, but we can't litigate our way out of this problem.""","Schools need to be proactive about stopping bullying, expert says .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Spanish authorities have arrested 25 people suspected in a 10 million euro ($13 million) fraud scheme targeting German owners of timeshare vacation property in the Canary Islands, police said Friday. The suspects contacted the timeshare owners, offered lucrative terms to buy their shares and lured the owners into paying what turned out to be non-existent taxes or transfer fees, Spanish national police said in a statement. The timeshare property never actually changed hands, and the suspects vanished, only to surface elsewhere and repeat the alleged scam, police said. With help from the German Embassy in Madrid, investigators identified a web of suspects spread among numerous businesses and locations, mainly on Tenerife Island -- one of the largest of the Canary archipelago of seven islands in the Atlantic Ocean. Authorities arrested 23 German suspects, one Polish suspect and one Swiss suspect late last week, police said. It was not immediately clear how many of the suspects had been arraigned or whether a judge had ordered them to jail or ordered their release. If convicted of fraud, they could face up to six years in prison, a police spokeswoman said. Several million Germans visit Spain annually, especially the Canary Islands and also the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean, and many also own property in the country. They, along with other property owners -- foreigners and Spaniards alike -- have felt the deep economic downturn after Spain's real estate bubble and construction boom collapsed. Many owners have tried to sell their property, usually finding depressed prices, not the lucrative terms that the suspects allegedly offered to the German timeshare owners.","Canary Islands vacation properties are the target of the scam .

"Washington (CNN) -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday led jubilant legislators and soldiers discharged under the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy in singing ""God Bless America"" to celebrate the upcoming repeal of the controversial law. President Barack Obama will sign the repeal bill on Wednesday, and Pelosi did her part at the ceremony attended by hundreds of supporters of the repeal by signing the measure passed by Congress to send it to the White House. The ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy enacted in 1993 banned openly gay and lesbian soldiers from military service. More than 14,000 military members have been discharged because of it. Pelosi, a California Democrat, said the military will be made stronger by including all Americans who want to serve without making gay and lesbian members lie about who they are. ""Isn't this a joyful day?"" she said, adding that the repeal measure will ""change the law, improve the policy, make life better for many Americans, and make our country stronger."" Pelosi then asked all in attendance to sing ""God Bless America."" At the end, Democratic Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, one of the first openly gay House members, could be seen wiping his eyes. Earlier, Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy of Pennsylvania told the gathering of an e-mail he received from a company commander in Afghanistan, who mentioned how he often had to counsel soldiers who received divorce papers or ""Dear John"" letters from spouses or opposite-sex partners. Murphy continued: ""This young company commander, this captain, on his fourth deployment, wrote in that e-mail saying, 'I never thought I'd see the day when I got one of those letters myself. And I'm sitting here at three o'clock in the morning in Kabul, Afghanistan, and I have no where to go because I happen to be gay, and I can't walk to the chaplain, and I can't go to a battle buddy, and I can't walk to my commander's office, so I'm sitting here cradling my 9 mm pistol thinking about blowing my brains out. But I read this article about this Iraq war veteran named Patrick Murphy from Pennsylvania that's fighting for me, and it gives me hope.'"" The repeal bill, a campaign promise by Obama, won Senate approval on Saturday in the final days of the lame-duck session. The House passed it twice -- first as part of a broader defense bill that was blocked by Senate Republicans, and then in the separate measure passed by the Senate. Conservative Republicans opposed the repeal, saying it would put too much stress on a military fighting two wars. However, Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen both called for a congressional repeal with a set phase-in timetable, warning that ""don't ask, don't tell"" could otherwise be abruptly overturned by the courts. Under the repeal measure, the Pentagon will finish developing an implementation plan that rewrites policies, regulations and directives. Once that potentially lengthy process is complete, Obama, Gates and Mullen will each have to certify that the repeal can move ahead without negatively affecting military readiness and unit cohesion. After the certification, another 60 days will need to pass before the repeal is officially enacted. CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this story.","NEW: Rep.

"Washington (CNN) -- The permanent council of the Organization of American States has approved a resolution asking troops to withdraw from the disputed border area between Costa Rica and Nicaragua. In a resolution issued early Saturday, the council said both nations should ""avoid deployments of the armed forces or security forces in the area where their presence could generate tensions."" Tensions between Nicaragua and Costa Rica have flared over Calero Island, a parcel of land on the Atlantic coast. Managua claims the area is Nicaraguan and denies its troops are in Costa Rican territory. Costa Rica claims it has been invaded. The resolution supported a report by OAS Secretary-General Jose Miguel Insulza that said both sides should resume binational talks and not escalate the military and police presence near the disputed area. The council's Washington meeting was contentious, however, beginning Friday afternoon and lasting until early Saturday as diplomats tried to reach consensus. Ultimately, the resolution passed with 22 votes, the organization said in a statement. Three countries abstained and two voted against it. Denis Ronaldo Moncada, Nicaragua's ambassador to the Organization of American States, said early Saturday that officials from his country would challenge the resolution. ""In the end, an agreement was reached that is really without any value,"" he said. ""We are going to challenge this resolution. We are going to question it, and we are going to document our position against this resolution, which was flawed from the outset and flawed in its conclusion,"" he said. Costa Rican officials claimed the vote was a ""triumph of peace and law."" ""Now, more than ever, the Nicaraguan authorities must know to listen to the clamor of all of the hemisphere in favor of peace and peaceful relations between neighboring nations, and withdraw their armed forces from Costa Rican territory,"" Costa Rica's foreign ministry said in a statement. Costa Rica claims that in addition to the Nicaraguan troops, a dredging project in the river is dumping sediment on its side of the border, and that a Costa Rican flag in the area was replaced with a Nicaraguan flag. Nicaragua has accused Costa Rica of breaking diplomatic relations between the countries. Wednesday, Costa Rican President Laura Chinchilla said her country would take its border dispute with Nicaragua to the . United Nations and the International Court of Justice if a resolution is not found. Chinchilla has said her country accepted the recommendations made by Insulza, but that before there are binational talks, the Nicaraguan troops must move back into undisputed Nicaraguan territory. If the Nicaraguan troops pull back from the disputed area, Chinchilla said she gives assurances that Costa Rican police will not move in. In response, Nicaraguan Vice President Jaime Morales Carazo acknowledged that Costa Rica may have no standing army, but said that means little, given that members of the Costa Rican police are better armed than Nicaragua's soldiers. In an earlier interview with CNN en Espanol, he called on Costa Rica and Nicaragua ""to resolve this as brothers"" and ""for a ceasefire in the verbal war,"" but added that Nicaragua is not the aggressor. ""We cannot invade our own floor of our own house,"" he said. ""Neither can we accept from anyone conditions or ultimatums.""

The fashionista's favorite fashion editor is sitting on a leather chair in her sparse white office. The shelves are all but empty. There's no in-tray on her desk and certainly no computer. ""They're not my specialty,"" she shrugs. An orange blossom candle twinkles in its glass casing and pictures stand -- some still in their wrapping -- against the wall. She's been in this office for eight years but it looks like she moved in last week. She hasn't even had time to hang her pictures, and it's not hard to see why. Every month, Roitfeld and her small team pull together what is considered to be the world's most fashion-forward magazine.   Watch Carine Roitfeld Revealed » . Vogue Paris may have a fraction of the circulation of its American stable mate -- 139,000 versus 1.3 million -- but what it lacks in numbers it makes up in prestige. Still, Roitfeld recognizes that even the upper end of the magazine market is not immune to the deepest global recession in decades. She's prepared to make cuts. And rather than begrudgingly canceling a coffee order or two, she's almost relishing a return to the pre-boom days when challenges were overcome with creativity rather than cash. ""It's become ridiculous,"" she tells CNN, explaining that where once eight people may have gathered around a table to discuss a photo shoot, now there are 25. ""Some things got too far away. There were people who were flying private jets -- we need to go back to reality. ""I don't want to take the money out of the beauty of the picture, I don't want to change the paper of the magazine, I don't want to change the materials, but we can do it another way."" ""When it's more difficult you have to be more creative."" CNN's Revealed joined Roitfeld and five members of her team as they gathered round a glass table to choose the cover of the April edition of French Vogue. It doesn't happen often -- usually the cover is a fait accompli -- but this time U.S. actress Scarlett Johansson has confused the issue by unexpectedly dying her hair. ""This cover, it was very difficult,"" Carine explains, ""because we want people to recognize Scarlett and then she changed her hair color."" Three mock-ups lie on the table; different fonts, colors and wording cover Johansson's lascivious poses. It's clear which one Carine prefers and, rather predictably, it's her choice that will hit news stands this week. ""I think this is a Vogue image and I want to stick to being Vogue,"" she says of her decision. ""The cover is like the publicity for your magazine. It's very important. We need the more appealing one, the more visible one."" Carine Roitfeld was a highly respected and well-connected fashion stylist with no experience in magazine editing when she took the job as editor-in-chief at Vogue Paris in early 2001.  See photos from Carine's personal album » . She was already an old friend of renowned photographer Mario Testino; they met 25 years ago when both were yet to make their names. He's now Godfather to her two children, Vladimir and Julia, who are 28 and 27 respectively, and who both now live in New York. Roitfeld and Testino later teamed up with U.S. designer Tom Ford during his first years as creative director at Gucci to reinvigorate the brand with an innovative advertising campaign. Roitfeld was approached by Jonathan Newhouse, chairman of Conde Nast International to take the role at French Vogue. During her time there, advertising revenue has increased almost 10 percent and circulation is up 27 percent. ""It is probably a 'Carine effect',"" concludes Xavier Romatet, the president of Conde Nast Publications, which owns Vogue magazine. ""Carine's probably the most creative person I've met in my life,"" he told CNN, describing her as a savvy business woman with a finely-tuned intuition as to what her readers want. Roitfeld scoffs at suggestions that she has an acute business mind, saying, ""I think I'm a terrible business woman."" Still, what she's doing at French Vogue is obviously working and despite persistent rumors that she may soon announce her departure, she insists she has no plans, as yet, to leave. ""I'm very happy here,"" she tells CNN before adding cryptically, ""but I'm sure something new is going to happen in the next year."" Many in the industry have tipped Roitfeld to replace Anna Wintour in New York, should the esteemed editor of American Vogue choose to retire. Read more about Roitfeld's views on the New York job . Roitfeld says she hasn't been approached about the job, and if she were, she probably wouldn't take it. ""Of course you'd be proud to be offered a job at this Vogue, because it's the biggest Vogue. ""But I'm not sure I'd be happy to work at the biggest Vogue. It's too big; you have to talk to too many different people. I'm very happy at French Vogue to be able to do everything -- almost everything -- I want to do in the magazine. ""Anyway my husband doesn't want to go,"" she adds later with a smile. Roitfeld is anxious not to feed any speculation of a competitive rift between her and Wintour, referring to her U.S. counterpart as the ""First Lady"" of fashion. ""Anna does a great job... I respect her a lot,"" Roitfeld says.","As editor in chief of Vogue Paris, Carine Roitfeld sets the benchmark for style .

Lavin, 33, of Las Vegas, was rushed to University Medical Center after Thursday's accident at the three-day Dew Tour Championship. Video showed Lavin soaring high over a dirt ramp before crashing to the ground. Lavin was wearing a helmet, tour spokeswoman Nicole Mancuso told CNN. ""T.J. is an important member of the Dew Tour family -- the Tour, athletes and action sports industry are all keeping him in our thoughts and prayers,"" race officials said in a statement. Lavin's mother told CNN affiliate KTNV that Lavin broke his eye socket and wrist, and is in a medically-induced coma to reduce swelling on his brain. She said she's confident her son, a veteran of the pro dirt circuit, will pull through. The competitor remained in critical condition Saturday, hospital spokeswoman Danita Cohen said. Lavin, the host of MTV's ""Real World/Road Rules Challenge"" program, has won the gold at several X Games and has produced a music album, according to MTV.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The U.S. military says only one supply route to Afghanistan has been closed by the Pakistani government after fighting that led to the deaths of three Pakistani soldiers, and a military spokesman said Thursday that United States is hopeful the situation is only temporary. Pakistan banned NATO supply convoys from entering Afghanistan after the deaths of the three soldiers, whom the government says were killed in Pakistani territory during fighting between NATO troops and militants, according to a military official from the NATO-led command in Afghanistan. Lt. Col. John Dorrian, an ISAF spokesman,  said the Torkham Gate in the Khyber Agency has been closed since about midday on Thursday. Chaman Gate, the other border crossing between Pakistan and Afghanistan, remains open. ""We don't think it's a very serious problem,"" Dorrian said. ""it's a throroughfare we use a lot so it is significant. But we can work around it."" ""We do expect these matters to be resolved."" The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad is talking with Pakistan to resolve the situation. Supply convoys are all-important for the Afghan war effort, and officials from NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) were trying to persuade Pakistan to lift the ban. Coalition forces rely heavily on convoys from Pakistan to bring in supplies and gear. Torkham Gate is one of the main ports of entry for materiel coming into the war zone. But he emphasized it's not the only way of getting supplies in, he said. Khyber Agency is one of the seven districts in Pakistan's tribal region. About half the cargo that flows into Afghanistan comes in via one of the two gates from Pakistan, the Defense Department says. Another 30 percent uses two major routes through Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, one via Russia and the other via the Caucasus. The remaining 20 percent -- mostly sensitive items like weapons, ammunition and other critical equipment -- comes in by air. ISAF said in a statement Thursday that its forces saw what they thought were insurgents trying to fire mortars at a coalition base in the Dand Patan District of Afghanistan's Paktiya province, near the Pakistani border. An air weapons team targeted the suspected insurgents' firing position, located inside Afghanistan along the border area, and the aircraft entered Pakistani airspace briefly ""as they engaged this initial target,"" the ISAF statement said. After this strike, the ""aircraft received what the crews assessed as effective small arms fire from individuals just across the border in Pakistan"" and the ISAF aircraft, operating in self-defense, entered into Pakistani airspace and killed ""several armed individuals."" Later, Pakistani military officials told ISAF that coalition aircraft struck its border forces. ""ISAF and Pakistani forces are reviewing the operational reporting to verify the exact location of the two engagements and the facts in this case, and we will work together to fully investigate this incident. ""Both sides have in mind that it is the insurgents, operating on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan and violating the territorial sovereignty of both countries, that we are focused on fighting,"" the ISAF statement said. ISAF issued ""sincere condolences to the Pakistani military and the families of those who were killed or injured."" The Pakistani government said two helicopters from Afghanistan appeared to have crossed the border into Pakistan in the Mandata Kandaho, Ali Mangola area of the upper Kurram Agency and engaged an outpost of Frontier Corps through cannon fire. The post, manned by six soldiers, is located 200 meters inside Pakistan, and troops fired their rifles to indicate that the helicopters were crossing into Pakistani territory. Instead of heeding the warning, the choppers fired two missiles and destroyed the post, killing the three soldiers and injuring three others. ""This is the third incident of its kind during past one week. In the wake of the last incident on 27 September, contact was made at the highest military level and the incident was regretted by the USA,"" the government said. NATO helicopters crossed into Pakistani airspace from Afghanistan in pursuit of insurgents over the weekend, killing 49 people, a spokesman told CNN Monday. Crossing the border did not violate the International Security Assistance Force rules of engagement, Maj. Michael Johnson said. Pakistan is very sensitive about U.S.-led military operations on its territory and issued a strong protest Monday. Pakistan called the incursions ""a clear violation and breach"" of U.N. rules for foreign forces in Afghanistan. The United Nations ""mandate terminates/finishes at the Afghanistan border. There are no agreed hot pursuit rules,"" Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. A commander of international forces in the western part of Afghanistan said Thursday that Pakistan's recent ban on use of supply routes is ""not a problem"" for troops in his area of the country. Italian Gen. Claudio Berto, talking to reporters in the Pentagon via satellite from Afghanistan, said, ""In my point of view, it's not a problem, we are really far away from Pakistan, and if you mean the goods for the soldier, they're coming through other borders, for example Turkmenistan. And we have no problem with this issue.""","NEW: About half of U.S. cargo comes into Afghanistan via Pakistan, Pentagon says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Four key GOP senators who have announced their support for a ""don't ask, don't tell"" repeal are prepared to join Democrats in voting to let the bill proceed, aides to the four said Friday. The aides said Susan Collins, Olympia Snowe, Lisa Murkowski and Scott Brown will vote Saturday to end debate on the ban on openly gay and lesbian people in the military, regardless of whether the Senate passes a stopgap spending bill, a continuing resolution to keep the government funded. The four have previously said that bill must be approved first. The Senate is currently working to craft a temporary spending bill, made necessary after Democratic leadership pulled a $1 trillion spending bill after Republicans abandoned their support of it. The four senators' support for the ""don't ask, don't tell"" repeal would ensure the 60 votes needed to clear the way for the bill to advance even if Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, votes against it, as is expected. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, who co-sponsored legislation that would repeal the policy, said Friday that the four senators have ""shown courage"" in supporting the measure. Lieberman said he believes that the Senate will have more than the 60 votes needed, adding that the bill's co-sponsors had worked closely with the Defense Department in crafting its language. But Pentagon officials are warning gay and lesbian soldiers that the current law will temporarily remain in place, if the bill passes, as they review the legal technicalities of the repeal. A guidance memo would be sent to military personnel informing them of the change, which would remain in effect for at least 60 days after it is signed into law, Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan said. Conservative Republicans have argued that, among other things, a repeal would place an unreasonable burden on the military at a time when it is facing severe strains in Afghanistan and elsewhere. The House of Representatives voted Wednesday to overturn the ban in a ""standalone"" measure not tied to any other legislative items. It passed 250-175 on mostly partisan lines. The House had passed a repeal of the ban as part of a larger defense policy bill, but the measure stalled last week in the Senate. Obama and Democratic leaders are trying to push through a repeal before the end of the current lame-duck congressional session. The more conservative incoming Congress, which will be seated the first week of January, is considered far less likely to overturn the Clinton-era ban. CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","NEW: Senators withdraw their requirement that spending bill pass first .

"(CNN) -- Folashade Abugan is the third Nigerian athlete to have failed a drugs test at the Commonwealth Games in India, where she won two silver medals, it was revealed on Friday. Abugan, who came second in the women's 400 meters last week and the 4x400m relay on Tuesday, has been stripped of both of her medals after testing positive for the banned anabolic substance testosterone prohormone. The 20-year-old, who was world junior champion in 2008, has waived her right to have her ""B"" sample tested, the Commonwealth Games Federation said a day after the four-yearly event finished in New Delhi. ""Folashade Abugan returned an adverse analytical finding from a test conducted on October 8, 2010, after competing in the women's 400 meter final,"" the CGF said in a statement. The news comes as a blow to the Nigeria team, who were already reeling following the failed tests of both women's 100m champion Osayemi Oludamola and Samuel Okon, who came sixth in the men's 110m hurdles. That duo tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine. The CGF statement also said Abugan has admitted liability for the failed test, and she has been disqualified from all the events she participated in. ""Ms Abugan wrote to the CGF waiving her rights to have her ""B"" sample analyzed and a hearing, as provided for within the CGF Anti-Doping Standard (ADS). She also admitted liability. ""She has been disqualified from all events she participated in during the Games, with the results nullified. This includes her silver medal in the women's 400 meters. ""As she was also a member of her country's second placed 4x400m relay team, that result is also nullified."" The silver medal she obtained in the 400m will now go to Aliann Tabitha Pompey of Guyana, with Christine Amertil of the Bahamas being promoted into the bronze medal position. England's quartet of Kelly Massey, Victoria Barr, Meghan Beesley and Nadine Okyere have been elevated to second position in the 4x400m relay, with Canada's Amonn Nelson, Adrienne Power, Vicki Tolton and Carline Muir now claiming bronze.","Nigeria's Folashade Abugan has tested positive for a banned substance .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Talk about burying the hatchet. When former President Bill Clinton turned out to rally for California Democratic gubernatorial nominee Jerry Brown on Friday night, the former rivals hugged and made up. Really, they embraced. The two have a bitter political history dating to 1992, when they ran against each other in the Democratic presidential primary. Back then, Brown earned Clinton's animus by refusing to drop out until well after it was clear Clinton had locked up the nomination. Speaking before a crowd on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles, Brown heaped praise on the former president. ""Let me tell you about President Clinton. I don't need to say much. Not only was he great in office, but he has been great after he left office,"" Brown said. ""He didn't retire to Palm Springs to play golf, he's out there doing stuff. He's helping people in Haiti. He's fighting AIDS."" He cheered the former president for ""motivating ... the highest angles of our spirit."" Clinton returned the favor, telling the crowd of screaming students, ""I've known Jerry Brown for almost 35 years. When we were governors together, we strongly supported to push for green energy ... he knew it was good economics when most people thought it was a fools errand."" Reviewing Brown's history as a two-term California governor, then mayor of Oakland and now attorney general, he enthused, ""I watched him consistently choose the future over the present, but not take a meat axe to the present"" insisting ""that's what you need now."" Brown is in a tight race with former eBay CEO Meg Whitman, who has funded her campaign with more than $119 million of her own money. It was Whitman who first brought Clinton into this race -- when she ran an ad featuring old footage of then-Gov. Clinton ripping into Brown during the 1992 campaign. A clearly irked Brown responded by making a snarky remark about Clinton's honesty and tossing in a reference to the affair with Monica Lewinsky. Brown later said he called Clinton's office to apologize and the former president announced plans to endorse his old rival. There were times during Clinton's speech that Brown seemed to lose patience, staring at the ground or stonily straight ahead. But there were no openly tense moments. For most of his remarks, the former president talked about the economy, accusing Republicans of digging America into a fiscal ditch and insisting ""the last thing you want to do is put the shovel brigade back in the hole."" He made a special appeal to the crowd of mostly college students, imploring them ""if young people vote as the same percentage of the electorate they did two years ago, then the good guys win."" He also gave praise to the other candidate on the stage, lieutenant governor hopeful Gavin Newsom, who is a Clinton friend and a supporter of Hillary Clinton's candidacy during the last election. But Clinton offered a special compliment for Brown. ""He's the only politician in America I've heard say this except me"" and went on to insist that ""as horrible"" as the recession has been ""when we come out of it, if we learn right lessons from it, we will be stronger for it."" He criticized Whitman's policy positions and closed with a Brown endorsement saying, ""The candidates have radically different ideas: one will lead us to a brighter future and the other will lead us to a movie we've seen before."" When they left the stage, the former adversaries went their separate ways. Brown walked off while Clinton worked the ropeline, crossing through the barricade and into the crowd to shake hands with just about every waiting visitor.","Jerry Brown is a Democratic gubernatorial nominee for California .

"(CNN) -- A school security chief gave an emotional account Thursday of his shootout with a Florida man who held school board members hostage before opening fire. Mikes Jones with Bay District Schools in Panama City told HLN ""Prime News"" he was afraid the system's superintendent was dead after Clay Duke, 56, pointed a handgun at the leader and opened fire Tuesday afternoon. Everything around me was just silent. It was in slow motion,"" said Jones, a former school board member and a retired Panama City police officer. Superintendent Bill Husfelt then raised his head above the counter after the shooting incident, in which at least 15 shots were fired. ""I couldn't believe he was alive,"" Jones told HLN. After a day spending time with his pastor and family, Jones talked with the media about the gun battle that took place during a routine school board meeting. ""When he fired the first shot, I had no recourse. It was a gun battle,"" Mike Jones told reporters about his encounter with Duke. ""I'm not a hero. I had just done my job."" Jones, who is known as the affable ""Salvage Santa"" for his charity work, said his ""heart goes out"" to the family of Duke, who his wife described as having bipolar disorder. ""I just want to get right with God about this and right with my church about what had happened,"" said Jones. Duke's widow, Rebecca Crowder-Duke, apologized for her husband's actions and said she understood that Jones was doing what he was ""trained to do."" Jones wasn't supposed to be at the routine meeting, but swung by in case there were questions about a remodeling matter related to his job. ""I wasn't in the building five minutes that I got into the gunfight."" He said he got a call about the dramatic confrontation and went downstairs. Inside, Duke had approached the front of the room, spray-painted a red ""V"" with a circle around it on the wall and brandished a handgun. He ordered the room cleared of everyone but six men and got into a discourse with board members and Husfelt about several issues, including the termination of Duke's wife. Jones did a ""peeka-boo"" look into the room, hoping Duke would come out. The officer, who recently received rapid response training, went to his vehicle to get a protective vest and more ammunition and returned. ""I was peeking through the crack of the door and when I saw his back and he was squared up with both hands I knew that the fight was fixing to happen,"" said Jones. But the officer said he could not get a clear line of fire on Duke. A chilling video of the meeting, from a live internet feed provided by CNN affiliates WJHG and WMBB, shows Husfelt attempting to reason with Duke. Husfelt pleaded with Duke to allow the other members to leave the room. ""Will you let them go? You're obviously upset at me, so why are they here?"" he asked on the video. At one point, Husfelt told Duke, ""I don't want anybody to get hurt. I've got a feeling that's what you want, is you want the cops to come in and kill you because you are mad, because you said you are going to die. But why? This isn't worth it."" Duke then pointed the pistol at Husfelt, who said, ""Please don't. Please don't. Please."" But Duke pulled the trigger as Husfelt and the others hit the floor. The gunman fired several times, missing everyone. Crowder-Duke told WJHG on Wednesday that her husband, who she described as having bipolar disorder and unable to get work recently because of his prior criminal record, intentionally fired over the people and did not intend to harm them. ""If he really wanted to shoot anybody, they (would have) already been dead,"" said Crowder-Duke, who police say was terminated as a teacher this year. She said she had received praise from her principal. Jones said he believed the superintendent had been shot. He opened the door with one hand and opened fire with the other, wounding Duke three times in a gunfire exchange. The suspect fell to the floor and fatally shot himself in the head, police said. WJHG reported that Jones was taken to a hospital with chest pains after the incident. The officer said he first struck Duke in the back and was worried he might go to jail. ""There's just so many things that go through your mind. It was instinct and training."" Jones told reporters he feels Husfelt deserved the accolades for asking Duke to let the other school board members go. ""Mike and his timing saved our lives,"" Husfelt said. But it was evident at Thursday's press conference the incident took a toll on Jones. ""The first thing that came to mind (was) what is this community going to think of me?"" he said. ""I'm known as Salvage Santa, this nice guy. Now I've taken somebody's life."" Crowder-Duke said she has no animosity toward Jones. ""I don't fault you for (the shooting). I know you were just doing what you were trained to do, and I'm sorry that God had to choose you to do that because you are a very kind, sweet, generous man,"" Crowder-Duke told WJHG. Husfelt said the district would re-evaluate security in the wake of the incident but said he doubted security would have made a difference. ""We could have had this place like Fort Knox. ... There was nothing we could have done to stop him."" For 27 years, Jones has restored bicycles, raised money and collected toys to be given away to needy children, according to the Panama City News Herald. The officer said he would be at a local store Thursday night to further the effort.","Security chief said he was afraid gunman killed superintendent .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- An American professor doing research in London stumbled across a series of previously unknown letters written by, to, and about Benjamin Franklin, a stunning find that sheds new light on early U.S. history. The letters cover Benjamin Franklin's success in dealing with a British general. The collection of 47 letters are hand-written copies made 250 years ago, when Franklin lived in London. That they were filed under the copyist's name, not Franklin's, may explain why they were overlooked by historians until now, said a curator at the British Library, where the letters are held. The find is reported in the April issue of the William & Mary Quarterly, a journal of early American history and culture. The letters are important in large part because they offer a ""wealth of new details"" that affect modern understanding of Franklin, writes Alan Houston, the political science professor who discovered the letters in the spring of 2007. They also raise the question of how many other documents remain waiting to be found on Franklin and his life. Houston, a professor at the University of California at San Diego, discovered the letters on the last day of his last research trip to London, just before the library's closing time. ""The first item was a letter from Benjamin Franklin to the secretary of the governor of Maryland, and I looked at it and I started to read, and I thought, 'This doesn't look familiar,'"" Houston told CNN. ""I've read everything Franklin ever wrote."" Houston said he quickly began to realize he had uncovered something previously unknown to historians. ""I swear, I just about shot through the ceiling I was so excited,"" he said. ""It's like finding a treasure chest."" Houston had been working at the time on a book on Franklin, ""Benjamin Franklin and the Politics of Improvement,"" published last year. The letters cover Franklin's success in dealing with British Gen. Edward Braddock, who had been sent to Pennsylvania in 1755 to defeat the French at Fort Duquesne, in modern-day Pittsburgh. The march to retake the fort was part of the French and British battle for control of the western lands in the colonies, part of a larger struggle for control of North America, Houston said. The problem was that Braddock was given no horses or wagons when he arrived in America -- no means of transport for him and his 2,000 redcoats. Braddock started to blame his hosts, so Franklin -- the Pennsylvania assembly's leading politician -- stepped in to help. Franklin went all over Pennsylvania trying to persuade farmers to lend their horses and wagons to Braddock and his men. It wasn't easy, because the farmers were tough negotiators who were also anxious and suspicious of the effort. Eventually, Franklin managed to get the farmers to agree, and within weeks, Braddock and his men were on the march. Braddock suffered a devastating defeat before he even reached the fort, however, when a much smaller contingent of French and Indian soldiers surprised the British. They killed Braddock and about 1,000 of his men. Despite the defeat, Franklin's success -- in what became known as ""the wagon affair"" -- highlighted his skill as a colonial leader, Houston said. When Franklin was sent to London in 1757 as a representative of the assembly, he brought with him a collection of letters detailing that success. It was proof of his political value to Great Britain and that the assembly's loyalties had been on the right side. This collection of letters, which Franklin referred to in his autobiography as his ""quire book,"" was never found, however -- until now. Houston said he believes the documents he read at the British Library are copies of that collection. They were made by Thomas Birch, an industrious and obsessive transcriber of historical documents who copied anything he could get his hands on. ""There was a vogue. It was very common for letters to be copied,"" said Matthew Shaw, curator of the U.S. collections at the British Library. ""Birch was very well known for being a copyist."" Birch and Franklin were friends in London, both members of the Royal Society, and Houston said he believes the copies were made sometime between 1757 and 1758. ""Birch undoubtedly found Franklin's quire book captivating, and he appears to have copied anything that remotely interested him,"" Houston writes in the journal. Also, Braddock's campaign and defeat were widely discussed in London, and ""Birch may have wanted to capture a crucial moment in the life of the (Royal) society's most famous American member."" Birch's transcripts were filed in the British Library as ""Copies of Letters relating to the March of General Braddock."" They form part of the massive Birch Collection containing the hundreds of volumes of his copies that Birch bequeathed to the library on his death, said Shaw. They weren't properly catalogued until the early 1970s, Shaw said, which is largely why they haven't been used by scholars. ""It's the first time they've really been shared with a wider audience,"" Shaw told CNN. ""We're very pleased.""","Collection of letters by, to, and about Benjamin Franklin found in London .

"(CNN) -- Residents of the two largest U.S. cities will finally be able to tap into Sprint Nextel's 4G wireless network soon. Sprint plans to launch its speedier, fourth-generation internet in New York on November 1. The 4G network will come to Los Angeles, California, at the beginning of December and to San Francisco, California, in late December, the company said. Sprint, the third-largest U.S. cellular provider by number of subscribers, rolled out its first 4G city network two years ago in Baltimore, Maryland. Since then, the telecom has added 54 cities, a mix of large metropolitan areas like Chicago, Illinois, and Las Vegas, Nevada, as well as smaller ones. With the three imminent additions, Sprint can color in some crucial sectors of its 4G coverage map. It's an important weapon to have in the face of plans by Verizon Wireless, the largest U.S. cell carrier by subscribers, to cover 38 cities with its 4G network this year. Moreover, the upcoming launches push Sprint closer to achieving its goal of covering the homes of 120 million Americans with its 4G network by the end of the year -- 10 million more than Verizon's plan. But Verizon's 4G network can reach speeds faster than Sprint's. The new infrastructure Sprint uses is in partnership with Clearwire, so the major telecom is reliant on Clearwire (in which Sprint owns a majority stake) to determine where it will build the so-called Wi-Max 4G technology. ""Wireless is a very competitive arena,"" acknowledged Sprint spokeswoman Kathleen Dunleavy. Teresa Kellett, Sprint's director of 4G, said she doesn't foresee Verizon's (and eventually AT&T's) speed advantage being an issue. ""The speeds with our 4G is significantly better than anything [customers] have experienced to date on a wireless device,"" Kellett said. ""They just need it to be responsive enough and fast enough for what they're doing."" Kellett boasts that Sprint subscribers can receive access to unlimited wireless data on 4G, whereas she expects other carriers will put caps on how much customers can download. AT&T has already put a halt to unlimited data plans for new customers. After Sprint 4G was launched in Baltimore, 20 months passed before a phone maker built a handset compatible with the faster network. With that Evo 4G smartphone from HTC and another from Samsung Electronics -- and 10 other miscellaneous devices -- Sprint is confident with its lead. However, T-Mobile began selling its first phone designed to take advantage of its next-gen HSPA+ network last week -- another HTC phone, called the G2. Verizon says it will have 4G cards for laptops this year and will have a half-dozen 4G-capable products to show in January. Verizon may add another gun to its arsenal. Rumors are flying that Apple will build an iPhone compatible with Verizon's network, a phone which may or may not use 4G. ""We feel very strongly about our Evo,"" Dunleavy, the Sprint spokeswoman, said. ""We feel it can stand head to head with the iPhone.""","Sprint plans to launch its 4G data network in New York on November 1 .

"(CNET) -- Ceatec didn't officially start until Monday, but Toshiba was already getting the lion's share of the buzz here on the show floor, with its glasses-less 3D TV. The device was announced Sunday night, and people flocked to the demonstration in a dark makeshift theater Monday, where the wait was nearly an hour. The reason? Because finally, mercifully, a TV maker has come up with a way to watch 3D at home without those ridiculous plastic glasses. There were three sizes on display: 12 inches, 20 inches, and 56 inches. While the smaller size models are destined for the Japanese market in December, the 56-incher is just a prototype and there are no imminent plans to make it into an actual product, according to a Toshiba representative here. The 3D Regza TV uses the Cell Broadband Engine that takes a 2D image and then simultaneously creates nine images of it from nine different directions, in real time. It's displayed on a high-definition LED TV. CNET: Watch an explanation video of how the technology works . After spending some time in the theater, we found the TV works surprisingly well. It's not a 3D cinema-quality experience, and there's clearly room to improve, but again, you don't have to wear any glasses. Still images fare better than moving images. And you have to sit (though we stood during the demo) very close to the center of the screen to get the effect. With the 12-inch version, move more than a few inches to the left or right and the 3D effect is lost. However, the viewing angle was better on the 20-inch model, and the best on the 56-inch one. And there's another matter of practicality: to get the best effect, you have to stand pretty close to the LED TV, closer than any normal person would want to for fear singeing their retinas. That's why the glasses-less 3D laptop, a Toshiba Dynabook, is a far more realistic application of the glasses-less technology: It's the same size as the 12-inch TV, but since it's natural to sit very close to a laptop and look at it straight on, the aforementioned problems are negated. The 12-inch 3D TV goes on sale in Japan at the end of this year for 120,000 yen, or $1,500. The 20-inch will have a 240,000 yen price tag, or about $2,900. Sorry, rest of the world, you'll have to wait, since there's no timetable for bringing either to other markets. © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea will hold its largest-ever winter live-fire drills Thursday in an area adjacent to North Korea, the South Korean Army said on Wednesday. The drills are scheduled as tensions between the two countries remain high. South Korea held live-fire military exercises earlier this week, a move that North Korea said could ignite a war. Both Koreas have traded tough talk and conducted military drills in the weeks after North Korea shelled a South Korean island last month. See more of CNN.com's Koreas coverage .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. diplomatic cables obtained and released by WikiLeaks frequently rely on unnamed sources for delicate information. But one such source -- a businessman in Mozambique -- has furiously denied making remarks about high-level corruption attributed to him by a U.S. diplomat. A cable dated January 2010 sent by then Charge d'Affaires Todd Chapman at the U.S. Embassy covered allegations about officials enabling drug trafficking by accepting bribes. They were based on a source who said he had ""personally seen"" one senior official [who is named in the cable] ""receiving pay-offs quite openly."" But now that source insists such words never left his mouth. ""I feel I have been used. This is all Todd Chapman's own agenda. He obviously imagined I would never read what he had written,"" the source told the state-run Agencia de Informacao de Mocambique (AIM). Several current and former officials came under attack in the cable in question. Chapman wrote that his source had told him the country's ruling party, FRELIMO, ""brazenly squeezes the business community for kickbacks."" The source also supposedly called the country's president a ""vicious scorpion who will sting you,"" and said FRELIMO and an alleged drug lord had their own clearing agent at a port. In an interview with AIM, Chapman's source admits meeting him in 2009 but says he only told the diplomat of problems he was having with his business. When asked about other things, the source said, ""I just told him I didn't know. I only knew what I read in the papers."" A similar case surfaced in a leaked cable from Peru. In March 2009, the U.S. Embassy in Lima sent a dispatch insinuating that a regional Army commander, General Paul da Silva, was involved in drug trafficking. The source's name was redacted, but he suggested the general was coordinating drug shipments with another man who was later arrested for smuggling drugs hidden in consignments of frozen fish. Da Silva, now the head of Peru's military, strongly denied the allegation and has threatened to bring legal action against the ambassador who wrote the cable. The wife of Zimbabwe's president has sued a Zimbabwean newspaper for $15 million following its publication of allegations contained in a leaked cable that she was linked to and profited from illegal diamond sales in the southern African country. The accusations in the Mozambique cable echo comments in several others from the country between July 2009 and January of this year. There are reports of officials routinely taking payoffs to turn a blind eye to drug shipments. One summary says bluntly: ""Mozambique has been called the second most active narcotics transit point in Africa."" The State Department would not comment on the leaked cables that were supposedly authored by Chapman. A profile on the networking website LinkedIn lists Chapman as now working at the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan. In a cable from November 2009, Chapman writes, ""The decrease in drug-related arrests at Maputo International Airport is not attributable to improved interdiction efforts but rather increased police and customs involvement in drug smuggling. A high level law enforcement official admits most police drug seizures are not reported to his office because traffickers and police make on-the-spot arrangements to allow the drugs to continue to flow."" Several attempts by CNN seeking comment from Mozambique's government were unsuccessful, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation released a statement denying the accusations. ""This information does not have any support base and undermines the image, prestige and good name of the Mozambican state and its leaders,"" said the statement reported by Radio Mozambique. Chapman said one prominent businessman, Mohamed Bashir Suleman, was ""described by multiple contacts as the largest narcotrafficker in Mozambique"" with contacts at senior levels of the government. Suleman is also a donor to the ruling party. Earlier this year, President Barack Obama identified Suleman under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, and the U.S. Treasury Department subsequently sanctioned businesses he owned, calling him a ""large-scale narcotics trafficker."" Suleman strenuously denied the allegations in a news conference, saying he had never been involved with drugs. As for his relationship with FRELIMO, he said: ""I am a member of the party, and I gave financial support for the good of the country and the good of the party."" He denied receiving any favors from the ruling party and said all of his goods passed through port scanners. A cable from July 2009 said a source within FRELIMO had described a customs official as ""the King of Corruption."" Six months later, Chapman wrote that same official had purchased real estate ""valued at well beyond what his government salary should be able to afford."" The official's office told CNN he was on vacation and wouldn't be available for comment until later this month. Chapman contended that of the more than ten drug seizures during 2009, none had led to prosecutions as of January 2010. He said a senior law enforcement officer admitted most seizures aren't made public because officials ask for bribes and keep the drugs for resale. Chapman also said police told Embassy officers they weren't willing ""to go after 'big fish' narcotraffickers because of their ties to senior officials."" Not every official is accused of living a double standard. ""Mozambique's Tax Authority (AT) has garnered a reputation for honesty and transparency,"" Chapman wrote in July 2009. ""Mozambique most certainly is not yet a thoroughly-corrupted narco-state,"" he says. But, ""money laundering, related government corruption (possibly even official support), and ties to South Asia mean that the problem has the potential to get much worse."" Transparency International, which monitors corruption worldwide, said in a 2009 report that ""the end of hostilities provided increased corruption opportunities, through the development of a market economy in the context of a weak state."" CNN's Marilia Brocchetto contributed to this report.","Leaked cables have unnamed sources furious .

"London (CNN) -- Lisa Suarez's voice breaks as she stands in the snow outside London's Heathrow airport, unable to get a flight home to Dallas, Texas. ""It's very hard,"" she says. ""All I want for Christmas is to hug my daughter."" She and her family are among hundreds of thousands of people stranded by ""freak weather conditions"" that dumped unexpected tons of snow on Europe this weekend, snarling flight schedules at the continent's busiest airports. Heathrow planned to cancel all arrivals Sunday, but later said it might allow three planes to land. A dozen long-haul flights are scheduled to take off Sunday night, spokesman Andrew Teacher said. He did not say which ones. Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris told travelers to expect two-hour delays and cancellation of a quarter of flights. One in five flights was being canceled at the French capital's second airport, Paris-Orly, with delays of an hour expected, Aeroports de Paris said on its website. Germany's Frankfurt airport said at least 500 of a planned 1,300 flights would be scrapped Sunday. And more snow is expected in Germany during the day, which will put further strain on flight schedules, spokesman Waltraud Riehemann said. More than 200,000 passengers were due to take off from Heathrow on Sunday, said Donna O'Brien, a spokeswoman for Heathrow airport operator BAA. Most won't be able to, she said. Workers were trying to remove 30 metric tons of snow from each of the airport's 200 aircraft parking stands, according to the airport's website. Meanwhile, ground travel in France was also snarled by heavy snowfall and cold temperatures. The U.K.'s Foreign and Commonwealth Office said Sunday that French authorities reported they are preventing all cargo trucks and buses from using roads in northern france and the greater Paris metropolitan area, and that car travel is ""unadvisable."" Air and rail services were also affected, the office said. The adverse weather in France even affected pop singer Lady Gaga, who said on her Facebook page that all 28 of her tour trucks had been detained by the government for more than 24 hours. The Lady Gaga concert set for Sunday night was rescheduled for Tuesday, according to the website of the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy, where it was to be held. A Monday concert remains scheduled. Paris police said that since noon Saturday, more than 1,300 trucks had been barred from entering Paris, and no trucks were being allowed to circulate in the city. They could not confirm whether Lady Gaga's trucks were among them. In other travel news: . --Britain's Automobile Association helped more than 3,000 drivers by 10:30 Sunday morning, and was getting 800 calls for assistance every hour, it said. It expected 14,000 call-outs by the end of the day, nearly twice the average on a Sunday. Another organization, the RAC, said it was getting 1,500 calls an hour to help drivers, mostly in Scotland. --London's Gatwick airport says its runway is open and ""operations are gradually returning to normal."" --Heathrow will have no flights from Terminals 1 or 4, and only a small number from Terminals 3 and 5, it says. Terminal 2 is closed for renovation. --Heathrow urges passengers to check with airlines before flying. Contact numbers are listed on its website, www.heathrowairport.com . --British Airways tells passengers to check www.ba2go.com before coming to the airport. Customers who need to rebook in the U.S. should call 1-800-247-9297. Those in the UK should call 0800 727 800. BA warns of high call volume despite hiring extra call center staff and urges people to call only if necessary. --BMI cancels all flights to and from Heathrow and asks passengers not to come to the airport. --British train operator Network Rail says trains are running more or less normally, but advises passengers to check before traveling. Heathrow is Europe's busiest airport -- and one of the busiest in the world. Paris Charles de Gaulle is second, and Frankfurt sees the third-highest traffic on the continent. Forecasters say the United Kingdom will remain in the grip of bitter winter weather at least through Monday. Heathrow employees are working to try to make the airport fully operational by Monday. ""We've got a few thousand people that have, unfortunately, had to spend the night,"" BAA spokesman Teacher said Sunday. ""We've been making them as comfortable as possible with blankets, with food and water."" Teacher said ice is the main problem affecting flights. ""We are extremely sorry for the disruption that's been caused to people's journeys today, but the decision has been made simply to avoid any kind of potential risk,"" Teacher said. ""These are absolutely ... freak weather conditions,"" he added. ""We've not seen a storm like this in 20 years."" On Saturday, frigid temperatures and extreme conditions pummeled Europe. From Northern Ireland to Bulgaria, blizzard conditions left airports with heavy delays or shut them entirely. Snow, ice and fog have caused travel chaos ahead of a busy holiday travel week. And severe weather could continue on Monday as another series of weather systems move in, said Met Office special forecaster Tony Burgess. ""There is another risk of [heavy snow] across England and south Wales on Monday,"" Burgess said. The next wave of snowy weather is expected to bring up to 20 centimeters (8 inches) to some parts of the United Kingdom, with London expected to receive 5 to 10 centimeters (2 to 4 inches) of snow. The weather system will move across France and Germany on Sunday. Below-normal temperatures are expected to continue in northern Europe into the beginning of next week.

"New York (CNN) -- Two Turkish-American gas station workers on suburban Long Island say they were assaulted and beaten with a flagpole bearing an American flag on the night of Election Day. Five men face charges in the alleged attack, police said Thursday. The incident began when some teenagers became angry when they were asked to show identification for a tobacco purchase, said Erdaogan Yavuz, the manager of the OK Gas Station in Wantagh, New York, told CNN. ""My father is a cop and he's going to kill all you guys,"" one of them said, according to Yavuz. The teens, yelling expletives, left only to return a short time later with two older men. All five began to assault Yavuz and his co-worker, Yuksel Cebeci, Yavuz said. Cebeci was able to get inside the station, but Yavuz said he was beaten badly. One of the older men shouted, ""You aliens get ... out of my country!"" ""Then he grabbed the [gas station's] flag and hit me in the face with the flagpole, and that's when I grabbed the flag from him to defend myself,"" said Yavuz, who said he became a naturalized citizen of the United States in March. When Nassau County police arrived on site, the man attacked one of the officers, according to a spokesman for the 8th precinct in Levittown. The officer was treated at St. Joseph Hospital in Bethpage for lacerations to his right knee and a swollen hand, the spokesman said. Cebeci was treated for broken fingers, Yavuz said. All five men were charged with assault but the case will not be prosecuted as a hate crime, said Chris Munzing, the deputy director of communications for Nassau County Police. The men were arraigned on Wednesday, and November court appearances have been set, the district attorney's office said. The district attorney's office identified the men as Nicholas Lazarus, Christ Makhmaltchi, Gregory Vitale, Richard Vitale Jr. and Richard Vitale Sr. Attempts to reach the suspects and their attorneys were not immediately successful Thursday afternoon. A surveillance video from the gas station is in the hands of prosecutors, officials said.","A request for ID for a tobacco purchase was the trigger, the station manager says .

"(CNN) -- Sixteen-year-old Valery Bianco and his 13-year-old sister Marina Bianco take extra care in preparing and wrapping their shoe box gifts for ""Operation Christmas Child."" They know firsthand what these gifts could mean to a child. ""I was almost 10 when I received my shoe box, and it was touching to receive a gift as an orphan, someone people don't care about,"" Valery says. Those shoe boxes were the first gifts that Valery and Marina received during their life at a Russian orphanage. When they were sent to the orphanage years earlier, they were not allowed to bring any possessions with them. Birthdays were not celebrated and there were no toys to be found on Christmas morning. All the two siblings had was each other. At times, it was hard for them to see how the tough life at the orphanage affected each other. ""I would see him fight with other boys and I would run into my room and hope he was OK. There were so many fights,"" Marina said. For Marina, the shoe box gift came when she needed it the most. She was 6 years old when it arrived. At that point, she was becoming very angry, finding herself in a lot of fights as well. She started believing that she had nothing to fight for. ""I did not care what happened to me,"" Marina said. ""People would want to beat up on me. I thought, well that is what life is. But when I received the shoe box, I realized that someone did care for me in the world, and I thought that I should live a good life."" Her shoe box had the simplest items: A small towel, a few toiletries, a coloring book and stickers and a small stuffed animal. For Marina, these possessions meant she was worth something. ""I realized you can be anyone you want, that you can control your own life,""  Marina said. Four years after receiving those first gifts, Valery and Marina were adopted by a family in the United States. As they were adjusting to an American life, learning English and a different culture, their new older sister came home from school one day with a shoe box present that she was wrapping for ""Operation Christmas Child."" The ""Operation Christmas Child"" program was started in 1993 by Samaritan's Purse, a Christian international relief group. That first year, Operation Christmas Child collected 28,000 shoe box gifts. Since then, the organization has received more than 8 million shoe boxes, which have been shipped to more than 100 countries. For this holiday season, they are accepting gifts through December 25 and have created a ""Build-A-Box"" online tool, where the gifts can be virtually selected and purchased. Then a Samaritan's Purse volunteer packs and wraps the shoe box gift. ""I knew how it felt to receive that box, how it changed my life. If there is a person right now, a child in trouble, thinking of running away, that box could comfort him. That is how I felt,"" Marina said. ""I realized I could help others."" As Marina started her own shoe box to send, she included a coloring book, a toothbrush, hard candy, a ball and a puzzle. In Russia, she loved puzzles because they would give her a focused activity during the many hours she was alone with her thoughts in the orphanage. Valery's shoe box had similar items, but he made sure his also included a toy car. It brought back memories of the one he received in his shoe box gift. ""I know they will have fun with that, I know I enjoyed it as a kid. I put my love in there and what I thought would comfort them. To let them know this is for you. You can own something now,"" Valery said. One ingredient requested for every shoe box, whether built online or prepared at home, is a personalized note of encouragement for the child who will receive it. Marina's note was easy for her to write. ""I told them about myself, that I received a box, and that I hope this box touches their life. I also wrote my address and e-mail in case they ever wanted to reach me,"" Marina said. When Valery thinks of a child reading his words of support, he recalls the note he received. ""I used to think about who sent my box, I wondered what they were like and what they enjoyed doing. I knew it was a good person with love in them,"" Valery said. Valery and Marina were silent as they wrapped their shoe boxes and realized that they are now the people making a difference.

"(CNN)  -- Inter Milan beat African underdogs TP Mazembe 3-0 to win FIFA's Club World Cup in Abu Dhabi on Saturday. First half goals from Goran Pandev and Samuel Eto'o and a late strike from substitute Jonathan Biabiany sealed victory for the European champions at the Zayed Sport City Stadium. Congolese side Mazenbe had shocked Internacional of Brazil in the semifinals but found themselves outclassed by the Serie A champions. The win will take a little of the pressure off Inter manager Rafael Benitez, whose side are trailing arch rivals AC Milan in the Italian title race this season. Inter took the lead after 14 minutes when Pandev was found by Eto'o with the Macedonian scoring neatly. With three minutes, Inter had extended their advantage after Javier Zanetti's cut-back found Cameroon star Eto'o to fire home. Mazembe goalkeeper Muteba Kidiaba, one of the stars of their passage to the final, came to the rescue with two fine saves to deny Diego Milito as Inter looked to kill the game off for good. But Mazembe had few chances, the best falling to Dioko Kaluyituka, who saw a first half stoppage time volley blocked by Ivan Cordoba and was denied by Julio Cesar with time running out. Maicon hit the post for Inter after the break but sealed victory as Biabiany run on to a through ball to score the third with five minutes left. Earlier, South American champions Internacional took third place with a 4-2 win over Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma of South Korea with Alecsandro scoring twice.","Inter Milan crowned FIFA Club World Champions in Abu Dhabi .

"(CNN) -- Forecasters say the United Kingdom will remain in the grip of bitter winter weather through at least Monday. ""Heavy snow showers Sunday will affect northeast England and eastern parts of Scotland as a snow system comes in off the North Sea,"" said Met Office Special Forecaster Tony Burgess. ""Southern England should not see much snow Sunday, Heathrow and Gatwick will hopefully improve, and northern Ireland will see a bit of respite,"" he said. Burgess added that another series of weather systems will move into the area, warning, ""There is another risk of [heavy snow] across England and south Wales on Monday."" A spokesman for Heathrow airport operator BAA told CNN, ""We have a team working very hard around the clock to do everything to prepare the airport for operation."" BAA is sending similar information out as Twitter messages. Frigid temperatures and extreme conditions continued to pummel Europe Saturday. Snow, ice and fog have caused travel chaos ahead of a busy holiday travel week. From Northern Ireland to Bulgaria, blizzard conditions left airports with heavy delays or shut them entirely. London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports closed all runways Saturday afternoon because of heavy snow and ice, though Gatwick reopened at 3 p.m. after clearing 4 inches of snow from the tarmac. Despite the reopening, the airport warned of ""inevitable"" delays and cancellations throughout the day. British Airways canceled all Saturday domestic and European flights at Heathrow. On Saturday night the airport announced it would be closed indefinitely. All easyJet and British Airways flights -- with the exception of a flight to Egypt -- were canceled out of Gatwick as well. Police closed several access roads surrounding the airports due to dangerous driving conditions. The delays and cancellations extended across Europe -- to Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Geneva, Switzerland; Munich, Germany; Paris, France; and Copenhagen, Denmark. Heavy snowfall also forced the closing of Hungary's Budapest Ferihegy International Airport on Saturday. It had reopened by 4:30 p.m. The relentless weather caused approximately 250 flights to be cancelled and thousands of passengers stranded at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport on Friday, according to airport spokeswoman Antoinette Spaans. ""We are expecting more delays due to weather conditions,"" Spaans said Saturday. ""The most delays and cancellations are expected to affect air traffic within Europe,"" she added. Katherin Kujit and her husband spent four hours at Schiphol and still didn't make their flight. ""Some people seemed very calm, but many were agitated,"" Kujit said. ""You could not sit, suitcases everywhere. People squashed closely together because they don't want to lose 4 inches in line."" They eventually gave up and booked a Monday flight to the United States. Ireland braced for an icey Saturday as the Irish Meteorological Service, Met Eireann, forecast widespread frost, ice and freezing fog for the morning, and some sleet and snow showers for later in the day. Temperatures were expected to drop down to between 4 and 8 degrees Celsius below zero (between 18 degrees and 25 degrees Fahrenheit) Saturday night. Northern Ireland was blanketed at the end of this week with its worst snowfall in 25 years, according to CNN affiliate TV3. The government issued emergency snow warnings Friday night, and more snow was expected Saturday. The Police Service of Northern Ireland warned motorists to avoid treacherous roads and travel ""only if absolutely necessary."" A British Airways flight from Boston and bound for London's Heathrow airport was flying over Ireland when passengers looking at their seat-back video screens noticed the map showed their plane making a U-turn. The aircraft later landed in Reykjavik, Iceland. Passengers alternately groaned and laughed when airline officials told them they had no idea when the flight to the United Kingdom could continue. At Frankfurt Airport Saturday approximately 240 flights were canceled and delays are expected to continue, according to airport officials. Airport personnel worked frantically Saturday morning to de-ice airplanes and return the airport to full operations, Ross said. He added that while about 3,000 passengers were stranded Friday, after having passed through passport control, the situation has improved Saturday and that stranded passengers were provided food and water for the wait. Travelers were experiencing similar delays in Berlin. ""Our holiday plans seem to be on the verge of being frozen for now,"" said Arundhati Banerjee of the United Kingdom, who was stranded at the airport. Meanwhile in Bulgaria, the eastern part of the country has been under snow for three days, with accumulation at nearly 1 meter (40 inches) in some areas, according to CNN affiliate bTV. The main highway, airport and port in Varna, Bulgaria, were closed Friday for several hours. Four regions in Bulgaria -- Silistra, Dorbich, Varna and Burgas -- elevated the weather advisory, and the country was still expecting heavy snowfall and strong winds, bTV's website said. Many roads remain closed, and town and villages were without water or electricity. In Belgium, the weather forced truck drivers to spend a freezing night in their cabs after authorities banned trucks over seven tons from travelling on icy roads. Italy's ANSA news agency reported that two people had died because of the bad weather -- a truck driver who was killed in a car accident and a man who died of a heart attack while cleaning up snow outside his house. Hundreds of passengers were stranded in Florence, Italy, after snow and ice stopped high-speed trains from entering the city's train station, the agency said. In northeastern Greece near Macedonia, heavy snowfall mid-week caused massive problems on several highways, where snowchains were declared mandatory, according to national news Athens News Agency. Meteorologists say the cold weather is caused by a negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation, which means that cold Arctic air is flowing into southern latitudes that are normally much warmer. Forecasters don't expect conditions to change anytime soon. The next wave of snowy weather is expected to bring up to 20 centimeters (8 inches) to some parts of the U.K., with London expected to receive 5 to 10 centimeters (2 to 4 inches) of snow. The weather system will move across France and Germany on Saturday night and Sunday. Below-normal temperatures are expected to continue in northern Europe into the beginning of next week.

"(CNN) -- More than three years ago, the outgoing U.S. ambassador in Zimbabwe, Christopher W. Dell, wrote a valedictory note about the government of President Robert Mugabe. It was titled simply ""The End is Nigh."" His advice to the U.S. State Department: ""Stay the course and prepare for change"" in the southern African nation. Today, President Mugabe is still in place, though he now heads an uneasy power-sharing government with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). The cable, dated July 2007, is one of thousands obtained by WikiLeaks, some of which were published Sunday in The New York Times and four European newspapers that had advance access to the documents. Dell goes on to characterize Mugabe, who has been in power since 1980, as ""a brilliant tactician"" who is ""more clever and more ruthless than any other politician in Zimbabwe."" He also believes Mugabe is ""hampered by several factors: his ego and belief in his own infallibility."" He notes that contacts within the ruling party, the ZANU-PF, are desperately seeking reform but acknowledge that it won't happen while the ""Old Man"" is still there. Mugabe has been in power in Zimbabwe since its independence in 1980. Once one of Africa's wealthier nations, with a thriving agricultural sector, it has deteriorated into economic and social turmoil. In 2007, the same year the cable was written, Zimbabwe had the highest inflation rate in the world at 66,212 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund. Fuel and food shortages prompted Dell to say ""for the first time the president is under intensifying pressure simultaneously on the economic, political and international fronts"" and that Mugabe was ""running out of options."" He says it up to the U.S. ""once again, to take the lead, to say and do the hard things."" He admits in 2007 that Mugabe will ""not wake up one morning a changed man, resolved to set right all he has wrought. He will not go quietly nor without a fight. He will cling to power at all costs."" Dell added: ""Mugabe and his henchman are like bullies everywhere: if they can intimidate, you they will. But they're not used to someone standing up to them and fighting back."" According to the cable, Dell said the ""optimal outcome ... is a genuinely free and fair election, under international supervision."" Thabo Mbeki, former president of South Africa, had been trying to mediate in Zimbabwe and had, according to Dell, ""the best, albeit very slim, hope of getting there."" When considering possible Mugabe successors, Dell is less than impressed with the options. He calls the MDC ""far from ideal"" and is ""convinced that had we [the U.S.] had different partners, we could have achieved more already."" He goes on to lament that the current leadership would ""require massive hand-holding and assistance should they ever come to power."" Morgan Tsvangirai, prime minister and MDC head, is characterized by Dell as a ""brave, committed man"" with ""star quality."" However, Dell criticizes Tsvangarai as being ""not readily open to advice, indecisive and with questionable judgment in selecting those around him."" Perhaps most tellingly Dell says of the MDC leader: ""Zimbabwe needs him, but should not rely on his executive abilities to lead the country's recovery."" Last week, Tsvangirai took President Mugabe to court, claiming he was making unilateral decisions regarding important Cabinet and judicial appointments in violation of the power sharing arrangement.","WikiLeaks releases 2007 cable from outgoing U.S. ambassador to Zimbabwe .

"(CNN) -- Competitors and judges describe entries for their contest as wild, crazy, baffling and just plain cool. Some of the ideas are ""way impossible,"" but that's sort of the point, they say, when a bunch of bright, young and talented designers and architects imagine a moon colony in 2069. The design competition, created by the nonprofit urban planning group SHIFTboston, produced wildly creative illustrations and concepts that touch on subjects as diverse as moon-based athletic games and a lunar cemetery. As entertaining as some of the designs were, they proposed solutions to serious issues such as world hunger and shrinking energy resources. ""The most important thing was bringing together two completely different industries,"" said Kim Poliquin, SHIFTboston's founding executive director. ""Architecture is changing as our society and technology changes. This shows how architecture could become a part of the astronautics industry."" Of course humans have been imagining space colonies in drawings and models  for more than half a century, as popsci.com reminded readers last month. SHIFTboston's Moon Capital 2010 competition aimed to smash together two fields that often find themselves at odds: architecture and engineering. ""The tension between what is mostly ideal or perhaps impossible and what is logical and clearly achievable is necessary to arrive at passionate and creative solutions,"" said contest judge Madhu Thangavelu, a professor of space systems design at University of Southern California. The entries ""are mostly exercises in vision and architecture and wholly meant to inform engineers where humanity's priorities lie with respect to human space activity on the moon."" The winning entry by designer Bryna Andersen imagines a moon base surrounding a massive satellite dish that would collect solar energy and beam it back to Earth. Another concept puts a moon colony in a hole in the ground called a lava tube. How about this: a giant sports stadium that would serve as the venue for the first site-neutral international athletic games. New sporting events would be introduced that make use of the moon's low gravity, say its designers --two architecture students at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. ""We researched a lot of energy producing and capturing technologies that we could incorporate into the project,"" said Keith Bradley, 23. Bradley's collaborator, 22-year-old Brian Harms said the colony would include ""places for algae farms and other plant life to grow -- for food and to produce oxygen."" Space is a perfect place to creatively imagine the impossible, Thangavelu said. ""There is something in the American psyche that caters to the stuff of 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek' and 'Avatar,' don't you think?"" Bradley and Harms acknowledged the influence of science fiction seeping into the project. ""The illustration of the elevator core -- looking up -- I kept coming back to 'Tron' for that one,"" said Harms. ""Now the new 'Tron' movie is coming out in December and we're excited about that."" One of the contest designs prompted urban planning blogger Nick Azer to mention another Hollywood sci-fi flick. ""The visual, to me, evokes 'The Matrix's' human farms ... seeing how warm and fuzzy I am for the moon, not quite my vision :)"" Is it possible Harms or Bradley or another of the competition's designers will someday contribute to an actual design project built on the lunar surface? ""It's totally possible,"" said Poliquin. ""We just have to be willing to spend the money on it. Let's just say it's probably going to happen, we just don't know when.""","Architects, designers show their ideas for lunar colony in 2069 .

"(CNN) -- Britain's Prince William attended a remembrance service Sunday in Afghanistan's Helmand Province to honor British and Commonwealth war dead, his press office said in a statement. The prince attended the service at Camp Bastion, the main British military base in Afghanistan, along with Liam Fox, Britain's Secretary of State for Defense, according to Clarence House. ""Prince William laid a wreath to pay homage to British and Commonwealth sailors, soldiers and airmen who have fallen in battle,"" the statement said. Fox and the prince, the second in line to the British throne, also attended a parade and spent the morning meeting with troops from the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, and visited Camp Bastion's medical center. ""Remembrance Sunday is a time when the entire country stops to recognize the sacrifices made by the Armed Forces on our behalf,"" Fox said in the statement. ""I am extremely proud that Prince William and I could come to Camp Bastion to stand alongside the men and women serving in Afghanistan today. I pay tribute to them and everyone who has served before them in this conflict and others on behalf of the freedoms that the British people enjoy."" Prince William departed for the United Kingdom soon after the Remembrance Day parade, according to Clarence House. The visit was the prince's second to Afghanistan. He previously visited in April 2008. William is a search-and-rescue pilot with the Royal Air Force, where he holds the rank of flight lieutenant. He is posted to RAF Valley, the station on the island of Anglesey in north Wales.

"(CNN) -- A gunman faces six counts of attempted murder and other charges after he opened fire at an elementary school in southern California and injured two students who were outside during lunch, authorities said. The girls, ages 6 and 7, suffered minor arm injuries in the shooting Friday in Carlsbad, said Lt. Jay Eppel of the Carlsbad Police Department. Both were flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego. Police indicated the students each were grazed in the arm by bullets. Construction workers at Kelly Elementary School detained a suspected identified as Brendan L. O'Rourke, 41, shortly after noon until officers arrived, Eppel said. Police do not suspect the man has a relationship with any students at the school. Worker Carlos Partida got into his truck and was able to knock the gunman down with the vehicle, police said in a statement. The man, dressed in black, was then tackled by other construction workers and witnesses. O'Rourke appeared to be trying to reload his handgun, police said, adding that the workers managed to remove the weapon. The suspect's vehicle was parked near the school. Officers found a handgun and propane tank inside, police said. O'Rourke also had taken a small gas can to the playground, police said. The suspect was taken to a hospital after he complained of back and neck pain, and faces six counts of attempted murder and numerous weapons violations, according to the statement. Police said the suspect provided three names, one of them a woman's name, when asked for identification. The superintendent for the school district thanked good Samaritans, police and school staff members for their actions Friday. Counselors will be at the school Monday to help students, staff and families ""handle the anxiety and fear that can result from a traumatic experience,"" John A. Roach said in a statement Saturday. Third-grade student Shaylyn Foley was on the playground with her friend and told CNN affiliate KGTV what she saw. ""I saw him and he was across the street. Phoebe said, 'Who is he?' Then I'm like, 'Phoebe, he might not be a good man.' Then he put his hand out and then I heard the shot, and then I'm like, 'Phoebe, come on, this isn't OK.'"" Shaylyn and her friend ran away as the gunman fired. Students were taken to a local park to be picked up by their parents. Pete Anderson, who operates a small research vineyard near the school, said he was tending vines when ""I heard something like a gunshot, followed by another."" Three more shots followed about 30 seconds later, he said. Children were yelling as they ran from a playground back toward the school, Anderson said. ""At this point, I knew this was not a drill,"" he told CNN. Anderson said he did not see the accused shooter until after he was taken into custody. The school is in a residential neighborhood in this city between Los Angeles and San Diego. ""This is extremely unusual,"" Anderson said.

"(CNN) -- An Iranian judge has sentenced a man accused of stealing chocolate and cocoa from a candy shop to have his hand cut off, the semi-official Fars News Agency reported Saturday. ""Considering the confession of the defendant and the fact that he was found guilty of breaking and entering, according to the Quran, he deserves to have his hand cut off,"" Fars quoted the judge as saying as he ordered the sentence. The 21-year-old man, whose name was withheld by the court, was arrested in May while driving in a suspicious manner, Fars reported. During the arrest, police recovered cash as well as chocolates and cocoa. ""After the man was taken to a police station, a report of a robber at a candy store was received by police,"" Fars said. Police told Fars that the man later confessed to robbing the store. In addition to the amputation sentence, the man was ordered to spend six months in prison for destruction of property and an additional six months for resisting arrest, according to Fars. Such an amputation sentence is often handed down to habitual thieves in Iran who have prior convictions for theft and robbery. CNN's Shirzad Bozorghmehr contributed to this report.","The man was arrested in May and was found with cash, chocolates and cocoa .

"(CNN) -- An Ohio judge on Tuesday set a $1 million bond for the man accused of kidnapping and keeping a 13-year-old girl bound and gagged in his basement, authorities say. Matthew Hoffman, 30, is suspected of having abducted Sarah Maynard, who authorities discovered over the weekend. She disappeared on Wednesday along with her mother, brother and family friend. Sarah Maynard's mother, Tina Herrmann, 32, remains missing, along with 10-year-old Kody Maynard and Herrmann's friend, 41-year-old Stephanie Sprang. Hoffman appeared in the Mount Vernon Municipal Court on Tuesday via a video link with the local jail, according to Pam Fuller, a deputy clerk. He is represented by a public defender. Hoffman sat in a corner and looked straight ahead during much of the proceeding. He wore what looked to be a green vest, which the local sheriff later described as a suicide gown. Knox County Sheriff David Barber said Hoffman was put in the gown after he gave indications to the jail staff and to investigators he could try to harm himself. Previously, Barber has said he believes Hoffman could ""absolutely"" lead police to the three missing people. He is not cooperating with the investigation, officials said. ""The likelihood is, of course, that they are not alive,"" Barber said about Herrmann, her son and Sprang. But he added he hopes they are, and that the department's priority remains trying to find them. Sarah Maynard was released from the hospital Monday. Barber described the girl as doing well under the circumstances. ""There's so many people behind her that definitely that's going to help with her emotional recovery. And she is receiving those kind of services as well,"" he said. The sheriff asked members of the public to think back to last week, to what they may have seen, and to call a tip line with any information. ""Wherever the investigation leads us, that's where we're going,"" he said. The next hearing in Hoffman's case is scheduled for November 23. Authorities have said they expect additional charges.","Matthew Hoffman, 30, is accused of abducting 13-year-old Sarah Maynard .

"(CNN) -- DNA has linked the slayings of three women, Philadelphia police said Tuesday night in announcing they are looking for a serial killer. Authorities are offering a $30,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those involved in recent homicides and assaults on women. ""We now know that this predator is responsible for three murders in this area,"" task force Capt. James Clark said at a news conference. The reward offer comes as police and federal agents petition neighborhood residents for information in their joint investigation of the three killings and three other attacks on women in the Kensington area of Philadelphia. The partially clothed body of the latest victim, Casey Mahoney, 27, was discovered December 15, according to police spokeswoman Jillian Russell. Mahoney had been sexually assaulted and strangled. Police say Elaine Goldberg, 21, and Nicole Piacentini, 35, were killed in strangulation attacks in November. Analysis showed the three were killed by the same assailant, Clark said. Previously, DNA from the scene of the two earlier homicides was found to be from a single person, police spokesman Ray Evers said. Authorities believe the attacker likely is still in the 10-block radius where the attacks occurred. ""We have detectives working day and night, following every tip,"" Clark said. ""It's time to bring this offender to justice,"" said Police Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey. ""Help us stop this brutal violence from occurring in the future."" The location, the similar nature of the attacks and the descriptions of the attacker led police to suspect they are connected. The victims all were choked, police said. But authorities say they lack corroborating DNA evidence linking the assaults to the homicides because too much time had elapsed between the initial two assaults in October and when the victims notified police. ""The assault victims did not come forward until police began combing the Kensington (neighborhood) for suspects and potential victims following the November homicides,"" Evers said. Federal agents joined the investigation earlier this month, bringing in resources from the FBI's behavioral analysis unit, violent criminal apprehension program, and National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime. ""The investigation appears to be limited to Philadelphia,"" said FBI spokesman J.J. Klaver. ""This could change if there are any indications that the subject or subjects responsible for the crimes ... are linked to similar crimes elsewhere."" The assault victims described the attacker as an African-American male in his early 20s, weighing between 160 and 170 pounds. Police said a third assault victim was pulled into an alley earlier this month. Despite being choked, punched and hit on the head with a brick, the 33-year-old woman escaped, and her assailant fled the scene, according to a police report. All victims were white females involved in prostitution and narcotics, police said.","NEW: DNA links three killings, police say .

"New York (CNN) -- By the time he turned 16, Sam Rawls had already seen lifetimes worth of trouble. He was heavily into drug use, sometimes had a violent temper and committed burglary and eventually spent three months in a court-ordered detention and rehabilitation facility in Waco, Texas, said Denise Martin, Rawls' mother. Rawls was released and returned home to San Antonio in November 1987, spending the next several months trying to get his act together, Martin said. With his difficult past, that was very complicated. ""He was very confused and troubled and sad, and he was just a mess and just wanted to get better,'' Martin said. On February 27, 1988, a Saturday, Rawls mowed the lawn and told his mother he was heading out to see some friends that night. According to reports, he took his bicycle. By morning, he was still not home. In the past, Rawls had fallen out of sight for a few days, but always called his mother and took some possessions with him, Martin said. Not this time. He has not been heard from in more than 22 years. Detectives revisit the case file at least once a year, according to Sgt. Chris Benavides, a spokesman for the San Antonio Police Department. The last lead came in 2006 and was ''not actionable,'' Benavides said. ""We are pretty much at a standstill.'' Although some reports say he may have been last seen accompanying a girl home from a friend's house, police said they have no record of this in their files. One part of the mystery that remains hard to explain: Rawls' bike was found at home. Rawls and his friends seemed to have a teenage fascination with Satanism, Martin said. Whether he ran away or met foul play may never be revealed. ""He would never hurt someone who cared about him this much,'' Martin said. ""He would never cause them this much pain. I mean, it's every single day,'' she said, adding that her son could find a way to contact her if he were able. Despite his problems, Rawls was also involved in society before he disappeared from it. He enjoyed acting and was very good at it, Martin said. He also drew a lot of sketches and wanted to be an artist, she said. He had friends, many of them girls, she said. At the time of his disappearance, Rawls was 6 feet, 2 inches and 150 pounds, with dark blond hair and blue eyes. His left collarbone protruded after he broke it sleepwalking, according to Martin. He was last seen wearing a black and white pullover jacket, Levis 501 jeans and white sports shoes. He had a silver ring with a turquoise stone in the shape of a marijuana leaf in the center and, from his mother, a watch with a moon design on the face and tan cowhide band.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Thursday announced a new initiative led by the top executives of major U.S. corporations that seeks to improve education in science, technology, engineering and math. The nonprofit initiative, called Change the Equation, involves 100 chief executive officers and has $5 million in funding for its first year of operation, according to information provided by the White House. ""These are actually the kinds of things that 10 years from now, 20 years from now, we're going to look back and say it really made a difference,"" Obama said. The initiative was founded by former astronaut Sally Ride, former Intel Chairman Craig Barrett, Xerox CEO Ursula Burns, Time Warner Cable CEO Glenn Britt, and Eastman Kodak CEO Antonio Perez, with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation of New York, according to the White House statement. Ride told CNN on Thursday that American students need new inspiration to learn the so-called STEM subjects -- science, technology, engineering and math -- to compete in the global workforce and help restore the United States as a leader in innovative research and development. ""For the last 20 to 25 years, our society really hasn't put a focus on the importance of math and science education. We're starting to pay the price,"" Ride said, noting that the United States has slipped in global rankings of math and science literacy among students. The goals of Change the Equation are to improve teaching in STEM subjects, inspire student learning in those subjects and achieve a national commitment to improve education in them, according to the White House. Obama said achieving them is vital for the nation's future economic success and vitality. ""The cost of inaction is immeasurable,"" Obama said, citing the lost participation of children who never get encouraged or exposed to education in STEM subjects. Some programs under the initiative would expand summer science camps for girls, allow more students to take part in robotics competitions, increase teacher training, and help students take advanced placement courses in math and science, the White House statement said. Obama also announced new public-private partnerships promoting better STEM education, including a robotics competition for students. Ride said business leaders were motivated to create the new initiative because ""they realize their future depends on it,"" noting that ""80 percent of jobs of the next decade are going to require some background, some basic skills in math and science."" ""We do need inspiration for the kids growing up today,"" Ride said. ""The space program did it for my generation. Maybe it will do it for the next generation."" Another goal is to ""humanize"" the subjects of science, math and engineering, Ride said, so that kids ""don't think all scientists are old dead guys.""","The Change the Equation initiative involves 100 CEOs .

"(CNN) -- Amid a high alert over an alleged al Qaeda plot to attack cities in Europe, France has warned its citizens about travel to the United Kingdom, saying British authorities believe a terror attack is ""highly likely."" The move follows a United States warning that Americans be careful about traveling in Europe because of the risk of terror attacks. Neither the UK nor France raised threat levels in response to the American warning, but each has now warned its citizens about travel elsewhere on the continent. Europe remains on edge after the warnings, based at least partly on intelligence about a plot obtained from a German-Afghan in U.S. custody in Afghanistan. Police in France seized 12 people for suspected terrorist ties Tuesday, but it is not clear whether they are connected to the plot that prompted the warning. Those arrests came a day after a suspected drone strike in Pakistan left five German nationals dead, adding to the unease. French national police said the 12 suspects were seized in the south of France. Three have links to a French man -- identified as Riahd Hennouni -- arrested in Italy last month, authorities said. Two of them were arrested in Marseilles and the third was arrested in Bordeaux. The nine other arrests happened throughout southern France, including some in Marseilles and at least one in Avignon, police said. Police in Marseille said the nine have links to an Islamist movement and are suspected of trying to obtain arms and explosives. It is unclear whether the 12 are French citizens. None of them has been charged. Under French law, police can detain and question suspects for up to six days without filing charges. Meanwhile, Italian police said Sunday they detained a French citizen of Algerian origin who is suspected of being a member of al Qaeda. The man was arrested last month by Italian police in Naples, Italy, on a European arrest warrant requested by France, the chief prosecutor in Naples told CNN Monday. The arrest was not announced at the time. Didier Allard of France's Palais de Justice appeals court identified the man as Hennouni and said an anti-terror judge in Paris had requested his arrest and asked that he be extradited from Italy. Elsewhere, Pakistani intelligence confirmed that five German nationals were killed in a suspected U.S. drone strike Monday in the northwestern part of the country. The Germans were among 11 suspected militants killed Monday in the Mir Ali area of North Waziristan, one of the seven districts of Pakistan's tribal region -- a remote and rugged area where militants hold sway. Three others were foreigners whose nationalities were not disclosed, said the officials, who did not want to be named. The other three were Pakistanis. The bodies were removed by the Taliban, one of the officials said. The militants killed are believed to have been members of the group Jihad al Islami, the officials said. The news of the arrests in France and the Germans' deaths in Pakistan come amid warnings from the United States, Britain, Sweden and Japan advising their citizens traveling abroad about potential terrorist attacks in Europe. It is not known if Tuesday's arrests and Monday's drone strike, however, are related to the latest alerts. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the FBI issued a joint bulletin Sunday warning of the potential attacks. The reported plot prompted the U.S. State Department to issue a Europe-wide security advisory for Americans traveling abroad. The alert did not cite specific countries because the information about the threat was not specific enough to do so, a State Department spokesman said Monday. Jihadists from the German city of Hamburg are alleged to be at the heart of the suspected plots, European intelligence officials said. Western intelligence officials say they learned about the potential attacks after Ahmed Sidiqi, a German citizen of Afghan descent, was arrested in Afghanistan in July and taken to the U.S. air base at Bagram for questioning. He has not been charged, and intelligence sources in Germany said he was cooperating with the investigation. According to German intelligence officials, Sidiqi and 10 others left Hamburg in 2009 for the tribal areas of Pakistan -- where most of the group joined a jihadist group fighting U.S. and coalition forces across the border in Afghanistan. Sidiqi told American interrogators that at least one member of his travel group was to be a ""foot soldier"" in the plot, with other members of the group helping to plan the attacks, a European counterterrorism official told CNN. Sidiqi's father, Mohammed Naim Sidiqi, said his son was on his way to the German embassy in the Afghan capital to get a new passport when he was detained. Sidiqi's father says he does not believe the allegations that his son is at the heart of an al Qaeda conspiracy. ""My son is not a killer, he's just not capable of that,"" he told CNN, stressing that such acts are absolutely forbidden in Islam. Sidiqi's sister says she, too, is shocked by the reports. According to Sidiqi's sister, her brother left Hamburg last year to start a new life in Afghanistan with his wife, an Indonesian citizen. She says that financial problems in Hamburg, including difficulty paying his rent, contributed to his decision to leave. ""He had some debts and he was determined to earn money in Afghanistan to repay them,"" his father told CNN. According to German intelligence agencies, Sidiqi had a job cleaning aircraft at Hamburg International Airport before leaving for Pakistan. Sidiqi's father said he also did some work in Germany related to computers. Before setting off, Sidiqi told his family he was going to meet some friends in Pakistan and then go across from there to Afghanistan, according to his sister. In later phone calls he would not reveal his location, according to his father. Sidiqi's sister confirmed he had attended the Taiba mosque in Hamburg, where several of the 9/11 conspirators met.

"New York (CNN) -- A former aide to Bernard Madoff has surrendered to authorities in Florida and will soon appear in New York to face charges related to Madoff's massive Ponzi scheme. Annette Bongiorno, 62, turned herself in to the U.S. Marshals Service in Florida on Tuesday after her bail was rejected by a district judge in New York, according to U.S. Marshals Deputy Wayne Pickering. She had been previously approved for bail, but that right was later revoked by Judge Laura Taylor Swain over concerns of flight risk, given that Bongiorno has access to millions of dollars, according to court documents. Bongiorno had been booked at the Palm Beach County jail, but was later transferred into the custody of the marshals, said Palm Beach police spokesman Eric Davis. Bongiorno's attorney Roland Riopelle said his client ""was disappointed but stoic."" He would not comment further on the case. She is said to have managed investment accounts for some of Madoff's largest and most important customers, including Carl Shapiro, Stanley Chais and Jeffry Picower, said Madoff's secretary Eleanor Squillari. ""(Bongiorno) was running the accounts for the favored clients,"" Squillari said. ""She really was the head of her department in the investment advisory part of the business."" The government previously filed civil complaints against Bongiorno and Joann Crupi, both longtime Madoff employees who worked as supervisors of his ""back office"" staff. The suits are intended to retrieve millions of dollars in assets -- including homes and luxury cars -- that the two allegedly received while involved in Madoff's scheme. Earlier this month, Madoff's son Mark Madoff committed suicide in his Manhattan apartment two years to the day after his father was arrested for swindling $50 billion from investors in the largest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history. Madoff pleaded guilty in 2009 and was sentenced to 150 years in prison.

"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- South African leader Jacob Zuma was in neighboring Zimbabwe this week to rescue the seemingly crumbling power-sharing government of President Robert Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai. The South African president's visit Friday to the capital, Harare, follows escalating tensions between the two leaders, with Tsvangirai this week taking Mugabe to court for making unilateral decisions in the 21-month-old government. After a more than six-hour meeting with Mugabe and Tsvangirai, who have not been on speaking terms for close to a month, Zuma said he had managed to break the impasse between the two. ""We have met and we have had successful consultations on a number of issues,"" Zuma told journalists. ""They were small issues. There had been a breakdown of communication with the leaders of the government which have been resolved, and meetings will resume."" Zuma joked and smiled with journalists, but that was not the case with Mugabe and Tsvangirai, who remained tense throughout the short press briefing. They refused to talk to journalists as they separately left the meetings. ""No comment. No comment. Talk to the mediator, President Zuma,"" Tsvangirai told journalists about how his meeting with Zuma and Mugabe went. Mugabe just waved to reporters before he jumped into his car. Zuma -- who was appointed by regional leaders to monitor Zimbabwe's fragile coalition government and mediate -- said he would brief his counterparts in the 15-member Southern African Development Community (SADC) about the tension in Zimbabwe. The friction between Zimbabwe's leaders worsened this week when Tsvangirai went to court to reverse unilateral appointments Mugabe made of senior government officials such as attorney general and several diplomats. Mugabe was ordered in August to reverse all unilateral decisions he has made, but that has failed to happen, leading Tsvangirai to abandon recent cabinet meetings.","President Robert Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai are at odds .

"(CNN) -- Los Angeles Galaxy captain Landon Donovan has decided against making another loan move to a European club during American soccer's offseason. The United States international spent three months with English Premier League outfit Everton at the start of 2010, but will not repeat the stint when the international transfer window reopens on January 1. ""I feel that it is important to continue to rest and recover this offseason as opposed to going on loan,"" he told the Major League Soccer website, adding that he had not considered going to any club other than Everton. ""I have been playing nearly non-stop for the past two years and I believe that this decision will allow me to perform at my best for the Galaxy and the national team throughout the upcoming year."" The 29-year-old scored two goals in 10 games for Everton last season, and also made six appearances during a similar loan spell with German side Bayern Munich in 2009. ""We expect Landon to join our club for the start of preseason training next month as we begin to prepare for the 2011 MLS season,"" Galaxy head coach Bruce Arena said. Donovan has been named US Soccer's Male Athlete of the Year for the fourth time in his career.

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Party primaries for Nigeria's presidential election will begin November 26, the Independent National Electoral Commission announced Tuesday. The primaries, which will continue through January 15, were originally scheduled for October, but were postponed by the commission. The presidential election, originally to be held in January, will be April 9. President Goodluck Jonathan, who became president after the death of Umaru Yar'Adua earlier this year, is running for election to the office. He will be challenged in the primaries by another former vice president of Nigeria. Atiku Abubakar emerged Monday as the consensus candidate put forward by a bloc of leaders from Nigeria's influential Northern Political Leaders Forum, which announced in September that it would name someone to take on Jonathan in the presidential primaries for the People's Democratic Party. Abubakar served as vice president under Olusegun Obasanjo from 1999 to 2007. Under Nigerian ""zoning"" rules, power must shift to between regions and ethnic groups every eight years. Jonathan -- who is from the Niger Delta, in the south -- was part of the joint ticket with Yar'Adua, who was from the north. He was elected in 2007. Because Jonathan took office after Yar'Adua's death in May, the northern leaders say the presidency should rotate back to the north. Jonathan disputes that. Voter registration for the presidential election will be January 15-29. CNN's Christian Purefoy contributed to this report.","Primaries will be held from November 26 through January 15 .

"Chicago (CNN) -- Two Chicago firefighters were killed Wednesday and at least 17 were injured, when a wall and roof collapsed without warning in an abandoned building on the city's south side, the city's fire department said. None of the injuries was life-threatening, said Fire Commissioner Robert Hoff in an afternoon news conference. One firefighter was in stable condition, he said. Hoff identified those killed as Corey Ankum, who had been with the department less than two years, and 12-year veteran Edward Stringer. Both were inside the structure. Other firefighters were working the blaze from the roof. CNN affiliate WGN aired footage of a line of firefighters saluting one body as it arrived at the medical examiner's office later Wednesday. Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said in a statement, ""The deaths of Firefighters Stringer and Ankum are both a sad reminder of how much gratitude we owe our first responders and a tragedy for all Chicagoans."" The deaths came on the 100th anniversary of the Chicago Stockyards fire, which killed 21 firefighters and the city fire marshal. The fire was reported shortly before 7 a.m. in the office area of a commercial building on East 75th Street, said Larry Langford, spokesman for the Chicago Fire Department. The routine fire call became a multiple-alarm blaze after part of the roof collapsed as firefighters were inside, he said. Four firefighters were trapped after the collapse occurred, and two of them died from their injuries, Langford said. The building was boarded up in the front but the back was open, leading firefighters to think that homeless people may have sought shelter there, Hoff said. The cause of the fire is under investigation, Hoff said. Investigators will look at whether ice or weather was a factor, as well as the age of the building and its heavy roof, the commissioner said. ""There are things that happen when buildings are aged, and that could have been one of the contributing factors in this case,"" Hoff said. The fire in the building's northeast corner had been brought under control, Hoff said, and firefighters were working on hot spots and ""looking for homeless or vagrant people"" when the collapse occurred. A wall of the building collapsed into an alley, Langford said, bringing part of the roof down with it. A search of the rubble found no one else, Langford said. Heavy equipment was being brought in to take the building apart. He said it was his understanding that both of the fallen firefighters had children. While the loss of a firefighter is always a tragedy, he said, ""it's been compounded"" by the deaths occurring so close to the holidays. Another firefighter died recently while battling a downtown blaze, he said. CNN's Sara Pratley contributed to this report.","NEW: Mayor calls deaths a tragedy .

"(CNN) --  A Saudi group advocating for democratic reform in Saudi Arabia has announced the cancellation of a planned public sit-in after having been denied a permit for the event by the kingdom's Ministry of Interior. In an e-mailed statement, the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA) said that the organizers of the sit-in were summoned on Tuesday to the Interior Ministry. They ""were informed that the sit-in request was refused without providing further legal justification preventing peaceful assemblies and protests."" CNN could not reach Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry for comment.  Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy where protests and gatherings are prohibited. In a statement dated November 13, ACPRA called on ""all Saudis to participate in a public sit-in to demand political reform"" on Thursday in the country's capital city of Riyadh. The purpose of the sit-in was to demand a list of 20 rights, among them ""ending princes' privileges,"" ""eradicating bribery and nepotism,"" ""fairness and impartiality of the judiciary,"" ""preventing arbitrary detention, torture, and harassment in prisons,"" and ""transparency, accountability, and control over the national income and how it be spent."" In a separate letter addressed to the kingdom's interior minister, Prince Naif bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, the group asked the minister to ""provide us the opportunity to peacefully express our demand for political reform, on the basis of the requirements of the allegiance: the stewardship of the nation over the ruler.  Because it is the only way to ensure the means to, and the guarantees of, justice and democracy."" The letter detailed how, if permission were granted to stage the sit-in, the attendees would ""express their feelings peacefully in a very civilized and polite manner."" Mohammed Al-Qahtani, president of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association, told CNN this was the third time his group had applied for and been denied a permit by the kingdom's Interior Ministry to hold a peaceful assembly within the kingdom. He believes this is in direct violation of Saudi Arabia's membership on the United Nations' Human Rights Council. ""They talk the talk but they don't walk the walk as far as allowing people to express themselves peacefully,"" said Al-Qahtani when describing the kingdom's stance towards groups asking for political reform. Al-Qahtani said he's not surprised permission for the sit-in was denied and that he and members of his group had been expecting this outcome. Al-Qahtani said that even though ACPRA was denied a permit for the planned sit-in, he does see positive signs in all this. ""Given the fact that we have been reiterating the same demands before and that we're still free to meet and discuss all this, it's a good indication of how times have changed for the better,"" said Al-Qahtani. He attributed a lot of the newfound tolerance in Saudi Arabia to its ruler, King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, who is seen by many as a reformer and who has been promoting national and societal dialogue within the kingdom since ascending the throne in 2005. ""If you think about the atmosphere in the country 10 years ago,"" explained Al-Qahtani, ""nobody could have put these demands on the table then -- so now, it seems Saudi Arabia has opened up a bit.""","The Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association wanted to stage a public sit-in .

"(CNN) -- At least 27 fishermen were missing after a Vietnam-registered vessel sank in the South China Sea, China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported on Thursday, citing maritime rescue authorities. Strong gales caused the Phu Tan to capsize and sink and the fishermen fell overboard, the report said. The accident occurred about 110 nautical miles to the west of Sanya City in the southern island province of Hainan, a South China Sea Salvage Bureau spokesman said. A rescue vessel was headed to the site of the sinking, and a towboat was ordered to assist.","The vessel was registered in Vietnam .

"(CNN) -- An unofficial watch group is forming in a central Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, neighborhood, residents say, in an effort to protect themselves against a serial strangler responsible for at least three homicides. The 12-member unit has been patrolling the city's rough-and-tumble Kensington district since Friday, two days after the partially clothed body of the latest victim, Casey Mahoney, was discovered. ""We are warning residents to go out in pairs,"" said group organizer Tom Potts. ""I've been talking to women in the area. Most are carrying pepper spray."" One of women has been walking with an electric stun gun, he added. Police are also trying to determine whether three strangulation assaults that occurred in the same area are also linked to the suspected killer. The victims were all white females, police said. Potts said the neighborhood group walks up and down Kensington Avenue and nearby streets each night in the drugs- and prostitution-riddled neighborhood. Their actions come as police ask residents for information of those involved in the attacks, but also warn the public against taking matters into their own hands. ""We are cautioning people to wait and get the person identified,"" said police spokesman Ray Evers. ""We need the public to be our eyes,"" he said, warning against the potential dangers of vigilante action. Some residents are pairing up when walking at night. ""I've never felt safe alone,"" said Arianna Hall-Reinhard. The 22-year-old Kensington resident says she carries pepper spray and joins friends when she heads home from work. ""It's a whole new level of having to be aware,"" she said. Others have taken to social media, joining a Facebook page called ""Catch the Kensington Strangler, before he catches someone you love."" The page featured an incorrect sketch of the suspected killer, prompting police to contact the site, Evers said. Elaine Goldberg, 21, and Nicole Piacentini, 35, were both killed in November attacks. Mahoney had been sexually assaulted and strangled on December 15, said police spokeswoman Jillian Russell. DNA has linked the slayings of three women, and authorities are offering a $30,000 reward for information leading to arrests and convictions, said task force Capt. James Clark. ""We now know that this predator is responsible for three murders in this area,"" he said. Authorities say they believe the attacker likely is still in the 10-block radius where the attacks occurred. ""It's time to bring this offender to justice,"" Police Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey told reporters. ""Help us stop this brutal violence from occurring in the future."" But authorities say they lack corroborating DNA evidence linking the assaults to the homicides because too much time had elapsed between the initial two assaults in October and when the victims notified police. ""The assault victims did not come forward until police began combing the Kensington (neighborhood) for suspects and potential victims following the November homicides,"" Evers said. Federal agents joined the investigation earlier this month, bringing in resources from the FBI's behavioral analysis unit, violent criminal apprehension program, and National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime. ""The investigation appears to be limited to Philadelphia,"" said FBI spokesman J.J. Klaver. ""This could change if there are any indications that the subject or subjects responsible for the crimes ... are linked to similar crimes elsewhere."" The assault victims described the attacker as an African-American male in his early 20s, weighing between 160 and 170 pounds. Police said a third assault victim was pulled into an alley earlier this month. Despite being choked, punched and hit on the head with a brick, the 33-year-old woman escaped, and her assailant fled the scene, according to a police report. All victims were involved in prostitution and narcotics, police said.","A resident watch group is forming to protect a neighborhood from a serial killer .

"Washington (CNN) -- Before Wednesday's Delaware Senate debate, the bulk of what people knew about Republican candidate Christine O'Donnell came from clips from a talk show from the 1990s. In the month since O'Donnell rocked the political world with her upset win over Rep. Mike Castle in the Republican primary, she's dominated headlines despite avoiding the national media. Wednesday's debate, co-moderated by CNN's Wolf Blitzer and longtime Delaware news anchor Nancy Karibjanian, could prove to be make or break for O'Donnell's Senate bid. She and Democrat Chris Coons are vying to fill the seat held for nearly four decades by now-Vice President Joe Biden . The debate gave O'Donnell an opportunity to reintroduce herself to voters, define her views and chip away at the 19-point deficit she must overcome to defeat Coons. It also provided a chance to do the opposite. O'Donnell and Coons focused largely on the economy and national issues during their 90-minute exchange. Updates from Delaware . O'Donnell threw rocks at Coons throughout the debate, while he tried to paint her answers as frivolous and unintelligible. ""Coons can can barely contain his disdain for his opponent,"" noted Gloria Borger, a senior political analyst for CNN. The debate produced a few humorous moments, such as when Coons said O'Donnell's well-publicized statements that she dabbled in witchcraft and questioned evolution theory were distractions instead of a substantive campaign issue. ""You're just jealous that you weren't on Saturday Night Live,"" O'Donnell said, referring to the comedy show's satirical skit about her. ""I'm dying to see who's going to play me,"" Coons responded with a smile. The debate was tense and O'Donnell was feisty -- until a flub near the end. O'Donnell was tripped up by the same question that caused problems for then-VP candidate Sarah Palin in her interview with Katie Couric about Supreme Court decisions. Asked if she could name a recent Supreme Court case she disagreed with, O'Donnell said, ""can you give me a specific one?"" O'Donnell was unable to provide a case, but said decisions she disagreed with would be posted on her website. While the forum was one of the most anticipated events of the campaign season, not everyone was as captivated. ""Even if I lived in [Delaware,] I wouldn't watch. I already know about this woman to question everything she has done. Her ethics and character leave a lot to be desired,"" commented CNN reader Marie MD. Commenter Laverne planned to tune in for the entertainment. ""Anybody in their right mind will be able to tell right away if she is truly knowledgeable of the topics,"" the reader said. Delaware voters had varying impressions of the debate. Bob Ashby said O'Donnell did a good job showing who she really is. ""I think that Christine O'Donnell needed to show that she's a human being, a real person and that she's impassioned, that all this other sort of conversation that's been going on about her is not really accurate. And I think that's what she attempted to do, and I think she did very well with that,"" he said. But voter Lisa Lucas was hardly impressed. ""I find it abundantly disconcerting that we have this much in common with Wasilla,"" she said. ""Even if you have some concerns about Chris Coons' history or his politics or whatever, yet again, we have a polarized election where it's a black and white thing, because she is so far off the grid."" Another voter, identified by her first name only, said that after watching the debate, she decided she wasn't voting for either candidate. ""I just feel that Christine O'Donnell doesn't really answer any questions. She goes very circular on things. And I just feel like Chris Coons has been kind of condescending. And it's just I don't get a good feeling from either candidate,"" Meghan told CNN. Immediate reaction from the blogosphere was also mixed. The Conservative Journal said the debate ""didn't have a clear cut winner as far as who answered better,"" but it predicted O'Donnell would benefit most. The blog gave credit to both candidates for substantive answers, but was turned off by Coons' ""snide retorts."" The left-leaning blog Talking Points Memo said that while O'Donnell may have mastered her talking points, she ""had a tough time this evening with some basic questions about issues she'd face if she is elected to the Senate."" How do you think she did? Did O'Donnell win or lose votes based on her performance?","O'Donnell, Coons face off in first debate .

She came across as aggressive but stumbled on a question about Supreme Court cases .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea will conduct naval fire drills near a flashpoint with the North that resulted in the deaths of four people, military officials said Thursday. The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff announced the exercises will take place in the seas southwest of Yeonpyeong Island on a day to be announced between December 18 and 21. The South previously announced military exercises for this week, but Thursday's announcement adds to them. Tensions mounted between the Koreas on November 23, when North Korea shelled the island, which lies in South Korean territory. The attacked killed two marines and two civilians and injured 18 people. Last month's attack was the first direct artillery assault on South Korea since 1953, when an armistice ended fighting. The North has accused the South of provoking the attack because shells from a South Korean military drill landed in the North's waters. North Korea Thursday accused the South's new defense minister, Kim Kwan-jin, of ""going reckless like a puppy knowing no fear of a tiger,"" state-run KCNA reported. During his confirmation hearing this month, Kim said South Korea would respond with airstrikes if the North attacks it again. The South Korean joint chiefs said the drills will be carried out in the presence of officials from the Military Armistice Committee and representatives from U.N. party members to ensure that the exercise is lawful and follows rules of the armistice.","New drills add to military exercises around the Korean peninsula .

"(CNN) -- At least 28 people were killed Wednesday after a boat carrying asylum seekers crashed into cliffs along the shore near the coast of Christmas Island, Australia's minister for immigration and citizenship said. Rescuers were able to pull 43 people from the ""dangerous"" waters and one person was able to swim to shore. ""It's a very difficult situation for everybody involved and of course, particularly, for those on Christmas Island: for the asylum seekers and for those involved in the rescue,"" Minister Chris Bowen said in an Australian radio interview. ""Those involved in the rescue -- both the naval officials, the customs officials and the locals -- did an outstanding job in saving so many people yesterday."" Bowen noted -- as Australia's border protection agency did earlier -- that weather in the area is treacherous. ""The rescue is being conducted in extremely difficult and dangerous conditions,"" the Australia's border protection agency said in a statement. '""We will continue the search until last light and review the situation and determine what further actions might need to be taken before first light tomorrow."" Bowen said 11 of the survivors were ""clearly children or say they're under 18. Of the deceased, we don't know yet."" Bowen also said it was unclear how many people were on the boat. ""People who have survived say that there were between 70 and 100, but we really don't know and we probably never will,"" he said. Most of the people on the boat were from Iran and Iraq, a rescue worker told Sydney radio station 2GB. ""Eyewitnesses told us that they saw babies being held in people's arms and then when the boat was hit by the wave and crashed up against the rocks, they could no longer see those young babies,"" said Jessica Campanaro, a reporter with the Australian radio station. ""There is an ongoing situation which involves a rescue of people off Christmas Island,"" a statement from Australian Customs and Border Protection said. ""Our paramount priority is the safety of all involved."" The group will be transferred to Christmas Island where they will undergo security, identity and health checks and their reasons for travel will be established, according to the Customs and Border Protection statement. The tragedy has spurred discussions of Australia's immigration policies, but Minister Bowen said there would time enough for those discussions later. ""It's appropriate that there be a political discussion about this, and people will have strong views,"" he said. ""My focus, together with [Minister for Home Affairs] Brendan O'Connor and the prime minister [Julia Gillard] is on the situation we have at Christmas Island. There'll be inquiries and investigations, but I think what we can best do today is lend our support to the valiant rescue efforts of our naval and customs personnel, and also the locals on Christmas Island who responded magnificently."" Christmas Island is an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean, nearer to the Philippines than to Australia. The island is about 1,600 miles northwest of the western Australian city of Perth and 220 miles south of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Five suspects were arrested on terror-related charges, including one of Indonesia's most wanted men, Abu Tholut, Indonesian police said Tuesday. Tholut and the others were arrested in Central Java on December 10, authorities said at a news conference Tuesday. Tholut helped create a militant training camp in Aceh that was raided by authorities in February, said Inspector General Iskandar Hasan, a National Police spokesman. The group was allegedly training and planning attacks in Indonesia that were similar to the 2008 Mumbai, India terror attacks, in which 164 people were killed. Tholut is a weapons expert and is a former senior leader of the terror network Jemaah Islamiyah, police said. Tholut could also be connected to detained radical cleric Abu Bakar Bashir and his organization Jama'ah Ansharut Tauhid or JAT. Bashir has been in police detention since August and Monday police sent charges to state prosecutors accusing him of multiple terror charges including inciting others to commit crimes of terror. The charges carry the maximum penalty of death. Bashir has denied these allegations. Tholut served four years in jail on terrorism charges from 2003 to 2007. He got off for good behavior but police say he rejoined Indonesia's terror network after his release. It was clear Tholut, as were other top suspects either caught or arrested in recent months, were reporting to Bashir, authorities said.","Police say the suspects were training at a militant camp in Aceh .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The prime minister of the Hamas government in Gaza denied Wednesday Israeli claims of an al Qaeda presence in the coastal strip, claiming there is no such thing. Speaking to reporters, Ismail Haniya said there was an active Palestinian resistance in Gaza but that it ""does not work outside of the borders of Palestine."" He said recent Israeli accusations that al Qaeda had secured a foothold in the Palestinian territory were ""an illusion"" and were being used a pretext for future Israeli military action in Gaza and to incite American and international public opinion against Palestinians. The remarks were made in reference to Israel's targeted killings last month of two Palestinians in Gaza. The Israeli military claimed the victims were senior operatives of an al Qaeda inspired radical group known as the Army of Islam and were planning attacks against Israeli and American targets in the Sinai Peninsula. Haniya said he had written a letter to Egypt's intelligence chief Omar Suleiman, assuring him that no Palestinian resistance groups were operating in the Sinai Peninsula. Asked about Hamas' relationship with Salafist organizations in Gaza, Haniya stressed the ""moderate"" nature of the Palestinian people and said the government was ""not seeking a clash with any party."" Salafists are a Muslim splinter group. Haniya acknowledged that Hamas had some differences with Salafist organizations in the past but claimed there had been ""no significant incidents"" since a violent showdown with a radical group in August of last year which left 21 dead and scores injured. Haniya argued Israel's targeted killings were part of a coordinated Israeli government media campaign to portray Palestinians as the aggressor. ""We are the ones being strangled in the siege, and now Gaza is being marketed as the ones who have the bombs, missiles and anti-aircraft missiles"" Haniya said .

"Haifa, Israel (CNN) -- Israeli police said Friday that they suspect arson in the wildfire that has killed at least 41 people and injured 17 in northern Israel over the past two days. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld cited ""suspicious objects"" found Thursday. He did not elaborate. Officials called the wildfire, which had scorched more than 7,400 acres and continued to burn, the worst in the nation's history. A police investigative team and a fire expert team have been working to determine the cause of the fire, which started from a single location, said Dudi Cohen, Israeli police commissioner. Forty of the fatalities were cadets in Israel's prison service who were en route Thursday to help evacuate 500 inmates from Damon prison near Haifa when their bus became engulfed in the fast-moving blaze, the Jerusalem Post reported. ""The bus had no chance; they tried to escape but were burned alive,"" a firefighter spokesman told the newspaper. ""It was a horrific scene."" Eight funerals were held Friday and several bodies were still being identified, the Jerusalem Post reported. Israeli firefighter spokesman Yoram Levy said shifting 29 kph (18 mph) winds made the inferno harder to control as flames neared a neighborhood in Haifa, a major tourist destination on the northern coast. Built on the slopes of Mount Carmel about 50 miles north of Tel Aviv, Haifa's metropolitan area is also host to historical sites that date to Biblical times. More than 15,000 people have been evacuated from villages and towns in the area, emergency officials said. The fire has also threatened a sensitive ecological area near the Hai Bar nature reserve. Known as Mount Carmel's ""Little Switzerland,"" the reserve is home to a wildlife preservation project that seeks to bring back native species mentioned in the Old Testament. The fire, which began Thursday morning on Mount Carmel and spread through nearby areas, has triggered an outcry in Israel. Though the nation is known for its military might, it has failed to handle the calamity, according to critics. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Friday during a Security Cabinet briefing that Israel could not cope with the wildfire alone and thanked the more than 13 nations sending emergency crews and equipment to help douse the blaze. During a visit to victims in a hospital in Haifa, most of which was blanketed in smoke, Netanyahu said Russian planes were the latest addition to the international force aiding Israel. Russia's ITAR-Tass news agency reported that an II-76 plane capable of holding 42 tons of water, an amphibious BE-200 and an Mi-26 transport helicopter also used for fighting fires were scheduled to fly to Israel. ""On the way here, we flew over Carmel, where we heard and saw the Greek aircraft fighting the fire,"" Netanyahu said. ""I very much appreciate the mobilization of many countries."" Netanyahu talked Friday with U.S. President Barack Obama, who said in a statement that officials from the two nations have been ""in near-constant contact since the fires began."" Chemicals to suppress the flames -- including 45 metric tons of fire retardant and 12,000 liters of foam -- will arrive this weekend through the U.S. Agency for International Development, that agency said, with teams of U.S.-based firefighting specialists also on their way. Additionally, a U.S. military official said that Israel has asked for satellite imagery from the U.S. military, as well as planes to carry water and flame retardants. Israeli fire crews were also aided by Cyprus, England and Turkey, among others. Relations between Turkey and Israel have been tense since last spring, when Israeli commandos boarded a Turkish ship carrying humanitarian aid for Gaza, killing nine people. ""This is a very blessed step that the prime minister of Turkey has decided to take,"" Netanyahu told reporters about Turkey's help.

"(CNN) -- Former Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader has been arrested in Salzburg, Austria, an Austrian Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said Friday. His arrest came after an international warrant was issued by Croatian prosecutors accusing him of abuse of position and power, according to Croatia's Ministry of Interior. Sanader was arrested on a highway in Salzburg, said the spokeswoman, who works for the extradition division of Austria's Justice Ministry and did not want to be named. Sanader will be extradited to Croatia, according to Croatian state-run HTV. Sanader faces allegations of corruption dating to his years as prime minister from 2003 to 2009, according to prosecutors. A popular, conservative politician, Sanader was a leading member of the Christian Conservative HDZ party founded by Croatia's first post-communist president, Franjo Tudman. Fellow party member Jerko Rosen said Sanader, who left the country on business, will return to Croatia immediately to fight the charges, RTL-Croatia reported. Rosen said he does not know Sanader's whereabouts. Sanader, who has an international passport, has been stripped of any official immunity, RTL reported. He is listed on the Interpol site as a fugitive wanted on fraud and organized crime offenses. Secret U.S. diplomatic cables recently released by the WikiLeaks website allege that kickbacks were being investigated during Sanader's term, and that there ""appears to be a new attitude toward allegedly corrupt party members that is strengthening the political will to fight corruption at all levels in the Croatian government and economy."" ""For the past three years, the Croatian State Prosecutor's Office for the Suppression of Organized Crime and Corruption (USKOK) has been ratcheting up its activity in corruption cases,"" the cable stated.

"New York (CNN) -- Less than one month after being rescued, one of the now-famous Chilean miners will compete in the New York City Marathon Sunday, according to Mary Wittenberg, president of the New York City Road Runners Club. Edison Pena, 34, was originally invited by the club, which organizes the annual marathon, to attend the event as a spectator. But Pena insisted on running in the 26.2-mile marathon, Wittenberg said. Pena earned the nickname ""the runner"" for jogging through one of the mine's tunnels, but he was eventually forced to stop after rocks began to fall along his route. ""He had the fortitude to take the time and run when in what most would describe as a pretty scary situation,"" Wittenberg told CNN. ""To be out there whether running or walking is such an affirmation of the human spirit,"" she said of the marathon. Wittenberg said Pena will be traveling to New York with his wife.

"(CNN) -- The new-look Miami Heat recorded their first win of the NBA season on Wednesday, but their conquerors in the opening round the Boston Celtics could not back up the victory. On Tuesday, 17-time NBA finals champions the Celtics defeated the much hyped up Heat and their star signings LeBron James, Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh in the most watched regular season basketball game of all-time. But in a reversal of fortunes in Wednesday's games, the Heat defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 98-87 with ""The Big Three"" securing their first win while playing together in the Florida-side's shirt. Meanwhile the Celtics -- who lost last season's final to the Los Angeles Lakers -- struggled against LeBron's old team the Cleveland Cavaliers, losing 95-87. Playing at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, the Heat performed closer to what had been expected of basketball's new dream team, spurred on by their disappointing loss to Boston. ""I saw a tangible difference in how we were playing,"" coach Erik Spoelstra told the official NBA website. ""Guys took it to heart and wanted to come out with a better disposition defensively and keep the ball in front of us to challenge at the rim."" Wade scored 30 points, James 16 and Bosh 15 to complete a better performance from the trio. But it was another James, James Jones, who really stood out for the Heat, finishing with 20 points on nine attempts and receiving praise from his star teammates. ""JJ was unbelievable today,"" James told the NBA website while Wade added: ""Give it up for JJ, really stepping up."" But Wade believes there is still more to come from Miami, who almost allowed Philadelphia to catch them in the final quarter. ""We're not at our peak, we're not even close,'' he said. ""Eventually when it's time to be there, we will.'' The Celtics were stunned by the Cleveland Cavaliers, playing in their first match for more than seven years without LeBron James, who announced his decision to leave the Ohio side in an hour long television program in July. Boston coach Doc Rivers was congratulated by Cleveland fans for having overcome the Heat, but his side then received no mercy from the Cavaliers. ""Guys in this locker room believe. We've been listening to what people are predicting for us,"" Cleveland forward Antawn Jamison said. ""We're going to let our game do the talking. It's probably going to take a month or so for people to realize, 'Hey, this is a team that can win and compete for the playoffs.''' For the Cavaliers, JJ Hickson finished with 21 points and Daniel Gibson 16 -- all in the second half -- to hold off the challenge from the Celtics. The east coast side had led by 11 points in the third quarter but were outscored 27-14 in the fourth. ""`We took them a little bit too lightly,'' Shaquille O'Neal, who spent last season with Cleveland, admitted to the NBA website. Elsewhere in Wednesday's other NBA Eastern Conference games, the New York Knicks beat the Toronto Raptors 98-93, the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated Chicago Bulls 106-95 and The New Jersey Nets won 101-98 against the Detroit Pistons.","Miami Heat win first NBA game of season on Wednesday while Boston Celtics lost .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- India's prime minister said he has nothing to hide and would be ""happy"" to appear before a parliamentary panel looking into a multi-billion dollar telecom scandal. ""I wish to state categorically that I have nothing to hide from the public at large, and as a proof of my bona fides, I intend to write to the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee that I shall be happy to appear before the PAC if it chooses to ask me to do so,"" Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said in a speech at a national meeting of the ruling Congress party. ""I sincerely believe that, like Caesar's wife, the prime minister should be above suspicion, and it is for this reason that I am prepared to appear before the PAC even though there is no precedent to this effect."" Opposition parties have stepped up their attacks on Singh, hailed as the father of India's economic reforms, since the country's main auditor reported in November that a sale of a second-generation wireless spectrum two years ago had been carried out at below-market prices. According to the government audit, the treasury lost up to $31 billion from under-valuation of airwaves. The alleged scam, seen as the biggest to hit India in recent times, has forced the country's Telecom Minister A. Raja, to step down. Raja, member of a key regional ally of Singh's Congress party, denies the charges. But opposition lawmakers are seeking a larger probe into the 2008 phone-license awards, and accuse Singh of having not acted swiftly. India's prime minister, on his part, insists the wrongdoers will be punished. ""It is my promise to you that no guilty person will be spared -- whether he is a political leader or a government official, whichever party he may belong to and howsoever powerful he may be,"" Singh said Monday. The damning audit report came on the heels of allegations of massive fraud in sports and real estate. Investigators are already probing complaints of financial malfeasance in the Commonwealth Games that India hosted in October. And several politicians, military officials and bureaucrats are the subjects of a separate inquiry for allegedly taking apartments meant for war-widows. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.","Opposition parties have stepped up their attacks on Singh .

"Washington (CNN) -- A senior U.S. official is denying allegations that American officials ignored warnings by the Moroccan-born wife of David Headley, a Drug Enforcement Administration informer in Pakistan who was convicted of helping to plan the 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai. ""She expressed concern about individuals that her husband was hanging around with,"" he said. ""She had concerns that they were involved in a terrorist plot. She had no details about who he was associated with or what they might be contemplating."" He added, ""There was nothing specific. There was nothing necessarily to follow up on."" The official, speaking on background because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the subject, said the wife ""walked into the U.S. Embassy in December 2007. There was a follow-up meeting in 2008. That was the last contact that we had with her."" The attack occurred in November 2008. An American former wife of Headley also expressed concern about Headley's activities to U.S. investigators two years earlier, news reports say, but Headley was able to continue his contacts and training with militants in Pakistan. The senior U.S. official denied, however, that the information was ignored. ""We took what the wives told us seriously,"" he insisted. This official said the State Department shared the information with ""relevant"" U.S. agencies. He said he did not know whether that information was shared with Pakistan. He would not say whether the information was shared with India, although he added that, as a matter of course, the U.S. shares intelligence with India and did so both before and after the Mumbai attacks. Asked whether the State Department fully investigated the Moroccan wife's concerns, the official said that since the United States has limited authority in a foreign country it ""checked out what she told us."" He provided no details. Monday, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley told reporters that if the United States had had specific information on possible planning for the Mumbai attacks it would have shared it with India. ""We would have absolutely provided it to the Indian government, you know, beforehand,"" he said. ""The fact is that while we had information and concerns, it did not detail a time or place of the attack."" Any information she did provide was followed up on, Crowley said. ""We followed up on that information and provided it to relevant agencies across the U.S. government,"" he said at a State Department news conference.","The information received included ""nothing specific,"" a U.S. official says .

"London, England (CNN) -- The board of British chocolate maker Cadbury accepted a buyout offer from American food giant Kraft Tuesday, a deal that would end the nearly 200-year-old independence of the beloved British brand. The board has agreed to recommend the offer to Cadbury shareholders, who have until February 2 to decide -- but they are expected to approve it. Kraft's offer Tuesday is its biggest one yet for the maker of Creme Eggs and Dairy Milk chocolate bars. It values Cadbury at £13.3 billion ($21.8 billion), or £8.40 ($13.77) per share. In addition, Cadbury shareholders will be entitled to receive 10 pence (16 cents) per Cadbury share. ""We believe the offer represents good value for Cadbury shareholders and are pleased with the commitment that Kraft Foods has made to our heritage, values, and people throughout the world,"" Cadbury Chairman Roger Carr said in a statement. He said Cadbury would work with Kraft to ensure the growth of the business for customers and employees. ""We have great respect for Cadbury's brands, heritage, and people,"" said Kraft Chairwoman and Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld. ""We believe they will thrive as part of Kraft Foods."" Will takeover affect Cadbury's taste? Cadbury had previously rejected two hostile takeover bids by Kraft because Carr said they did not value the company high enough. Illinois-based Kraft earlier this month sold its North American frozen pizza business to Nestle to finance a fresh bid for Cadbury. The January 5 sale helped Kraft boost the cash element of its offer, which would give Cadbury shareholders cash in addition to Kraft shares. There had been rumors that Swiss firm Nestle, which has a chocolate and confectionery unit, would make its own offer for Cadbury. But Nestle squelched those rumors when it bought Kraft's frozen pizza business in the United States and Canada for $3.7 billion. U.S. chocolate maker Hershey also had reportedly been considering a $17.9 billion bid for Cadbury. Cadbury is a beloved brand in Britain, producing chocolate products that have become a cultural fixture. Its Dairy Milk and Bournville brands have been around for more than 100 years, and its Milk Tray and Roses samplers -- which are still sold today -- were some of the first to be marketed as an everyday purchase. John Cadbury established his shop in Birmingham, England, in 1824, selling drinking chocolate alongside coffee and tea. Cadbury, a Quaker, was trying to give people an alternative to alcohol, which he thought destroyed lives, according to the company. Cadbury: From grocery store to global giant . The company now employs around 45,000 people in 60 countries, including around 5,700 staff at eight manufacturing sites in the UK and Ireland, . Kraft's roots go back to 1903, when J.L. Kraft began selling cheese from his horse-drawn wagon in Chicago, Illinois. Today the company owns products from Oreo Cookies and Jell-O gelatin to Philadelphia Cream Cheese and Miracle Whip salad dressing, though it may be most famous for its Macaroni & Cheese instant dinner and Velveeta processed cheese products. Kraft's takeover of Cadbury has also been criticized by British trade unions who urged the UK government and the EU to block the bid. Unite, the UK's largest union said a merger will destabilize the company and hit future returns to shareholders. Outside Cadbury's plant in the Birmingham suburb of Bourneville on Tuesday some workers expressed their fears about possible job losses. One man told the Press Association: ""There are a lot of worried people inside that building."" The employee, who asked not to be named, added: ""Nobody really knows what is going on or what this might mean in terms of job losses, but inside that factory there are a lot of people who are very, very worried about the future -- the future of the company and their own future, their jobs and their families. ""It is not a good atmosphere here today.""","British chocolate maker Cadbury accepts buyout offer from U.S. food giant Kraft .

"(CNN) -- Not long ago, I was very kindly invited to Buckingham Palace, as a member of Britain's food industry. Hundreds of very smart foodies turned up, having showered, shaved and left behind their stoves, whisks and knives. It is a funny thing seeing many of your contemporaries in suits and dresses when you're used to seeing them in their whites and aprons. I spent most of the evening introducing myself or just observing the many groups of people that mingle at occasions like these. One group caught my eye for most of the evening. It was made up of gentlemen all dressed in military uniform -- rather splendid military uniforms, obviously designed for just such a royal occasion. It was not the uniforms or even the rows of medals on their chests, but the fact that military members were there at all. Watch an interview with Arthur Potts Dawson . What would the military be doing at a food gig at Buckingham Palace? Well, the answer stopped me short, so short that I have been unable to think of much else since that rather uneventful night -- uneventful except for the firm handshake of Her Majesty the Queen. The answer in its simplest form was that the uniforms were the catering corps, a corps that has catered all over the world for British soldiers on every battlefield ever since men needed to fight and eat at the same time. The answer in its most shocking form was that these were the men who would be in control of the food in Britain should we face shortages. Shortages? Yes, shortages, of oil, water and their means of distribution. Shortages of flour, milk and eggs. Shortages of meat, fruit and vegetables. In fact, should this country suffer from any number of potential problems with our oil-dependent food chain, our very lives could be in the hands of the small group of men standing in a corner in Buckingham Palace. All of Britain's superstar chefs had turned out for this event, but none was more important than the gentlemen who stood watching the rest of us, as we rather arrogantly walked around the room as if food would always be available  to perform tricks with, to swear at and make jokes with. Well, food security is a serious issue and I better find out as much as I can about it. TED.com: Jamie Oliver's TED Prize wish . In Britain the big supermarkets dominate our food chain. British supermarkets are some of the best in the world at controlling, manipulating and delivering cheap food. Controlling food and its distribution takes a huge amount of money and energy, but because the British food producer could not keep up with the supermarkets' demands for ever-lower prices, the supermarkets have moved to buying globally. They turned to the products provided by cheap labor in northern and southern Africa, South America and Asia. But in shifting from Britain to the world, our supermarkets managed to destabilize Britain's food infrastructure. The supermarkets have left behind farmers, milk producers and fishermen. They all have knowledge they should be passing down, but there is no new blood wanting to pick up the rake, the fishing net or the gate latch at 4 a.m. TED.com: Michael Pollan gives a plant eye's view . There is no money in food production in Britain: The supermarkets have taken the potential for a decent living away. The cost to produce milk is higher than the supermarkets are willing to pay. The cost of meat is too high, and the cost of fish is too high. But the supermarkets reply that they are only trying to ""give the customers what they want,"" so they must go abroad. In this statement is the manipulation. We as customers are led to believe that the low costs we pay are borne by the supermarkets. Well, think again. It is the producers in this country who are paid such low prices by the supermarkets for their produce that they are going out of business by the hundreds every year, and with it goes their knowledge. The supermarkets are not delivering cheap food, it is the farmers and producers of Britain, and now the world -- and at a cost to the environment too. Increased yield means increased use of fertilizers, pesticides and antibiotics in animals. About 30% of fresh food is thrown away in supermarkets every day, although they will deny it. British households are throwing an estimated 30% of their food away too. Where are we going with this over-producing, over-consuming super-cheap food system? We are going global with a huge reliance on oil. TED.com: Dean Ornish on the world's killer diet . But when the oil stops flowing, and our systems fail, no safety procedures are in place to help us. No localized food networks, and no agricultural schools developing our next wave of farmers -- this in a country where the average age for a farmer is 64. It feels to me as if we are becoming so overly reliant on our supermarket system, that when it breaks down, all we can turn to is military intervention. Surely we should be striving to teach and educate people how to feed themselves. How to grow food and distribute it locally. How to barter for food items that can bring the essential vitamins and minerals for healthy life. Be mindful of what supermarkets are doing and demand to see their business practices. Stop throwing away food. Compost as much as you can, eat as locally and as seasonally as you can. Share knowledge and information. We are stronger as a group than an individual. Think in a cooperative and communal way, set up local food hubs and create growing communities. I have tried to create that type of idea in The People's Supermarket, and hope that it grows in popularity. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Arthur Potts Dawson.","Arthur Potts Dawson: British supermarkets control and deliver very cheap food .
Potts: They buy cheap food globally, driving local producers out of business .
Dairy and meat farmers, fishermen are becoming a vanishing breed, he writes .
Consumers must work for fresh, sustainable food systems not reliant on oil, he writes ."

"(CNN) -- Rebels in the oil-rich Niger Delta region said Friday they will launch new raids on oil installations to seize more hostages after Nigerian authorities freed 19 who had been seized. ""Our fighters have been instructed to carry out more raids on oil installations from where fresh hostages will be taken,"" the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) said in a statement. The 12 Nigerians and two Americans, two Frenchmen, one Canadian and two Indonesians were released Wednesday. Nigeria has launched an ongoing offensive targeting Delta, Bayelsa and Rivers states, the largest military campaign in the Niger Delta since the government offered an amnesty program in 2007. MEND is one of several militant groups in the Niger Delta that has been battling the government for years over the distribution of the country's oil wealth. In its statement, the group offered its own version of the rescue operation, saying the fighters guarding the hostages retreated in order to prevent a gun battle that would have ""endangered the lives of these hostages."" The group said the Nigerian military were tipped off to the location of the hostages by ""certain persons from this community,"" but did not elaborate.

"Paris, France (CNN) -- The French foreign ministry Thursday said a photograph of seven hostages in Niger -- including five French nationals -- has been authenticated and is an ""encouraging sign"" showing the hostages are alive. ""On September 30th a television network broadcast a photograph of the seven people who were kidnapped in Arlit [Niger] on September 16th, including five French nationals,"" the foreign ministry statement said. ""Even if we do not know what date it was taken, it is an encouraging sign as it shows all the hostages alive. All state services are mobilized and are doing everything they can to free them."" The photograph was also posted on an al Qaeda-linked website, along with audio of what appeared to be the hostages responding to rapid questions from an unknown man. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), the terror movement's affiliate in North Africa, claimed responsibility for the abductions of the six men and one woman, who are all linked with the French nuclear reactor builder Areva. The group included an Areva employee and his wife, along with five subcontractors who worked for the French construction firm Vinci. A spokesman for French President Nicolas Sarkozy's office said Sunday that France was ""ready to discuss"" the hostages' release. On the recording, four men and one woman are heard giving information, including name, age, nationality, hometown, job title and marital status. All the hostages said they are French and gave the names of French cities as their hometowns. One man and the woman, who said they are married, gave their ages as 59 and 62. Three others said they are 25, 30 and 33. The photograph showed seven people sitting on the ground. Six were men, and the seventh person's face was intentionally blurred. Behind them stood people with covered faces, carrying large guns. Officials for Areva and Vinci say they have beefed up security measures for their employees in the area and are working closely with both Nigerien and French authorities to secure the release of the hostages. French military planes have been flying reconnaissance missions from the airport in Niamey, Niger's capital, trying to locate the hostages or their abductors. Areva has been mining uranium for the past four decades in Niger, one of the poorest countries in the world. French director Michel Germaneau was abducted in Niger and executed in July in nearby Mauritania. A video showed Germaneau's photo along with images of the French flag and al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb's black-and-white flag.","A photograph showing seven hostages is an 'encouraging sign,' France says .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid kept up the pressure on La Liga rivals Barcelona on Sunday with a 1-0 win over Sevilla at the Bernabeu. A 77th minute strike by Angel Di Maria was enough to see Jose Mourinho's side secure three points. The win came despite playing the last quarter of the game with ten men, after Ricardo Calvalho was shown his second yellow card for a challenge on Alvaro Negredo. The Portuguese international was one of twelve players to be cautioned during an ill-tempered match, which also saw Sevilla defender Dabo sent off late in the game. Sevilla remain in 11th place, while Madrid remain right on the heels of Barcelona in second -- two points behind as La Liga takes its winter break. Atletico Madrid put the disappointment of this week's Europa League exit behind them as they cruised to a comfortable 3-0 win over Malaga to move up to sixth in La Liga. Portuguese midfielder Tiago opened the scoring after 22 minutes and bagged a second in the 69th minute after Dominguez had made it 2-0 three minutes earlier. Malaga have now lost 11 league games this season and remain third from bottom in the table. The victory moves Atletico above Getafe on goal difference, who came from two goals down to beat Almeria 3-2 at the Estadio Mediterraneo. Kalu Uche opened the scoring after seven minutes and Leonardo Ulloa doubled the home side's lead in the 24th minute. Manu pulled a goal back for Getafe five minutes later and three minutes into the second half Venezuelan striker Miku bundled home an equalizer. Derek Boateng completed the comeback in the 71st minute to extend Michel's men's unbeaten run to six matches. Osasuna and bottom-of-the-table Real Zaragoza played out a 0-0 draw. Meanwhile in Germany's Bundesliga, Bayer Leverkusen missed the chance to close the gap on league leaders Borussia Dortmund to eight points as they were held to a 2-2 draw against Freiburg. Leaders Dortmund miss out on Bundesliga record . The hosts took the lead after 16 minutes when Arturo Vidal converted a penalty to score his eighth goal of the season. But a determined Freiburg fought back with goals from Jan Rosenthal after 24 minutes and Stefan Reisinger midway through the second half. But the visitors' lead didn't last long as substitute Patrick Helmes finished calmly after Stefan Kiessling set up the scoring opportunity in the 75th minute. Mario Gomez scored his second hat-trick of the Bundesliga season as Bayern Munich hammered Stuttgart 5-3 at the Mercedes-Benz Arena. Gomez opened the scoring after 31 minutes and Thomas Muller doubled the lead five minutes later. Stuttgart's defensive frailties were further exposed when Franck Ribery made it 3-0 with a superb individual goal a minute before half-time. Stuttgart tried to mount a comeback with substitute Martin Harnik pulling a goal back five minutes after the break. But any hopes of a lasting revival were immediately snuffed out by Gomez who struck twice in two minutes to complete his hat-trick. Harnik claimed his second goal on the hour mark, and Christian Gentner made the scoreline slightly more respectable for Stuttgart with a 70th minute strike. Bayern now lie fifth in the table heading into the winter break. Stuttgart remain in trouble in 17th place with only 12 points.","Real Madrid keep pressure on rivals Barcelona with 1-0 win over Sevilla .

"Newark, Delaware (CNN) -- A feisty Christine O'Donnell attacked her Democratic opponent but also stumbled in Wednesday's debate with Chris Coons in their election battle for Delaware's U.S. Senate seat held for nearly four decades by Vice President Joe Biden. The highly anticipated showdown between two candidates considered surprise contenders featured O'Donnell displaying her conservative credentials that gained Tea Party backing while Coons, put on the defensive at times, generally backed Democratic policies favored by President Barack Obama. O'Donnell's primary victory over a veteran mainstream Republican candidate last month shook up the GOP establishment, with party strategist Karl Rove even questioning her qualifications. Now trailing badly according to the latest polls, she appeared nervous at the start but quickly went on the attack, accusing Coons of raising taxes and offering a ""rubber stamp"" to Obama administration policies if elected. ""My opponent wants to go to Washington and rubber-stamp the spending bills"" that she said are hurting the nation and Delaware. Later, O'Donnell said, a vote for Coons would cost the average Delawarean $10,000 ""instantly"" in tax hikes and energy reform costs. At other times, her attacks were less precise and drew scorn from Coons, such as when she said the influence of a Marxist college professor on Coons' political beliefs should ""send chills up the spine of every Delaware voter."" ""If it were accurate, if it were true, I'd agree,"" Coons responded. ""It's not accurate and it's not true."" He emphasized his experience as New Castle County executive but also attacked O'Donnell, calling some of her positions extreme and accusing her of lying about his record in campaign messaging. ""Most of them are untrue,"" Coons said of claims about him on her campaign website. ""Some of them are just flat-out lies, some of them are mischaracterizations, some of them are just factually untrue."" Both candidates framed the election as a clear choice for voters, and their stance on issues showed that. CNN iReport: Tell us how you think the candidates did . Coons said he supports abortion rights and embryonic stem cell research while opposing the ban on openly gay and lesbian soldiers from military service, and he backed most Obama administration policies, with a few refinements. For example, he said Bush-era tax cuts should be extended to the vast majority of the county but questioned Obama's plan to limit the extension to those families making up to $250,000 a year. He also said the health care reform law needed some adjustments. O'Donnell backed Republican positions such as calling for tax cuts and spending cuts to balance the budget, and she repeatedly said tough social issues such as abortion rights and teaching creation theory in public schools should be state or local issues instead of federal decisions. When pressed on a comment from more than decade ago when she questioned evolution theory, she responded: ""What I believe is irrelevant. What I will support in Washington, D.C., is the ability of the local school system to decide what is taught in their classrooms."" In one testy exchange, O'Donnell referred to Obama administration policies creating what she called ""a culture of dependency"" by expanding the number of people getting food stamps. Coons immediately tried to portray her as insensitive saying: ""To simply denounce people as being dependent because they're applying for and receiving food stamps in the worst recession in modern times is frankly slandering people who are in incredibly difficult times."" O'Donnell interrupted, saying, ""That's not fair. That's not fair of you to say that because that's not at all what I'm doing,"" and then counter-attacking by declaring: ""I'm not the person who would cut the tax benefits of disabled and low-income citizens as you did as county executive."" The most serious problem for either candidate came when O'Donnell was asked to cite any specific recent Supreme Court rulings that she opposed. ""Oh gosh, give me a specific one,"" she said, and when told the question required her come up with cases, O'Donnell responded, ""I'm sorry,"" and promised to put the information up later on her website. Coons quickly referred to the Citizens United ruling in January in which the court lifted some limits on corporate contributions to campaign spending. The debate produced a few humorous moments, such as when Coons said O'Donnell's well-publicized statements from a decade earlier that she dabbled in witchcraft and questioned evolution theory were distractions instead of a substantive campaign issue. ""You're just jealous that you weren't on 'Saturday Night Live',"" O'Donnell said, referring to the comedy show's satirical skit about her. ""I'm dying to see who's going to play me,"" Coons responded with a smile. O'Donnell scored a major upset last month when she defeated Rep. Mike Castle to win Delaware's GOP Senate nomination. She had support from the Tea Party Express, a major endorsement from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, as well as the strong anti-establishment and anti-incumbent feelings among voters this year in topping Castle, a moderate Republican who served nine terms in the House and eight years as governor before that. However, her victory made a race considered relatively safe for Republicans based on the expected nomination of the popular Castle into one in which the little-known Coons suddenly became the favorite, due to O'Donnell's inexperience and questions about her past. Since O'Donnell's primary victory, she has had to deal with controversial and colorful comments she made about a decade ago when she was a spokeswoman for conservative causes. Her first campaign commercial began with O'Donnell declaring, ""I am not a witch"" in response to her statement years ago on the program ""Politically Incorrect"" that she ""dabbled in witchcraft."" She acknowledged in an interview with CNN that the resurfaced clips have forced her to reinvent herself in the final weeks of the campaign. ""I haven't been embarrassed. And I'm not saying that I'm proud,"" O'Donnell told CNN's Jim Acosta last week. ""I've matured in my faith. I've matured in my policies. Today you have a forty-something woman running for office, not a 20-year-old. So that's a big difference."" The debate at the University of Delaware in Newark was co-moderated by CNN's Wolf Blitzer and by longtime Delaware news anchor Nancy Karibjanian of Delaware First Media. Results of a CNN/Time/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Wednesday showed Coons with a 19-point lead over O'Donnell. However, O'Donnell enjoys a lead in campaign cash, which is one reason both President Barack Obama and Biden are coming to Delaware on Friday to help Coons raise money. O'Donnell, 41, ran unsuccessfully for Senate twice before, in 2006 and 2008. Since winning the primary, she's had to deal with controversies involving unpaid income taxes and allegations of misusing campaign donations, as well as attacks from Democrats and some Republicans, including Rove, on her qualifications. Coons, the 47-year-old executive of New Castle County, the state's most populous county, faced no serious opposition in the Democratic primary. While he is running his first statewide campaign, Coons is neither a political novice nor a party outsider. In 1988, Coons served as a policy researcher for the failed Senate campaign of then-Lt. Gov. S.B. Woo. He went on to earn a degree from Yale Law School, as well as a master's in ethics from Yale Divinity School. The winner in November will fill out the remaining four years of Biden's final term in the Senate. Biden stepped down from his seat after his election in November 2008 as vice president. Former Biden aide Ted Kaufman was named as an interim replacement, and did not seek a full term. CNN's Tom Cohen, Paul Steinhauser, Jim Acosta, and Bonnie Kapp contributed to this report.","NEW: O'Donnell backs more state powers on social issues .

"Washington (CNN) -- Senate Republicans mounted a counter-attack Sunday against ratifying a new nuclear arms treaty with Russia this year, trying to put off a vote that Democrats say they will win if it is held. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky led the way, telling CNN's ""State of the Union"" that members of his party need more time to consider the START accord. ""I've decided I cannot support the treaty,"" McConnell said in his first outright rejection of ratifying the treaty during the current lame-duck session of Congress. The treaty would resume mutual inspections of U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals, while limiting both nations to 1,550 warheads and 700 launchers each. On Sunday, Democrats rejected a Republican amendment to the treaty's preamble that would have added a reference to tactical nuclear weapons, which are not covered by the pact. Republican senators are ""uneasy"" about the treaty, and trying to get a vote before Christmas was not the best way to ""get the support of people like me,"" McConnell said. His unequivocal stance increased the GOP's public opposition to ratification, which would require at least 10 GOP senators to vote with the Democrats to reach the two-thirds majority of 67 needed. The Democratic caucus has 58 members, but one of them, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, is preparing for prostate cancer surgery Monday and is expected to miss the rest of the current lame-duck session that expires January 4. If the vote gets put off to the new Congress, as Republicans want, the number of GOP votes needed for ratification rises to at least 14 because the Democrats will have a diminished majority of 53 seats. McConnell's comments prompted a response from his Democratic counterpart, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, who issued a statement saying he was ""deeply disappointed"" at McConnell's opposition to the treaty. Reid's statement noted that ""respected Republican leaders"" including former President George H.W. Bush and several former secretaries of state, as well as the current military leadership all called for ratification. In addition, Reid's statement said, the proposed treaty has been available since May and the Obama administration has answered questions from senators and taken steps to address concerns. For example, the administration has committed to increased spending on modernizing the U.S. nuclear arsenal at the request of Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, who had been leading the GOP opposition to the treaty. ""I know many senators, including my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, who share the belief that this treaty is too critical to our national security to delay, and I look forward to strong bipartisan support to pass this treaty before we end this session of Congress,"" Reid's statement concluded. Later Sunday, Reid filed a cloture motion -- a necessary procedural step to end debate and set up a vote. ""After months of consideration and five days of open and robust debate, it is time to move forward on a treaty that will help reverse nuclear proliferation and make it harder for terrorists to get their hands on a nuclear weapon. Every day we delay is another day we do not have inspectors on the ground in Russia monitoring their nuclear arsenal,"" he said in a statement. Democratic Sen. John Kerry, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, predicted Sunday that Democrats have the necessary support for ratification and that the vote would occur in the coming days. ""I believe it will pass, and I believe there will be a vote,"" Kerry said on the ABC program ""This Week."" However, the ranking Republican on the Senate panel, Richard Lugar of Indiana, said he was uncertain that the vote would occur before the lame-duck session expires. ""Several Republicans will support it, and I join the chairman (Kerry) in believing that there are the votes there,"" said Lugar, who backs ratification. ""The problem is really getting to that final vote."" Lugar noted that the Senate still needs to debate Republican amendments to the treaty. Any change in the language or substance of the pact would require reopening negotiations with Russia, effectively killing the agreement. So far, Democrats have defeated the two Republican amendments proposed -- Sunday's attempt to add a reference to tactical nuclear weapons, and a Saturday bid by Sen. John McCain of Arizona to remove from the preamble language recognizing a relationship between offensive and defensive weapons. In both cases, however, Democrats were at least seven votes shy of the 67 they will need to ratify the treaty. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, on Sunday continued questioning the language cited in the failed McCain amendment, telling the CBS program ""Face the Nation"" that it could undermine future development of U.S. missile defense systems. According to Graham, Russia could object to continuing U.S. development of missile defense capability as a violation of the treaty and withdraw from it. Kyl, appearing on ""FOX News Sunday,"" also challenged the language in the preamble, which he said changes the past U.S. stance by linking offensive and defensive weapons. ""In the last arms control treaty with Russia in 2002 we absolutely separated the two issues,"" Kyl said. Now, he said, the Democrats were insisting the treaty can't be changed. If that's the case, Kyl said, ""we're just a rubber stamp for the administration and the Russians, the administration that for the first time wasn't willing to stand up to the Russians and say, 'You're not going to implicate our missile defenses.' "" However, Democratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, labeled the missile defense concern a ""straw man"" argument without substance. The nation's top military leaders say ""there is no restriction, no limitations whatsoever"" on missile defense in the treaty, Levin said. Lugar also challenged some of the GOP arguments, saying the resumed inspections under the new treaty were essential for verifying compliance by Russia. In addition, the treaty represents new opportunities to engage with Russia on important issues in the continuing evolution of relations between the countries after the Cold War era, he noted. ""To throw away all of those opportunities simply because some feel the Russians are no longer relevant or we should just simply build whatever we want to quite apart from the Russians seems to me is an illogical stance, but we're hearing a lot of that,"" Lugar said on the ABC program. Democrats argued that the Senate has plenty of time to consider further Republican amendments and debate the treaty before the new Congress gets sworn in during the first week of January. Previous arms control treaties have taken a similar amount of time to debate, Levin noted on the CBS program. The Senate is expected to go into a closed session Monday afternoon to discuss classified information related to the treaty. On Saturday, President Barack Obama sent letters to McConnell and Reid expressing his support for the accord. ""The New START treaty places no limitations on the development or deployment of our missile defense programs,"" Obama wrote. CNN's Gabriella Schwarz contributed to this report.","Senate Democrats defeat a second Republican amendment .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Six unidentified men were found in a cargo truck at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport during a random security sweep, officials said. Transportation Security Administration spokesman Jon Allen said the Transportation Security Administration, along with more than a dozen federal and state agencies, were conducting counter-terrorism exercises Tuesday when agents discovered the men. The men were handed over to two federal agencies -- Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Allen said. The men were illegal immigrants, said ICE spokeswoman Barbara Gonzalez. ""None of those encountered were in secure areas of the airport, nor did they have access to those areas,"" she said. Gonzalez previously said all the men had been processed for removal from the United States, but she later clarified the statement. ""They have not been processed for removal at this time. We are still looking into the matter and there is an ongoing investigation,"" she said. Gonzalez said five of the men were from Mexico and one man was from El Salvador. ""Additionally, our investigation has revealed that none of these individuals had any ill intent"" against the United States, Gonzalez said. The security operation took place outside a cargo facility that has no connection to any airport terminals, and the sweep was part of a routine exercise carried out randomly at various transportation hubs, Allen said. ""We conduct thousands of these across the country on a regular basis. This particular operation was targeted to facilities carrying cargo,"" he said. Agents were using a three-tiered method, including an X-ray machine, radiological detection equipment and bomb-sniffing canine teams, he said. ""Finding individuals in the back of the truck was not expected.""","NEW: The investigation is ongoing, ICE spokeswoman says .

""It is a beautiful day for the fight against the mafia,"" Maroni said. ""The capture of the boss constitutes a fundamental threshold in the context of the biggest contrasting operation started against the Camorra clans that operate in Campania.""

"(CNN)  -- Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored the only goal from the penalty spot as AC Milan went back to the top of Serie A with a 1-0 home win over city rivals and reigning champions Inter on Sunday night. Earlier, Lazio had briefly gone top as they beat Napoli 2-0 in Rome, but the defeat for European champions Inter drops them to fourth in the standings, six points behind their city rivals. Milan won a fifth minute penalty when Clarence Seedorf released Swedish star Ibrahimovic and as he dragged back the ball had his legs taken from under him by Marco Materazzi. Ibrahimovic got up to score from the spot and Milan might have gone further ahead as he volleyed just over while Robinho had the ball in the net on 22 minutes but was denied by a linesman's flag. Inter had their best attacking moments through Wesley Sneijder and they looked set to come back into the match when Milan's Ignazio Abate saw red on the hour mark for a second yellow. But they failed to take advance and Seedorf nearly added a second with a fierce shot from 18 meters. In the German Bundesliga, reigning champions Bayern Munich moved up to sixth in the standings with a 3-0 win over Nuremberg. Mario Gomez scored twice for the Bavarian giants, but they are still 12 points behind league leaders Borussia Dortmund, who kept up their relentless pace with a 2-0 win over Hamburg on Friday. But coach Louis van Gaal has not given up hope his team can retain the title despite the big gap. ""We have to try and get at least 30 points, then we will have a chance,"" the Dutchman told AFP. ""I think Dortmund are very lucky at the moment, but they have a good team, they are well organized, play well and have a good coach. ""Their players really want to win."" Germany captain Philipp Lahm scored the other goal for Bayern from the spot in the 75th minute before Gomez rounded off the scoring. He then missed a penalty three minutes from time at the Allianz Arena which would have completed his hat-trick.","Zlatan Ibrahimovic penalty settles Milan derby in San Siro .

"(CNN) -- Living in Tokyo, Japan, during the late '90s, Geoffrey Barnett found it extremely difficult -- even dangerous -- to ride his bicycle to work every day. ""The traffic is incredible, and there's so much pollution,"" said Barnett, an Australian who worked in the city as an English teacher. His students shared his frustration, and they would often talk about Tokyo's jam-packed streets during class. ""It was always a topic of discussion that motivated the students to talk, because it was a part of their life as well,"" Barnett recalled. Out of those frequent discussions evolved Barnett's idea for Shweeb, a system of personal, pedal-powered monorail pods that he hopes can one day become an alternative form of urban transit. With Shweeb, pods hang from an elevated track that, theoretically, would stretch to destinations throughout a city. ""Cumbersome, jammed-up cities of today should be rendered into completely accessible worlds once you've got a way to shoot over the traffic,"" said Barnett, who derived the name Shweeb from the German word ""schweben,"" which means to hang, hover or float. He left Tokyo in 2000 to design a prototype. Barnett's vision received a significant boost last month when Google awarded Shweeb $1 million for research and development. Shweeb was one of five winners of Project 10^100, Google's ""call for ideas to change the world."" The public suggested more than 150,000 categories for Google to consider. Five were eventually chosen, including ""drive innovation in public transportation."" ""The cost of innovation in public transportation is often very high, sometimes in the billions of dollars,"" Google spokesman Jamie Yood said. ""We looked for a concrete project where the funding available to us with Project 10^100 has the potential to yield impact. Shweeb's innovative approach toward low-cost and environmentally friendly urban transport has the potential for significant impact in the future."" Google tests cars that drive themselves . During its global search, Google was able to see a Shweeb prototype in action. Since November 2007, Shweeb has been a star attraction at Agroventures, an adventure park in Rotorua, New Zealand. People of all ages can race the bullet-shaped capsules on a closed track there. ""We've been able to prove a lot of good things about the technology: that we can get the transmission working at high speeds so we can swing around corners, that it's efficient,"" said Barnett, 40. ""It's going faster [up to about 28 mph] than most of our customers would be going on a bicycle. ""The downside is that because it's set up as a racetrack, we don't really give the customers the chance to enjoy it as an efficient way to move. They're under a lot of pressure to put in all their energy and get a good [lap] time."" Barnett said the first concern people usually have about Shweeb is that it might be hard work, but he said it's anything but. ""Although it is pedal-powered like a bicycle, it's got none of the resistances that are inherent in a bicycle, being that you're riding feet-first into the wind with a very small frontal area,"" he said. ""The wind resistance is really low compared to a bicycle. ... I can see people of any age and any fitness level being able to cover a kilometer [0.62 miles] without any effort at all, let alone sweat."" Barnett envisions people using Shweeb -- which uses no fuel, no batteries and has no emissions -- for short trips in major urban centers where residential towers are relatively close to central business districts. That's about the only place that Robert Lang, an expert in urban studies, could see it working out. Lang, a sociology professor and director of Brookings Mountain West at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, says Shweeb might be a viable solution, but only in the few areas with a high population density. ""It would make sense in China and New York and places like that, but you wouldn't have that much opportunity through much of urban America,"" Lang said. ""There's not the imperative for congestion relief like there is in the center of London or New York."" Lang said he sees light-rail trains and plug-in hybrid vehicles, not Shweeb, as the future of urban transit because they fit existing expectations and institutions. ""It doesn't require any change in behavior,"" he said. As one might expect with any new technology, there are plenty of questions surrounding Shweeb. How large will the pods be? Will there be room for cargo or another passenger? Can they function in severe weather? What about hills? The Shweeb website has answers for all of these questions and more, but the system is still very much in the conceptual phase. For example, many people have expressed concern about slow riders holding up traffic on the monorail, where there's nowhere to pass. Barnett says there would be no need to pass, however, because shock absorbers would allow the pods to stack together and let the faster people ""push"" the slow rider in front. ""The Shweebs behind the front one can push it along so the front one is taking the wind resistance but all the ones behind her are basically extra engines to counter that wind resistance,"" he said. ""They'll act as a team. Everyone will just go up to a higher gear, and they'll all pedal together and all their energies will be combined."" But Barnett acknowledges that he still needs more testing to make sure this idea works efficiently. So the next step for the company is to build a flat, straight track about a mile or so long. Barnett has been in talks with several sites about hosting the new test track, and he estimates that it is probably about a year and a half to two years away from completion. While there's still a long way to go until his ultimate vision can be fulfilled, Barnett said he feels encouraged by Google's vote of confidence. ""It just felt like a real affirmation of what I've believed in for the last 10 years, and it just felt like what they wanted for a system that would change the world was exactly what I've been trying to push for what feels like a lifetime now,"" he said. ""But then on top of that, there's also just a huge responsibility that you've got all this goodwill from all around the world, and you've got to not let them down.""","Shweeb, a pedal-powered monorail, wins $1 million from Google .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- One media outlet billed it as the miners versus King Kong. The seemingly invincible 33 miners from Chile and five of their rescuers toured the Universal Studios theme park on Friday, and they were entertained with a tram ride through a tunnel featuring a lifelike 3-D clash with King Kong and Tyrannosaurus rex. ""One more time! One more time!"" the miners, the rescuers and their relatives chanted after the short movie feature concluded. The earthshaking simulator -- rocking the tram as if it were under attack by the beasts of the ""King Kong""' film -- didn't scare the miners, who were trapped 69 days after their gold and copper mine collapsed in August. ""Why not,"" the tram driver said. ""Let's do it again."" So it went. The miners of Chile -- who survived the longest mine entrapment in history -- had their way again, along with their relatives and the five rescuers. Helicopters and other TV news crews continued to follow them. The miners, rescuers and relatives are in Los Angeles this week for their first group tour to the United States since being freed last month. The group is in the nation's second-largest city to attend ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,"" which will air worldwide on Thanksgiving evening, November 25. Organizers invited them as special guests. On Thursday, the entourage visited Hollywood landmarks such as the Walk of Fame stars on Hollywood Boulevard, including one belonging to Elvis Presley. It was an appropriate pilgrimage because miner Edison Pena had led sing-alongs to Elvis music to lift the spirits of fellow miners during the dark ordeal. In fact, he had asked for the music to be sent down into the mine as rescuers drilled a bigger hole to pull the miners out of the ground. ""He is the king, he is the best,"" Pena, 34, said, as he posed for photographs beside Elvis' star on Hollywood Boulevard. ""The sweetest of dreams."" One passerby, Ron Prouty, 30, a writer, was surprised to happen upon the miners. He was returning home from a Starbucks. ""To me they're real heroes, and I think it's beautiful they're out in Hollywood,"" Prouty said. ""I thought a celebrity was here but this is better than a celebrity."" For the majority of the visitors, the trip was their first time outside of Chile. At the top of their to-do list, besides resting after a 12-hour flight from Santiago, Chile, was shopping. ""I want to go to the mall and buy some shoes for my son and daughter,"" said Katty Valdivia, 40, the wife of Sepulveda. For miner Juan Carlos Aguilar, 49, and wife Cristy Coronado, 40, the visit was a double celebration -- because they experienced the birth of their first grandchild, Emily Sofia Studer, born Wednesday. When Aguilar was trapped in the mine, his wife was concerned whether the ordeal would be too much of a strain on her pregnant 17-year-old daughter, Damaris. ""We were really worried,"" Coronado said, speaking in Spanish as did his colleagues. ""My daughter was far into her pregnancy and we were all consumed with what could happen. For those 69 days, we were a separated family."" The miner-poet Zamora said he overcame the gloom of entrapment by doing something he had never done before: write poetry. He wrote 32 poems -- about his wife, mother, son, relatives, friends. He left copies of his verse at home and was unable to share his poetry. ""I never wrote before,"" Zamora said. ""It was a way of keeping me from suffering inside the mine. I wrote about feelings and how people were suffering on the outside and how they would ever rescue us."" Like some other miners, he readily offered up his autographs to anyone wanting to meet him. ""The Poet,"" he wrote in Spanish near his name. Monica Araya, the wife of Florencio Avalos, the first miner who was pulled out of the ground last month, described the 69 days of waiting and wondering as one of her worst experiences. ""It was bad, really bad,"" said Araya. ""I couldn't believe it. I was worried about his life, but I believed they would all survive because I had faith and hope."" She has since noticed a few different things about herself and husband. ""We have changed,"" Araya said. ""We are more sentimental, and we enjoy more what moments we have together."" Before arriving in Los Angeles, the group made a brief stopover at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia, where the miners signed flags. One signed ""Corazon de Minero,"" which means ""heart of a miner."" When miner Richard Villarroell prepared to board the plane in Santiago, Chile, on Wednesday night, the 27-year-old said he has only traveled to Argentina. ""I want to see the world,"" he said, smiling. ""I know all of Chile, but not the rest of the world."" Villarroell, a mechanic, worked at the San Jose mine for two years. His girlfriend was pregnant while he was trapped. The miners captured the world's imagination when they survived the longest mine captivity in history, beginning August 5. For more than two weeks, many officials thought they were dead. But crews made contact after a small borehole enabled communication with the men trapped 2,300 feet underground. Rescue crews encountered repeated setbacks. Initially, authorities expected the miners to be trapped until Thanksgiving or Christmas because of the difficulty of drilling a new tunnel to extract them. On their U.S. trip, the miners and rescuers will get a whirlwind tour of southern California. They'll see the sights and shop in Los Angeles and Hollywood through the weekend. The visit is a world away from the miners' experience in the weeks after the mine collapse that trapped them. In the days before they made contact with the ground, some ate about a bottle cap's worth of canned fish per day and drank mine water that tasted like machine oil. They have said they were prepared to die, even as they awaited their rescue. The miners and rescuers were invited by CNN to attend ""Heroes,"" an annual program now in its fourth year that shines a light on ""everyday people changing the world."" The Chileans were extended the invitation because their plight and rescue captured the world's attention and symbolized the resilience of the human spirit. CNN Heroes received 10,000 nominations from more than 100 countries. That list was narrowed down to the Top 10 CNN Heroes. The Hero of the Year will be revealed on the show; the public votes to select that winner. ""The heroic efforts of the rescue of these miners was one of the most unifying and inspirational events of the year,"" said Jim Walton, president of CNN Worldwide. ""CNN Heroes is a fitting way for CNN to honor these men and their rescuers,"" he said. ""We hope viewers around the world will be heartened by the story of their rescue as well as the stories of this year's top 10 CNN Heroes.""' The miners' imprisonment began when a ramp into the San Jose mine -- located in the arid Atacama region of northern Chile -- collapsed. Shift foreman Luis Urzua told the men that they had a shot of surviving the catastrophe, but there was a good chance they would never again see daylight. The men occupied themselves by voting on everything, including how food should be distributed. Majority rule prevailed -- 17 votes plus one -- but the miners often managed to find common ground and most decisions were unanimous. Everyone had a task. No one was left alone. And they became masters of compromise and patience, even as their rations quickly began running out.

"New York (CNN) -- A Malaysian man was charged on Thursday for hacking into the computer  network of a U.S. Federal Reserve bank and for stealing more than 400,000 stolen  credit card and debit card numbers, according to federal authorities. Lin Mun Poo, 32, is suspected of accessing financial records at a Federal Reserve Bank in Cleveland, Ohio, by ""exploiting a vulnerability he found within their secure system,"" according to a statement by the U.S. Attorney's Office of the Eastern District of New York. At least 10 Federal Reserve Bank computers were affected by the breach, resulting in thousands of dollars in damage, the statement said.

"Paipote, Chile (CNN) -- In short order, freed miner Victor Antonio Segovia dispatches with some of the myths swirling around the 33 men rescued from the depths of the earth this week: He has no plans to write a book about what he endured in the San Jose mine, he isn't going to sue anyone for the collapse, and he intends to go back to working in the area's mines. ""Just not that one,"" Segovia says. All day Friday in the hardscrabble mining town of Paipote, Segovia's family and neighbors ready the Segovia family home for his arrival from the nearby hospital. All 33 men underwent a barrage of medical testing to see how their record days of imprisonment underground had affected them mentally and physically. All but two miners were released from the hospital Friday, and all the men are expected to make a full recovery. The Segovia family was particularly hard hit by the collapse. Two of the other trapped miners, Esteban and Pablo Rojas, are Segovia's cousins. ""Welcome home Victor Segovia,"" one neighbor said as she carried a handwritten sign greeting the miner into his home. ""If God has given you a new life and chance, grab on to it with everything you have."" The family has received gifts. While Victor's brother Pedro Segovia waits under the scorching sun of Chile's Atacama desert, he nervously toys with a brand new Sony media player. An anonymous gift left for the now famous miner. Pedro Segovia said his brother is tough and untouched by how close he came to dying in the dark recesses of the earth. ""We missed him a lot,"" Pedro Segovia said. But for him its just like another shift. As if he worked for eight hours and came home. If Segovia  has troubling memories of his long, forced stay in the mine, so far he hasn't shared them with his brother. ""He'll tell me at some point,"" Pedro Segovia said. ""What happened, what he lived through."" Inside the Segovia house are hints of how he passed the long weeks of eternal darkness. Two Chilean flags decorate a wall in a courtyard behind the Segovia's home. In carefully etched blue ink Victor drew a miner with a drill over a 33 on the white section of the flag. Below, each miner wrote his name and put his signatures in ordered columns. ""For you with all my heart,"" Segovia wrote his mother Blanca. The flags were a gift for her 50th wedding anniversary and were delivered by way of the ""paloma"" tube system that sent food and letters to the men. ""He likes to play the guitar, accordion and organ,"" Blanca Segovia said with pride about her son, who learned to play the instruments without any formal training. ""We are going to have a nice party for him."" But for the guest of honor just getting to the party will be almost as difficult as the previous legs of his journey. As the afternoon wears on, more and more media trickle into the neighborhood. Tripods and cameras are posted like sentries in front of the Segovia home. It has all the makings of an ugly media scene. So photographers agree and shake hands that all will stay in a fixed line so everyone can get an unobstructed shot of Segovia's homecoming. But hours later as Segovia steps from a van, a still photographer lurches forward and the plan is scrapped. Pushing against the wave of cameramen, Chilean police nearly have to carry the miner into his family's home. One of the photographers gets into a showing match with an officer after the melee. As the party gets under way, though, clapping and joyous chants of ""Chi Chi Chi, Le Le Le, los mineros de Chile,"" can be heard from outside the house. Then journalists still hanging around the house receive an invitation to come in and speak with the miner. Segovia appeared understandably worn from his ordeal and the crush of media attention. As reporters ask him questions, he looks down. His voice is soft and his answers are clipped. ""That was quite something,"" he said simply of the August 5 mine collapse. ""That was something very ugly."" He said he has been to Camp Hope, where family members waited for the miners' rescue. ""I don't need to go back,"" he said. Segovia said he missed his family terribly while in the mine. And, he said, he has become someone who ""thinks more about God."" ""We were a team,"" he said of the 33 men. ""But all the same there were problems. So much time together, like any family, the problems start but were ones we worked out."" Other miners have told CNN that the 33 men swore an oath never to discuss the details of what took place as the men struggled to survive in the mine. Before he goes back to the party, Segovia makes it clear he is not completely free of the mine. ""Down there you were always tired and didn't have any nightmares,"" he said. ""Here you have nightmares until you realize you are out.""","Victor Segovia, two of his cousins were trapped in the San Jose mine .

"Las Vegas, Nevada (CNN) -- This weekend marks the end of an era for many fans of the iconic Liberace. The Las Vegas museum dedicated to preserving the glitz, the glamour and even the gaudiness that defined the entertainer's career is closing Sunday after more than 30 years. Despite his dynamic history, the draw of the Liberace Museum has been eclipsed by some of Vegas' increasingly lavish attractions. Low attendance is the primary factor in the decision to close the museum, Liberace Foundation President Jack Rappaport said. Liberace himself opened the museum in 1979, and in its prime, it brought in 450,000 visitors a year. ""We've dwindled down to 50,000,"" Rappaport said. He blames the low attendance on the museum's location three miles off Las Vegas Boulevard, commonly known as the Strip. ""We are just geographically not desirable,"" he said. [When the museum opened in 1979] we weren't competition for the Strip. We actually complemented the Strip."" Rappaport feels that the megaresort style of the new casinos of Las Vegas -- with high-end shopping, an abundance of restaurants, shows and other museum-type attractions -- gives tourists everything they could need. ""It's kind of like going to Disney World or Disneyland resort. You go there, and you don't really have to go anywhere else."" If there is a bright side, it's that since the closing was announced weeks ago, attendance has nearly tripled, according to one tour guide's estimate. A significant number of this influx are locals who've lived in Vegas for decades but never made it to the museum. But positive attendance news in the 11th hour doesn't change the fact that for most of the 23 employees, not only will they be out of a job, they'll be out of a way to educate people on a man they've come to admire. ""I mean, [Liberace] was Las Vegas,"" museum director Tanya Combs said. ""Reading everything and seeing everything ... you start to believe in what a nice man he was, and you really wanted everyone to know that."" Museum archivist and historian Pauline Lachance has been the go-to gal for anything and everything Liberace. ""He's made such an impact on my life; it's unbelievable. I get kind of choked up talking about him,"" she said. She could tell you about all sorts of things, from ""Walter"" Valentino Liberace's early life as a piano prodigy to his prime years as the highest-paid entertainer in the world, with the highest flamboyance factor to boot. He was a man who, in the midst of a battle with HIV, sold out New York's Radio City Music Hall so fast that his record still stands. Lachance's very first experience with Mr. Showmanship himself was a night that almost didn't happen. ""I really didn't want to go,"" she recalls of the show her husband roped her into attending. But that evening sparked a passion, some might say obsession, for the king of bling. Up until his death in 1987 at 67, she attended no fewer than 50 of his shows. ""All you need to do is go to one performance, and you want to go to every one after that. He just captivates you with his charm and his music."" After the museum closes Sunday, Lachance will continue to work for the Liberace Foundation part-time. But there will be no more camera-wielding visitors oohing and aahing over Liberace's rhinestone-studded piano, complete with matching costume and Roadster. See an iReporter's snapshots of the glitzy museum . The musician's remarkable costumes became more elaborate as the decades went on, some taking more than a year to construct. Throughout his career, he played eight major hotels in Las Vegas, with his longest run at the Las Vegas Hilton. In addition to establishing the museum in Vegas, Liberace set up a foundation to provide scholarship money to students of the arts. To date, the foundation has given more than $6 million to more than 2,700 students. But what it's able to offer these days has diminished significantly. Two years ago, the scholarship fund amounted to $112,000. The following year, that number dropped to $62,000. Rappaport said people can rest assured that the museum's collection -- which includes more than 60 of Liberace's intricate eye-popping costumes, his 9-foot mirrored Baldwin grand piano and his 7-foot rhinestone studded Baldwin grand -- won't go into hiding for too long. A traveling tour of part of the collection is planned. The tour might be under way as early as summer 2011, according to Jeffrey Koep, chairman of the Liberace Foundation board of directors. A new incarnation of the museum isn't out of the question. ""The board felt it best to close while we are still solvent and create a new business plan as we examine ways to sell our current location and search for locations that would allow for more patrons,"" Koep said in an e-mail. Tour guide Howard Shapiro said he wasn't terribly surprised that the museum in its current form won't be around forever, but he agrees that Liberace is too much a part of Sin City to be totally forgotten. ""Las Vegas has a history of tearing down and not preserving. It's a sad commentary, but that's what this town is about, reinventing itself,"" Shapiro said. ""I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere down the line, Liberace gets reinvented again. By whom and how, I don't know. But it is sad to see it close.""","Liberace Museum in Las Vegas, Nevada, is closing Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Australia got its first Catholic saint Sunday, a feisty 19th-century nun who was briefly excommunicated when her colleagues exposed an abusive priest. Mary MacKillop co-founded the Sisters of St. Joseph of the Sacred Heart in 1867, and gained a reputation as the first Australian nun to leave the cities and minister to the rural poor. Nuns in her order got evidence that a priest was engaged in ""scandalous behavior,"" according to the Rev. Paul Gardiner, who has spent decades researching MacKillop's life. The nuns reported it to the Rev. Julian Woods, MacKillop's first spiritual mentor who co-founded the Sisters of St. Joseph. Woods in turn reported the abuse to church authorities, resulting in the Rev. Ambrose Patrick Keating being sent back to Ireland from Kapunda, Australia. But Keating's friends ""were really upset with Father Woods and thought they could best get at him by getting at Mary,"" said Claire Larkin, the chair of the Mary MacKillop Centre in Penola, Australia. ""They told a lot of lies to the bishop,"" who excommunicated MacKillop and the entire order in 1871, she said. Bishop James Quinn revoked the excommunication five months later, on his deathbed, the order says in its biography of Mary MacKillop. But she still had to spend decades fighting local Catholic leaders for control of the order she founded. ""She was a charismatic entrepreneur,"" the Rev. Thomas Reese, author of ""Inside the Vatican,"" told CNN. ""She was a feminist before her time. She struggled in a male-dominated institution and got things done."" Her familiarity with church politics may have played a role in the instructions she issued to her nuns when women got the vote in Australia. ""It is the duty on us all to vote ... Get advice from some leading man in whom you have confidence or from the priest, but keep your voting secret,"" she wrote in 1903. The order grew to include 300 nuns in Australia and New Zealand by 1891, its website says, and now has about 1,200 members. She died in 1909 and was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1995. The Catholic Church credits her with miraculously helping to cure a woman named Kathleen Evans of cancer. She took to wearing a piece of MacKillop's clothing pinned to her nightgown and asked her family and friends to pray for MacKillop to intervene with God on her behalf. Her cancer disappeared, Evans said in a statement. Pope Benedict XVI recognized the cure as a miracle in December 2009, and announced two months later that MacKillop would be canonized. He praised her ""courageous and saintly example of zeal, perseverance and prayer"" on Sunday in canonizing her as St. Mary of the Cross MacKillop. Some 4,000 people attended an outdoor mass Sunday to celebrate the canonization in Penola, where she started her ministry in a disused stable. ""It's so exciting, we've had a marvellous day,"" Larkin said from Penola. ""It's been a long journey"" to sainthood, she said. ""Her dream started in a little country outback town, to think that she's gotten that recognition.""","NEW: She was a feminist before her time, a Catholic author says .

"(CNN) -- Stargazers who were willing to give up a little sleep got to catch the last lunar eclipse of 2010 early Tuesday. The total lunar eclipse lasted about three and a half hours, starting as a partial eclipse about 1:33 a.m. ET and finishing at 5:01 a.m. ET, according to NASA. As a coincidence, the eclipse fell on the same date as the 2010 winter solstice. The last lunar eclipse to happen on the day of the winter solstice was in 1638. ""For eclipse watchers, this means that the moon will appear very high in the night sky, as the solstice marks the time when Earth's axial tilt is farthest away from the sun,"" NASA said. In areas with clear skies, only watchers across North America, Greenland and Iceland were able to see the eclipse. Those in western Europe could see the beginning stages before the moon set, and stargazers in western Asia saw the later stages after moonrise, according to NASA. Share your lunar eclipse images, videos . The Twitter universe was aglow as the eclipse reached its peak. ""Moon fully covered, appears red - very cool,"" said Adam Goodman in Toronto, Ontario. The weather didn't cooperate for everyone though. ""Thank you cloudy sky for ruining the eclipse for me, apparently I woke up 3 for no reason,"" Seth Pelletier in Utah tweeted. The most recent lunar eclipse occurred June 26. A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth lines up between the sun and the moon, blocking the sun's rays and casting its shadow on the moon, according to NASA. As the moon moves into the Earth's shadow, it appears to change color, turning from gray to orange or deep red. The new color stems from indirect sunlight that passes through Earth's atmosphere and casts a glow on the moon, NASA said. ""Our atmosphere filters out most of the blue colored light, leaving the red and orange hues,"" the agency said. Lunar eclipses differ from their solar counterparts, as no special equipment is needed for viewing. NASA will stream a live video feed of the eclipse from a camera mounted at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Tuesday was the last chance for those in the continental United States to see a total lunar ecllipse until April 15, 2014, according to NASA. CNN's Emmanuella Grinberg contributed to this report.","The eclipse was visible to North America, Greenland and Iceland .

"(CNN) -- A British couple kidnapped by pirates has been released after more than a year in captivity, Somali leaders said Sunday. Paul and Rachel Chandler were seized from their yacht in October last year, just after they set sail from the Seychelles Islands for Tanzania.

""So, please somebody get in touch. Otherwise we just sleepwalk to a tragic ending."" It was unclear whether a ransom was paid for their release. Last year, British officials refused to pay a ransom or negotiate with pirates. ""The government will not make substantive concessions for hostage takers, including the payments of ransom,"" the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- The worst secret in boxing is out of the bag: ""Sugar"" Shane Mosley is the most likely opponent for Manny Pacquiao's next fight. The 39-year-old American boxer used Twitter to announce that discussions between the two camps are at an advanced stage, with confirmation expected in the next 24 hours. ""Just excited about the fight with Pac [Manny Pacquiao]. I know you're going to be there,"" he tweeted to former world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis on the social networking website.

But in a subsequent interview with the Los Angeles Times, Mosley confirmed that he would meet with Pacquiao's representatives on Tuesday to finalize a deal. ""We've already discussed the fight about three to four weeks ago, so now we'll go over it again,"" said Mosley. ""Both sides just need to commit to what we've talked about and then I think we're done."" Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach had earlier ruled out Marquez while, at the same time, insisting on an important caveat if Mosley was indeed chosen. ""[Mosley] won't be an easy fight for Manny,"" Roach told assembled reporters in the Philippines, where he was celebrating Pacquiao's 32nd birthday. ""He can punch with either hand. But if the fight pushes through, I'll insist on a drug test. He's been known to take steroids and it shows in his body."" Marquez calls out Pacquiao for rematch .

But Mosley never tested positive, and denied knowing what it was or that it was illegal. ""I'm disappointed that this is coming out again, four years after I've been to the grand jury and gave my truthful testimony,"" Mosley said in a 2008 statement, issued after the allegations first came to light.

"(CNN) -- Five consumers who found shards of glass in their bags  of frozen vegetables set off what has become a national recall that the products' supplier is tracing to a single lot of peas. The packages were supplied by the Pictsweet Co. of Bells, Tennessee, and sold in Kroger grocery stores in the Southeast and Wal-Mart stores east of the Rocky Mountains. All carry the Kroger or Wal-Mart's Great Value brand, said Anne Tyrrell, spokeswoman for Pictsweet.. Tyrrell said the company became aware that glass was inside some packages of frozen vegetables after getting complaints from five consumers.

"(CNN) -- Chelsea's star striker Didier Drogba has been suffering from malaria, his club manager revealed on Tuesday, but the Ivory Coast player will still line up for the London derby against Fulham in the English Premier League on Wednesday. Drogba started on the bench for Chelsea's 2-0 defeat to Liverpool on Sunday, having missed recent matches against Aston Villa and Spartak Moscow due to a suspected virus. However, the results of blood tests showed that he had in fact contracted the tropical disease. ""A test showed malaria,"" Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti told his club's official website. ""He lost his condition, he lost power. ""Didier had a difficulty to train because he didn't feel good, he didn't have power to train. He was unselfish to play also when he was not 100 percent."" But the Italian said Drogba was now back to health and would be fit for the league leaders' home clash with Fulham on Wednesday. ""He suffered obviously but after treatment, he will be better,"" Ancelotti said. ""One time it was serious, now there is the possibility to treat and come back well. He is okay. Tomorrow he will play."" Ancelotti said Ghana midfielder Michael Essien would return to the Chelsea line-up, having missed the Liverpool game with a toe problem, but Frank Lampard is not yet ready to make his long-awaited return. The England midfielder, who has been sidelined following a hernia operation, is scheduled to make his comeback against Sunderland on Sunday. ""Lampard has been training with us and he is good. He is able to play; he is fit because he worked very hard physically,"" Ancelotti said. ""Physically he is 100 percent -- he just has to be comfortable to play with the ball and with his teammates.' Meanwhile, second-placed Manchester United have been hit by illness and injury ahead of Wednesday's local derby at Manchester City. United's website reported on Tuesday that manager Alex Ferguson had yet to finalize his line-up, with several players having been sent home from training. ""So we're not in a great position at the moment. Hopefully tomorrow we're better, but there seems to be a lingering aspect of this virus going around and there's nothing we can do about it. We've a strong squad and we just carry on,"" Ferguson said. United will be without injured midfielders Nani, Owen Hargreaves and veteran Ryan Giggs. Giggs will miss a Manchester derby for the first time since making his senior debut, the UK Press Association reported, ending a club-record run of 33 appearances against City.

"(CNN) -- After all the celebrating, overeating and overdrinking with friends and family, sitting down quietly with a good book could be just the thing you need. Sure, you could turn to the old holiday standbys, but if you want to think outside the Christmas box, here are 10 great nontraditional books for holiday-themed reading: . 1. ""Pat Hobby Stories"" F. Scott Fitzgerald spent his last years in Hollywood, working on an unfinished final novel and screenplays that didn't go anywhere. His ""Pat Hobby Stories,"" wry and winning tales of a washed-up screenwriter who just never learns, suggest he never stopped learning or lost his sense of humor. The first, ""Pat Hobby's Christmas Wish,"" has him attempting to blackmail a producer into a promotion on the day before Christmas. 2. ""A Likely Story"" We find another writer with Christmas headaches in Donald Westlake's ""A Likely Story."" Westlake is best known for his crime novels; here he goes in a different direction, with a very funny story about families in the age of divorce. Tom Diskant is doing his best to sort out a complicated personal life while trying to keep his glossy publishing project, ""The Christmas Book,"" on track. Both go wrong in unexpected ways. 3. ""Last Night at the Lobster"" In ""Last Night at the Lobster,"" Stewart O'Nan gives us all the small details that make up a day's work in a popular franchise restaurant. It's just before Christmas, and we share the regrets, hopes and best intentions of the beleaguered manager after corporate tells him to shut the place down. 4. ""P.S. Your Cat Is Dead"" James Kirkwood won a Tony and a Pulitzer for ""A Chorus Line,"" but his comic novel, ""P.S. Your Cat Is Dead,"" has its own devoted following. It's New Year's Eve when Jimmy, a just-dumped, out-of-work actor, catches Vito breaking into his apartment. It's his third break-in, and Jimmy's had enough. He decides to hold Vito responsible for everything that's gone wrong. The two hit it off, though, and over the course of a long night, things get stranger and gayer and better. 5. ""I Remember"" You can find a more traditional holiday in Joe Brainard's ""I Remember."" The episodic memoir from the New York-school poet is filled with simple striking moments recalled from the sort of middle-American childhood that we all miss, whether we had one or not. 6. ""Santa Claus: A Biography"" There's no bigger Christmas celebrity than Santa Claus. But like most celebrities, we only think we know him. Gerry Bowler's sprightly cultural history, ""Santa Claus: A Biography, examines his origins and evolution. The book suggests there's still hope for Santa, despite the corporate spokesperson and entertainment icon he's been turned into today. 7. ""Wise Blood"" Of course, there's one bigger name in Christmas, the one people say gets forgotten amidst all the parties and wrapping paper. In Flannery O'Connor's ""Wise Blood,"" Hazel Motes wants to forget about Jesus and sin and salvation so badly that he takes to the streets, preaching the gospel of the Church Without Christ. The more he insists, though, the more we don't believe him. Southern gothic at its finest. 8. ""An Atheist's Guide to Christmas"" Genuine atheists have to make it through the holidays too, and they aren't confused about what they really believe. They aren't necessarily as angry as you'd think from the current crop of Big Atheism books, either. The writers who contributed to ""An Atheist's Guide to Christmas"" are in a friendlier and funnier mood and remain consistently thoughtful and entertaining. Edited by Robin Harvie and Stephanie Meyers. 9. ""Doomsday Book"" The time-traveling historians in Connie Willis' award-winning science fiction novel, ""Doomsday Book,"" don't have religion on their minds as the holidays come to Oxford University in 2054. Something's gone wrong, and a young grad student is stranded back in a dangerous, plague-ravaged 14th-century England. Willis makes the otherness of medieval society disconcertingly real. 10. ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"" Things weren't all plagues and suffering back then, though. ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"" is a tricky, playful 14th-century tale, one of the great stories of chivalry. It starts when the mysterious Green Knight crashes a sumptuous holiday feast at King Arthur's court. He proposes a Christmas game to the best and the brightest of Camelot: ""Any one of you can try to chop off my head,"" he says, ""and if I survive, a year from now, you must let me chop off yours."" What could possibly go wrong?","Instead of reading the standby holiday books, try 10 great nontraditional books .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli authorities are investigating whether the attack that left an American woman dead and her friend injured was ""nationalistic,"" a police spokesman said Monday, using a term for crimes in which a victim is targeted based on an Arab or Israeli background. American Kristine Luken died in the attack. Her body was found Sunday after Kay Susan Wilson, Luken's friend and co-worker at a Christian ministry, stumbled into a picnic area with her hands bound, bleeding from multiple stab wounds and asking for help. Wilson told authorities the two were hiking in a forest near Beit Shemesh, west of Jerusalem, when two men attacked them, tied them to a tree and stabbed them, according to police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld. Wilson told reporters from her hospital bed Sunday that one of the men was armed with a long serrated knife and that she believes they were Arab. ""It was clear that they came to kill,"" the Israeli newspaper Haaretz quoted Wilson as saying. ""Who carries around a knife like that?"" Wilson said she was wearing a Star of David on a necklace when she was attacked, according to the newspaper. ""He took it off like a gentleman and then turned me around and stabbed in the place where the Star of David had been,"" Haaretz quoted her as saying. Rosenfeld confirmed Monday that investigators' primary focus is that the attacks may have involved nationalistic intent, but he said investigators have not yet completely ruled out other possibilities. Luken and Wilson both worked for CMJ UK, a Christian ministry based in England. Wilson, a British citizen living in Israel, was a senior tour guide for the group, according to a statement posted to the group's website by its CEO, Robin Aldridge. Luken was an administrator for the group and had recently taken over responsibility for managing the group's tour operations in Israel, Aldridge said. ""She had a beautiful and gentle spirit as well as a strong and vibrant faith,"" Aldridge said of Luken. ""She loved Israel and had visited on several occasions both as a tourist and as a member of CMJ."" ""It is a tragedy that such a lively, caring and faith-filled person should have been struck down in such a way,"" he said. The Foreign Office in London said it was ""aware of the hospitalization of a British national"" and was ready to provide assistance if needed. Luken had worked for CMJ UK for one year, having previously been a government employee, according to Aldridge. ""She had to cope with a move to a new country as well as a new job but quickly made the adjustment and became a key member of our team,"" Aldridge said. He said the group's work sharing the Christian faith with the Jewish people in Israel would continue despite the attack.","NEW: Police confirm they are focusing on whether the attack was ""nationalistic""

"(CNN) -- The Kroger Co. is recalling select pet food packages from stores in 19 states fearing some of these products may contain aflatoxin, a toxic chemical byproduct that could be harmful to animals. The recall involves certain bags of Pet Pride Cat Food, Pet Pride Kitten Food, Old Yeller Chunk Dog Food, Kroger Value Cat Food and Kroger Value Chunk Food, the company said Saturday. The Kroger Co. urged customers to immediately consult with their veterinarian if their animals show any signs of sluggishness or lethargy combined with a reluctance to eat. A yellowish tint to the eyes or gums, severe blood or diarrhea are also warning signs, the company said. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), Aflatoxin is a fungal toxin that contaminates maize and other types of crops during production, harvest storage or processing. The company has set up a Customer Recall Notification system to help customers determine whether they have purchased any of the contaminated products. Most of recalled products have an expiration date of October 23 and 24, 2011.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The recent recovery of one of his stolen trophies and several scrapbook items at a Los Angeles park left tennis legend Pete Sampras ""a little more optimistic"" that the rest of his coveted memorabilia will soon be found, his agent said Monday. Thieves last month broke into a public storage facility that the 14-time Grand Slam titleholder was renting as he and his family moved from their Thousand Oaks, California, estate to nearby Brentwood. Afterward, Sampras learned that 51 of his 64 championship trophies -- including one marking his first Australian Open cup -- were among the coveted items stolen. His agent, Grant Chen, said authorities contacted Sampras after one of those trophies and several other items were found late last week at the Griffith Park Recreation Center in Los Angeles. The park, one of the nation's largest situated south of Burbank and west of Glendale, is about 20 miles east of the West Los Angeles storage site from which the trophies were stolen. Los Angeles Department of Parks and Recreation spokeswoman Andrea Epstein declined to comment on the find, referring inquiries to Los Angeles Police. That office would not talk about the investigation. Sampras and his wife Bridgette Wilson-Sampras, an actress, recently listed their Thousand Oaks property, which is on the grounds of the Sherwood Country Club, for sale at $25 million. ""The moving company we hired is very well trusted, and we've used them before,"" said Chen, who helped the Sampras family -- including sons Christian, 8, and Ryan, 5 -- pack and move. ""Only a few people knew the contents of the 50 to 60 tightly sealed boxes that we stored."" Sampras can account for all but one of the 14 Grand Slam trophies -- given for his wins at the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. Most of them Sampras brought personally to his new home, while he loaned his 1993 Wimbledon men's singles trophy, 1997 Australian men's singles title and one Davis Cup trophy to the Nike headquarters in Oregon. The only one stolen was his 1994 Australian Grand Slam title, said Chen. Steven Glick, a spokesman for Public Storage in West Los Angeles, told CNN that his company is ""fully cooperating"" with  investigators, but he declined to elaborate. Sampras, 39, was awarded five season-ending Association of Tennis Professional World Tour trophies and six trophies for finishing No. 1 in the world from 1993 to 1998. Those valuables, as well as seven ESPY awards, two Davis Cup medallions and an Olympic ring, were among those stolen from two rental units, Chen said. In addition to his titles, Chen said thieves took framed photographs of Sampras with Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, as well as some personal letters written by Bush. Other stolen items included a piano bench signed by singer Elton John and a signed guitar from Carlos Santana. Sampras, who grew up in Southern California, defeated Andre Agassi at the 2002 U.S. Open before retiring the following year with the most Grand Slam wins in tennis history. Roger Federer later surpassed his record with 16 major titles. ""Sampras pleaded with the public as a last resort, (hoping) that someone will offer a tip or come forward,"" said Chen. ""Those stolen items represent memories of a lifetime, and Pete wants nothing more than to share those memories with his sons.""","Pete Sampras is ""a little more optimistic"" his stolen mementos will be found, his agent says .

"Pristina, Kosovo (CNN) -- Kosovo's prime minster lashed out at critics Monday over a recent report alleging that officials may have stolen organs from prisoners of war and political rivals, calling it ""pure fabrication."" European authorities charged in a report released last week that executives who control the country may have stolen organs when the Kosovo Liberation Army was fighting Serbian forces in the late 1990s. ""It is a political accusation based on no facts or proof,"" Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said. ""Therefore, it is a pure fabrication."" The report says Thaci, a former leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army, was the ""boss"" of a prominent faction in the militia that ""apparently wrested control"" of ""illicit criminal enterprises"" from rivals across the border in Albania. ""Numerous indications seem to confirm that ... organs were removed from some prisoners ... to be taken abroad for transplantation,"" read the report. It suggested that illegal organ trafficking continued after the war ended. And links between ""criminal activity"" and ""certain KLA militia leaders ... has continued, albeit in other forms, until today,"" the report charges. Thaci said he is looking into all legal and political possibilities to correct what he sees as the report's inaccuracies. It was not immediately clear what action he planned to take. ""It is a lie for which Dick Marty will be accountable,"" the prime minister said of the author of the draft report. Nearly 1,900 people who disappeared during the conflict still have not been found, and another 500 disappeared after NATO troops arrived in June 1999, according to Marty. The report is based partially on investigations by European Union officials and was written for the Council of Europe's Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights. European Union officials in Kosovo have said that anyone with concrete evidence of war crimes or organized crime should step forward. Kosovo was a province of Serbia but declared independence in 2008. About 70 countries have recognized the declaration, but Serbia does not, and international organizations including the United Nations and European Union continue to have administrators in Kosovo. The Council of Europe, an organization with 47 member countries, seeks to promote democracy and human rights. The council's parliament plans to debate the report in January. ""This (report) of course is a blow (for Kosovo), but this challenge will be overcome because it has nothing in common with the truth, and the truth is that Kosovo is a story of success,"" Thaci said.","Prime Minister Hashim Thaci says the report is ""pure fabrication""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- -- The mother of a 24-year-old California woman whose decomposed remains were found in Malibu Canyon in August said Monday she believes her daughter was murdered and asked that the coroner exhume the remains and the FBI crime lab examine her clothing. Mitrice Richardson was last seen leaving a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lost Hills/Malibu station in September 2009 after being detained by deputies on a citizen's arrest complaint made by a restaurant manager. She was missing for 11 months until her remains were discovered by park rangers searching an area of the Santa Monica Mountains for marijuana fields, authorities said. Sheriff Lee Baca said last August that authorities had ""no indication of a homicide,"" but Latice Sutton, 46, Richardson's mother, said she and a forensic anthropologist with the Los Angeles-based nonprofit Missing Persons Identification Resource Center disagree with the sheriff. Sutton says evidence wasn't analyzed . The Los Angeles County coroner already has agreed with Sutton's request that medical examiner personally visit the remote area where deputies retrieved Richardson's remains, said Clea Koff, a forensic anthropologist with the resource center, who's working with Sutton. And Baca has agreed to meet with Sutton on December 29, Sutton said. For the FBI crime lab to examine Richardson's clothing, the sheriff has to request their involvement, she said. But Sutton said she isn't satisfied that her daughter's death has been investigated thoroughly. She held a news conference at a Los Angeles church Monday to highlight her crusade. ""Today is the day I'm going public and I've announced some of the hidden facts that people are not aware of so that they can understand why I'm pushing that Mitrice's case be looked at as a homicide case,"" Sutton told CNN. Sutton, of La Verne, California, is an operation manager at a Boys and Girls Club of San Bernardino. Richardson's father, Michael Richard, has acknowledged that his daughter was in a troubled mental condition the evening of her arrest for allegedly being unable to pay $89.51 for food and drink at a Malibu restaurant. The woman's remains were found about eight miles from the sheriff's station, in the Monte Nido section of the Santa Monica Mountains, which bisect Los Angeles, Richardson's mother said. ""Mel Gibson gets driven to his car, and Charlie Sheen gets taken to his house,"" the father said last August, referring to practices by law officers in Malibu. Richardson was just released, though she was in a manic state, Koff said. Sutton cited several circumstances about her daughter's skeletal remains and mummified arm that made the mother believe her daughter was murdered. Sutton said the mummified arm was bent in a way that would made if difficult for floodwater or other acts of nature to wash clothing off the body. Richardson's bra was found unsnapped and her pants unzipped several hundred feet away from the remains, the mother said. Her underwear, shoes and shirt were never recovered, the mother said. Koff, the forensic anthropologist who has worked for the United Nations' international criminal tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, examined Richardson's remain at Sutton's request prior to burial. She said that metallic jewelry and man-made artifacts were found in Richardson's hair, but the coroner's exam didn't examine those materials sufficiently. Koff claimed that the pupae casings -- the eggs from which maggots hatch -- found on the remains were never tested to determine if the insects were consistent with the area in which the remains were found. ""We believe that it is imperative that the coroner complete the examination,"" Koff said.","Mitrice Richardson went missing after she left a Los Angeles County Sheriff's station .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Gas and oil prices rose in Iran Monday after the country dramatically cut subsidies for its citizens to bolster the nation's sagging economy. The initiative went into effect Sunday, with the country saying it will gradually remove all subsidies within five years. The price of subsidized gasoline rose four-folds -- from 1,000 rials (9 cents) per liter to 4,000 rials, the Mehr news agency said. Officials say energy subsidies have cost the Iranian government around $100 billion dollars a year, state run Press TV said Monday. While some have said the plan will stoke inflation, others say it is in line with recommendations from international financial organizations to solve Iran's economic woes, Press TV said. Five years ago, Ahmadinejad's government announced its plan to cut government subsidies and help adjust prices in Iran's economy. That includes a policy to phase out subsidies on staples such as fuel and food, likely causing consumers' costs of such items to rise. Iran has $10 trillion in oil resources alone, plus natural gas reserves worth between $3.5 and $4.5 trillion, International Monetary Fund mission chief Dominique Guillaume said in an interview posted earlier this fall on that world body's website. But its economy nonetheless has seen lackluster growth, including between 1% and 2% of GDP this past year. Despite its abundance of fuel, Iran has been pushing to expand its nuclear program. Many in the international community, including U.S. officials, have expressed grave concerns and successfully pushed for sanctions fearing that Tehran might be trying to develop nuclear weapons. But Iranian leaders have said the nation wants nuclear power, in part to free up more oil to export and pump more money into the economy. With subsidies that effectively allowed domestic consumers to pay relatively little for oil and gas -- far below what they or people anywhere else would pay on the world market -- Iran was forfeiting potentially huge revenues, explained IMF Senior Economist Roman Zytek on his group's website. The IRNA news agency reported Saturday that Iranians' use of commodities like fuel ""has not followed a reasonable pattern"" -- with Zytek saying that many Iranian citizens have been buying excess amounts of oil and gas. Iran's subsidy reforms, he said, aim to decrease domestic demand for fuel, make the country more fuel-efficient, and allow Iran to profit more from its natural resources.","The country plans to remove all subsidies in five years .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Southern California faces another water-logged day Wednesday with renewed threats of flash flooding, especially in San Diego county. The National Weather Service is forecasting rainfall rates of up to 2 inches per hour, which could prompt flooding in the San Bernardino, Santa Ana and Palomar Mountains, and along the Orange County coastal plains. On Tuesday, storm-weary Californians slogged through another day of record-breaking snow, rain and flooding from a series of storms that prompted an emergency declaration from the state's governor. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's proclamation covers Kern, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Luis Obispo and Tulare counties in southern California. The declaration warns that the forecast calls for ""extraordinary and continuing rainfall"" that is likely to cause more flooding and landslides in the region and authorizes state assistance to local authorities. The five-day rain total has topped 10 inches in many areas, with much heavier amounts in some locales.  More than 21 inches has fallen on Twin Peaks in San Bernardino county, with Twin Creek receiving nearly 20 inches. In Orange County, authorities were on the scene after a mudslide affecting homes in the Silverado Canyon area, the county's Fire Authority said on Twitter. Rescues were needed, and evacuations were underway, according to the Fire Authority. In Los Angeles County, meanwhile, authorities ordered the evacuation of more than 230 homes in two neighborhoods out of fear of debris flows. Of the 232 homes ordered evacuated in the La Canada Flintridge and La Crescenta areas, however, only one family evacuated, said Nicole Nishida, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The area is a concern because it is below an area burned in the 2009 Station fire. Fires burn vegetation holding the soil in place, leaving the soil more likely to dislodge after heavy rains. One resident wary of the potential for mudslides was  Donna McLaughlin of La Canada Flintridge who lost her home last year when a 10-foot wall of mud came barreling down a hillside. She just moved back in October. ""Here we go again,"" she told CNN affiliate KABC. But this time, the city has bolted down protective concrete barriers and attached them to each other in the area in an effort to guard against mudslides. McLaughlin said the barriers were not bolted down or attached last year. ""Had they done that, our house would have at least been saved,"" she told KABC. Streets in downtown Laguna Beach were closed Wednesday because of extensive flooding, KABC reported. In southwestern Utah, a dam that authorities had feared was in imminent danger of giving way to floodwaters was found to be in stronger condition than previously believed, said Marc Mortensen, a spokesman for Washington County. The roughly 800 residents of the towns of Virgin and Rockville were allowed to return to their homes Tuesday night, Mortensen said. Engineers will monitor the dam, located on the Virgin River, and conduct more tests Wednesday, when high water flows are expected again, he said. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert said he was prepared to declare a state of emergency in the south, where floodwaters also washed out at least one bridge. But as of Tuesday afternoon, Utah officials said the required benchmarks for an emergency declaration had not been reached, and Herbert hadn't received a request from local authorities to issue one. ""We are closely monitoring the activity in southern Utah, and praying for the safety of all of the area's residents,"" Herbert said in a statement from his office. Flash flood warnings were also in effect for western Arizona. In Southern California, where the car is king, a record number of motorists called their local auto club to report dead batteries, a need for emergency tows and crashed vehicles, said spokesman Jeffrey Spring of the Automobile Club of Southern California. More than 25,000 distraught motorists made calls for help on Monday, the largest number ever in a 24-hour period for the AAA's largest U.S. affiliate, Spring said. ""We're in Southern California, and we don't have a lot of experience driving in the rain, and some people drive through high puddles not realizing what kind of effect it can have on a car,"" Spring said. ""If the engine gets splashed and gets wet, it can stop the car right there."" Spring said AAA was ""able to serve the majority of members in 30 minutes,"" although he added, ""I'm sure there were a number of people who had to wait longer than that."" Monday's call volume surpassed the prior record of about 22,000 on October 9, 2008, when a heat wave and the scorching Santa Ana winds disabled many automobiles, Spring said. Monday's weather -- torrential rains -- had opposite conditions, he said. ""Batteries are fickle things if they're not at full strength,"" Spring said. ""Hot weather can affect them and weather like this."" In the southern Sierra Nevada, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks were effectively shut down Monday and Tuesday because flooding, mudslides and rockslides closed the two roads into the parks, said Brandy Frederich, assistant general manager of Wuksachi Lodge in Sequoia National Park. In fact, the 102-room lodge was vacant Tuesday after the last couple of guests departed Monday, Frederich said. ""Well, we're all up here,"" Frederich said of the hotel staff. ""We would be open if the road is open. It's gorgeous right now. Up here, it finally turned to snow."" But the rain at lower elevations washed out the two roads, she said. Deborah Craigo, 39, who lives in the Mojave Desert community of Hesperia, California, said monsoon conditions have inundated the arid landscape. Fire stations are even offering sandbags to residents who want to shore up defenses to their homes, said Craigo, who is also a CNN iReporter. ""It's been raining from two days ago and it just has not stopped. They closed a lot of the roads down,"" said Craigo, a mother and college student. ""It's pretty bad now. We have a riverbed in back of our house, and two days ago it was completely bone dry. And then within two days the riverbed is completely full."" In Orange County, California, four hikers whose truck was stranded by floodwater between two canyon roads were airlifted out Tuesday morning and were reported to be doing well, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. The four had been stranded overnight. Five other people were rescued in the same area Monday evening, the station said. A bulldozer was used to help get them to safety, it said. Elsewhere, 40 horses were rescued from Riverside County as water rose to heights of about 4 feet, affiliate KCAL reported. The storm is actually a series of storms originating in the Pacific, known as the ""Pineapple Express"" because of their origin near the Hawaiian Islands. They have brought heavy snow to the higher elevations, with torrential rainfall in lower spots, and high winds. Total rainfall has approached 10 inches in some areas. Numerous roads were closed because of mudslides or flooding. And as much as 13 feet of snow had fallen in the Sierra Nevada as of Tuesday, according to CNN Meteorologist Rob Marciano. ""We get a lot of snow here, but not usually this much in a 24-hour period,"" said CNN iReporter Sarah Butner, who is visiting family in Mammoth Lakes, California. The area has received about 9 feet of snow, she said Monday. ""The decks have a good 5 feet of snow on them,"" she said. One area of the neighborhood was also flooded, she said. In Arvin, California, near Lamont, Caliente Creek  washed away land near one home. Hugo Figueroa, who lives there, said he and his family were told to evacuate, CNN affiliate KBAK reported. Flooding washed out several roads near Lamont and Arvin, the station reported. High winds also whipped much of the state, particularly at high elevations. Peak wind gusts reached 152 mph in Alpine Meadows summit in northern California, the weather service reported. Mudslides forced officials to close a portion of State Route 1, also known as the Pacific Coast Highway, in Ventura County from just north of the Los Angeles County line to Oxnard, according to the California Department of Transportation. The Pacific Coast Highway was also closed north of Santa Barbara due to flooding. A mudslide also closed a portion of State Route 41 in San Luis Obispo County. A stretch of State Route 34 in the Oxnard area was closed because of flooding. The danger of mudslides will probably intensify, CNN meteorologist Ivan Cabrera said. ""A serious situation will develop now with the mudslide danger that will continue over the next several days,"" Cabrera said Monday. Another danger: Falling trees. Erik Budzinski of Orange told KABC he is heartsick after his vintage 1970 Ford F-150 truck was crushed by a large tree Monday night. ""It was my baby,"" he said. Budzinski said he was inside his home and heard the wood cracking and popping as the tree fell. ""I just knew it,"" he said. Still, many southern Californians were not deterred from holiday shopping by the rain, although the rain-slicked roads had led to thousands of accidents. ""It's a little scary to be driving with this much rain, but I'm going to deal with it,"" Adriena Young told KABC. ""It's better than a drought."" CNN's Jeremy Ryan, Sara Pratley, Nick Valencia, Michael Martinez, Ed Payne, Sara Weisfeldt and Daphne Sashin contributed to this report.","NEW: Reported mudslide affects homes in Orange County .

"(CNN) -- Tashard Choice recently had a great opportunity to pick up a nice present for his 3-year-old nephew. The Dallas Cowboys running back went up to Michael Vick after a game and asked for his autograph. Well, that kind of blew up in his face. Here he was, just trying to do a nice thing for a child, and people get all crazy upset, just because Vick plays on the other team. In a sign of the times, Choice even felt it necessary to apologize on Twitter. Here's hoping that if you go out to get a sports memorabilia gift this holiday season you deal with a lot less criticism. But you might feel some heat. After all, there are some cool items, but they can be pricey, especially if someone like Vick signs his name to them. We'll help you sort through the many sites that sell sports items and point you toward a few things we might even include on our wish list. It's understandable why Choice's nephew wanted Vick's signature. He's one of the hottest athletes in the country right now, likely leading Philadelphia to the NFL playoffs. If you hunt around the internet, you can find several sites selling a jersey, even one selling one he wore during his college career. The most popular jersey would be the one he wears now, No. 7 for the Philadelphia Eagles. Or you could go for the autographed Eagles' jersey. That one is $592 at Fans Edge. Or you could save a little coin and get one from the Falcons (the team he played for until he went to prison for his role in a deadly dogfighting operation) for the sale price of $125. Want a less controversial quarterback? Tom Brady's New England top is $760 in blue and $1,049 in white. If the person you are buying for digs historical baseball moments, he or she might like a ball autographed by pitcher Armando Galarraga and the umpire who cost him his perfect game, Jim Joyce. The grace each showed after Joyce's blown call is an example of sportsmanship most fans will talk about for years. One ball, $573. It's a souvenir commemorating a moment that hadn't happened before and probably won't again. While neither of those men seem likely candidates for the Hall of Fame, Andre Dawson is one of the all-time greats and is part of the 2011 class that will be enshrined in Cooperstown. He was widely admired by all baseball fans during his 21-year career. You can get an autographed Cubs replica jersey at Tristar Productions for $259. (You'll have to pay extra to get it in a frame.) One of the most exciting moments of the sports year -- at least for U.S. soccer fans and even bandwagon fans -- came at the World Cup, when in its final group game the United States needed a goal to move into the prestigious round of 16. All-time leading scorer Landon Donovan pounced in the last minute, sending bars and offices across the country into scenes of pandemonium. SportsMemorablia.com has a few autographed photos of Donovan and his teammates celebrating what is one of the signature moments in U.S. men's soccer history for $263. Hockey fans will long remember the exciting Olympics men's final, won by Canada when Sidney Crosby scored in overtime. NHL Auctions has some Team Canada jerseys, including one signed by Ryan Getzlaf ($229). If you want one, bid soon, as that auction ends Monday. NASCAR fans are fiercely loyal. But if you are giving to someone and you don't know who his or her favorite driver is, you probably can't go wrong with a Jimmie Johnson die cast. Johnson won his fifth consecutive championship this season and die casts are cool small-scale replicas of the cars used in races. If you go to Johnson's Team Lowe's site, there are many cars to choose from, including cars from previous years and cars with the various color schemes used throughout the year. Want something that might make a cool addition to the home office or the man cave? Consider seats from stadiums that met their demise. For instance a pair of seats from old Yankee Stadium will cost you $1,500 at Steiner Sports. Steiner also has seats (or parts) from the Meadowlands and Wrigley Field. But let's go big. Say you have a blank check, and the fan who has almost everything. Well, Babe Ruth collectibles are some of the most sought after sports items on the planet. Sports Memorabilia offers five bats from the Sultan of Swat at $125,253 (and 50 cents). They were used in games at the time he was being sold from the Red Sox to the Yankees and making the transition from pitcher to right field. If that price is too steep, the company offers a store model bat for just $964. Still too much? They also have a Babe Ruth card by Topps from 2009 for $17. While we're at it, everyone loves a good sports movie. Look how much bank the film ""The Blind Side"" took in at the box office. So, while it may not qualify specifically as ""sports"" memorabilia, you could also buy a prop or costume from the hit film. Premiere Props in El Segundo, California, offers more than 100 items from the film, including a green Crusaders jersey worn by Quinton Aaron for $799.99. His stunt double's uniform is just $599. Other items range from $14.99 to $1,599.","Sports paraphernalia is more than just the Topps baseball card these days .

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- Anna Chapman, one of the Russian sleeper agents deported by the United States in last summer's spy swap, will be giving the dour face of Russian political life a bit of flash and glamour. Chapman was elected to the public board of the pro-government The Young Guard of United Russia on Wednesday, according to Russian news agency reports. The organization, which is the youth branch of Russia's ruling United Russia party, held a congress in Moscow on its fifth anniversary and reshuffled its leadership. The country's powerful prime minister, Vladimir Putin, is chairman of the United Russia which controls more than two-thirds of seats in the Russian parliament, the State Duma, as well as most local legislatures across the country. Chapman is one of the 10 Russian spies in the United States swapped last July in exchange for four Russian prisoners -- a transfer that conjured the politics and tensions during the Cold War. Chapman, perhaps the most famous of the 10 Russians, has been relentlessly covered by international media and portrayed as a glamorous spy. In her new role, Chapman addressed the congress's participants, according to Interfax. ""So many people are hunting after power, glory and money,"" she was quoted as saying. ""But does all that make us more happy? Maybe all we really need is something more human and positive?"" ""There would be much less negative things in the society if each of us would wake up with a smile and be happy about a new day, when one can create something new and useful,"" she said. Interfax and state-run news agency RIA-Novosti reported that Chapman rushed out of the congress hall right after her short speech without speaking to journalists who chased her all the way to the exit. RIA-Novosti said they were asking her about why she joined The Young Guard and what she plans to do in her new position. But Chapman didn't respond to any questions, RIA-Novosti said.","Chapman was elected to the Young Guard of United Russia board .

"(CNN) -- A 35-year-old Florida blasting inspector is presumed dead after the ground at a mine collapsed Thursday, sending him plummeting into a lime rock pit, police said. Kenneth James Stephens Jr. was working as a supervising contractor at Austin Powder Company as it detonated ammonia nitrate at the Mid Coast Aggregates mine in Webster, Florida, Sumter County Sheriff's Office Lt. Bobby Caruthers said by e-mail. After the controlled explosion, the earth collapsed beneath Stephens when he was about 30 feet from the blast site. He fell into a water-filled pit about 100 yards across, Caruthers said. Alerted shortly after noon, police arrived and initially saw no sign of the victim at the surface, nor did a police helicopter surveying the area from above. A crane lowered a pontoon, containing a dive team, into the pit to look for Stephens -- though, as of 6:30 p.m., his body had not been located. Recovery personnel have begun the next step in their effort, building a berm, likely out of limestone, to seal off the area where Stephens fell from the rest of the pit. When that's complete, they will pump out the water in hopes of finding the victim's body. Representatives from the Occupational and Safety Health Administration and the Mining Safety and Health Administration are on site, Caruthers said. He added that Austin Powder claims it has never had an accident like this since being founded in 1833, and that the sheriff's office has never responded to such an incident at this mine. Stephens, a resident of Beverly Hills, Florida, had participated in more than 1,000 controlled blasts in his 11 years at the Austin Powder Company, said Caruthers.","NEW: Police haven't found a 35-year-old Florida man who fell into a lime pit .

"Paris (CNN) -- Part of Paris Charles de Gaulle airport was evacuated Friday due to the accumulation of snow on the roof, and hundreds of flights were canceled because of a shortage of de-icing fluid, authorities said. Nearly 2,000 passengers were moved from Terminal 2E to other parts of the airport, authorities said, calling the measure ""preventative."" Part of the roof of that terminal collapsed in 2004, shortly after the state-of-the-art building was inaugurated. Four people were killed, media reports at the time said. About a foot of snow had fallen on the roof Friday by the time authorities decided to close the terminal, French media reports said. Authorities were working to clear it and reopen the terminal. French authorities earlier Friday asked airlines to cancel half their morning flights to and from the airport because de-icing fluid is running low, they said. That led to the cancellation of 400 flights Friday morning -- 200 arrivals and 200 departures. Then, early in the afternoon, they asked airlines to scrap a third of their flights for the rest of the day. Charles de Gaulle is the second busiest airport in Europe, after Heathrow in London. Paris' second airport, Orly, has not had to cancel flights because they are not running out of glycol, which is using for de-icing, authorities said. Airports in Europe are still struggling to get passengers to their destinations after they were snarled by unexpected snow over the weekend. Dublin airport was experiencing delays Friday because of de-icing and because airplanes are in the wrong places after the week's disruptions, it said in a statement.","Charles de Gaulle cancels a third of afternoon and evening flights .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Federal officials are investigating whether this week's Pacific storms caused a pilot to crash his small plane into a mountain in a southern California state park, authorities said Friday. It is the second death that might be related to the storms. Christopher Julius Petrikas, 65, a former commercial airline pilot from Riverside, California, slammed his twin-engine Aero Commander plane into a 3,300-foot mountain summit in Lake Perris State Recreation Area on Monday, authorities said. That park is just 11 miles from the city where Petrikas lived. He was the small plane's sole occupant. On Friday, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor said his agency and the National Transportation Safety Board will examine if the weather was a factor in the fatal crash. ""Yes, weather will be among the factors NTSB and FAA examine,"" Gregor said in an e-mail response to CNN. The state park's superintendent, John Rowe, said visibility on the mountain was poor around the time of the crash. ""The weather was not favorable at that time of the morning,"" Rowe told CNN on Friday. ""Visibility was between 100 yards and sometimes, at the top of the mountain, it would be 10 to 15 yards when my partners and I were searching up there. We couldn't even see the sheriff's helicopter."" The other life that might have been taken by the storms was that of Angela Marie Wright, 39, of Menifee, California, who also died in Riverside County when her car was swept off a road and into Canyon Lake on Wednesday, according to the coroner's office. ""Weather might have been a factor, but we can't determine that until we complete the investigation,"" Riverside County Sheriff's Deputy Melissa Nieburger said Friday. ""We're investigating that as a traffic collision."" Overall on Friday, rain-soaked residents of California were enjoying a reprieve from the storms that inundated the state for most of the previous week. Another round of wet weather was expected to hit the West Coast over the holiday weekend. During Friday's break in the storm fronts, authorities were able to provide a detailed account of the dramatic search for the downed pilot. Rains so deluged the chaparral, grasslands, and hiking and equestrian trails on the mountain that Rowe's four-wheel drive vehicle became stranded and a park ranger's all-terrain vehicle toppled over, Rowe said. So his crews searched on foot in the rain for about 1.5 miles until they discovered the wreck and dead pilot, he said. ""That's how messy it was. The trails were running like small rivers so it made recovery efforts very, very difficult,"" Rowe said. The plane was found near a World War II crash site where a training plane from nearby March Air Reserve Base also hit the mountain and killed its crew, Rowe said. Petrikas, the small plane's pilot, began his 75-mile flight from Palm Springs to Chino around 9 a.m. Monday, but when he didn't land on time, authorities launched a search for him, Rowe said. The pilot was found after the Riverside County sheriff's office pinged his cell phone and investigators were able to track down his location, Rowe said. The eight-hour recovery mission left some search members with near hypothermia because of prolonged exposure to rain that fell at a rate of a half-inch or an inch an hour, Rowe said. Sixteen low-security state inmates, who are often used for brush clearing in wildfires, were deployed in the search, and they had to carry Petrikas' body for three miles from the soaked mountaintop, Rowe said. Rangers' stranded vehicles were left abandoned for four days because the heavy rain and mud made it impossible for them to be moved, Rowe said. The wrecked plane, which remains on the park summit, could be retrieved by next week, he said. Friday marked Southern California's second day of sunshine after five days of storms. At Malibu's renowned Surfrider Beach, surfers dressed as Santa Claus, Mrs. Claus and Frosty the Snowman were riding mild waves during a lull in the weather Thursday, said Malibu resident Julie Ellerton, who videotaped the spectacle for a CNN iReport. But many residents of the region and three nearby Southwest states spent the time recovering from the damage wrought by torrential rains. California Lt. Gov. Abel Maldonado late Thursday afternoon proclaimed a state of emergency for Kings, Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties, to expedite government assistance and aid to the region. Two days earlier, a similar order was issued -- by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger -- for Kern, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Luis Obispo and Tulare counties. Maldonado is serving as acting governor while Schwarzenegger is out of the state. The series of Pacific fronts pounded southern California hardest, but the storms also strafed western Arizona, southern Nevada and southwestern Utah, which all were under flood watches and warnings that stretched until early Friday morning. Mudslides remain a threat because of the soggy ground. Conditions cleared in much of those areas Thursday, but the damage left by days of seemingly nonstop rain remained. That meant the chore of the day was cleaning up mud and flood damage to many homes and businesses. They may not have long to dry out: The National Weather Service forecasts that another storm system could dump light to moderate rainfall on much of southern California on Christmas Day and Sunday. Rainfall accumulation measurements at airports in Los Angeles, Long Beach, Camarillo, Santa Barbara and Santa Maria for the month -- ranging from 6 to 8.9 inches -- made this December the wettest ever in each of those locales, even with more than a week still to go. In one stark image, the field and sprawling parking lot of Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego was under water early Thursday, as crews worked desperately to pump out water. They succeeded, as the Naval Academy and San Diego State University faced off in college football's Poinsettia Bowl. The Mojave River was one of many at dangerously high levels, reaching 16.6 feet -- 0.6 feet above flood stage -- at 11 a.m. Thursday. The heavy rains also produced potential health hazards for swimmers and surfers on particular parts of Los Angeles' beaches, and Los Angeles County officials warned recreational users to be careful when next to drains or waterways because they carry bacteria and trash from streets and mountainsides. ""Fortunately, discharging storm drains, creeks, and rivers only comprises a small portion of the beach, and therefore, anybody who wants to go to the beach will be able to enjoy their outing,"" said Jonathan E. Fielding, the county's public health director and health officer. Throughout the Southwest, water roared through desert washes and urban waterways alike, and the ferocious strength of the rapids often damaged bridges or suburban concrete creek beds -- and dumped mud everywhere. The series of storms is known as the ""Pineapple Express"" because of its origin near the Hawaiian Islands. The upside to the severe weather, according to experts, is the relief the heavy rainfall has brought to a region devastated by drought and fires. The storms also brought heavy snow to mountain areas in California and other states. The National Weather Service issued hazardous weather outlooks for northern Nevada, Utah, Wyoming and most of Colorado. An avalanche warning was in effect for parts of Colorado. And locally heavy snow was forecast for much of the country's midsection, with the weather agency issuing advisories from Kansas east to Ohio.

"(CNN) -- In the summer of 2007, two Palestinian groups -- Fatah and Hamas -- fought street battles in Gaza. Fatah, loyal to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, was losing. And a U.S. diplomatic cable indicates that ""desperate, disorganized, and demoralized"" Fatah members appealed to Israel to attack their rival. The cable quotes the head of the Israeli Security Agency, Yuval Diskin, as telling U.S. diplomats, ""They are approaching a zero-sum situation, and yet they ask us to attack Hamas."" Diskin is also quoted as saying that Hamas had infiltrated Abbas' Presidential Guard and seized heavy machine guns. Fatah members quickly denied any approach had been made. Dimitri Diliani, a member of Fatah's revolutionary council, said such comments are part of a smear campaign carried out by Israel, which had never been asked ""to address or to assist in any Palestinian national manner."" But Hamas, in a statement that underlines the continuing animosity between the two groups, said that the ""WikiLeaks information regarding the scale of security cooperation between the Israeli occupation and Fatah is dangerous information and represents additional evidence regarding the involvement of Fatah with the occupation."" According to the cable, Diskin told U.S. Ambassador Richard H. Jones that Fatah was ""on its last legs,"" and Hamas was ""well-organized and ascendant."" But he opposed arming Fatah, saying, ""They are not organized to ensure that the equipment that is transferred to them will reach the intended recipients."" He was also wary of requests for Fatah members to be trained in Yemen ""with a strong al Qaeda presence."" Diskin also had harsh words for Abbas, saying, ""He knows he is weak and he has failed. He has failed to rehabilitate Fatah."" According to the leaked cable, Diskin also suggested Abbas would soon retire. Abbas continues as president today. The leaked cables also indicate the Israelis appear to have seen an advantage in Hamas consolidating its control in Gaza. A cable from June 13, 2007, quotes the head of Israeli military intelligence, Maj. Gen. Amos Yadlin, as saying that ""Israel would be 'happy' if Hamas took over Gaza because the (Israel Defense Forces) could then deal with Gaza as a hostile state."" Yadlin played down the threat Hamas represented, saying Iran, Hezbollah and Syria were of greater concern, according to the cable. He said that while Iran already had a presence in Gaza, ""Israel could handle the situation so long as Gaza does not have a port."" Today, three years since the cables were written, Hamas still retains control of Gaza, although much of the territory was devastated by the Israeli offensive of January 2009 in retaliation for rocket strikes across the border. The situation in the West Bank, still controlled by the Palestinian Authority, is calmer, with better security and investment assisting economic growth. Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian lawmaker and former minister, told CNN that the leaked cables show ""that the internal division in Palestine is serving only the interest of Israel"" and that ""Israel itself encouraged this division.""","WikiLeaks cable says ""desperate"" Fatah asked Israel to attack Hamas in 2007 .

"San Francisco, California (CNN) -- President Obama will wake up in San Francisco, California, on Friday amid a five-state, four-day tour aimed at propping up embattled key Senate incumbents. Obama will fly to Los Angeles, California, to attend a fundraiser luncheon at the University of Southern California for Sen. Barbara Boxer and former Gov. Jerry Brown, before delivering remarks at a Democratic National Committee rally at USC's Alumni Park. Boxer has opened a slight lead against Republican Carly Fiorina, as has Brown in his effort to win his old job back in a nasty battle with Republican Meg Whitman. National Democrats are still watching these races closely to ensure they don't slip out of their hands. By Friday evening, the president will be in Las Vegas, Nevada, to attend a DNC rally at a middle school before heading to a private residence for a fundraising event for Sen. Harry Reid and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Reid is stuck in the mid-40s in most polls, despite months painting his Republican opponent, Tea Party-friendly Sharron Angle, as an extremist. On Saturday, Obama heads to Minnesota for a rally to support former Sen. Mark Dayton, who is running for governor. The president also will headline a fundraiser for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee before heading back to the White House on Saturday evening. In addition, the president will attend another congressional campaign panel fundraiser Monday in Rhode Island before taking four days off from campaigning to tend to other business at the White House. As the president stumps across the West for several Senate incumbents, Democratic officials revealed Thursday he will shift his attention to the Midwest and Northeast in the final weekend before the midterm election. Obama will headline four major rallies for the Democratic National Committee in the final stretch, starting Saturday, October 30, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Bridgeport, Connecticut. Both states have Senate battles that are simply too close to call, as well as competitive gubernatorial battles. Also on that Saturday, Obama will return home to Chicago, where there is a tight gubernatorial fight and Democrat Alexi Giannoulias is locked in a bitter battle with Republican Mark Kirk for Obama's old Senate seat. The state is also home to a close re-election battle for Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn. Advisers to the president have privately said he's particularly concerned about the symbolism on election night if his party can't even hold his former Senate seat, which is why first lady Michelle Obama and the president each campaigned in Illinois earlier this month. On Sunday, October 31, the president will return again to Ohio in his 12th visit as president -- just days after he and the first lady headlined their first joint rally there, drawing 35,000 people to the campus of Ohio State University. White House aides have said they expect the president to be in Washington on Election Day, though that could always change if Democratic officials calculate that a last-minute visit will have an impact in another key race. Vice President Joe Biden will join Obama at the Cleveland, Ohio, rally, according to Democratic officials, as the White House continues to very aggressively coordinate the travel of the president, vice president, and first lady for maximum benefit. Biden led campaign events earlier this week in Washington, California, and Nevada -- three states the president is also hitting on his current five-state swing -- because of the urgency of saving incumbent Sens. Patty Murray, Boxer, and Reid. Michelle Obama will also be visiting Washington and California next week, and then will be in Las Vegas for Reid on Monday, November 1, the day before Election Day. That same day she will also headline an event in Philadelphia, a sure sign that the White House believes that Joe Sestak, the Democratic candidate for Senate that many pundits had written off, has a legitimate shot of knocking off Republican Pat Toomey.","Critics say midterm election will be a referendum on Obama and his leadership .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United have returned to the top of the English Premier League after a header from Ji-sung Park gave them a narrow 1-0 win over previous table-toppers Arsenal. The only goal of a largely disappointing match came just before half-time when Park superbly adjusted his body to divert Nani's deflected cross past 20-year-old Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, who was making his league debut for the London side. Neither team found their top form in a game of mistimed passes and niggly tackling, but United had the best of the chances with England striker Wayne Rooney missing a golden opportunity to stretch the advantage in the 73rd minute. Arsenal defender Gael Clichy was adjudged to have handled the ball in the penalty area but Rooney's spot-kick flew high and wide of the visitors goal. Gunners manager Arsene Wenger brought on big-name players Robin van Persie and captain Cesc Fabregas, who was returning from injury, in an attempt to get back into the game. But their flowing passing football deserted them and it was United who nearly snatched a second goal late on, when Rooney's clever lob was superbly clawed away by Szczesny. The result means United now lead the table by two points on 34 points and remain unbeaten after 16 league matches. They also have a game in hand on all their rivals. Arsenal are two points behind in second, level on points with Manchester City, while defending champions Chelsea are another point behind in fourth position.","Manchester United return to the top of the English Premier League table .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A ""farce,"" ""bitter"", ""ugly and chaotic,"" ""sinister and slapstick and a ""public relations nightmare;"" the Olympic torch's journey of harmony and peace hit a large protester-sized road hump in London, the world's press commented Monday. British newspapers said the Olympic torch relay through London was a ""public relations nightmare."" The British and Chinese press were far from impressed with the chaotic scenes as the Olympic torch was carried through London by a mixture of celebrities, politicians and athletes on its way to Beijing. In the UK, The Times said the relay was ""reduced to farce and ignominy"" as 35 protesters were arrested after clashing with police over China's actions in Tibet. ""Despite nearly a year of planning and the deployment of 2,000 officers, the Metropolitan Police were unable to stop protesters breaking through the security cordon at vulnerable points,"" the Times reported. ""It was a public relations nightmare for London, with images of Tibetans pinned to the tarmac by police, and demonstrators waving placards outside Downing Street.""  Watch a gallery of the torch relay in London » . The Daily Telegraph said the relay was nearly abandoned because of the ""ugly and chaotic"" scenes. ""Organizers, including Chinese officials, discussed ""pulling out"" of the day-long relay after just a few hours, as police fought running battles with wave after wave of anti-China protesters,"" the newspaper reported. The Daily Telegraph said police were surprised by the ""relentless"" attempts to disrupt the parade at ""every corner"" of the route.

The Independent said ""most spectators saw little more than a blur of fluorescent-yellow police jackets.""

The Guardian said the relay was ""a journey of harmony"" but there was precious little unity on display"" while the tabloid Sun described the scenes as ""shocking.""

The China Daily said ""tens of thousands of people lined the route of the relay to cheer the event; far outnumbering protesters."" ""Many spectators voiced disapproval of attempts to disrupt the torch relay by those who claimed they had done so for 'political causes,'"" it reported. It quoted Nick, a British university student, who said that ""sports should be separated from political things.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Visitors to the Los Angeles Police Department website have identified five women depicted in photographs found in a suspected serial killer's home this summer, but police need to independently confirm those claims, spokeswoman Norma Eisenman said Friday. Authorities would not say whether those women are alive or dead, Eisenman said. A website displaying the photos received 10 million hits in 24 hours after police asked for assistance in naming more than 100 women depicted in 180 photos, which police released Thursday, Eisenman said. Some women were featured in more than one picture, police said. Police have also received more than a dozen phone calls since releasing the photos, they said Friday. Authorities want to know whether a serial killer known as the Grim Sleeper has more than the 10 murder victims that police are now alleging. ""We are grateful for the public's response to the release of the images,"" a statement said. ""It is our fervent hope that with this response, coupled with the tireless efforts of our detectives, the women depicted in these images will be positively identified."" In July, 57-year-old Lonnie David Franklin Jr. was arrested and charged with 10 murders and one attempted murder dating to 1985, and Los Angeles police spent hundreds of hours sifting through thousands of photographs, Polaroids and videotape found in Franklin's house. The bodies of victims, many working as prostitutes, were all found in close proximity to each other in a neighborhood formerly known as South Central Los Angeles. Franklin, a mechanic who once worked for the LAPD, was arrested in July after police say they matched his DNA with DNA left on some of the victims. Police were led to Franklin after his 28-year-old son got arrested and gave a DNA swab, authorities said. Authorities said they narrowed the confiscated images down to 180 photographs. At a news conference Thursday attended by Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Police Chief Charlie Beck, authorities said they had difficulty determining whether some of the women were alive or dead in the photos. ""We cannot tell,"" Beck said. ""Obviously, as all of you can see, some of them are animated, and some are not. It's impossible to tell by the photographs. Robbery Homicide Detective Dennis Kilcoyne said police have a responsibility to try to determine the whereabouts of the women. ""These are clearly photos of women that Mr. Franklin had contact with,"" Kilcoyne said. ""We have a responsibility to identify these women. They may be alive and well, but we need to be certain. ""If there's nothing we glean from this, we are able to fill in the timeline of Mr. Franklin's life, and that's one of our goals as well,"" Kilcoyne said. He declined to talk about the context in which the women's images appeared. ""The lifestyle or the situation that these women are in would defeat our plea with the public,"" Kilcoyne said. Police are not sure where the women in the images resided, because Franklin's movements throughout his life are not yet ascertained, authorities said. ""His travel habits are unknown to us,"" Kilcoyne said. ""We believe he spent the majority of his life right here in the city of Los Angeles.""","NEW: The public has identified five of more than 100 women depicted in photographs .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Longtime Hollywood publicist Ronni Chasen was gunned down on Sunset Boulevard early Tuesday, just minutes after she left a star-studded party to celebrate the premiere of the movie ""Burlesque,"" police said. ""We were all on such a high,"" songwriter Diane Warren said. ""And then she left -- I'm guessing about 10 minutes before I did. What on earth? What happened? Why?"" Chasen, 64, died when ""multiple shots"" were fired into her Mercedes seconds after she drove past the posh Beverly Hills Hotel on her way home, according to Beverly Hill Police Sgt. Lincoln Hoshino. Police found her car crashed into a light pole after responding to a report of gunfire heard near the intersection of Sunset and Whittier Drive at 12:20 a.m. (3:20 a.m. ET), Police Sgt. Robert Maycott said. Chasen died later at Cedars-Sinai Hospital, according to Lt. Fred Corral, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner. Detectives searched Chasen's West Los Angeles home and her public relations firm for clues Tuesday, but Hoshino called it ""a wide open investigation."" They have no suspects or motive for the attack, he said. Warren, who was Chasen's celebrity client, called the killing senseless. ""They didn't steal anything,"" she said. ""Her purse was still there."" Chasen had been on the red carpet at Grauman's Chinese Theatre walking with Warren as she and ""Burlesque"" star Cher were interviewed about the music in the film. Warren, who contributed a song to the movie's soundtrack, said Chasen also went with her to the after-party at Hollywood's W Hotel. ""I am devastated beyond belief,"" Warren said. ""I can't believe this. I can't believe this."" Michael Levine, head of Levine Communications Office, called Chasen a ""beloved, iconic figure."" Levine, who said he has known Chasen for 25 years, has started a reward fund with a goal of raising $25,000 by next week. ""We must do everything possible to assist the Beverly Hills police in solving this horrific crime,"" Levine said. ""Ronni gave the utmost for her clients and this industry."" Hollywood celebrity public relations is ""like a small family,"" said Edward Lozzi, who operates a small Beverly Hills firm. Chasen was a ""class act"" and ""the ultimate professional,"" Lozzi said.

"(CNN) -- Federal authorities were investigating Friday the circumstances of a drone that crashed in El Paso, Texas, this week, which U.S. officials said originated in Mexico. Mexican Attorney General spokeswoman Rocio Torres denied her country's involvement with the drone Friday, but later in the day, another Mexican official said the drone was being operated by the Ministry of Public Security and was following a target at the time of the mechanical malfunction. The Mexican official did not know the nature of the surveillance but said ""we know they were following a target."" He did not know how the malfunction affected that operation, if at all. Ricardo Alday, a spokesman for the Mexican Embassy in the United States, also said the drone belonged to Mexico and was part of an operation in coordination with the U.S. government. ""It was flying on the Mexican side of the border when it had a mechanical malfunction,"" Alday said. ""It is my understanding both Mexican and U.S. authorities were fully cognizant of what was going on in the area."" Alday said the drone malfunctioned, entered U.S. airspace and landed in El Paso. U.S. Customs and Border Protection Special Operations Supervisor Ramiro Cordero said a resident called his agency Tuesday evening ""about something in front of his property."" The agency picked up the device and consulted with officials in the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Consulate in Juarez, Mexico. ""We determined it was the property of the Mexican government,"" Cordero said. U.S. National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Keith Holloway said he believed that the drone ""was owned by the government of Mexico, and I think they were the operators."" ""We are collecting data,"" Holloway said. ""We are not sending anyone down to the scene. We are collecting information to see what occurred."" A U.S. government official said authorities are ""100 percent"" sure that the drone belonged to the Mexican government, which used it for law enforcement and homeland security. Operators lost control of the drone, and it crashed, the official said. Another U.S. official said the drone flew out of control. He described it as small, with a 6-foot wingspan. ""They are little. They are squirrelly. A gust of wind can wreak havoc on these things,"" the second official said. A parachute deployed before it hit the ground, and the drone was found intact, with no one hurt and no property damage, the official said. ""There is nothing to suggest that there was any kind of surveillance activity that was going on with anything used by the government of Mexico in U.S. airspace,"" the official said. ""There is nothing to support that they were spying on us,"" the official added. ""There is nothing to cause alarm or suspicion."" A spokesman for NORAD, which is responsible for the aerial defense of the United States, said that it had real-time awareness of the situation but that it was not deemed to be a threat and did not require any NORAD response. NORAD said the Federal Aviation Administration and its Mexican counterpart are responsible for the civil airspace over their respective countries and coordinate cross-border air traffic. Officials with the Mexican military, which also uses drones, didn't respond immediately to calls for comment. The crash of an unmanned aerial vehicle from Mexico would be a first on U.S. soil, Cordero said. He said U.S. Homeland Security has turned the drone over to the Mexican Federal Secretariat of Public Safety in Juarez. Holloway said the craft was an Orbiter Mini UAV designed by Aeronautics Defense Systems, whose website describes it as ""a compact and lightweight system designed for use in military and homeland security operations"" and ""the ultimate solution for over-the-hill reconnaissance missions, low-intensity conflicts and urban warfare operations."" Unmanned drones are routinely used by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to look for illegal immigration on the U.S.-Mexico border.
