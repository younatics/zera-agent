"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A story that helped catapult the issue of poor work conditions for Chinese workers at Foxconn -- a primary maker of iPads and other devices for Apple Inc. -- back into the spotlight in January has unraveled. An episode of ""This American Life,"" a wildly popular U.S. radio show distributed by Public Radio International that is regularly the most downloaded podcast on Apple's iTunes store, broadcast an hour-long radio version of monologist Mike Daisey's ""The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs,"" in which he details a 2010 trip he took to meet workers at Foxconn in Shenzhen, China. That episode -- which broke records as the most downloaded show of ""This American Life"" -- has now been retracted for numerous fabrications, many of which were repeated by Daisey in subsequent interviews, including one with CNN International. The power of Daisey's storytelling, coupled with a New York Times investigative series of stories in January, fanned the flames that launched a number of off-and-online protests, including a petition on Change.org that seeks to ""protect workers making iPhones in Chinese factories"" that has nearly 250,000 signatures. CNNMoney: Apple and the Daisey affair . But several of Daisey's dramatic claims, some of which he repeated to CNN's Zain Verjee, have been retracted after Daisey's Chinese translator was found by a reporter from ""Marketplace,"" distributed by American Public Media, and disputed his version of events, including: . * Meeting workers with shaking hands that were poisoned by the chemical n-hexane. Apple itself acknowledged there were incidents with the chemical at two plants, but not at Foxconn. * Found workers who were as young as 12 years old. The translator told public radio they interviewed no underage workers, although some may have looked young. Apple's 2010 audit found 10 suppliers who hired 91 underage employees out of hundreds of thousands of employees. * In one of the show's most dramatic moments, Daisey said he interviewed a former worker now handicapped from repetitive stress injuries seeing an iPad for the first time, describing it as ""a kind of magic."" The translator said that never happened. Questions raised about work conditions at Foxconn are nothing new. The electronics supplier -- who also makes electronic goods for Sony, Microsoft, Nokia and other household brands -- came under intense scrutiny by CNN and other media outlets in 2010 after a series of suicides at its Chinese plants. Daisey told public radio that after seeing the news story slip away from public attention, he wanted to create a story that would help sustain interest in the work conditions for overseas makers of popular electronics goods. ""And everything I have done in making this monologue for the theater has been toward that end -- to make people care. I'm not going to say that I didn't take a few shortcuts in my passion to be heard. But I stand behind the work,"" Daisey said. ""My mistake, the mistake that I truly regret is that I had it on your show as journalism and it's not journalism. It's theater. I use the tools of theater and memoir to achieve its dramatic arc."" But purporting as truth the fabrications of his show in dozens of media interviews has raised a number of questions about the line between drama and journalism. ""The net result of Mike Daisey's efforts to put self-promotion ahead of the facts has badly muddied the waters, and has probably done more harm to the people he sought to help,"" wrote Arik Hesseldahl, senior editor for All Things D. ""Everybody who has touched Mike Daisey in the past three to four months has been tainted and they need to go back and re-examine their archives,"" Hesseldahl told CNN's Howard Kurtz. Kai Ryssdal, host of ""Marketplace,"" which broke the story, said Daisey's account mixed fact and fiction. ""Mike Daisey is a great, great story teller and when you have a guy who spins a web like that and gets you involved, it's really difficult to take it apart and say, wait a minute, let's think about this for a second ... what doesn't work here?"" he told CNN. ""Also, there are parts of Mike Daisey's story that are true -- it does happen that Apple has had underage workers (at its suppliers); it does happen that people have n-hexane poisoning and all that,"" he said. ""But the bottomline is Mike Daisey tells a great story and people suspended their disbelief.""","A popular U.S. radio show has retracted an episode on Apple supplier Foxconn .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid moved 13 points clear at the top of La Liga with a 4-0 win over Racing Santander at the Bernabeu Stadium on Saturday. Karim Benzema scored twice as Madrid notched up their 18th win in 19 matches since the end of September. The hosts went ahead in the sixth minute as Cristiano Ronaldo headed home from a Kaka cross. Santander made their task even harder when Domingo Cisma was sent off for handling the ball in the 38th minute and soon the deficit was doubled as Benzema scored from a tight angle moments before the break. Substitute Angel Di Maria netted a third in the 73rd minute before Benzema scored a fourth in the 89th minute. Barcelona can reduce the arrears to 10 points on Sunday if they beat Valencia at the Nou Camp. Espanyol are up to fourth place after claiming a point in a 1-1 draw with mid-table Getafe. Substitute Alvaro Vazquez gave Espanyol the lead in the 66th minute only to relinquish it a minute later when the referee awarded Getafe a penalty after Miku was brought down by Thievy Bifouma. Miku made no mistake from the spot. Meanwhile in Serie A, Juventus came from behind to beat 10-man Catania 3-1 in Turin. Pablo Barrientos gave the Sicilians the lead in the 4th minute before Andrea Pirlo put Juve back on level terms in the 22nd minute. Marco Motta's dismissal in the 65th minute saw Juve take control of the match with goals from Giorgio Chiellini in the 74th minute and Fabio Quagliarella seven minutes later wrapping up the three points. The win means Juventus now lead by two points but AC Milan can return to the top if they win at Cesena on Sunday.","Karim Benzema scores twice in 4-0 win over Racing Santander to put Real Madrid 13 points clear .

"(CNN) -- The leader of Colombia's main leftist rebel group -- the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -- died in a military operation in the country's southwest, President Juan Manuel Santos said Saturday. ""I confirm the death of Alfonso Cano. The No. 1 of FARC is dead,"" Santos said. ""This is the most overwhelming blow given to the FARC in all of Colombia's history."" The military operation that took place Friday in the state of Cauca also killed Cano's communications chief, a female friend and members of his security team, Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon told reporters. Cano's chief of security was captured. ""The death of Alfonso Cano is the most important historical mark of our military forces and our national police in our fight against the FARC organization,"" Pinzon said. ""He was part of the organization for over 33 years. He was their ideologue, their political figure and most importantly, he was a despised terrorist ready to act in a radical way ..."" Cano, an alias for Guillermo Leon Saenz, took over the FARC's top spot in March 2008 after an apparent heart attack killed the former leader, Manuel Marulanda. Cano's family released a statement following his death, urging peace and asking the media to respect their privacy. They called on authorities in Colombia, and specifically on President Santos, to allow them the opportunity to give Cano a dignified burial. ""This is great news for all the Colombian people,"" said Labor Minister Rafael Pardo. ""This will help the peace process and it shows that armed conflict is no longer the way forward in Colombia."" The FARC has been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s. While severely weakened in recent years, the guerrilla group has continued to carry out kidnappings and attack security forces in the South American nation. Following Cano's death, the FARC released a statement in which its leaders said they would not end their guerrilla struggle. ""This is not the first time that the oppressed and exploited in Colombia are mourning one of its greatest leaders. Nor is it the first (time) that he will be replaced with the courage and absolute conviction of victory. Peace in Colombia will not be born in any guerrilla demobilization, but the abolition of the causes that give birth the upheaval,"" they wrote. Senior officials in the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama said that they believe Cano's death will pose a serious challenge to the FARC going forward. There aren't many people left to head the group and most of those who might, no longer live in Colombia, they said. The FARC, which began as a revolutionary guerrilla group, has evolved into a narco-trafficking organization, the officials said. While it is no longer able to threaten the state, the FARC still has the potential to hurt a lot of people, they added. The United States and European Union consider the FARC a terrorist organization. ""This is an important victory for Colombia and represents a major blow against the largest terrorist organization in this hemisphere,"" said U.S. State Department spokeswoman Darla Jordan. ""We firmly support the efforts of the Colombian people, their security forces, and President Santos to combat the FARC,"" she said. In July, Santos said Cano escaped an attack by less than a day. At the time, security forces raided a remote camp believed to have been his hideout. After the raid, authorities found clothes they believe belonged to Cano. CNN affiliate Caracol TV reported that authorities also found large quantities of the cigarettes the FARC leader is thought to smoke. ""We were very close,"" the president told reporters at a military airport in Bogota. He said security forces had acted on an intelligence tip from one of Cano's ""own people."" CNN's Claudia Dominguez, Luis Carlos Velez and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","NEW: The FARC says his death does not spell the end of the guerrilla struggle .
The FARC leader's family asks that his remains be treated with dignity .

"(CNN) -- After more than six months of silence, Syria's leader, Bashar al-Assad, spoke last week for only the fourth time since the beginning of the country's widespread uprising in March. His words show that he is as delusional now as when the protests began. By continuing to blame the revolution on a foreign conspiracy, dismissing hundreds of thousands of his fellow citizens as ""bandits, Zionists and al Qaeda,"" Assad is taking a page out of the handbook of Libya's late dictator, Moammar Gadhafi, on political survival. Assad will fight to the end simply because he cannot even conceive of his end. ""Victory is nigh,"" Assad assured his dwindling supporters. But the current standstill after 10 months of fighting against unarmed protesters, and the deaths of more than 5,000 people, makes this promise hollow. Indeed, Assad's recent call on loyalists to continue to form local units to support the army and the security forces in their crackdown clearly shows increasing difficulty for the regime. Without external support, the protest movement has proved impossible to defeat, even for Assad's machine of oppression, deemed by international human rights organizations to be one of the worst in the Middle East. Assad's best defense at this stage is to play the hackneyed hand of dictators in the region -- and he is pursuing it assiduously by stoking international fears of civil mayhem in Syria. The United States and the international community do not seem to know how to respond, other than to impose economic sanctions, followed by more economic sanctions. The sanctions, though effective in crippling Syria's economy, have proved useless at stopping the bloodshed. If anything, violence is escalating, its ferocity forcing the previously unarmed protesters to rally around the increasing number of Syrian Army defectors to organize an armed resistance to loyalist militias. As for the Arab League delegation of monitors roaming the country to ensure compliance with an agreement to halt the violence against protesters, the average daily death toll has more than doubled, reaching around 50 innocent people, since the monitors arrived in late December. There are vital steps the United States can immediately take. Ragtag defectors from the Syrian Army, joined by civilians, have had to fight back. Yet these unorganized protesters have fought Assad's loyalist troops and militias nearly to a standstill with only light arms, obtained locally. Providing them with more sophisticated gear, including RPGs, night vision goggles and better communication equipment, would likely enable them to neutralize Assad's tanks and possibly free entire towns. Implementing a no-fly zone could also prevent Assad from laying these towns, once free, to waste. A naval blockade of Syrian ports would help prevent arms shipments to the regime. These are all measures the protesters themselves have forcefully and uniformly requested. Some might be concerned that the prospect of increased militarization will plunge Syria into civil war. Assad is leaving his opponents with little choice. Either they must settle for his version of reform, forever keeping him and his inner circle in power and above the law, or they are ""terrorists"" and will be struck with an ""iron fist,"" as he threatened last week. If Russia persists in threatening a veto at the U.N. Security Council, the United States should call for an international conference on Syria, with the Arab League, the Islamic Conference, NATO, Japan, India, Brazil and all concerned states. This would be a viable path to legitimate multilateral intervention while circumventing the Russian veto. Syrian opposition coalitions, such as the SNC (Syrian National Council) and the Antalya Conference for Change, and prominent independent dissidents should be also invited, so that they can endorse the outcome and legitimate any international actions against the Syrian regime. The protesters and all Syrians who yearn for freedom are unambivalentÂ in their call for international intervention. America faces a fundamental choice. It can stand behind democratic aspirations fully, or it can continue to rely on 19th century notions of power politics and influence. Backing tyrants as a hedge against Islamist extremism has only fostered more extremism. Although the course of history is never smooth or predictable, supporting freedom, democracy and individual dignity will, over time, provide the most stable model for prosperity and peace.

"(CNN) -- Michael Clarke joined an exclusive club comprising of cricket legends Don Bradman and Wally Hammond on day two of the fourth Test as Australia continued to batter India. The Australian captain made 210 at the Adelaide Oval as he became only the third player in history to hit double and triple centuries in a series. Clarke's knock, coupled with former captain Ricky Ponting's 221, saw Australia reach a mammoth 604-7 declared in their first innings, as they search for a 4-0 series whitewash. By the end of play India were 61-2, as Virender Sehwag and Raul Dravid fell cheaply, and staring down the barrel of another humiliating defeat. Ponting passes new milestone . Clarke made 329 not out in the second Test at Sydney and said he was flattered to join an illustrious club with fellow countryman Bradman -- who ended his career with an average score per game of 99.94 -- and former England captain Hammond, who made 22 Test centuries. ""I didn't know that, but it's very nice,"" Clarke told reporters. ""It's very special, no doubt about it. One thing I've never been very keen on is statistics and records. ""It's about helping your team win and, if things like that come along, it's very special."" Clarke and Ponting's partnership of 386 was the fourth highest of all time for Australia, with Bradman involved in all of the top three. In Abu Dhabi, bowlers Graeme Swann and Stuart Broad each took three wickets as England grabbed the initiative on day one of the second Test against Pakistan. Pakistan, who won the first Test of the three-match series in Dubai by ten wickets, made 256-7 at the end of play after winning the toss and opting to bat first. Captain Misbah-ul-Haq compiled an unbeaten 83, and was ably assisted by Asad Shafiq, who made 58, but on a good batting surface England did well to restrict their opponents. England had to wait nearly 20 overs for the breakthrough, as Swann bowled Taufeeq Umar, before Monty Panesar -- playing his first Test since July 2009 -- repeated the feat to remove Mohammad Hafeez soon after. Broad then made his mark as he bowled Younis Khan and Azhar Ali in quick succession to leave Pakistan wobbling on 103-4. But Misbah-ul-Haq and Shafiq steadied the ship, putting on 100 before Swann trapped Shafiq LBW. Adnan Akmal was then out in the same fashion to Broad. Swann's dismissal of Abdur Rehman just before the close confirmed it was England's day.","Australia captain Michael Clarke matches legends Wally Hammond and Don Bradman .

"Quito, Ecuador (CNN) -- Voters in Ecuador might have a chance to weigh in on a high-profile case of sibling rivalry. Fabricio Correa, 52, filed paperwork to register a new political party Wednesday. His aim, he said, is to defeat his younger brother, incumbent President Rafael Correa, in elections next year. ""There is no legal security. There is too much corruption. Today, drugs are rampant. Crime has doubled. There is no investment. There are no jobs. The number of poor people has increased 50%,"" Fabricio Correa told CNN en EspaÃ±ol on Wednesday. Court ruling in a libel case a victory for Rafael Correa . Ecuadorian government officials declined to comment on those accusations. The spat between the two brothers has played out publicly for years, with each accusing the other of corruption. ""The Big Brother,"" a book published by two journalists in 2010, has fueled the feud. The investigation alleged that companies connected with Fabricio Correa had received preferential treatment, with more than $167 million in government contracts. The president denied that he knew about the contracts, called them unethical and terminated them. He also filed a libel lawsuit against the journalists who wrote ""The Big Brother,"" but he pardoned them earlier this year. Fabricio Correa has contended that the contracts were terminated because one company, Cosurca, refused to pay a $1.5 million bribe to the government. On Wednesday, he repeated criticisms of his 48-year-old brother and other government officials. ""I have been taking care of my younger brother since he was little, and I have always know that he was like this. I thought that he had matured, and maybe he had, but the drug of power is very powerful, and even worse when he is surrounded by a perverse circle,"" Fabricio Correa said. While the elder Correa has become a vocal member of Ecuador's opposition, one political analyst said critics must do more to find common ground among opponents of the current administration. ""The opposition has not been able to assemble an appropriate team and create a unified party that can oppose Rafael Correa,"" analyst Vladimir Serrano said. Looking toward the 2013 presidential elections, Fabricio Correa said Wednesday that ideology would not be an obstacle for him to gain supporters from different political backgrounds. ""I am like an archer. I stand in the center, and if they throw me one way, I fly to the right, and if they throw me to the other side, I fly to the left,"" he said. Fabricio Correa said Wednesday that he had filed more than 200,000 signatures with election authorities Wednesday requesting approval for his political party, known as EQUIPO (the Spanish word for team) -- which he said stands for equality, progress and order. Election authorities have a month to evaluate the application.","Fabricio Correa files paperwork to register his political party .

"(CNN) -- Former Manchester United footballer Eric Cantona said Tuesday he wanted to campaign for the French presidency -- but commentators said the announcement was a publicity stunt to turn the spotlight on the plight of poor people. Cantona has written to French mayors to obtain the 500 signatures needed to stand in April's election, Liberation newspaper reported. The 45-year-old told them he was ""a citizen very much aware of our times,"" and would stand up for the young and poorly housed. But the bid was interpreted by Liberation as a way of publicizing his cause of better housing, rather than a genuine presidential campaign. Nicolas Sarkozy of the UMP party is bidding for re-election in April against Socialist rival Francois Hollande. See high-res images of other sports stars-turned-politicians . Cantona's move is just the latest in a varied career by the Frenchman. Since leaving Old Trafford in 1997 where he was known as ""King Eric"" for his goal-scoring prowess, Cantona has turned to acting, most notably in director Ken Loach's ""Looking For Eric."" And in 2010 Cantona urged bank customers to withdraw all their money from French banks. The call prompted widespread condemnation by politicians, and few people took out their cash. Finance Minister Francois Baroin, who is also a mayor, dismissed his latest move, adding that he preferred ""the Cantona who looks after housing to the Cantona who told the French to withdraw their money from the banks in order to cause a disaster."" Cantona gained notoriety in 1995 when he launched a flying kick and several punches at a fan as he was sent off during a match. After the game, he told journalists: ""When the seagulls follow the trawler, it's because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea."" Last year Cantona, voted by Manchester United fans as their player of the century, was named as director of football for the newly-reformed New York Cosmos. Many other sports stars have made the move into politics. Former Pakistani cricket captain Imran Khan's party is campaigning in elections, while International Monetary Fund boss, and former French finance minister Christine Lagarde was once a member of the French teenage national synchronized swimming team.","Former footballer Eric Cantona says he wants to run for French presidency .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge in New Orleans ruled Thursday that Transocean is not liable for Deepwater Horizon compensatory damages sought by third parties in the worst oil spill in U.S. history. There are more than 120,000 plaintiffs in the lawsuit, scheduled to go to trial on February 27 in New Orleans. Third parties comprise the vast majority of plaintiffs. Transocean owned the Deepwater Horizon rig that exploded on April 20, 2010, killing 11 people. Transocean is still potentially liable for punitive damages or civil penalties under the Clean Water Act. A spokesman for Transocean said the ruling confirms ""that BP is responsible for all economic damages caused by the oil that leaked from its Macondo well, and discredits BP's ongoing attempts to evade both its contractual and financial obligations. ""Transocean is pleased to see its position affirmed, consistent with the law and the long-established model for allocating risks in the offshore-oil and gas industry,"" spokesman Lou Colasuonno said. BP, the oil company that contracted the rig, highlighted liabilities Transocean still potentially faces. ""Under the decision Transocean is, at a minimum, financially responsible for any punitive damages, fines and penalties flowing from its own conduct. As we have said from the beginning, Transocean cannot avoid its responsibility for this accident,"" a BP statement said. ""By contrast, since the spill we have stepped up, acknowledged our role and paid more than $7.8 billion in claims, advances and other payments to individuals, businesses and governments,"" BP said. ""Today's ruling makes clear that contractors will be held accountable for their actions under the law. While all official investigations have concluded that Transocean played a causal role in the accident, the contractor has long contended it is fully indemnified by BP for the liabilities resulting from the oil spill. The court rejected this view,"" BP said. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Federal judge says Transocean isn't liable for third parties' compensatory damages .

"Burbank, California (CNN) -- Off the beaten path of the Los Angeles theater district, troubadours are resurrecting Shakespeare in an adaptation that would make the Bard smile. The Troubadour Theater Company has melded ""Two Gentlemen of Verona"" with song and dance performed to music by the band Chicago and has rendered an energetic, comedic romp entitled ""Two Gentlemen of Chicago."" Troupes and their adaptations of ""Bardolatry,"" as George Bernard Shaw coined it, come and go, riffing endlessly on Shakespeare's tragedies and comedies, always searching for ways to breathe new life into the iambic pentameter of 500 years ago. But the Troubadour Theater Company, performing at Hollywood producer Garry Marshall's Falcon Theatre in Burbank, has come upon an entertaining formula. The performers use live music, choreography, improvisation, audience interaction, and no small measure of humor and farce to create an evening of engagement and laughter. Much of the troupe's magic comes from its improv, and performers apparently play pranks on one another, such as in one scene when Matt Walker's Proteus toasts Rob Nagle's Valentine -- with real booze, not some liquid stage prop. ""Oh, got the real thing!"" Walker says, nearly choking, during the March 17 performance. ""On St. Patrick's Day, no less."" (Walker, who trained at improv mecca Second City, also directs the show.) Other improvisations are equally witty. When Rick Batalla's Thurio flubs a line, Beth Kennedy's Launce jests him: ""Thurio, you aren't sharp enough -- especially with your lines."" (Kennedy is also the show's producing director.) That may be a bit unfair to Batalla, whose talents include playing the guitar and singing. The integration of Chicago's ballads, played lived by seven musicians, makes for a nice fit in the romantic comedy narrative. Add in the troupe's choreography, and the production is more than just a ""free-wheeling, no holds barred...slapstick"" that the stagebill touts. The show opens when Proteus and Valentine have had enough of another ""Saturday in the Park,"" a Chicago standard. Later, both men fight over Sylvia by serenading her as ""You're the Inspiration,"" a popular Chicago ballad. Among the show stealers are Kennedy's clownish Launce and his dog, Crab, which is a loveable pug. It's always high risk to bring an animal into a live performance -- for who knows what could go wrong -- but Kennedy is happy to improvise and highlight the what-will-the-dog-do-next suspense. Kennedy and Crab amaze the audience by exchanging between themselves a high-five -- and then a low-five. When Crab turns his rump to the audience, with his tail high in the air center stage, Kennedy admonishes the animal with what everyone is looking at but is too polite to express: ""Why, you're showing them your evil eye! ""I'm so sorry,"" Kennedy tells the gallery, all laughing. The Troubadour Theater Company's ""Two Gentlemen of Chicago"" runs through April 22 at the Falcon Theatre in Burbank, California.","""Two Gentlemen of Chicago"" is an adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Two Gentlemen of Verona""

"(CNN) -- Entertainer Lady Gaga scores a 93, edging out President Barack Obama at 91. NBA rising star Jeremy Lin scores an 80. Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates gets a 77. Pope Benedict XVI earns a 53. However, these very public figures -- along with the other hundreds of millions of us using social media -- all bow to the 100-point chart-topper: teen heartthrob Justin Bieber. We're talking about Klout, the four-year-old Web service that measures online influence based on ""one's ability to drive action."" Klout scores are derived from social networks -- mostly Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus -- to measure how many people you influence, how much you influence them and the relative power of your network. Some have described a Klout score as the credit score of the digital age. It has very little to do with real-world, offline influence and everything to do with Twitter retweets and Facebook likes. The more of those you have, the higher your score. The San Francisco-based startup claims to have assigned scores to more than 100 million people. CNN sat down recently with Klout co-founder and CEO Joe Fernandez to discuss why web users should know their Klout score, how brands are capitalizing on rewarding key influencers, the company's first acquisition and why burritos helped shape the initial idea behind Klout. CNN: Why should people care about their Klout score? Fernandez: We're helping people better measure and understand influence online. To examine the content users create on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, the whole social Web. As the Web grows more massive all the time, it's becoming increasingly important to quickly assess what Internet users are influential about and how they are influenced in order to make more informed decisions. What are the most effective means for increasing one's Klout score? Consistency is really the biggest thing. It's finding time in your day to create at least one piece of content to keep your network engaged in what you have to share. Last year Klout users reacted rather loudly to some pretty significant changes to the service. How has the feedback been overall now that a number of months have passed and what did you guys learn in terms of the passion of your core users? It was a great learning experience for us. People were surprised at how much their scores shifted and their passion for the scores definitely showed after that. What we learned was that we need to drive transparency and make it clear why users' scores changed. Since then we've worked to add layers of transparency and our users have reacted very well. Is it true the idea for Klout was partly inspired by your expertise in burritos? Ha ... yes. My jaw was wired shut for three months in 2007. I was thinking all the time about food. I then became interested in the idea that, because I recommend taquerias to friends online so much, that I should be rewarded for that expertise. Burritos were definitely a part of my inspiration. Are you seeing adoption of the Klout service in the job market? Everywhere I go it seems I'm meeting someone who tells me they either put their Klout score on their resume and got the job or it came up during the job interview. If you think about what's important in the workplace today, for many positions, it's one's ability to activate a network. To spread the word. To be comfortable in the social web. Klout is a great way to benchmark how effective someone really is. It seems businesses are beginning to pay more attention to key influencers online and reward those patrons accordingly. What is a good example of an industry or company using Klout to elevate the consumer experience? One of my favorite uses are by hotel properties that are now using Klout scores to upgrade the rooms of guests during check-in as they access their online influence rating. These types of perks have been offered for many years but always based on how much money a person spends. Now for the first time brands are valuing your networks. Klout was in the news very recently with the acquisition of Blockboard, a service that helps people connect with their neighbors. What can you share about the thinking behind the move and what impact will it have on users? The web is clearly shifting from desktop to mobile. We've done a good job at understanding influence online, but as it drives down to local and mobile we thought it was important to pick up a team like the people at Blockboard that are as passionate as we are about the rest of social media and open up mobile to Klout in new ways. How do you respond to criticism that the Klout score is not a true reflection of influence? For example, ahead of the Iowa caucus, Mitt Romney and New Gingrich were tied according to their Klout score (78). But ultimately Rick Santorum won in Iowa. What's wrong? Klout measures your ability to drive actions online. That doesn't always reflect in the real world. We predicted the New England Patriots would win the Super Bowl because many of their players had higher Klout scores. But on the playing field it's a different situation. Just like Newt and Mitt were tied online but the voters in Iowa saw things differently. With Cuban heritage as part of your background, what has it been like as one of just a handful of Latino tech company entrepreneurs? This entire journey so far has been great. The Latino community online along with the rise of social media use across Latin America has been supportive throughout, offering lots of goodwill. Silicon Valley is an interesting place. I went there two years ago not knowing a single person. It's amazing. I believe anyone can arrive and if you have a great idea and the passion to build a company, you're gonna get a shot at it. What do you see for the short- and long-term future of the company? Our big thing is continue to drive value for our users. Help them understand their influence. And not enough for them to just understand their reach but benefit from it. Big things are in store for Klout users in 2012, such as the integration on the mobile platform ... [and] new tools that increase transparency and help people drive up their scores.","Klout is a web service that examines online influence based on ""one's ability to drive action""

"Washington (CNN) -- House GOP leaders unveiled a 2013 budget blueprint Tuesday that has little chance of becoming law but draws a clear contrast with Democrats on taxes, spending, and a host of hot-button political issues -- all of which could play a pivotal role in the 2012 campaign. Republicans cast the $3.53 trillion plan -- which doubles down on past GOP proposals to overhaul Medicare and other politically sensitive programs -- as a bold attempt to reverse skyrocketing federal deficits and avert a looming fiscal catastrophe. ""This plan of action is about putting an end to empty promises from bankrupt government and restoring the fundamental promise of America, ensuring that our children have more opportunity than we do,"" said House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin. ""We're here to offer Americans the chance to choose which future they want for themselves: the president's path of debt and decline, or the path that we're proposing, a path to renew prosperity for Americans."" Democrats called it a betrayal of last year's bipartisan deficit reduction deal, and characterized it as another GOP giveaway to the wealthy at the expense of the middle class and vulnerable seniors. Sensing electoral opportunity, they also tried to hang it around Republican presidential frontrunner Mitt Romney's political neck. ""If you're Mitt Romney, you're going to love this budget, because what it does is provide another round of tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and does it at the expense of middle-class taxpayers and seniors,"" Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen, a member of the House Democratic leadership, told CNN. White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer said in a written statement that the proposed GOP budget ""fails the test of balance, fairness, and shared responsibility."" It ""draws on the same wrong-headed theory that led to the worst recession of our lifetimes and contributed to the erosion of middle-class security over the last decade,"" he argued. White House bashes budget proposal . Among other things, the House GOP plan calls for a reduction in individual tax rates and brackets. Instead of today's six brackets, with rates from 10% to 35%, it calls for just two -- 10% and 25%. The proposal would eliminate the Alternative Minimum Tax, while dropping the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 25%. GOP leaders would compensate for lost revenue by closing a series of tax loopholes and ending numerous deductions. They declined to offer details Tuesday, however, on exactly which loopholes and deductions would be affected, noting that the matter would be taken up at the congressional committee level in the near future. Returning to one of the most controversial points from last year's budget fight, the proposal includes dramatic changes to the Medicare program. It would offer future seniors a choice of staying in the traditional fee-for-service plan or opting instead for a Medicare-approved private plan, all of which would be available via a new Medicare exchange. No matter which plan they chose, including the traditional Medicare plan, seniors would receive a government subsidy to help pay for their choice. ""We propose to save and strengthen Medicare by taking power away from the government bureaucrats,"" Ryan said. ""We preserve the Medicare guarantee for today's seniors so they can count on the benefit that they've organized their retirement around, and we preserve that guarantee going into the future for tomorrow's seniors by empowering them with choices."" The Republicans ""have made it clear they want Medicare to wither on the vine, to die, and this is an important step for them in that direction,"" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California. ""Bless their hearts, they don't believe in Medicare, and they act upon their beliefs."" Medicaid, which provides health coverage for the poor, would be converted under the GOP plan into a series of block grants for the states. Individual states would be empowered to tighten eligibility rules or revise enrollees' cost-sharing obligations. Budget proposal would overhaul Medicaid . The Republican proposal also protects defense spending by undoing a scheduled $55 billion cut in the Pentagon budget, replacing the reduction with cuts elsewhere. Ryan has called the scheduled Pentagon cuts -- part of the agreement reached in last summer's Budget Control Act -- ""devastating to America's defense capabilities."" Among the compensating changes: greater federal worker pension contributions and more means-testing of entitlement benefits. Overall, the GOP plan caps 2013 domestic discretionary spending -- programs other than defense and entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare -- at $1.028 trillion. Democrats immediately cried foul when the new proposed cap was unveiled, noting that it's nearly $20 billion below the total agreed to in last summer's deficit reduction deal. The Republicans ""shook on (that deal) and they passed it as law,"" Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad, D-North Dakota, said Tuesday. ""Now they are threatening to ... walk away."" If House Republicans fail to stick with the agreement, he warned, ""they will once again threaten to shut down the government and needlessly imperil the economic recovery."" House GOP leaders insist they can propose any amount under the $1.047 trillion level, because that figure simply represents the top limit for discretionary spending, not a level up to which Congress must spend. ""People have limits on credit cards. That doesn't mean that you're required to spend up to the limit,"" argued House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. ""We all know that we've got a real fiscal problem here in Washington, and frankly we think we can do better."" While the House Republicans' proposed budget has no chance of becoming law, it does promise to have a major impact on both the presidential and congressional campaigns. Democrats believe the proposed Medicare changes in particular could prove devastating to GOP hopes in key swing states such as Florida, which has a large elderly population. A number of Republicans, however, believe they'll ultimately be rewarded for having the political courage to tackle politically sensitive issues. Conservatives also argue it's critical to draw clear distinctions between top Republicans and Democrats before voters go to the polls in November. ""If we simply operate based on political fear, nothing is ever going to get done,"" Ryan told reporters Tuesday. ""If we allow entitlement politics -- fear that your adversaries will turn your reforms into a political weapon to use against you -- and we cower to that, then America is going to have a debt crisis."" Ryan insisted that the eventual Republican nominee will firmly support the House GOP's blueprint. ""All of our candidates have campaigned on these various ideas,"" he told reporters. ""We are sharpening the contrast between the path that we're proposing and (Obama's) path to debt and decline."" ""And yes, we do believe our nominee ... is going to be perfectly consistent with this,"" he stressed. ""I've spoken with all of these guys, and they believe we are heading in the right direction."" Shortly after Ryan's remarks, Romney released a statement praising the House Republican leadership for ""taking a bold step toward putting our nation back on the track to fiscal sanity and robust economic growth."" ""Chairman Ryan and I share the same goals of cutting taxes and fundamentally reforming our tax code, dramatically reducing federal spending, as well as finally tackling the crushing debt our nation faces,"" Romney said. CNN's Kate Bolduan, Jeanne Sahadi, and Rebecca Stewart contributed to this report.","NEW: Romney praises House GOP budget plan .

"(CNN) -- England soccer captain John Terry, who is accused of racially abusing another player during a match, will go on trial July 9 after his lawyers entered a plea of not guilty in a London Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. Terry did not appear in person for the hearing. The trial date was set so far in the future because of Terry's football match commitments. Grosvenor Law, which is representing the football player, said it will put forward a ""detailed and robust"" defense, adding that Terry is ""shocked and disgusted"" by the accusation. The case stems from comments the Chelsea footballer allegedly made to Queens Park Rangers player Anton Ferdinand in an English Premier League match last year. Alison Saunders, chief crown prosecutor for London, said Terry is being prosecuted for a ""racially aggravated public order offense"" because of the comments during the October 23 match. ""I am satisfied there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and it is in the public interest to prosecute this case,"" Saunders said in December. The maximum penalty for the offense is Â£2,500 ($3,900). The London-born defender denied the allegations. ""Mr. Terry has never racially abused another player in his entire career,"" his lawyers said Wednesday. Terry's club has also backed him up. ""John has made it clear he denies the charge and is determined to do all he can to prove his innocence,"" the club said in a statement in December. ""Chelsea FC has always been fully supportive of John in this matter and there is no question that we will continue to be so. Terry's position as England captain has come under scrutiny since the allegations were made, and the court case will come before the team's next match at home against the Netherlands on February 29. The English Football Association's former chief executive, David Davies, said the ruling body might take action later if Terry is found guilty. ""The FA would most certainly go down that road,"" Davies said in December. ""England is the country which first embraced the idea of using the power of football to face racism back in the 1990s. England has not, unlike many other countries, swept this issue under the carpet. ""He can most certainly still play for England, as things stand. You always start with the premise of innocence until proven guilty. He will, to be sure, fight these charges with a vehemence."" In another case last year, Liverpool's Luis Suarez was suspended and fined for racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra. Suarez was suspended for eight matches and fined Â£40,000 ($63,000), England's Football Association announced in December. Evra said Suarez repeatedly shouted a racial slur at him during the October 15 match and demanded that Suarez be held accountable. Suarez did not specify what he said, but said it wasn't offensive. And his club issued a statement saying it was ""very surprised and disappointed"" with the decision. Racist taunts, alleged and proven, have dogged English football for years. On Saturday, police arrested a man on suspicion of making a racially abusive gesture at a high-profile soccer match between Liverpool and Manchester United earlier that day. Also in January, Merseyside police arrested a 20-year-old man on ""suspicion of a racially-aggravated public order offense"" following a Liverpool match against Oldham.","NEW: The trial date is set so far in the future because of Terry's football commitments .

"(CNN) -- A 25-year-old Oklahoma man was charged Friday with murder in the deaths of two girls who were found about three and a half years ago, shot to death in a ditch alongside a remote country road. ""We don't believe that he knew (the slain girls) directly,"" Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation Director Stan Florence said Friday of Kevin Sweat. ""We just believe that he happened to be in the area that day."" According to a probable cause affidavit, Sweat told investigators on September 13 that he'd been driving his Chevrolet Cavalier where the girls were found when he saw ""two monsters"" come at him. The suspect said he ""panicked,"" shooting the ""monsters"" first with a Glock .40 handgun and then with a .22 handgun he'd had in his glove box, the affidavit said. It claimed Sweat had voluntarily waived his rights and agreed to talk to investigators. The ""monsters"" are believed to be best friends Taylor Paschal-Placker, 13, of Weleetka and Skyla Jade Whittaker, 11, of nearby Henryetta, who were discovered June 8, 2008, by Taylor's grandfather. They had been shot in the head and chest, eight times for Skyla and five for Taylor, the state medical examiner reported after an autopsy. Their killings rattled Weleetka, a town of just over 1,000 residents, with police calling the shootings the community's first murders in more than 20 years. They also set off an extensive investigation involving multiple local, state and federal law enforcement agencies and including about 650 interviews, 900 leads and 19,000 forensic tests on 800 pieces of evidence, according to Florence. In January 2010, Sweat was among those interviewed about the girls' murder, because he owned a Glock .40 Model 22 handgun like one of those thought to be used in the shootings. He then told an investigator then that he'd sold such a gun in 2007, according to the arrest affidavit. But he was not considered a suspect until this year, after being arrested and charged with the murder of his girlfriend, Ashley Taylor, Florence said. He was already in the Seminole County Jail in his girlfriend's death when the new charges were filed, according to the state investigative bureau director. He is charged on four counts related to the 2008 case: two each of first-degree murder, plus two each of shooting with intent to kill, according to the affidavit. The witnesses cited in this document include several of Sweat's family members, including his father, as well as the two victims' relatives and the Glock gun company. District Attorney Max Cook, whose jurisdiction includes Creek and Okfuskee counties, said Friday that he has filed court documents requesting that Sweat be eligible for the death penalty if found guilty of murder in any of these killings. ""We feel that we are in an appropriate position to go forward in this case,"" Cook said Friday, referring to the case of the two girls. Neighbors and relatives described Taylor and Skyla as nearly inseparable, often playing together after school, riding their bikes and sleeping at each others' houses. They were at Taylor's house the night of June 8, when they set off about 5 p.m. for a walk down the road. Soon thereafter, Taylor's grandfather made a futile attempt to call her on her cell phone. He found the two girls about 30 minutes later, lying side-by-side in a ditch about a quarter-mile from the home, police said. Six weeks after the slayings, Oklahoma authorities released a 911 tape in which a breathless, nearly hysterical woman -- identified only as a family member of one of the victims -- is heard screaming, ""Somebody killed two girls."" ""They went for a walk, and now they are both down here dead. ... My granddaughter and her friend,"" the woman said on the tape. ""Help me. Please!"" On September 30, a $5,000 reward was offered for information on ""the Glock .40 model 22 handgun used in the Weleetka girls' homicides,"" the state investigation bureau noted on its website. A serial number was given for that weapon, one of two linked to the girls' deaths. Ballistics tests determined that the .40-caliber shell casings found at the crime scene, matched those found on the property of Curtis Sweat, Kevin's father, the affidavit said. Investigators determined the serial number of the gun, which had been sold to Sweat. In his September interview, the suspect admitted that he'd purchased the Glock .40 gun in 2007. Authorities on Friday reiterated their plea for the public's help in tracking down this firearm, which they said Sweat may have tried to sell in March at a Tulsa gun show. Two photos of the suspect were also released: one taken around the time of the Weleetka killings and the other a mug shot after he was charged in his girlfriend's death. ""We hope that, by releasing (those photos), it will spark someone's memory of seeing Mr. Sweat around the scene of (Taylor and Skyla's) murder,"" Florence said.","NEW: Shell casings at crime scene matched those on suspect's father's land, police say .

"Charlottesville, Virginia (CNN) -- A former University of Virginia lacrosse player accused of fatally beating his ex-girlfriend contributed to her death, but did not kill her and had no intent to do so, his attorney argued Saturday. The defense and prosecution have rested in the murder trial of George Huguely, which is expected to resume on Wednesday. ""Yes, George contributed to her death. But no, he didn't kill her . . . he left there with her alive, and that is not in dispute. There was no intentional killing, because she wasn't dead when he left,"" defense attorney Francis Lawrence said during his closing statement. ""There's no intent to rob, and no intent to kill."" Huguely faces six charges, including robbery and first-degree murder in the May 2010 death of Yeardley Love, a 22-year-old senior who was also a lacrosse player. On Saturday, the defendant officially waived his right to testify. Lawrence described his client as ""stupid, drunk -- but not calculating."" The defense has said Love's death was an accident. Police were initially called to Love's off-campus Charlottesville apartment by a roommate who reported ""a possible alcohol overdose,"" Police Chief Tim Longo said at the time. A medical examiner later ruled that blunt force trauma killed Love, and authorities allege that Huguely caused it during an altercation. ""When somebody's little girl doesn't wake up the next day, and there's no reason why they shouldn't ... I ask you to do no more, and no less, than to hold him responsible for what he did,"" said Charlottesville Commonwealth's Attorney Warner D. Chapman. At several points during his closing statement, Love's mother and sister cried. Twice, it appeared Chapman was also crying, or chocking back tears. ""It goes without saying that this woman is never going to be able to say what happened to her ... but the evidence proves she was killed in the commission of a robbery,"" he told the jury. After closing arguments, the judge had hoped to give the case to jurors, but they felt they were too tired to continue. The trial will resume Wednesday morning and deliberations are expected to begin shortly thereafter. Prosecutors have claimed all along that Huguely followed through on his intentions to kill Love. Earlier in the trial, Chapman read e-mails exchanged between the two after Huguely heard Love had allegedly slept with someone else. The defendant wrote, ""I should have killed you,"" and Love responded, ""You should have killed me?"" according to Chapman. Huguely responded that the pair should talk, Chapman said. The prosecutor also told jurors that Love's death was slow and painful, claiming she could have remained alive for a couple of hours after Huguely left her apartment. The defense agrees Love was alive when Huguely left. Charlottesville Police Detective Lisa Reeves wrote in a sworn statement used to obtain a search warrant in the case that ""George Huguely admitted on May 3, 2010, that he was involved in an altercation with Yeardley Love and, during the course of the altercation, he shook Love and her head repeatedly hit the wall."" The defense attorney has said there is no evidence that Love's head hit a wall, and on Saturday, the defense called a witness who questioned the nature of Love's injuries. Ronald Uscinski, a neurosurgeon, testified it was ""possible, but less likely"" that the victim's brain injuries were the result of blunt force trauma. Huguely has been held for nearly two years. If he's convicted of involuntary manslaughter, the most time he could serve is 10 years.","NEW: George Huguely was ""stupid, drunk -- but not calculating,"" the attorney argues .

"Washington (CNN) -- Your hotel, health club and neighborhood pool can remain open this weekend without fear of violating the law. The Justice Department said Thursday it is delaying for 60 days a new law that requires all public pools to install ""lifts"" or provide other means to make pools accessible to disabled individuals. The law was passed in 2010 and was scheduled to take effect Thursday. But in recent months, there has been widespread confusion about what sort of pools are required to make the change, whether pools must install permanent lifts or can use cheaper portable lifts and whether one lift could service more than one pool. As the Thursday deadline neared, hotels and other pool operators nationwide unleashed a torrent of calls and letters to industry associations and politicians, saying the rule threatened to close pools from coast to coast. Several Republican lawmakers charged the rule was an example of unwieldy government regulation. And scribes even gave the debacle a name: ""Poolmaggeddon."" A hotel industry association said the government originally indicated portable lifts were acceptable, but reversed itself in a legal interpretation released early this year. It also said the government is requiring a separate lift for every pool, greatly increasing the costs to facilities with numerous pools. Permanent lifts are costly because they must have electrical grounding work, which requires installers to ""tear up"" a pool deck, said Marlene Colucci, executive vice president of the American Hotel & Lodging Association. ""You have to do electrical grounding requirements anytime you're within five feet of water, and that's required by the government. And this was not at all contemplated by the Department of Justice when they issued this further guidance,"" Colucci said. Permanent lifts also are an ""easy attractive nuisance"" for children, she said. ""Children see it, they look at it and say, 'This is a diving board. This is something to play with. And we're very concerned about injuries that result from that."" Colucci said portable and permanent lifts range in cost from $4,000 to $10,000, but permanent lifts have additional installation costs. Pool operators said there is also widespread confusion about language in the law that says they must accommodate disabled individuals to the extent that it is ""readily achievable"" to do so. The Justice Department said the ""readily achievable"" language has been in the Americans with Disabilities Act since 1992, and is an acknowledgment that it is not always possible to remove all architectural barriers in an existing building at the outset. ""Readily achievable"" means that it is ""easily accomplished"" and can be done ""without much difficulty or expense."" Asked by CNN Thursday whether the rule requires permanent, ""fixed"" lifts, a Justice Department spokesman gave the following response: . ""An existing pool must do what is readily achievable (affordable and easy). If a fixed lift is affordable and easy for that hotel, they need to provide a fixed lift. If only a portable lift is affordable and easy for that hotel, they can use a portable lift. If they already have a portable lift, they should explore whether it is affordable and easy to attach the lift. If no lift is achievable, they should make a plan to achieve access when it becomes readily achievable for them."" That language seemingly gives wide latitude to pool operators. But Colucci says it also creates problems. ""By having a definition that's so broad, you really don't give anybody any certainty,"" Colucci said. ""Which means that you end up having to litigate the definition of what is 'readily achievable.'"" In a press release Thursday, the Justice Department conceded there were ""misunderstandings"" about the pool law and extended the deadline 60 days. It also held open the possibility of even longer delays and said it will accept public comments on a possible six-month extension. CNN's Lizzie O'Leary contributed to this report.","Law requires ""lifts"" or other means to make public pools accessible to disabled people .

"(CNN) -- The last few months have witnessed a dramatic turn in the way democratic politics are conducted in a sovereign country that is also a member state of the European Union. The depth of the economic crisis and the increasing dependency of Greece on external funds to survive have led to an unprecedented degree of national humiliation and destabilization of the political system. Greek parliamentary practices are operating under emergency procedures, a government has been overturned overnight and constitutional practices are being bypassed. The national parliament, the symbol of representative and competitive democracy in Greece, has become purely symbolic and procedural in the way it votes for its austerity laws. External pressures to impose a Special Commissioner to run the country's finances and recommendations regarding the date of national elections -- and the most desirable outcome -- are all attacking the heart of Greece's democracy, its sovereignty. To be sure, Greek democracy was far from perfect before, suffering from clientelism, nepotism and corruption, but it had made significant strides since the country's entry into the European Community in 1981. Similarly, national sovereignty had become vulnerable way before 2009, as a result of increasing debt to unsustainable levels and a state deficit whose extent was not even calculated properly. Yet what we are seeing now is the undermining of Greece's political class, and a fall in levels of trust in the political system. The historical responsibility for this state of affairs lies with domestic mismanagement, political incompetence and the constant missed opportunities for reform. This unprecedented level of economic recession and social alienation means Greek democracy is moving backwards at a rapid pace. In times of crises, history comes back with a vengeance. There are those who revisit the past in order to understand what went wrong and blame the main culprits for the impasse. Others refer to similar historical parallels and focus their attention on comparable historical moments. Indeed during the history of modern Greece, democracy has often suffered from instability, uncertainty, military intervention and authoritarian or exclusionary practices. A frequently mentioned historical reference is the interwar period, when the economic crisis shook the Greek political environment, and led to instability, military coups and eventually the fascist dictatorship under politician Ioannis Metaxas in 1936. Some remember the years of Nazi occupation during Second World War and the humiliating blow to Greece's national dignity, a very popular reference in present-day Greece and an impulsive reaction to the current pressure from Germany. Others refer to the more recent past of the post-war period of the 1950s and 1960s when the country suffered from an exclusionary and defective semi-democratic process led by the triarchy of the monarchy, the military and the right-wing forces. This type of illiberal and exclusive democracy led to the imposition of the military junta in 1967. As with these historical examples, observers of the current political instability are worried about the high levels of disapproval among Greece's political class, the extent of social reaction and mobilization on the street and the degree of political polarization. Greece is gradually losing its middle class, the pillar of the political center, as politics is increasingly dominated by extremists of both sides. As usually happens during political instability, the extremists are the ones that gain in strength while those in the center become most vulnerable. Indeed, recent opinion polls show a remarkable defeat of the two-party system -- the center left (PASOK) and the center right (New Democracy) -- as voters move towards left-wing politics and, occasionally, the extreme fascist right. In the past, Greek democracy often suffered from polarized and extreme politics. But the reasons were endogenous and had to do with the balance of power between the military, the monarchy and party politics, and the reactions of those who were excluded and wanted to participate in the political process. Politics in post-civil war Greece was a clear example of polarization and political exclusion. For the first time since the 1974 transition to democracy, Greek democracy has experienced an unprecedented level of development and consolidation which is inter-connected with the country's membership of the European Community. Ironically, it is the source of Greece's democratic strength that threatens today the achievement of the past four decades. For the first time, the threat to Greece's democracy comes from the club of western democratic states, who treasure liberty, promote and assist democracy and use their normative soft power in international politics. It is a democratic German ruling political class, a democratic government fully accountable to its citizens, which recommends a commissioner, suggests that technocratic governments are maybe more efficient and is afraid of Greek national elections. It is the eurogroup of the democratically elected financial ministers of the rich, prosperous northern European countries that is curtailing the choices of a free government and are demanding the strict supervision of a fellow member state. Greek democracy is threatened by the very entity that contributed to its consolidation. Greek democracy is not in danger of falling into the hands of the military because the Greek military is confined to its barracks, is well under civilian rule and military rulers have no interest in political intervention -- not that there is any political power left to seize anyway. The danger to Greece's democracy comes from abroad, where the urge for the economic competitiveness of the country through internal devaluation is hurting political competitiveness and freedom of choice. Since its inception as an independent state, Greece has looked to the west to improve its democracy, for the emulation of models in the state administration and education and legal systems. The West has been the main orientation of a country on the periphery of Europe's geography, which provided the templates for reform and modernization. More recently, the accession into the European Community unleashed all the benevolent forces of Greek democracy in the company of the most advanced democracies of the world. And countless times, Greece and other southern European countries were presented as excellent examples of democratic consolidation, examples to be followed by the post-communist central and east European states. The European Union has been the beacon of constitutional practices, human rights, party political competition, and the main source of strength of the international standing of its member states. What we are seeing now in Greece is democratic regression to pre-membership levels, polarized politics, the undermining of the ruling classes and the loss of national sovereignty. Soon the country will urgently need a ""pre-accession strategy"" of political reconstruction, next to a much-required strategy for economic growth. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Othon Anastasakis.","Financial crisis is attacking the heart of Greek democracy and sovereignty .
Greek politics are increasingly dominated by extremists on both sides .
Finance ministers of northern Europe are curtailing the choices of a free government .

"Cartagena, Colombia (CNN) -- Cartagena , the historic jewel of Colombia's Caribbean coast, is a secret that's getting out. The city's spectacular setting is a draw in itself. Protected by ancient stone walls that enclose its vibrant port, Cartagena is almost entirely surrounded by the Caribbean Sea. Pink, yellow and purple buildings line the cobblestone streets of the old city, faded after centuries under the powerful sun. Billowing flower boxes droop over balconies, drawing the eye up Spanish colonial facades. Painted doors of all shapes and sizes open onto lush courtyards or mysterious wine cellars. Behind many doors visitors will find first-class dining and some of the most interesting boutique shopping in the Caribbean. Between January and August 2010, more than 111,000 international visitors came to Colombia, up 9% from the year before, according to Colombian immigration authorities. Of those visitors, 11% made Cartagena their primary destination. Historically, Colombia's struggles with crime have scared away tourists. But violence associated with Colombia's infamous drug trafficking is steadily declining, and Cartagena continues to be one of the safest cities in Colombia. Another darker side of history dates back much further: the Spanish Inquisition. Cartagena was a vital seaport for Spain after colonists founded the city in 1533, and the coastal city remained under Spanish rule for more than 275 years. In 1610, a tribunal was established in Cartagena as part of the effort to preserve Catholic orthodoxy in Spain and its kingdoms. The Palacio de la Inquisicion, in the middle of the old city, is not for the faint of heart. Guides will (sometimes gleefully) take visitors through every instrument of torture used against those the Catholic Church deemed heretics. Note: Smiling for photos may feel awkward. Escape the grim scene onto one of Cartagena's grand public squares and you'll find locals singing and selling paintings, CDs, hats and whatever else there is to offer while the old timers look on from benches surrounding the square. Take a walk on the 16th-century walls of the old city. From there, the sea stretches as far as the eye can see. Near the walls, mopeds and buses scurry in and out of the city. The buses are apt to screech to a sudden halt before their stops and pick up again without warning. Riders should try to anticipate the driver's next move, as hopping off at speeds of 10 mph or more seems routine. Getting around can be both alarming and comical. Relax and quench your thirst with some of the most coveted and exotic fruit juices in the world, like guanabana, lulo and nispero. The guanabana with a hint of milk added is a frothy delight. Everywhere you look in town there are fruit stands with tiny windows for taking juice orders. Behind them old ladies use every tool at their disposal to whack and whomp the fruit until the juices pour over the white plastic cups handed out to patrons. One lime-aid guy's reputation as the best in town is confirmed by the lines that form down the street when his cart appears. He works quickly, making a delicious drink out of the most basic of recipes: hand-chopped ice, fresh limes and sugar. If you want to explore beyond the city walls, arrange a boat ride at the harbor and watch the old city merge into the new as you pull away from the dock. Modern glass towers occupy a thin stretch of peninsula called Bocagrande. They appear to be built from the sea up to the sky and provide a sharp contrast to the adjacent old city. An hour's boat ride will get you to the Rosario Islands. The local beaches in Cartagena are somewhat grimy and tourists often opt for a daytime excursion. Lay out on a sunbed overlooking the sea and snooze to the sound of the waves softly crashing on the beach. For a more active afternoon, try scuba diving and snorkeling offshore. Spend the rest of the day noshing on fresh seafood and fruit. Boat back into town to dry off and watch the sunset at the CafÃ© del Mar. It's a hot spot that attracts tourists and locals and rests on top of the stone walls that surround the city. Enjoy a michelada (a local favorite of beer with lime juice in a salt rimmed glass) and watch the sunset over the Caribbean. Once the sun goes down, the cafÃ© heats up with go-go dancers whose silhouettes are framed against the dark sea by smoke machines and laser lights. Stroll down into the city through plazas shadowed by cathedrals and peppered with restaurants. Travelers on a budget can find yummy eats at the more casual restaurants with seating spilling out onto the plazas. Sit outside and you may have a front row seat to an impromptu musical performance. You'll need a reservation at La Vitrola, one of Cartagena's most famous restaurants. Occasionally a bodyguard of a distinguished political patron will be waiting outside, leaving the regular diner to wonder who might be sitting at the next table.

"BELLEVUE, Nebraska (CNN) -- A woman walked slowly toward the door of the abortion clinic when a nearby protester screamed, ""Don't kill your baby!"" About 100 women's rights supporters were on hand Saturday outside an abortion clinic in Bellevue, Nebraska. But the shouts on this day were drowned out by women's rights groups who gathered at the Abortion & Contraception Clinic of Nebraska in Bellevue, just south of Omaha. ""Welcome! Welcome! This clinic stays open,"" abortion supporters chanted in unison, their voices rising every time anti-abortion activists tried to shout at patients arriving at the clinic. Anti-abortion groups, led by Operation Rescue, and supporters of abortion rights rallied Saturday outside the clinic operated by LeRoy Carhart, one of the nation's few remaining doctors who perform late-term abortions. Carhart was best friends with George Tiller, one of the world's most well-known doctors performing abortions. Tiller was shot in the head at point-blank range on May 31 as services began at Reformation Lutheran Church in Wichita, Kansas. Scott Roeder, a 51-year-old anti-abortion activist, is charged in Tiller's killing. He has pleaded not guilty. The rally in Bellevue came nearly three months to the day after Tiller's killing. A massive police presence, including heavily armed rapid-response teams, monitored the demonstrators. Streets were blocked off, and police kept both sides separated with buffer zones in between. Abortion rights supporters outnumbered their opponents nearly 2 to 1. Operation Rescue drove in two of their so-called Truth Trucks, delivery trucks with giant billboards of dismembered fetuses on the sides. The vehicles parked in a designated area outside the clinic to gasps from the women's rights groups. Police used sniffer dogs to make sure the vehicles did not have any explosives before allowing them to park. Megan Belleavia called the trucks abortion ""pornography"" that shouldn't be allowed. ""You can't stand out in the street corner and show pictures of a bare-breasted woman without getting in trouble, so why should they be able to show that?"" she said. About 50 anti-abortion demonstrators prayed near the trucks, asking God to forgive what was happening inside the clinic. One woman held a sign that said, "" I like to listen to my Mommy's voice."" About 10 people stood with red tape over their mouths, with the word ""Life"" written across it. Mike Whitaker said the tape symbolized ""the silent cry that the babies have when they're actually being killed in there."" As he spoke, about a dozen abortion-rights supporters stood on the clinic property, their backs to those who oppose abortions. ""A woman has a right to choose,"" they sang. ""A lot of towns will have things that stick out, positive things. This is something that's really a negative, a huge negative, for the city to have an abortion clinic here,"" said Whitaker, a 30-year resident of Bellevue. Whitaker said he comes nearly every Saturday to pray for Carhart and those inside. Larry Donlan of Rescue the Heartland said, ""What we're doing today is what we do every day that this killing center is open. We're here to give assistance to mothers and pray for the dead and the wounded,"" Donlan said. In all, about 100 women's rights supporters were on hand, spread out over the clinic property and near its entrance. Dozens gathered along a main street holding signs that read ""Dr. Carhart is a hero"" and ""Keep abortion legal."" When passing cars honked at them, they responded with loud hurrahs. Michelle Fadeley drove from the Chicago area to support Carhart. ""Someone who is willing to put his own life on the line to save thousands of other women's lives is truly a hero,"" said Fadeley, who works for a local Illinois chapter of the National Organization for Women. Anthony Hardwick of Omaha clutched a sign that read ""Women are not an incubator."" ""What it means to me is that women are not solely for the purpose of procreation. They're not little vessels for men to plant their seeds in,"" he said. Supporters of women's rights groups spread the word ahead of Saturday's demonstration that Operation Rescue was coming to protest outside Carhart's clinic. In the wake of the killing of Tiller, they said they wanted to show up in large numbers; supporters from at least 16 states were present Saturday. Troy Newman, the president of Operation Rescue, was unfazed by it all. He has pledged to try to shut down Carhart's clinic. Operation Rescue and other anti-abortion groups have asked Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning to investigate the clinic, alleging it has ""an unacceptable safety risk to women."" Bruning has referred the matter to the state Department of Health and Human Services. A spokeswoman for the health department would only say they're looking into the matter and that Carhart's clinic has been in compliance with the law in previous inspections over the last decade. ""This is the beginning, not the end,"" Newman said outside the clinic. ""All these NOW women will go home tomorrow, but we're going to be embedded here in the community."" Inside, Carhart continued to perform abortions.","Protests take place nearly three months to the day Dr. George Tiller was killed .

"Gainesville, Georgia (CNN) -- Kelsey Trusty plans almost everything, but getting cancer was one thing she didn't anticipate. Yet what began as an unexpected health crisis has led to an untapped source of creativity that helps her pay for treatment. In October 2011, the 22-year-old nursing student from Gainesville, Georgia, was in the middle of her first year of nursing school, a job at a hospital and organizing her wedding when she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. In the blink of an eye, Trusty made the transition from physician-in-training to patient. She began a month-long hospital stay to receive chemotherapy and blood transfusions. ""I was in the hospital with quite a bit of time on my hands,"" Trusty said. ""I'm not the kind of person who can just sit and watch TV all day. I needed something to do to keep me sane."" Inspired by a post her mother saw on Pinterest, Trusty began braiding scarves out of old T-shirts. After perfecting her method, she shared her work on Facebook, thinking maybe a few people would want one. Much to her surprise, demand was instant. After her diagnosis, she had to quit school because her treatment included extended hospital stays. But soon enough, she found she had nearly a full-time job filling scarf orders. The scarves come in a variety of styles and sizes, and customers can choose the colors. Trusty makes the scarves by cutting strips of T-shirt material and braiding them together. Sometimes, her hands tremble from chemotherapy as she adds a hand-stitched logo featuring the leukemia awareness ribbon. ""It went from zero to 60 very quickly,"" she said. ""I think it really appealed to people being able to customize them."" Trusty set about branding her product, naming her budding business ""Tussle"" in a nod to her battle with leukemia. Her best friend created a logo and she set up a Facebook page for the business. She even has her own shipping labels, ""And that made me feel really fancy,"" she said. Profits from the scarves have had a tremendous impact on her out-of-pocket medical expenses, she said, covering co-payments for doctor's visits and subsidizing the cost of cancer treatment. Meanwhile, she's still getting ready for her wedding in July. ""No one ever expects to be paying for a wedding and chemotherapy at the same time,"" she said. ""It's an incredible burden lifted off my shoulders and my family's shoulders."" In addition to the positive financial impact, Trusty is also using her creativity to help other cancer patients. Last month, Trusty auctioned off one of her scarves, donating the proceeds to another cancer patient. ""It's nice to be able to use something that's helped me to help other people as well,"" Trusty said. ""I'm a people-pleaser by nature, so it helps me stay positive when I see other people happy as well."" She has shipped scarves all over the country and as far away as England. One of the best things about the experience has been meeting new people in her community and beyond and sharing stories with them, she said. ""I make scarves mainly for people who I've never met before,"" she said. ""And so it's been a really cool way for me to meet people in my community and get to know people who I probably never would have gotten the chance to meet before."" She is unsure of what her future holds after treatment, but the experience has given her an appreciation for the unpredictability of life and the value of every day. ""Right now, I don't know what the plan is for me, and that's scary,"" she said. ""But my God tells me, and my experience tells me, that I don't need to worry about planning the next step.""","Kelsey Trusty started braiding scarves out of T-shirts during hospital stay .

"(CNN) -- The son of late evangelist Oral Roberts and former president of Oral Roberts University was arrested early Tuesday on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol and speeding, authorities said. Richard Roberts, 63, was stopped by the Oklahoma Highway Patrol just after midnight after a trooper observed him traveling at about 93 mph on a turnpike in his Mercedes-Benz sedan, according to an arrest report. The speed limit on the road is 65 mph, the report said. The trooper ""detected the strong odor of an alcoholic beverage about Roberts' breath and person,"" the report said, and Roberts failed field sobriety tests. Roberts consented to a breath test, which showed his blood alcohol level at .11%, higher than the .08% limit for legal intoxication. He was booked into the Tulsa County Jail. CNN affiliate KOTV in Tulsa said he posted bond and was released a few hours later. Roberts was president of Oral Roberts University until 2007. Oral Roberts died in 2009. Roberts appears on the television show ""The Place for Miracles: Your Hour of Healing,"" according to the Oral Roberts Ministries website. ""Our prayers go out to Richard and Lindsay Roberts and their entire family as they face this life challenge,"" said Jeremy Burton, spokesman for Oral Roberts University.

"(CNN) -- When the man destined to become China's next leader enters a circa 1866 Victorian house in Muscatine, Iowa, on Wednesday, things will feel familiar. It was here in the town's historic district that Xi Jinping first feasted on Iowa beef and corn during a visit more than two decades ago. Wednesday, the menu is a tad more upscale -- tenderloin, spring rolls and bacon-wrapped scallops. And the excitement, decidedly more palpable. After all, back in 1985, Xi was a provincial official from the hog-farming region of Hebei, Iowa's ""sister state."" He wanted to see how Americans raised their livestock and learn about different applications of corn, said Sarah Lande, owner of the Victorian and host of Xi's visit. She would have been thrilled to have another Hebei province official visit quiet Muscatine. She's honored and humbled that Xi chose to see his old friends again. In the United States for a five-day visit, Xi, who is widely expected to become the next Communist Party leader and president of Asia's economic powerhouse, met Tuesday with President Barack Obama and other top U.S. officials in Washington. Obama and Xi discuss economics, human rights . But part of Wednesday is reserved for a private visit to this small eastern Iowa town known for farming, the largest Heinz plant outside of Pittsburgh and factories that used to spit out billions of mother-of-pearl buttons. That was before the refinement of plastic. Now with Xi's visit, the global spotlight will shine on Muscatine, if only for an hour on Wednesday. The town has never seen so many security personnel. Nor have the high school boys swim champions had to share headlines before in the local newspaper. As Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad put it: This is the biggest thing to hit Muscatine since Pope John Paul II's visit in 1979. Chris Steinbach, editor of the Muscatine Journal, said he had received thousands of e-mails from journalists around the world who were curious about Xi's visit. ""It's obviously a pretty big deal,"" said Steinbach, ""You never know what will come as a result of this kitchen-table diplomacy."" That kind of one-on-one relationship made an impression on Xi on his first trip to Iowa. ""When you get the opportunity to meet somebody in their home or in a private setting, you get to know them differently than at a state dinner,"" Steinbach said. ""Clearly that worked on Mr. Xi when he was here 27 years ago."" Rewind to a time when Mikhail Gorbachev was ascending to the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, Terry Anderson was taken hostage in Lebanon and Tiananmen Square was just another place in Beijing. Xi arrived in Muscatine for two weeks in April 1985 with a Chinese delegation looking into farming technology. Doyle Tubandt, president of Muscatine Foods Corp., recalled how Xi discussed globalization, its scope then unimaginable to many Americans. ""Here we are 27 years later and it sure is,"" said Tubandt about the global economy. His own company now exports food and pet products to China. Back then, Tubandt escorted Xi on a tour of a corn processing plant. At times, the language barrier was hard to overcome. How do you translate words like centrifuge? Tubandt gestured heavily and drew drawings in the sand to explain things to his Chinese visitor. He kept a tin of black tea that Xi presented to him as a memento of the visit. After all these years, the tin is preserved half full. For all the talk of trade between Washington and Beijing, in Muscatine it will all be very personal. ""He is coming only to visit old friends,"" Lande said. It has been a lot of work, a bit crazy for a one-hour visit, Lande said. But it's worth it to have an old friend back. Both Lande and Tubandt have given thought to what they might say when they come face-to-face with China's presumptive next president. ""It's a bit daunting when I think about it, so I don't try to think about it very much,"" Tubandt said. ""It's telling to me that he's coming here. He understands the importance of long-term friendships."" Lande said she wasn't nervous until she woke up Tuesday. ""What can you say when you have one minute to say it?"" Lande said she will talk about building a bridge to friendship in the future, and hope that Iowa can set a global example. It's not often Muscatine residents have a chance to do that.","Xi Jinping is scheduled to visit Muscatine, Iowa, on Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- ""The thing that kind of brought it to a head was I was overworking myself,"" Nick Cannon told Piers Morgan. The entertainer thought he was just suffering from a bad cold at the time, telling the CNN host, ""My body went into overload."" Nick Cannon spoke out on Friday's ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" about the recent health scare that left him fighting for his life. Cannon, who hosts ""America's Got Talent,"" used to co-host the NBC series with Morgan. Cannon was suffering from kidney failure. But his health woes didn't stop there. ""Through a bunch of tests and studies,"" said Cannon, ""they found out that I have lupus nephritis, which is an autoimmune disease. ... It's a rare one. Mine was a very rare case, but it's attacking only my kidneys."" Not only was Cannon, 31, suffering from lupus nephritis very seriously, but the condition made him more prone to getting blood clots. ""I was trying to do everything to prevent that,"" said Cannon. ""I was wearing the surgical stockings, I was on a blood thinner, so many different things while I was in the hospital."" After hosting the Super Bowl preshow, Cannon started feeling pain again, this time above the kidneys. He had two clots in his lungs, fluid around the lungs and an enlarged heart -- all a result of his kidneys not functioning properly. Cannon maintains he remained optimistic throughout the ordeal. ""I never got to that stage where I was like, 'OK, this is it,'"" said the entertainer, ""but I knew the severity of the situation."" Referring to himself as a ""glass-is-half-full type of guy,"" Cannon insisted he ""never went to that place, even though I knew it was very serious."" Doctors ordered Cannon to get at least six hours of sleep a night, and he quit his five-hour radio show to focus on his health -- much to the relief or his wife, pop superstar Mariah Carey. Cannon joked that he calls his wife ""Dr. Carey"" because ""she knows when I'm supposed to take my medicine, what I'm supposed to eat... "" Cannon said Carey has been taking care of him and the couple's twins -- a boy and a girl, Monroe and Moroccan, who turn 1 next month -- throughout the entire ordeal. ""She is such a pro,"" said Cannon. ""She knows all the home remedies."" Cannon said that he is relishing the family time. ""That's what it's all about,"" said Cannon. ""Family is first."" Morgan, who covered Whitney Houston's funeral for CNN, told Cannon that he was touched by the tweet Cannon sent out upon hearing the news of Houston's death. Cannon's tweet read: ""Tell our loved ones how much we love them while they're still here. I wish I could have told Whitney how great she was one last time."" Carey, who was a close friend of Houston's, attended the funeral, but Cannon was hospitalized at the time. ""I know what she was dealing with and how people just started to come and let her know how special she was and how to keep her head up,"" recalled Cannon. ""It's like everybody needs to hear that, you know? We want to send the flowers while people can still smell them."" Watch Piers Morgan Tonight weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- The body of a girl whose disappearance triggered a public outcry in Argentina was found naked inside a garbage bag in Buenos Aires Wednesday afternoon, authorities said. It was a tragic ending to the story of Candela Rodriguez, 11, who became an icon and symbol for the more than 200 missing children in the country. ""My God, they killed my daughter!"" Candela's mother, Carola Labrador, shouted at the scene after identifying the body, the state-run Telam news agency reported. Candela's family went to the media immediately after she went missing on August 22. But it was when social media sites like Twitter picked up and shared her case that Candela became a top story. Argentinean celebrities called for her safe return home, and President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner met with Labrador. But all the attention did not save the young girl. On Thursday, people placed cards and candles in a makeshift memorial at her home. Police are investigating the motive for Candela's kidnapping and killing, though early indications point to an extortion plot against her father. Candela's father, Alfredo Rodriguez, is serving a three-year prison sentence for belonging to a ""street pirate"" gang, Telam reported. The girl's aunt received a call after her disappearance from someone who threatened to kill Candela if her father did not return some money he owed, the agency reported. Police located a house in which they believe Candela was held and were searching it, Telam reported. Her body was found in a lot where a demolished building once stood, by someone who was sifting through trash there.","Candela Rodriguez was missing since August 22 .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- In Beijing in August, Ethiopian runner Haile Gebrselassie will once again find himself staring down the 10,000 meters of rubberized track that curls between him and a third gold medal in the Olympic event. Gebrselassie goes on a training run with companions at home in Addis Ababa. He won gold in 1996 and 2000, but finished a disappointing fifth in 2004 when a problem with his Archilles tendon hampered training in the lead up to Athens. This time it's different. He's pounding a well-worn path on often twice-daily runs through the streets of his hometown of Addis Ababa. He's older and injury-free. In 2004, he was under pressure to become the first man in history to win gold over 10,000 meters in three consecutive Olympics. Now it's not even his first choice of race to run. ""I'm not interested in the 10,000 meters,"" he says; a somewhat surprising statement from a man just weeks away from competing in the world's greatest ever sporting event, the pinnacle of any athlete's career. The problem is he's been there, done that and recognizes that he's unlikely to match his younger opponents in speed over the distance. In Beijing, he'll be toeing the starting line with the current world champion Kenenisa Bekele and Sileshi Sihine, both Ethiopians who finished first and second in Athens in 2004. ""They're in good shape. They're already superior athletes,"" Gebrselassie says. ""For me to be there, it's not for Bekele or Sihine, just to be in the group, to stay together, to share their experience. Most of them they know how to compete, they know how to win."" In March, Gebrselassie made the highly-publicized decision not to contest the Olympic marathon in Beijing. He insists it's not a slight against China and the Olympic organizers but, as an asthmatic, he says the risks to his health are too great. Running the 10,000 meters was a compromise, says Jos Hermens of Global Sports Communication, Gebrselassie's manager. Haile didn't want to disappoint his fans and fellow countrymen who had been expecting him to race. ""Of course he's running for himself also,"" Hermens says, ""But for him, it's a team effort to run for his country. He'll be very happy if the other two guys are doing well. I think Haile would be very happy with a bronze medal."" Would he? ""Yeah, absolutely,"" Gebrselassie insists. ""The 10,000 meters is not my event any more. If I won bronze, fine. Even if I don't compete, I don't mind."" While the Beijing Olympics might merit a small note on Gebrselassie's calendar, there is a big red circle marked around September 28th, the date of the Berlin Marathon, just five weeks later. ""One of my targets this year is the Berlin Marathon, to run a good time and if possible surpass the world record,"" he says. It's a record he set in spectacular style last November, covering the 42 kilometers in just two hours, four minutes and 26 seconds. It was his 25th world record. He attempted to better the time at the Dubai Marathon in January, but missed out by a mere 27 seconds, a failure Gebrselassie blames on over-enthusiasm at the start; he just ran too fast. ""I paid the price at the end because I could not push anymore, especially the last seven or eight kilometers,"" he says. In Berlin, he's hoping to strike the right balance of restraint and speed to take him over the line first and fastest. It won't be an easy feat. Training for the 10,000 meters is all about speed. After the Olympics he'll literally have to switch gears to work on his strength and stamina. ""It's not a normal preparation for a marathon,"" Gebrselassie's manager, Jos Hermens says. ""Normally you have a few months of preparation. It's kind of new territory he will be in."" ""I think it will be OK because Haile's 35 and his body is a running machine,"" Hermens says. ""He's done so much endurance, but you don't know how the body will react. For him and for us it's something to see because it's never been done before at this level."" Gebrselassie is not fazed. He's simply merged training for the two disciplines into one unconventional schedule. ""I'm trying to work on endurance and a bit of speed. If I move completely to speed work I lose the benefits of the endurance training. I'm trying to handle both,"" he says. It seems a lot of work for someone who's conceded that his days as the fastest man over 10,000 meters are over. He's already passed the baton to Kenenisa Bekele, who bettered his world record over the distance in 2004, and again in 2005, at a blistering 26:17.53. Gebrselassie may not be putting money on himself to win in Beijing, but he's in no doubt that one of his Ethiopian team mates will be first across the line. ""For sure,"" he says, ""No question about it.""","Marathon runner Haile Gebrselassie is one of Ethopia's most celebrated athletes .

"(CNN) -- Interior Department officials announced an extensive restructuring of the agencies that oversee offshore oil drilling Wednesday, pledging ""fundamental change"" for a system widely criticized after the worst oil spill in U.S. history. The expected moves split the since-renamed Minerals Management Service into separate agencies, with one responsible for approving offshore leases and another to enforce safety and environmental laws. Michael Bromwich, the head of the current Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement, told reporters the reorganization is aimed at beefing up safety after ""decades of neglect"" and conflicts of interest among regulators. ""This reorganization is much more than just moving boxes around,"" Bromwich said. ""It is about a comprehensive review and a fundamental change in the way that these agencies operate."" The Interior Department said it plans to have its newly created Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement up and running by October 1. A separate agency to collect revenues from leases was spun off from MMS in 2010. The announcement came eight days after the presidential commission that investigated last April's sinking of the drill rig Deepwater Horizon sharply criticized regulators for their passivity, finding they were outmatched, underfunded and had conflicting responsibilities that prevented them from effective oversight of the offshore oil industry. The sinking killed 11 workers and uncapped an undersea gusher that spewed more than 200 million gallons of crude into the Gulf of Mexico before it was contained in June. Efforts to reshape the MMS began shortly after the explosion. Before the disaster, internal watchdog reports criticized MMS inspectors for accepting meals and tickets to sporting events from oil companies they monitored in the Gulf and found regulators in the agency's Colorado office received improper gifts, engaged in illegal drug use and had inappropriate sexual relationships with energy industry representatives. The Interior Department is also setting up a committee of top scientists and engineers to recommend improvements in offshore safety and well containment procedures. Tom Hunter, the former head of Sandia National Laboratories, will lead that committee, the department announced. ""I think what has become abundantly clear through the various investigations, including the report of the Deepwater Horizon Commission, is that industry moved deeper and deeper into our nation's waters,"" Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said. ""And while the technology for oil and gas drilling in those waters developed very quickly, other technologies that should have come along hand-in-hand simply did not.""","The former Minerals Management Service is being split into permitting and safety bureaus .

"East Haven, Connecticut (CNN) -- Two days after a Connecticut mayor delivered an errant comment about eating tacos to support East Haven Latinos, some of whom are the alleged victims of police mistreatment, Mayor Joseph Maturo Jr. apparently got his wish. Some 500 tacos were delivered to his office Thursday after a Latino activist group called Junta for Progressive Action launched a text-for-tacos campaign to draw attention to the comment, which Maturo later apologized for. In the interview Tuesday, a local reporter pointed out that there were no Latino officers on East Haven's police force. ""And your point being?"" Maturo responded. Asked what he planned to do for the Latino community in light of the discrimination allegations, the mayor said, ""I might have tacos when I go home, I'm not quite sure yet."" That set off the activist group, a local branch of the Reform Immigration for America organization, which said that anytime someone texts the word ""taco"" to 69866, it will deliver a taco to the mayor on their behalf. They've received more than 2,600 texts, the group said in a statement Thursday. ""The mayor has shown a total lack of respect for the constituents he has been sworn to serve to the best of his ability,"" said Henry Fernandez, spokesman for the group. Maturo twice apologized for the comments, saying his words were largely a product of stress. Still, some 500 tacos were placed inside his office; the rest are already being rerouted to local food-assistance outlets. ""The town of East Haven has received an abundance of tacos as a result of the campaign initiated by the group 'Reform Immigration for America,'"" said Maturo in a statement. ""Recognizing that there are many in need in our state, we have arranged for all of the tacos to be donated to local soup kitchens and pantries, including the Downtown Evening Soup Kitchen in New Haven."" He added that ""the events of the past few days have focused our town, and my administration, on the need to deal sensitively and compassionately with the challenges currently facing our town."" On Tuesday, FBI agents arrested four East Haven police officers accused of playing a role in abuse of Latino residents and business owners, performing illegal searches, making false arrests and harassing immigrant rights advocates. The arrests are the first to stem from a federal investigation into racial profiling in the city and follow a scathing December report from the U.S. Justice Department that accused the town's police of engaging in ""discriminatory policing against Latinos.""

"(CNN) -- Heavyweight Dereck Chisora faces being sanctioned by the British Boxing Board of Control, after being called to a hearing next month following his brawl with fellow-Briton David Haye at a press conference on Saturday. Despite Chisora issuing an apology for the fracas, which occured after his points defeat to WBC champion Vitali Klitschko in Munich, the BBBC has released a statement saying that a hearing has been arranged for March 14. Board secretary Robert Smith said: ""Dereck Chisora has been called to appear before the stewards of the British Boxing Board of Control on Wednesday, 14th March under Regulation 25 (misconduct), with regard to his behavior prior, during and after his contest for the World Boxing Council heavyweight championship against Vitali Klitschko on Saturday, 18th February in Munich."" Haye -- who retired from boxing following his defeat to Klitschko's younger brother Wladimir last year and is therefore not under the jurisdiction of the BBBC -- had appeared at the press conference to take issue with Vitali's management, who he claims have reneged on a deal to fight him later this year. But he soon became embroiled in a shouting match with Chisora, which resulted in the 28-year-old leaving his seat on the stage to confront Haye -- resulting in an unseemly brawl which saw Haye's manager Adam Booth receive a gash to his forehead. During the incident, Chisora threatened to ""shoot"" Haye a number of times and the Zimbabwe-born boxer has now ""wholeheartedly apologized"" for his ""inexcusable"" actions. ""I feel I must wholeheartedly apologize for my part in the regrettable scenes both before and after what was to be the biggest night of my career,"" Chisora said in a statement. ""Whilst my behavior was inexcusable, there were many things that went on behind the scenes that ultimately caused my frustrations to boil over, however this is of course no excuse."" He added: ""I cannot go into the specific details at the moment as quite rightly the British Boxing Board of Control will be investigating this matter. ""The bottom line is I have let my family, my team and, worst of all, the sport I love down. I acknowledge that my actions were totally unprofessional, with or without provocation. ""I have a duty as a professional boxer to conduct myself properly at all times, especially with boxing being a sport of controlled aggression. I have let lots of people down on Saturday night, including myself, and for that I am truly sorry."" Haye, who relinquished his boxing license in October when he officially retired, also issued a statement, although he stopped short of apologizing and pinned the blame for the fracas squarely on Chisora's shoulders. He said: ""I realise I am no angel -- and don't mind a bit of professional trash-talk to help raise boxing's profile -- but, during my 21 years in the sport, I have never been involved in, or even witnessed, such a serious fracas. ""I shall happily assist the boxing authorities with any investigation they wish to launch and, ultimately, hope that all lessons learned from this will be implemented."" The brawl was the final act of a controversial weekend for Chisora, who received widespread criticism for slapping Klitschko during the pre-fight weight-in. And Haye continued his statement by adding: ""Moments before declaring he wanted to go face-to-face with me, Chisora assured the gathered media that he would give me 'two slaps'. ""His weekend had already been shrouded in controversy but, despite this, Chisora climbed down from the top table, removed his robe and then walked towards me, entourage in tow, in an aggressive manner. ""I held my ground, but, unfortunately, he caused a serious disturbance to occur, something which threatened to damage the reputation of the sport we both love."" The incident, during which Chisora claimed Haye hit him over the head with a bottle, is still being investigated by Munich police, although police spokesman Gottfried Schlicht said: ""Until we speak to David Haye, nothing more can happen. ""We need both sides. We have heard from Dereck Chisora and now we wait to hear from David Haye.""","British heavyweight Dereck Chisora is called to appear before a hearing next month .

"PIGEON FORGE, Tennessee (CNN) -- When asked if I wanted to bounce down a hill while inside a gigantic inflatable plastic ball, I have to admit, I was intrigued. ""My nerves were in overdrive,"" says CNN.com Live's Melissa Long before her Zorb adventure. My nerves were in overdrive since I was worried I might throw up, and on camera nonetheless, since I'd be harnessed to the interior of this PVC ball as it bounced haphazardly down a hill at up to 30 mph. My curiosity beat out any butterflies, and I signed up for the adventure with two of my CNN.com colleagues. We mapped out our 248-mile trek from downtown Atlanta, Georgia, to Tennessee and packed light. However, I've learned to always have snacks handy to ward off any munchy urges in between bathroom breaks. And, of course, driving can be quite an adventure! I grew up playing ""I spy"" and checking out license plates. This time, we fiddled with satellite radio and iPods, and then despite endless musical options, we realized the real entertainment came from chatting about the small towns we drove through, telling jokes, or attempting to be funny, and learning more about each other.  See map of our route » . After nearly a tank of gas and 3½ hours on the road, we arrived in Pigeon Forge. With the Great Smoky Mountains as a backdrop, we were quickly overwhelmed by the commercialism and realized you could find just about everything you would ever need on this 5-mile stretch known as the ""Parkway,"" or just off of it, including the first North American Zorb site. The Zorb hails from New Zealand and there are fewer than a dozen spots in the world to try it. There are two options if you want to achieve the status of a ""Zorbonaut."" Sign up for the Zorbit run and you'll be harnessed inside the Zorb. At the top of the hill, you'll climb through the Zorb's two foot entry hole and once you're buckled in, the rodeo gate opens and an employee shouts, ""Zorb!"" For the next 30 seconds, you'll bounce up and down, left and right, as the sky and ground appear and then reappear, and you lose all sense of orientation. A child at this site described the experience to me and said it was like being inside a washing machine. I would also say it's similar to the unpredictable path of one of those 10-cent vending machine bouncing balls.  Watch my Zorb experience » . The other option is to try the Zydro which won't toss you upside down. Instead, you'll speed down the hill just as you would on a waterslide, except this time you're sitting in water and surrounded by clear, flexible plastic that echoes your laughs. You can't possibly make it down the 1,000-foot track without getting soaked! Personally, I preferred the Zydro experience since you can climb into the ball with a friend and share the zigzagging. When you're harnessed and bouncing solo, you can scream or smile all you want, but there's no one to laugh with. Indoor skydiving . We quickly discovered the Zorb isn't the only facility for people craving excitement in Pigeon Forge.  See photos of our trip » . There's a smorgasbord of activities such as Dolly Parton's famed theme park, Dollywood, go-karts, water rides, laser tag and indoor skydiving. Several years ago, I went skydiving and was anxious to compare. Here's a perfect example of a first impression being terribly wrong! I thought indoor skydiving would be easy. Real skydiving was a cinch in comparison since I was strapped to an expert who did the bulk of the work and all I really had to do was get the courage to do it and admire the view below. After a short video and training class at this U.S. Flyaway facility, you'll be fitted for the full body suit, goggles, helmet and earplugs. The earplugs will come in handy since the wind tunnel is loud from the jet engine which creates the 120-mph column of air inside. Depending on your abilities, you may find yourself from three to 12 feet above a metal, mesh-like trampoline secured over the jet engine.  Watch me learn to fly indoors » . Other tourists also properly suited are allowed inside, and one at a time you'll be motioned onto the mesh to learn to ""fly"" with the trained instructor. At first, operators wait until you're flat on your stomach on top of the wire grate to really fire up the engine. Once you get a feel for it, you'll ""dive"" or jump, which is more difficult than it looks. With indoor skydiving, just like with regular skydiving, you must properly position your lower back, head, arms and legs. Even the slightest movement can alter your alignment, and you may find yourself curled up in a ball on the padding which lines the funnel. I'll admit I never came close to mastering the techniques. Expert skydivers often rely on wind tunnel facilities to try out their tricks before performing them after jumping out of a plane. I was thankful one of the instructors, who had worked at the Pigeon Forge facility for 12 years, was willing to show off his amazing acrobatic abilities! In addition to the thrills, just like the Las Vegas Strip lined with hotels and casinos, the Pigeon Forge ""Parkway"" is packed with small affordable motels and larger hotels. There are also endless souvenir shops and chain restaurants lining the street. Designed for ""family fun,"" all of these attractions transform this tiny town of 5,800 residents into a major destination for more than 10 million visitors a year looking for excitement. And of course, there's another kind of adventure waiting just a few miles up the road, in the Great Smoky Mountains.

"Editor's note: Jordan Lorence is senior legal counsel for the Alliance Defense Fund, a nonprofit organization of Christian attorneys. He has litigated religious liberty and free speech cases since 1984, including the Southworth case before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1999, involving mandatory student fees at public universities, and a 2004 case that resulted in a California Supreme Court ruling that marriage licenses issued by San Francisco to same-sex couples were invalid. Jordan Lorence says Rick Warren's views on marriage shouldn't bar him from Barack Obama's inauguration. SCOTTSDALE, Arizona (CNN) -- Proponents of redefining marriage couldn't wait for the new president to be sworn in before demanding that he erase from the inauguration ceremony a prominent American who disagrees with them. The target of their rhetorical bombardment is Rick Warren, the popular Christian pastor from Southern California. President-elect Barack Obama has asked Warren to give the invocation at his inauguration. Not so fast, cries Kathryn Kolbert, head of People for the American Way, an organization that claims to advance equality and freedom of speech and religion (but not for Rick Warren and those who agree with his marriage views) in a piece published on CNN.com. Warren's grave sin? Along with 52 percent of California voters, he supported California's Proposition 8, which affirmed the definition of marriage as between one man and one woman. What a radical! Though Warren will only be praying for the country's future (not giving a speech about marriage), Kolbert and others are pressuring Obama to set a precedent for his administration of publicly shunning someone who supports the traditional definition of marriage. They want people like Warren silenced and ostracized for their ""hate speech,"" defined today as disagreeing with their agenda to impose a redefinition of marriage on an unwilling America. Obama, to his credit, has resisted their strident demands. The attacks on Warren are the latest in a series of coercive, intimidating attacks on supporters of traditional marriage. Now, activists have ramped up their strong-arm tactics by pushing the president-elect to ban Warren from appearing at the inauguration. This is amazingly audacious, in light of the fact that on marriage, the overwhelming majority of Americans and, indeed, humanity, agrees with Warren. Americans have voted to preserve marriage in all 30 states where it has been on the ballot by an average vote of more than 65 percent. The collective experience and wisdom of every major civilization from the dawn of time agrees that societies function best and children are best protected when marriage is defined as between one man and one woman. Warren and those who agree with him want all nations to experience these benefits of marriage when it is rightly defined and consistently practiced. Ironically, Obama has repeatedly stated that he agrees ""that marriage is the union between a man and a woman."" Does Kolbert question his fitness to serve as president in light of his allegedly ""bigoted"" views on marriage? Kolbert brazenly denies that she and other activists desire to silence pastors like Warren because of their marriage views. She is indignant that Warren and others spread the ""big lie"" that redefining marriage would threaten the freedom of speech and religious liberties of those who hold the view shared by the vast majority of Americans. Her argument is disarming in its pure duplicity. Part of Kolbert's case against Warren, who she thinks should not be speaking at such an important public ceremony, is that he believes that folks like her are working to ban people like him from speaking at public ceremonies. Thus, the ""big lie"" becomes an obvious truth. This is really all about ideological purity -- and purging. Are the activists proposing that no one should be permitted to speak at the inauguration if they hold beliefs on marriage contrary to hers and her ideological bedfellows? How can publicly snubbing the influential and respected Warren advance what Kolbert calls ""the values of unity and respect ... on which President-elect Obama campaigned?"" It won't. But it will surely send a message to those who believe in marriage, that they will be viciously attacked for expressing, or merely believing, that marriage is defined as between one man and one woman. Ms. Kolbert provides just the latest example of how the forces of ""tolerance"" and ""diversity"" quickly abandon their principles of ""live and let live"" when somebody disagrees with them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jordan Lorence.","Jordan Lorence: Barack Obama has asked Rick Warren to give the invocation .

"(CNN) -- The Iowa caucus is Tuesday and so far, this shaky bunch of challengers has done a better job of telling us why Obama should not be re-elected than telling us why they would be any better. And yet, one of these candidates must be declared the winner, which is a big reason why 70% of Americans want the election to be over even before it officially begins. Yeah, a lot of voters have already made up their minds based upon party affiliation, but I believe most Americans dread being manipulated for 10 more months by an onslaught of isolated statistics, abbreviated facts and slick campaign ads. We're sick of the bull -- but it seems you have to be knee deep in it in to vote, and covered head-to-toe to run. Which is why politics is dirty and Washington stinks. Remember when then-Sen. Obama promised to change all that? Sure the cantankerous tea party didn't help, but really we knew that ""hope and change"" wasn't going to happen shortly after questions about his faith began to dog him in 2007 and voters wondered if he was a Muslim. The president Obama promised to be would have said, ""This is America, where we have freedom of religion and the fact that this is being used as a way to characterize me as unfit to be president is not only religious bigotry, it's unconstitutional and un-American."" However, the politically savvy candidate handled such rumors by reiterating he was a Christian, which left many dissatisfied because he played the game almost as soon as he promised not to. Which is why the compromises he's made over the past three years should not come as a surprise. That doesn't make him a bad president or a bad person. It just makes him a politician. And while the message of his first campaign hypnotized many to believe he wasn't, the reality is the word ""politician"" is in every sentence of the president of the United States' job description. So for all of you folks in Iowa as well as New Hampshire and South Carolina who are jazzed up over the piety of Rick Santorum, business smarts of Mitt Romney or the whatever of whomever, keep this in mind: The question in national politics isn't which candidate is best suited to lead but rather which candidate is going to mislead the least, because they all do it. Early and often. A cursory glance at the record and statements of the GOP candidates as well as President Obama shows a heap of flip-flops. Backtracking. Beltway bipartisanship, which does not reflect a politician's ability to get along with the folks across the aisle but rather the propensity for Democrats and Republicans to say, do and vote however they think they need to stay in the building. Keep their seat. Get in office. I don't regret voting for Obama, especially considering that Sen. John McCain's way of playing the game could have resulted in putting Sarah Palin within a heartbeat of the presidency, but I wouldn't classify myself as an Obama supporter either. I'm not a supporter of any politician or party, for that matter. I'm a supporter of ideas. I'm a supporter of principles, none of which should be dumbed down to religious practices, contingent on polls or assigned to a specific party because at the end of the day, they're after one thing: self preservation. ""What's best for the country?"" is really just a campaign slogan. For example, the Democrat-controlled 111th Congress can rewrite history any way they want, but voters can see they did not pass a comprehensive budget in 2009 because they did not want to make decisions that could be used against Democrats up for re-election in 2010. This is also the reason why the Congress waited until after the midterm election to overturn ""don't ask, don't tell."" Or look how the professorial Newt Gingrich told us Herman Cain would be a good president, even though we all witnessed Cain struggle to talk intelligently about Libya, China or even huge chunks of the United States. Santorum massaged his stance on abortion and endorsement of Romney in 2008 once he decided to run for president himself. Rick Perry called the stimulus package a failure while neglecting to talk about how he used stimulus money to balance his state's budget and create the jobs he talks so much about. Meanwhile, Romney, who made millions in no small part by laying off thousands of Americans for a living, calls himself a job creator. I don't even think Yoda would have tried a Jedi mind trick like that. And yet there he is and here they are: our choices for 2012. I don't know about you but all I want is a stronger economy and not to be blown up by Iran or a crazy guy with a bomb sewn into his tighty-whities. Seems like a simple request but as we all know, there's very little about running a country with more than 300 million people and the world's largest economy that is simple. Or from the look of things, honest. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: 70% of Americans wish the election was over .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A Spanish woman -- who at age 66 gave birth to twins -- has died less than three years later, a local official and a family member told CNN Thursday. Maria del Carmen Bousada gave birth in December 2006 in Barcelona, after receiving in vitro fertilization treatment in California. At the time of the birth, she was believed to have been the world's oldest new mother. Bousada died Saturday at her home in the southern Spanish town of El Puerto de Santa Maria, said the family member, who identified herself as the wife of Jose Luis Bousada, whom she said was a nephew of the deceased. ""She has died. I was at the wake in Cadiz,"" said the woman, who declined on the phone to give her name. CNN reached her at the phone book-listed residence of Jose Luis Bousada in Cadiz, the nearby city where Bousada spent most of her life. The death was widely reported in Spain. The local official told CNN that Bousada was cremated at the Greater Cadiz Bay cemetery Sunday morning but that the cemetery did not list that on its Web site, which is customary, because the family asked to keep it secret. The local official, who spoke on condition of not being identified, said he talked Thursday with the cemetery manager, who confirmed the cremation. She would have been 69 at the time of death. The woman's twin boys, named Pau and Christian, will be three-years old in December. They are being cared for by a nephew of the deceased, a family member said. Spanish news reports said Bousada had been diagnosed with a tumor around the time of the birth, which occurred about a week before her 67th birthday. British tabloid News of the World said Bousada lied to a California fertility clinic about her age and said she was 55, just in case they refused to treat her. In an interview last year, Bousada told the paper that -- since her mother lived to be 101 -- she figured she would live long enough to raise the children. A retired department store employee who was not married, she reportedly lived most of her life with her mother in Cadiz, and decided to have children after her mother died in 2005, selling her home to raise cash for the fertility treatment. ""God didn't let her enjoy her children very much. He should have given her more time,"" said Pilar Pinto, who runs a fresh produce business in El Puerto de Santa Maria. ""The kids are with a nephew of Bousada, and his wife. They are being well taken care of, and are in great shape. I see them here often in town,"" added Pinto, whose shop is downstairs from the home of one of Bousada's brothers. Pinto said it is the brother's son, a nephew of the deceased, who is taking care of the children. Manuela Reyes, who lived near Bousada's home in the same town, told CNN affiliate Cuatro, ""This woman lived there, ever since those apartments were built. You didn't see her much. She came in and out of her house with her little kids, but not much else.""","Maria del Carmen Bousada gave birth to twins in December 2006 in Barcelona .

"(CNN) -- Tales of war leave out half the story much of the time: . Women. Now that attention is turning to what women endure during war, it is time to ensure they get a say in the peace. In 1951, Eric Hoffer wrote, ""Though ours is a godless age, it is the very opposite of irreligious. The true believer is everywhere on the march, and both by converting and antagonizing he is shaping the world in his own image."" The true believer is everywhere in ""In the Land of Blood and Honey."" The film forces its audience to consider the cruelty men are capable of visiting upon one another and what nobility and humanity people share while enduring horror beyond the imagination's capacity to digest. How those instincts exist hand-in-hand, forced into intimacy in the suffocating confines of war's madness, and what little it takes for the true believer to ignite the darkest hollows of men's souls are the subject of ""In the Land of Blood and Honey,"" actress and director Angelina Jolie's film on the Bosnian war. People do not want to know what men have been capable of, because it shows us the horror of which true believers are capable. But this film refuses to look away. And viewers shouldn't either, because bearing witness matters, and there is much for all of us to remember. Among the most unforgettable points: the cruelty meted out to women simply to send a message of war. ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" focuses on two characters, one a young woman sent to a ""rape camp"" in Bosnia. Viewers might want to think this did not happen or could not happen, but of course the film's relentlessly painful point is that it did, less than an hour's flight from Vienna. Such violence continues today in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sri Lanka, as the International Crisis Group recently noted. And in the PBS series ""Women, War & Peace,"" viewers experienced the painstaking process of bringing Bosnia's perpetrators to justice at the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia, the first tribunal to define sexual enslavement as a crime against humanity. Men in fancy conference rooms in government capitals, the United Nations and think tanks around the world rarely focus on the civilians caught in the crossfire, trapped in a hell they had no role in creating. As rape becomes increasingly relied upon as a weapon to humiliate, destabilize and exercise power, women's bodies become the battlefield between two warring sides. Not only do they get no say in war, they must pay its price in excruciating detail. This trend has only become more apparent as the very nature of war has changed from state-on-state to intra-state conflict. According to the Human Security Report Project, in 1989, governments accounted for 75% of deaths resulting from organized campaigns against unarmed civilians. In 2008, that figure fell below 20%. ""Non-state groups, responsible for 25 percent of one-sided-violence fatalities in 1989, perpetrated over 80 percent of the deaths in 2008."" Recently, the United States unveiled its National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security (PDF). In the report, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton outlined her plan to ""accelerate, institutionalize, and better coordinate"" efforts to ""advance women's inclusion in peace negotiations, peace-building activities, and conflict prevention; to protect women from sexual and other kinds of violence; and to ensure equal access to relief and recovery assistance, in areas of conflict and insecurity."" The numbers show rather abundant room for improvement: . • According to UN Women, women have accounted for fewer than 8% of all peace negotiators in the past 20 years. • Women account for fewer than 3% of peace treaty signatories during the same period. • Of 300 peace agreements UNIFEM analyzed, just 18 mentioned sexual-based violence. • According to Michelle Bachelet, former president of Chile and now head of UN Women, ""in actual budget terms, the U.N. allocates only about 5 percent of its post-conflict funds to addressing women's post-conflict needs."" One of UN Women's goals, she noted, is to boost that figure to 15%. The Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Liberian President Ellen Sirleaf Johnson, activist Leymah Gbowee and Yemeni activist Tawakkol Karman sent a message that, according to the head of the Nobel committee, ""we cannot achieve democracy and lasting peace in the world unless women obtain the same opportunities as men to influence developments at all levels of society."" Now it is up to the world to decide whether its wallet and its political will replace lofty words. Change cannot happen unless women are seen not only as victims of war, but as participants in peace and stability. The numbers show that when they are present they make a difference. When women have a seat at the table and a share in the power, man-made horrors such as the rape camp so vividly depicted in ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" may be less likely to return. Let us hope that the world is at last ready to stop simply pitying women and prepared to start investing in them.

"Homs, Syria (CNN) -- Dark-haired and swaddled in a white blanket, baby Fatime is just 24 hours old, the picture of innocence in her grandmother's arms. But the world she has been born into is anything but innocent. Her mother gave birth to her in a makeshift shelter in the besieged Syrian city of Homs, the heart of the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Her mother, 19, has no painkillers and could not sleep after giving birth, she said, still in excruciating pain. Fatime's father does not know his child has been born -- a month ago, he left the wood-cutting factory that has been turned into a makeshift bunker. He was going for supplies and has not been able to return, his wife says. Fatime's father may live to see her, but two great-uncles will not, her grandmother says. Both men were detained and returned as mutilated corpses. As she describes what happened to one of her brothers, her voice trembling, the grandmother grabs her head, wrapped in a black headscarf, and twists it to suggest a neck being broken. She shows a photograph of the battered body of her other brother, the state of the corpse horrific. Baby Fatime is one of at least two dozen children holed up with mothers, grandmothers and other relatives in this makeshift shelter in the Homs neighborhood of Baba Amr. Government forces have been shelling Homs since early February. The families in the shelter have found relative safety but little comfort. ""We're not sleeping at night, we're not sleeping during the day,"" one mother howls, clad head to toe in black with her face covered by a niqab, an Islamic veil showing only her eyes. ""The children are always crying; the bombs are coming down like this,"" she laments, waving her arms for emphasis. They huddle in near darkness, some covering their faces as they speak to me, afraid of losing more than they already have if the government learns who they are. The room is filled with endless stories of death and despair. One woman says her son has been detained since the end of August. Another says her son also has been held a month and a half. A woman named Safaa says her brother and husband were killed when a round hit their home 10 days ago, but she can hardly pause to grieve. ""I have to keep going,"" she says. ""I have to live for my children."" The families in the shelter survive on rice and lentils taken from a nearby government warehouse, but supplies are running low. Activists gather about two dozen children for the camera and lead a song against the regime. But the little ones are hard to comfort. ""My husband died on the first day of the bombing. They didn't let me see his body; it was shredded to pieces. His blood is still in the streets,"" says Umm Khidir, one of the mothers. But her focus now is on her son. She says he is sick with a fever, and there's no medicine. ""He keeps crying and saying, 'I want daddy, I want daddy.' I can't bring his daddy back,"" she says, demanding to know why the world is not coming to their aid. ""What is the world waiting for? For us to die of hunger and fear?""","Women and children huddle in a makeshift shelter as the Syrian government shells city of Homs .

"(CNN) -- The high-pitched breathless appeal from a young girl to a 911 dispatcher poignantly captures the panicked uncertainty students felt as a teenager roamed Chardon High School, picking off students. ""We just had a shooting at our school. We need to get out of here! Oh my God!"" the girl screams, her voice trembling. The dispatcher asks the girl if she saw the shooter. ""No,"" the girl says beginning to cry. ""No. I didn't. I just saw the gun."" The girl's sob-filled plea is among 911 tapes authorities released Tuesday as they continued their investigation into the shooting at the suburban Cleveland school that left three dead, two wounded and a close-knit Ohio community reeling. Sophomore T.J. Lane has confessed to taking a .22-caliber gun and a knife to the school Monday morning and firing 10 rounds, said Geauga County Prosecutor David Joyce. After a preliminary hearing Tuesday, Joyce told reporters the 17-year-old will most likely be tried as an adult. ""Absolutely,"" Joyce said. ""It's a matter of law in the state of Ohio. At 17 years old, committing an act like this."" Joyce predicted Lane will be charged with three counts of aggravated murder ""as well as other counts."" Lane will continue to be held in detention, and charges must be filed by Thursday, the judge at the hearing ordered. Police have said the motive behind the shooting remains unclear, and Joyce added that the teen picked his victims indiscriminately. ""I guarantee that this was an aberration, this does not represent our community,"" he said. ""He chose his victims at random. This is not about bullying. This is not about drugs. This is someone who is not well."" Lane told authorities he stole the gun from his uncle, a source told CNN on Tuesday. Then, just before class started Monday, witnesses say Lane silently walked up to a table of students in the school cafeteria. The 911 tapes detail the uneasy moments that followed as the school went on lockdown and police feverishly searched for the gunman. In one call, a student who fled the school tells a dispatcher he saw the shooter. ""His name is Thomas Lane,"" the boy says, his calmness belying the situation. ""He's somewhere in the building. As soon as I saw him pull the gun and start shooting, I ran outside because I didn't want to get in the way of it."" He tells a dispatcher that he saw a few students get sprayed by bullets. ""They were laying on the ground in blood,"" the boy says. Another call follows, from someone hiding in a teacher's lounge. Alarmed voices buzz in the background. ""We just need somebody down here as fast as possible,"" the caller begs. ""I want to go home. I want to go home so bad."" The voices in the room rise as the group realizes the door to the lounge won't lock. ""Everybody quiet down. He could be out there,"" the caller says, his voice dropping to a whisper. By the time the carnage ended, the gunman had shot five people, three of them fatally: Daniel Parmertor, 16, who died Monday; Demetrius Hewlin, 16, who died Tuesday morning; and Russell King Jr., 17, who was declared brain dead early Tuesday. Another student wounded in the shooting remained hospitalized Tuesday. A fifth victim was released, officials said. Monday's death toll might have been higher had it not been for the actions of assistant football coach and study hall teacher Frank Hall. Students said Hall chased the gunman out of the school, and police arrested the suspect nearby a short time later. ""I wish I could have done more,"" Hall told CNN affiliate WEWS. Classes in the tight-knit community of 5,100, about 30 miles east of Cleveland near Lake Erie, are to resume Friday. But staff, students and parents will be encouraged to return to district schools for visits and counseling on Wednesday and Thursday, Superintendent Joe Bergant said. Geauga County Sheriff Daniel McClelland said the community has a long way to go before it can put the shooting behind it. ""Now we move to another important phase,"" he said. ""And while the investigation continues and we still look for the why and what and who, we now deal with a community looking to heal.""

"(CNN) -- When Bob and Mike Bryan faced match point in their Australian Open men's doubles semifinal, it wasn't just the twin brothers who were feeling the strain. Defeat on Thursday would have halted their bid for a record 12th grand slam title together, but they had a more pressing matter back home. In Miami, Bob's pregnant wife Michelle had to stop watching the American top seeds' showdown with Robert Lindstedt of Sweden and Romania's Horia Tecau because the stress was bringing on contractions. ""She turned it off in the third set because she was starting to feel a couple of small contractions,"" Bob told reporters after the nailbiting 4-6 6-3 7-6 (7-5) victory over the seventh seeds. ""I've been telling her, 'Don't watch the matches, it will get your heart rate going and you might spit that baby out!'"" With the birth due on Saturday, Bob has banned the mother-to-be from watching the final against Indian doubles specialist Leander Paes and the Czech Republic's Radek Stepanek. ""She's on bedrest now,"" the 33-year-old said. ""She's not getting out of bed. We're down to the finish line. It's crunch time."" Bob will fly back to Miami on Sunday, hoping to have beaten the record he and his brother share with the legendary Australian doubles team of Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde. ""We always have good chats with those guys,"" Bob said of their relationship with the team known as ""the Woodies."" ""I think Todd watched the end of our match. On the way to the locker room, he said, 'That was an incredible reflex volley.' ""They've always seemed like they've been happy for us and our success. They seem very secure with their own achievements and career. They've had an amazingly decorated history on the court. They have nothing to fear."" The Bryan brothers have topped the end-of-year rankings on a record seven occasions and have won over 700 matches together -- an Open era best. Paes, who has won six major doubles titles in his career, and Stepanek, a finalist alongside compatriot Jiri Novak at the 2002 U.S. Open, upset the odds to defeat second seeds Max Mirnyi of Belarus and Canada's Daniel Nestor. Mirnyi and Nestor, the 2011 French Open champions, took the first set before Stepanek and Paes rallied to win 2-6 6-4 6-4.","Bob and Mike Bryan save match point to reach Australian Open doubles final .

"(CNN) -- The stock market crashed. Wall Street panicked. People stashed silver and gold under mattresses while businesses shut doors across America. People in Detroit, Michigan, line up for food at the Capuchin Soup Kitchen. We're talking, of course, about the Great Depression ... of 1873. That's the event that Scott Reynolds Nelson cites when asked to give an historical perspective on today's sputtering economy. The historian says the economic panic of 1873 started with the same toxic mix as today's crisis: risky mortgages, a stock market dive and the use of complex financial instruments that few understood. ""Until 1929, when people used the word[s] Great Depression they referred to 1873,"" says Nelson, a professor of history at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. ""That was a worldwide international depression that started with the banks. That's what we're seeing now. This looks like 1873."" The nation's economic crisis is not only causing people to look more closely at their 401(k) account statements. They're also turning to their history books. Politicians and commentators routinely invoke the Great Depression and other historical events to describe today's economic crisis. But how fair is that historical analogy? Why Great Depression comparisons may be unfair . James Kolari, an economist at Texas A&M University, says the nation experienced two ""rough"" recessions in the mid-1970s and the early 1980s. A recession is generally defined as a decline in the Gross Domestic Product for two or more consecutive quarters. He says it's not fair to compare the current economic crisis to the Great Depression because the federal government was far more passive in the 1920s. ""We let 15,000 out of 30,000 banks fail,"" he says. ""Government efforts to jump-start the economy were slow and relatively weak until President [Franklin] Roosevelt came along with the New Deal."" Kolari says people can learn more by looking at Japan. He says the U.S. economy is facing the same crisis as Japan in the 1990s when the Japanese economy collapsed from a real estate bubble, and never fully recovered. ""The Japanese government moved too slowly and not aggressively enough,"" he says. ""The problems festered."" David George, a professor of economics at La Salle University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, says the federal government better protects ordinary people from financial ruin today than during the first stages of the Great Depression. Today we reap the benefits of policies created during that era, George says. Roosevelt helped create New Deal legislation to insure bank deposits and enacted other modern relief efforts like unemployment compensation to help those in distress. ""By any measure, incomes were lower then than now, and the worst imaginable loss of output today would still keep the nation well above where we were back then,"" George says. Marjorye Heeney is not an economist, but she definitely knows something about the Great Depression. Heeney, 83, grew up on an Oklahoma farm during the Great Depression and lived through the 1930s Dust Bowl storms. For much of that decade, ""black blizzards"" -- formed by a prolonged drought and poor farming techniques -- ravaged the southern Plains. Heeney, who now lives in Topeka, Kansas, snorted when told that today's conditions remind some of the Great Depression. During the Depression, crops failed, and few had a job, car or clothes, she says. ""Everyone had one nail for themselves in the clothes closet,"" Henney says. Henney says the Great Depression toughened people up. People grew and canned their own food, sewed their own clothes and learned how to make possessions last. ""No one really came from wealth, and nothing was easy,"" she says. ""But people got by because they had a wonderful spirit of survival. We're not as gutsy. I don't know if we have that today."" Why this economic period is still frightening . Victor Matheson, an economist at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, says the nation's most recent recession was the dot-com bust, which hit around March 2001. ""This recession has already eclipsed the dot-com bust in every fashion,"" he says. ""During that time, the GDP did not fall much, and unemployment did not rise much."" Matheson offers one bit of good news, though. He says today's unemployment rate is not as bad as in previous eras. The unemployment rate reached 10.8 percent during the early 1980s and 25 percent during the Great Depression, he says. Yet Matheson says there is an ominous feature to the current situation: The Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates as far as they can go, to around zero percent, but the recession marches on. The current recession is so ""scary"" that Matheson says he has reversed his attitude on Obama's $787 billion stimulus plan. He once opposed it but now supports it because he can't think of anything that might work better. He says the economy will not bounce back on its own anytime soon. ""You gotta go with what you got,"" he says. ""The Federal Reserve has loosed all of its cannons, and it has nothing left. Now we're down to fiscal policy."" Nelson, the historian who has studied the panic of 1873, says today's economy might even be worse than the American economy in 1873. ""This is a perfect storm: banks failing, stock markets declining and commodity prices dropping,"" Nelson says. Nelson says it took America four years to recover from the 1873 panic. Tens of thousands of workers -- many Civil War veterans -- became homeless. Thousands lined up for food and shelter in major cities. The Gilded Age, where wealth was concentrated in the hands of a few ""robber barons like John D. Rockefeller,"" followed the panic. America, of course, pulled out of the panic. Nelson is just not quite sure how the nation is going to do it now. His ultimate assessment of today's economy is blunt: . ""It looks grim.""","Is it fair to invoke Great Depression?

"(CNN) -- We now live in an age when glamorous, hey-look-at-me belters so dominate the pop-music firmament that you can barely tell who's doing the shouting. So it may be hard for some to remember -- or imagine -- what it was like to behold Whitney Houston for the first time. Not even your first taste of snow, your first meaningful kiss, your first encounter with one of the seven natural wonders quite aligns with the experience -- unless as some rough combination of all three. As many who grieved over Houston's shocking death yesterday at 48 will tell you, this first encounter would have taken place somewhere in the middle of the ""Morning in America"" years. Indeed, she seemed destined for greatness even before she released her first eponymous album for Clive Davis' Arista Records in 1985. The word was out years before that Houston had the presence, the pedigree and -- goodness knows -- the pipes to be something unprecedented, remarkable, even historic. Daughter of the great soul-and-gospel vocalist Cissy Houston, cousin to both Dionne and Dee Dee Warwick and goddaughter to Aretha Franklin, Houston's family background seemed a magically appropriate fusion of both the grit and the glamour of late-20th-century African-American pop music. You couldn't find a more auspicious template for great expectations. And for a while, she fulfilled those prospects -- and then some. Remember the insouciant swagger she showed in both the video and the recording of ""How Will I Know?"" The effortless push-pull command of romantic lyrics she exhibited in ""Saving All My Love For You""? The skyscraping, come-to-meeting intensity she brought to ""The Greatest Love of All""? They were all on ""Whitney Houston,"" the debut album that answered just about every question we could have about her before we could calm down enough to come up with any questions at all. Here was a singer blessed with both her godmother's hair-raising vocal agility and Diana Ross' physical magnetism. Being demure can make you alluring and enigmatic. Having powerful sounds at your command can make you frightening and fascinating. Put them together and you had a pop phenomenon capable of breaching all manner of audience boundaries whether of race, age or geographic origin. At her peak she had enough confidence to win both the rockers and the disco crowd with the white-lightning rave, ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)."" She covered Dolly Parton's ""I Will Always Love You"" with such overpowering force that she all but assumed ownership of the song. There seemed nothing she couldn't do, even acquit herself more than decently as a movie actress in ""The Bodyguard"" (1992),""Waiting to Exhale"" (1995) and ""The Preacher's Wife"" (1997). When someone can do anything, it's not unusual for others to wonder if she's doing too much -- or trying too hard. Those of us who were mesmerized by her prodigious breakthroughs wondered how long she could keep it up, especially under the glare of multimedia celebrityhood. Some of us might have preferred that she take a hiatus, a brief withdrawal from the spotlight to protect her voice and, especially, her psyche from gossip, glitz and, yes, controlled substances. But when people demand that you deliver a knockout ""Star-Spangled Banner"" at a Super Bowl while a war's going on, when your life literally becomes a lowbrow real-life sitcom (only without the laughs) and when there are hundreds, thousands and millions of little-girls-with-big-voices who look to you as a role model, there's not a whole lot of elbow room to turn the dial to ""slow"" and contemplate ways of adjusting your art and your life to time's insistent demands. We don't yet know the circumstances surrounding Houston's death. And we aren't going to dwell on whatever personal trials accumulated over the years and their cumulative effects. There's plenty of time for that -- and a lot of dreary tell-all books to come. We'd rather not think about it. We have a simpler need: To remember when there was literally no one else like Whitney Houston in this world -- and how much poorer the world would have been without her.

"(CNN) -- It is a noise that has become synonymous with watching top-level tennis -- the sound of ear-splitting shrieks and grunts as star players battle against each other in a bid to claim the sport's biggest prizes. The yelps of three-time grand slam champion Maria Sharapova and world No. 3 Victoria Azarenka have been the source of much conversation this week at the Australian Open in Melbourne -- the year's first grand slam. It might reach a crescendo on Saturday when they meet in the women's final, with the No. 1 ranking also at stake. ""About Maria, I mean, what can I say?"" said eighth seed Agnieszka Radwanska in a press conference following her quarterfinal defeat to Belarus' Azarenka on Tuesday. ""For sure that is pretty annoying and it's just too loud."" Who will be 2012 Australian Open victors? Throughout her career -- which has included reaching No. 1 in the world, a breakthrough win aged 17 at Wimbledon in 2004 and two further grand slam titles -- Sharapova has been renowned for the volume of her on-court vocalizations. ""I've heard it a few times over my career,"" the 24-year-old Russian said. ""You've watched me grow up, you've watched me play tennis. ""I've been the same over the course of my career. No one important enough has told me to change or do something different. ""Right now there is no rule change. I don't hear that there will be one, so it doesn't really matter what my answer would be, would it?"" At present, there are no WTA Tour rules which directly prohibit grunting. Female tennis' governing body does, however, have regulations which outlaw hindrances. Rivals reunited: Kvitova faces Sharapova in semis . An involuntary hindrance would cover a player's hat falling off, or a ball rolling from their pocket. In this instance, a let is called and the point is replayed. Any hindrance deemed deliberate by the umpire would result in the loss of a point. Although the issue of grunting is not mentioned in the International Tennis Federation's 2012 rulebook, the WTA explained how they are attempting to coach the trait out of the next generation of players. ""Everyone who watches tennis knows grunting is a part of the game, and we are aware that some fans find it bothersome,"" read a WTA statement. ""We are currently in the process of exploring how to reduce excessive grunting, especially for younger players just starting out, without adversely affecting players who have developed their game under the current training . ""We do believe that we need to address the concerns expressed by some fans and take a careful look at our rules and education policies."" Switzerland's Martina Hingis retired in 2007 after a 13-year playing career which saw her claim five grand slam titles, including three successive Australian Open triumphs between 1997 and 1999. The former world No. 1, who is playing in the senior's event in Melbourne, said the noises were more irksome for fans and viewers and largely go unnoticed by players. Djokovic downplays injury scare ahead of Murray rematch . But Hingis did admit to being baffled by some of the noises coming from the opposite end of the court. ""It's just sometimes when they were stretching a little bit more, you're like: 'What are you doing?' The more they had to stretch the louder it got,"" the 31-year-old explained. ""Or sometimes it's like a heavy grunt and it's on the service line and the ball doesn't have any weight on it. But I think it's more of an issue with the spectators."" Due to the volume and unique nature of world No. 3 Azarenka's screams, the Rod Laver Arena crowd took to mimicking her during a second round win over Australian Casey Dellacqua. ""Of course I hear it. I mean, I'm not deaf,"" the 22-year-old joked. ""But it's fine for me. I mean, I respect the crowd, whatever they do. I try to just be focused on my game."" So, with the WTA focused on coaching grunting out of the next generation of talent, it looks as if opponents of Sharapova and Azarenka will have to put up with the deafening screams for the foreseeable future. Or start wearing ear plugs...","Agnieszka Radwanska has criticized Maria Sharapova for grunting during matches .

"Beijing (CNN) -- China says it has had ""a frank, in-depth talk"" with North Korea about the situation on the Korean Peninsula after Pyongyang's announcement of a planned satellite launch provoked an international outcry. Wu Dawei, China's special representative for the Korean Peninsula, met with Ri Yong Ho, a senior North Korean nuclear negotiator, in Beijing on Monday. Wu told the Chinese broadcaster CCTV that he and Ri had exchanged ""opinions on the topic of preserving the peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula,"" as well as on Pyongyang's planned satellite launch. China appears to be putting pressure on North Korea over the plan to fire off a long-range rocket that the North says will carry the satellite into orbit. South Korea has called the announcement a ""grave provocation"" that contravenes U.N. Security Council resolutions. And the Japanese defense minister, Naoki Tanaka, said Monday that he would consider ordering the destruction of the projectile if it presented a risk to Japan. Chinese Executive Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Zhijun expressed ""concern"" when he met North Korean ambassador Ji Jae Ryong on Friday, the official Xinhua News Agency reported over the weekend. ""We sincerely hope parties concerned stay calm and exercise restraint and avoid escalation of tension that may lead to a more complicated situation,"" Xinhua quoted Zhang as saying. China rarely puts public pressure on its northern neighbor, which relies on Beijing's political, economic and diplomatic support. North Korea announced Friday that it plans to launch a satellite into space next month to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of its founder, Kim Il Sung, grandfather of Pyongyang's new leader Kim Jong-un. The United States says the rocket launch would be a ""deal-breaker"" for a recent aid agreement between the United States and North Korea. In closed-door meetings partly brokered by China, North Korea last month agreed to stop nuclear tests, uranium enrichment and long-range missile launches in exchange for resumption of U.S. food aid. The announced missile launch also could derail recent efforts to reconvene the multilateral talks, known as six-party talks, on denuclearizing North Korea. The launch is expected to take place April 12 to 16. North Korea says it plans to invite experts and the media to observe the launch. Pyongyang has also invited the International Atomic Energy Agency to return, nearly three years after it kicked U.N. nuclear inspectors out of the country, the IAEA said Monday. CNN's Junko Ogura and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","North Korea's announcement of a satellite launch has provoked alarm .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal's status as the world's top tennis player may have dimmed slightly with two recent final defeats, but the Spaniard showed again on Sunday that he is the man to beat on clay. The 24-year-old extended his record of most successive titles in an ATP Tour event with his seventh success in Monte Carlo, boosting his leading tally of Masters Series crowns to 19. Nadal beat fourth-seeded compatriot David Ferrer 6-4 7-5 in the final as he shook off successive losses on hard-court surfaces to the pretender to his throne, Novak Djokovic, to claim his 44th career title and the $630,000 first prize. He has won 30 of those on clay, putting him equal third in the post-1968 Open Era list alongside compatriot Manuel Orantes and Bjorn Borg. ""Rafa is incredible on clay. I mean, he's everywhere at the same time. He's the best player on clay in history,"" Ferrer told the tournament's official web site. Djokovic, unbeaten in 2011, missed this tournament due to a knee injury but the Serbian is expected to line up alongside Nadal at the Madrid Masters at the start of next month. Nadal won that event last year as he went through the clay season unbeaten, culminating in his fifth French Open triumph. That run saw him beat Ferrer in the final of the Rome Masters, and he again denied the 29-year-old a 1,000-point haul in Monte Carlo on Sunday as he avenged his defeat at the Australian Open quarterfinals in January. Ferrer dropped serve as early as the third game, but the world No. 6 broke back immediately as both players made uncharacteristic errors that would be symptomatic of a match also featuring moments of brilliance. Nadal broke again in the fifth game and won the opening set in 70 minutes. He won against serve in the third game of the second set before Ferrer fought back to lead 5-4, but Nadal broke him again to go 6-5 up and sealed victory when his opponent netted on the second match-point. Nadal's only defeat in Monte Carlo came at his first appearance in 2003. Is Sharapova back as a real contender? Meanwhile, Russia ended Italy's Fed Cup reign by reaching the final of the women's teams event with a comprehensive 5-0 victory on Sunday. The home team led 2-0 after the opening day in Moscow, and world No. 3 Vera Zvonareva put her country into the title match for the first time since her last appearance in the tournament in 2008 by beating Roberta Vinci 6-4 6-2. With the tie over, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova stepped in for Saturday's singles winner Svetlana Kuznetsova to hand Sara Errani her second defeat as the Russian triumphed 7-6 (7-5) 7-6 (7-4). Pavlyuchenkova and Ekaterina Makarova then sealed the whitewash, beating Alberta Brianti and Maria-Elena Camerin 7-6 (7-3) 6-1 in the doubles. Italy had won the title the past two years, but went into this match without top-ranked players Francesca Schiavone and Flavia Pennetta. Four-time champions Russia will play the Czech Republic in the final after the other semifinal in Belgium went to the deciding doubles rubber after both teams won a singles tie on Sunday. Czech No. 1 Petra Kvitova gave her country a 2-1 lead in Charleroi with a 7-5 4-6 2-6 victory over Yanina Wickmayer, Belgium's top-ranked player in the absence of injured world No. 2 Kim Clijsters. But 106th-ranked Kirsten Flipkens leveled the score again by beating Barbora Zahlavova-Strycova 6-2 6-3. Zahlavova-Strycova then paired up with Iveta Benesova to beat Flipkens and Wickmayer 6-4 6-4 to seal a 3-2 win. Czechoslovakia won the title five times but not since separating into two nations following the Velvet Revolution in 1989.","Rafael Nadal wins seventh consecutive Monte Carlo title, beating David Ferrer in final .

"(CNN) -- A former southern California schoolteacher is set to be arraigned Tuesday amid allegations he bound young students, then photographed them with semen-filled spoons held at their mouths and three-inch cockroaches crawling across their faces, among other graphic depictions. Authorities have said they have discovered roughly 600 images taken by Mark Berndt, 61, in his classroom. Dismissed by the Los Angeles Unified School District school board about a year ago, Berndt was arrested January 30. He appeared in court two days later, after which he was ordered held on $23 million bail -- $1 million for each of the 23 counts of lewd acts on a child that he faces. All of those initial 23 victims were between 7 and 10 years old, and all but two of them were girls, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said. Berndt has not yet entered a plea. Since his initial appearance, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Sgt. Dan Scott said an additional 200 photographs purportedly taken by the longtime Miramonte Elementary School teacher had been found. It is uncertain what, if any, additional charges Berndt may face as a result of that discovery or other developments in the investigation. The law enforcement probe began when investigators found ""over 40 photographs depicting children in a school classroom, with their eyes blindfolded and mouths covered with tape,"" a Los Angeles County sheriff's statement said. ""Investigators learned that some of the photos depicted suspect Mark Berndt with his arm around the children, or with his hand over their mouths,"" according to the sheriff's department. Some photos showed ""children with large live Madagascar-type cockroaches on their faces and mouths."" Others show female students with ""what appeared to be a blue plastic spoon, filled with an unknown clear/white liquid substance, up to their mouths as if they were going to ingest the substance,"" said the sheriff's department. Scott said that Berndt was arrested soon after lab testing matched Berndt's DNA with a substance -- later determined to be semen -- from a blue plastic spoon and an empty container from a trash bin in his classroom. The young students ""didn't realize they were victimized,"" said the sheriff's department spokesman. ""They thought they were being blindfolded and gagged as a game,"" Scott added. ""And they were rewarded with cookies or spoons full of sugar, (but) they did not realize the spoon contained semen."" A search of Berndt's home found hundreds of photographs depicting children and a video showing sexual ""bondage"" activity that ""mirrored the bondage-type photos of the children,"" investigators said. Parent Bessy Garcia, the mother of two children who were among Berndt's alleged victims, spoke of betrayal. ""He wasn't only a teacher, he was our personal friend,"" she told CNN earlier this month. ""He tricked us. We thought he was the best person in the world."" Los Angeles School Superintendent John Deasy said that Berndt was removed from his teaching job in January 2011, after school officials learned of the police investigation. A teacher for 30 years, Berndt initially challenged the school district's decision to dismiss him. But he eventually dropped his appeal and resigned last spring. His arrest this January precipitated a broader fallout, into the adequacy of safeguards for the school's students and the prospect of more victims. Days after Berndt was taken into custody, another Miramonte Elementary teacher -- Martin Springer, 49 -- was arrested and charged with three felony counts of lewd acts with a girl under the age of 14. He has pleaded not guilty. The school board subsequently shut Miramonte down for two days, during which the board reconstituted the entire staff in the 1,400-student school. Miramonte is located in unincorporated Los Angeles County within the Florence-Firestone area, about 6 miles south of downtown Los Angeles.","An arraignment is set for Tuesday in L.A.

"(CNN) -- Tuareg tribesman who reportedly fought for Moammar Gadhafi in Libya have returned to Mali with weapons, stoking violence and forcing thousands to flee, Mali's president said. The development, announced by President Amadou Toumani Toure in a speech broadcast on state TV over the weekend, is perhaps the most-significant regional fallout to date from the end of former Libyan leader's regime. The fighters returning from Libya have blended into the National Movement for Liberation of the Azawad (MNLA) and renamed northern Mali as the Azawad, the name of the region home to a majority of the Mali Tuareg. During the address, Toure blamed freshly-armed fighters returning from Libya for attacks on military patrols outside the northeastern town of Aguelhoc, which has become a flashpoint in the struggle between the military and the rebels. The military was ""unable to enter Aguelhoc where elements of Al Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), a group of former fighters from Libya and a group of deserters from our army were well positioned,"" Toure said, according to the state-run L'essor newspaper. ""The fighting was hard and we lost men, and equipment was destroyed."" The growing insurgency is also raising concerns in Washington, which sees the small, poor nation as an important ally against AQIM, the sub-Saharan al Qaeda group. ""The situation is unpredictable and instability could spread. Private citizens have not been targeted, but the MNLA has indicated via its websites that it intends to conduct military operations across northern Mali,"" the U.S. State Department said as part of a new travel warning issued last week. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland condemned the rebel attacks, saying Saturday that ""the United States is deeply concerned by continuing incidents of violence."" The influx of fighters returning from Libya has re-energized the Tuareg insurgency, which seeks to wrest control of three northern regions, according to the global intelligence firm Stratfor. ""Mali has experienced perhaps the most significant external repercussions from the downfall of the regime of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi,"" it said in a recent analysis. Gadhafi endeared himself to Malians by funding the construction of a popular mosque in the capital Bamako, and helped pay for a Malian government complex that remains under construction. He is also accused of backing the Tuaregs in Mali and Niger during the 1990s. So it came as no surprise that Malian Tuaregs willingly went to Libya to fight for Gadhafi as he fought to keep hold of the reigns of his regime which crumbled in August, Libya's new government has said. After Gadhafi's death in October, heavily armed Tuareg fighters began returning home and launching attacks on the Malian army, Mali's government said. The nomadic Tuaregs, who are considered an indigenous tribe in the region, are spread across Mali, Libya, Algeria, Niger and Burkino Faso. In Mali, the Tuareg have long called for the creation of an independent state -- and have risen up against the Malian government a number of times since the 1960s. The latest uprising began to take root late last year but gained momentum in January when the rebels began attacking towns in northern Mali. The Malian army clashed with rebels in the Timbuktu region last week, killing 20 people, taking a dozen prisoners and seizing vehicles and weapons, according to the country's defense ministry. It reported no casualties on the government side. But the rebels claim to have either attacked or seized at least six towns in recent weeks, including some in the Timbuktu region, according to its website. The claims appear to be supported by reports by the International Committee of the Red Cross that thousands have fled the region ahead of fighting. Malians have taken to the streets in the capital city of Bamako to protest the government response to the MNLA amid rumors that the army, not the rebels, initiated the latest fighting with attacks on the Tuareg, an allegation Toure and others say is false. The unrest has thrown Toure's administration into turmoil. He sacked his defense and interior ministers last week, and quickly moved to meet with the wives of soldiers who were forced to flee their homes for refugee camps ahead of rebel attacks. Toure told the families at camps outside Bamako and neighboring Kati that Malian troops did not initiate the fighting in famine-stricken Tinzawaten, which became ground zero in the latest uprising. ""Our military did not go to the north to make war but rather to deliver supplies to our troops in Tinzawaten,"" he told the wives, according to state-run media. It was after that that armed fighters attacked the towns of Menaka, Tessalit and Aguelhoc, he told the spouses, according to the report. ""There are many rumors. If we are not careful, we'll fall into the hands of those who are attacking Mali and who want to oppose the government,"" he said. Nearly 10,000 Malians and Nigerians have fled because of the fighting, the International Committee of the Red Cross reported last week. ""Some of the refugees have been cared for by (local) villagers, but space has been absorbed very quickly,"" said Jurg Eglin who heads ICRC operations in Niger and Mali. ""The shelters are sketchy. These people, many of them women and children, suffer from lack of food and especially water."" Another 3,000 have reportedly fled to Mauritania, according to the state-run AMI news agency. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Dana Ford, Amir Ahmed and journalist Amadou Timbine contributed to this report.","The nomadic Tuaregs are spread across several countries .

"(CNN) -- Manchester City striker Mario Balotelli has been charged with violent conduct by the English Football Association after his apparent stamp on Tottenham midfielder Scott Parker during Sunday's 3-2 Premier League win. Balotelli appeared to catch the side of Parker's head with his boot after the pair had clashed in the second half at the Etihad Stadium. And to compound the misery for Spurs, Balotelli went on to score a last-minute penalty in the top-of-the-table clash, with his winner putting City eight points clear of third-placed Tottenham. Manchester clubs sink London rivals to move clear at summit . An FA statement read: ""The FA has today charged Manchester City forward Mario Balotelli with violent conduct following an incident in his side's home game against Tottenham Hotspur. ""Balotelli was involved in an incident with Tottenham's Scott Parker during Manchester City's 3-2 victory at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday 22 January 2012. Balotelli has until 6 p.m. on Wednesday 25 January 2012 to respond to the charge."" The incident angered Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp, who told reporters: ""I don't like people kicking other people in the head on a football pitch. ""It is not something I understand. Why should he go and back-heel someone in the head when he is on the floor?"" Should Balotelli be found guilty, he will be banned for four matches because he has been sent off once already this season. Balotelli would miss the Premier League trips to Everton and Aston Villa, plus the home encounter with Fulham and the second leg of the League Cup semifinal against Liverpool. Controversy has dogged the Italian international since his move to Manchester in August 2010. He has already been sent off three times in a season-and-a-half at City and has been involved in a number of incidents both on and off the pitch that have publicly angered City manager Roberto Mancini. However, one piece of good news for Mancini on Monday came with the confirmation that the FA has decided not to hand defender Joleon Lescott a violent conduct charge, after the England international appeared to catch Tottenham's Younes Kaboul in the face with his forearm during the same match.","Manchester City striker Mario Balotelli charged with violent conduct by English FA .

"(CNN) -- Branislav Ivanovic scored a superb extra-time goal to put Chelsea through to the quarterfinals of the European Champions League, while Real Madrid also progressed Wednesday. The Serbian defender's 105th-minute strike gave the English Premier League side a 4-1 second leg win over Napoli and passage to the last eight 5-4 on aggregate. Trailing 3-1 after the first leg in Italy, one of the results which cost Andre Villas-Boas his job as Chelsea manager, the home side responded with an all-action display at Stamford Bridge. Goals from veteran players Didier Drogba, John Terry and Frank Lampard -- whose futures had seemed under threat during the short reign of the Portuguese coach -- helped send the tie to extra time. Napoli had looked menacing in the opening exchanges and Marek Hamsik and Ezequiel Lavezzi both forced fine reaction saves from Petr Cech. But striker Drogba's diving header after 39 minutes tipped the balance in the home side's favor. Two minutes into the second half and they were two up and level on aggregate as captain Terry found space to head home Lampard's corner. Napoli, who continued to be a threat, responded almost immediately with a goal to go ahead again on aggregate as Gokhan Inler swept home from the edge of the area. But Andrea Dossena handled to give Chelsea the chance to take the match past regulation time, and England international Lampard stepped up to smash home the 75th-minute penalty kick. Substitute Fernando Torres had two half-chances to end his goal drought before Ivanovic cropped up in the penalty area to smash his shot high into the Napoli net. Chelsea held out comfortably in the second half of extra time to seal a famous comeback and give interim manager Roberto Di Matteo his third straight win since taking over from Villas-Boas. Defender Terry said it had been one of their greatest every performances. ""This could top them all sure,"" he told the UK match broadcaster. ""The lads put in a great display, really solid, really resilient, with the firepower going forward. ""We proved we're a team tonight. That desire, that togetherness. We showed what Chelsea are made of tonight."" Nine-time champions Real Madrid booked their passage after a 4-1 win over CSKA Moscow at the Santiago Bernabeu, clinching a 5-2 aggregate success. The scoreline was a little flattering for Real, who had some nervous defensive moments before Argentina striker Gonzalo Higuain converted Kaka's cross to put them ahead on the night and on aggregate. In-form Cristiano Ronaldo scored his first of the night early in the second half with a speculative long-range effort which embarrassed CSKA goalkeeper Sergei Chepchugov. France forward Karim Benzema made it 3-0 to Real with his first touch after coming on as a substitute, then Zopan Tosic scored a deserved goal for the visitors with a crisp strike which whistled past Iker Casillas. But Ronaldo scored in injury time with his sixth goal in the competition to restore the Spanish league leaders' three-goal advantage.","Chelsea through to Champions League quarterfinals .

"(Health.com) -- Psychologists, not to mention parents, have long observed that kids who seem depressed tend to have trouble getting along with -- and being accepted by -- their peers. What the experts haven't been able to agree on is which comes first, the depression or the social difficulty. Most researchers have supposed that kids who are excluded or bullied become depressed as a result (rather than vice versa), while others have suggested that the two problems go hand in hand and are all but impossible to tease apart. A new study, published this week in the journal ""Child Development,"" provides some of the strongest evidence to date for a third theory: Kids who cry easily, express negative emotions, and show other signs of depression ultimately suffer socially because they are shunned by their peers and attract the attention of bullies. ""Bullies target youth who are unlikely to fight back,"" says lead author Karen P. Kochel, Ph.D., an assistant research professor at Arizona State University, in Phoenix. ""Youth who are depressed really have the potential to appear vulnerable, and are easy marks for victimization, unfortunately."" Health.com: 10 things to say (and not say) to someone with depression . To better understand how depression and social problems unfold over time, Kochel and her colleagues tracked an ethically and socioeconomically diverse group of 486 children as they went through the 4th, 5th, and 6th grades. Along the way, the researchers periodically gauged depression symptoms and social acceptance by surveying parents, teachers, and the kids themselves. Fourth graders who showed signs of depression were more likely than their classmates to be victimized as fifth graders, and kids who were picked on in fifth grade tended to be less accepted by their peers in sixth grade. By contrast, the researchers found little evidence that being bullied increased a child's risk of becoming depressed in later grades. Health.com: Dad's depression may rub off on kids . Although the findings suggest that depression tends to precede social difficulty, they don't rule out the possibility that problems with peers can make an already depressed child even more depressed. ""I think it's very possible it is a cyclical process,"" Kochel says. It's not clear from the study what the depressed kids might have done, specifically, to turn off their peers. But research in adults suggests that depression can have a negative effect on a person's social skills and overall agreeableness, says David Schwartz, Ph.D., an associate professor of psychology and education at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles, who did not participate in the study. Depressed people ""are often characterized by negativity and inappropriate self-disclosure -- think of 'Debbie Downer' on 'Saturday Night Live,'"" Schwartz says. ""As a result, they may not be all that much fun to be around. Unfortunately, they sometimes get into a cycle where depression brings social skills deficits, and social skills problems lead to interpersonal rejection, which helps maintain the depression."" Health.com: How you can help someone who's depressed . Kochel and her colleagues suspect that a similar pattern may occur in children. ""One possibility is that depressed youth maybe exhibit social skill deficits or behaviors...or excessively talk about their problems,"" she says. ""These are all things that have the potential to be irritating to peers."" Jennifer Lansford, Ph.D., a developmental psychologist at Duke University's Center for Child and Family Policy, in Durham, North Carolina, says the study was ""rigorous and well-conducted"" and that the findings make sense. ""Even from a pretty early age, [expressions] of sadness or...other negative emotions can lead to problems with peers,"" she says. ""If parents and teachers are able to work with kids to express their emotions in different ways, then they may not elicit the same maltreatment from peers."" Lansford emphasizes, however, that depressed behavior never justifies the bullying or exclusion of a child. ""I think it's important to avoid a 'blame the victim' perspective on this,"" she says. The findings, Kochel says, drive home how important it is for parents and teachers to be aware of the signs of depression in children, arrange for treatment if needed, and help depressed children socialize and get along with their peers. The cycle of depression and victimization is likely to get worse if left unchecked, since depressive symptoms tend to intensify during the teen years, she says. Parents who are concerned that their child might be having a hard time socially can volunteer in his or her school to get a better sense of what's going on, Lansford says. And they can encourage friendships by organizing playdates, she adds. ""Even just having one good friend can really be a buffer against victimization -- or depression, for that matter,"" she says. ""If kids are able to establish one solid friendship, that can be a real protective factor for them.""

"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai announced Wednesday he had divorced his wife of less than two weeks, claiming that a ""greater and thicker plot"" had undermined his confidence in the relationship. ""This relationship has been irretrievably damaged to a point where marriage is now inconceivable,"" said Tsvangirai, 59, in a statement released late Wednesday, referring to the traditional marriage he had with 39-year-old Lorcadia Karimatsenga since November 18. ""I was well-meaning and had good intentions to rebuild my family and start a new lease of life following the tragic passing on of my wife on 6 March 2009,"" Tsvangirai's statement said. But since the day he paid lobola -- money a prospective husband pays the family of his bride -- ""everything has been played in the press and I have become an innocent bystander in what is supposed to be my relationship. I have become a spectator in this relationship and things are happening too fast, on camera and without my knowledge. This has led me to conclude that there is a greater and thicker plot around this issue which has undermined my confidence in this relationship."" Since the announcement of the marriage -- for which Tsvangirai reportedly paid $36,000 -- state and social media has been stalking Karimatsenga. Some media reports said she was already pregnant with twins. Earlier in the day, President Robert Mugabe, who formed a coalition government with Tsvangirai, appealed to the media to respect his prime minister's private life. ""Everyone has a right to do what he wishes. But this one (Tsvangirai) is being targeted and mobbed by the media every day. Please leave him alone,"" Mugabe told journalists. Tsvangirai's first wife died in 2009 in a car accident in which the former opposition leader survived with minor injuries. ""Sometimes when you are searching for a partner especially after losing your wife, there are many stakeholders in the process some of whom have their own ulterior intentions. Having been married for 31 years, the tendency is to want to use your experience as a yardstick for future relationships. Regrettably, the individuals, like the one in question, may not meet the same standards,"" added Tsvangirai without explaining. He said the intention of those who worked against his marriage is to ""inflict maximum damage on my person and character for political gain."" ""The 'marriage' has been hijacked and there is an apparent active political hand that is now driving the processes. State security agents have also weighed in to force and direct proceedings which has resulted in everything regarding this relationship now taking place in camera, with the public media journalists in tow,"" the prime minister's statement said.","The prime minister cites a ""plot"" for the failure of his marriage .

"(CNN) -- World No. 2 Petra Kvitova and former No. 1 Maria Sharapova are set for a rematch of the 2011 Wimbledon final after both reached the last four of the Australian Open on Wednesday. The two players are battling to become the new top-ranked woman following Caroline Wozniacki's quarterfinal defeat by defending champion Kim Clijsters on Tuesday. Kvitova is the rising force in the female game after claiming her first major title with victory over Russia's three-time grand slam champion at the All England Club last July, and then winning the season-ending WTA Championships. The Czech booked her spot in the Melbourne semifinals with a 6-4 6-4 win over Italian surprise package Sara Errani, who has never previously been beyond the third round of a grand slam. A nervous Kvitova hit 22 unforced errors in the first set against the world No. 48 before triumphing in one hour and 51 minutes. By comparison, fourth seed Sharapova had a convincing 6-2 6-3 win against her 56th-ranked compatriot Ekaterina Makarova, who eliminated five-time champion Serena Williams in the fourth round. Kvitova said her win on the grass of Wimbledon will count for nothing ahead of Thursday's rematch on a hard-court surface. ""I think it was a really good match from both sides,"" the 21-year-old said of last year's clash. ""How I can compare? I can't because it was grass and here is the hard court. ""I mean, it will be similar match as the Wimbledon, but still it can be different. But tactics will be the same as the Wimbledon."" Sharapova is searching for a first grand slam title since her win in Melbourne four years ago, which followed her breakthrough success at Wimbledon as a 17-year-old in 2004 and her 2006 U.S. Open triumph. The 24-year-old has lost two of her three matches against Kvitova, including their last clash in Tokyo in September. ""I've lost to her the last couple of times, obviously the big one in Wimbledon,"" she said. ""I think she is the one to beat right now. ""She's playing the best tennis in her career, coming off so many wins last year. I'm looking forward to the match-up -- I don't like losing so many times in a row, so I'll try my best.""

"(CNN) -- ""The Darkness II"" is a gore-filled, blood-enraged slaughterfest that really wants to be a feel-good, love story. Oh, and you get to fight with characters who have four arms. Set a couple of years after the conclusion of the original game in this series, players control Jackie Estacado, a crime boss who is also host to an ancient evil known as The Darkness. This force imbues Jackie with superhuman powers including two extra arms -- called ""demon arms"" in the game -- that look like snakes with piranhas for heads. It's scary stuff. And these extra arms are essential for in-game combat. Jackie has been keeping The Darkness bottled up inside, but there are others who want the power for themselves. As the game starts out, The Darkness gets released and helps Jackie in his war against the Brotherhood. At its core, ""The Darkness II"" is a first-person shooter that adds in the demon arms and provides four different opportunities of attack. The shooting aspect is solid, with plenty of different weapons to choose from, and allows Jackie the ability to carry around two sets of weapons, at least sometimes. When you're carrying four weapons with four arms, that's when the action and that's where it really gets bloody. The two arms, which resemble snakes with piranha heads, can lash out at opponents, grab and destroy doors and fences, and help gather Essence -- the element that helps Jackie increase his powers. The arms also have some pretty bloody (and cool) finishing moves that raise the gore to med-school-dissection-class levels. Opponents get various extremities ripped off and tossed aside or violently torn in two using the legs as a wishbone. The more gruesome the kill, the more Essence can be collected. And the stronger Jackie can become by spending Essence on improved weapons, special demon arm kill bonuses or super powers. Using four arms to fight enemies works fairly naturally, but does get a little hectic in some of the group battles. In trying to gain as much Essence as possible, I found myself rushing toward distance opponents to grapple with the demon arms, but taking a bunch of damage along the way. Eventually, I decided just to pick off far-away bad guys with weapons and wait for the grunts to come rushing to me. In the game, there is no mini-map or radar to let you know where the villains are located and there will be times you just have to get hit to find out there was someone behind you. Enemies do spawn from every direction -- even places you just cleared out -- so be prepared to swivel around a lot. The artwork in the game is very graphic-noir, with a hand-painted look. It looks great. Gritty exteriors, colorful interiors and a hell-scape that was foreboding helps immerse the player in whatever environment they were in. Each area was distinct with the appropriate overall emotional landscape. Darklings are back from the first title. Or, I should say, a Darkling is back. These physical manifestations of the Darkness in your brain were used as weapons in the previous game. This time, there is only one and he acts more like a sidekick than a destroyer. Looking like an agile goblin, the Darkling provides some good comedic moments, but he's also handy in distracting opponents, getting into tight places, and short-circuiting electrical boxes when needed. There is also a point in the game where Jackie takes over the Darkling and you get to directly control it. The new viewpoint makes for a nice change of pace. For all these game-play nuances, however, the story of ""The Darkness II"" is where the game developers really wanted to make their mark. Jackie, still mourning over the murder of his girlfriend, has visions of her in the early part of the game. Players discover an eternal love between the two that eventually crosses over the barriers between life and death. That type of romantic story plays out mostly in cut scenes and cinematics. This love stuff felt jarring and out of place at times when compared to the brutality of the battles. Do you get invested in the story? Sure. However, there are a few disjointed moments that left me scratching my head and wondering what it all meant. Also, the game seemed short. Compressed action and lengthy cut scenes did nothing to make the adventure last, and the ending came around too quickly. So I was a little disappointed when I realized the story was coming to a close. Overall, ""The Darkness II"" is a solid shooter that gets amplified by the fact that you get to fight with four arms. Using the demon arms to rip opponents to shreds or fling them into the sky never seems to get old. Oh, and much like today's movies, stick around after the credits. You'll really want to see this. ""The Darkness II"" is available in North America on February 7 and in Europe on February 10. It can be played on Windows PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game is rated (unsurprisingly) M for Mature due to blood and gore, drug references, intense violence, strong language, and strong sexual content. This review was done with the Limited Edition version for the PS3.","Players control Jackie Estacado, a crime boss .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Spain's best-known judge, Baltasar Garzon, went on trial Tuesday in Madrid accused of abusing his judicial authority in an investigation into financial corruption. The trial before a seven-judge panel at Spain's Supreme Court began Tuesday morning and if convicted, Garzon, who was suspended in 2010 pending the trial, would not go to jail but could lose his right permanently to be a judge in Spain. The trial in the so-called Gurtel financial and political corruption case is just the first of two trials against Garzon. Next week, a case that many legal experts say is the more important one, accuses Garzon again of overstepping his legal authority while investigating human rights abuses under the former dictatorship of Spain's Francisco Franco. Garzon became known internationally in 1998 when he sought the extradition of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, who was in a London hospital. Garzon accused him of the murder of Spaniards in Chile and of crimes of genocide. Garzon said in May 2010, at the time of suspension from his post as investigating magistrate at the National Court, ""I face this calmly, with the tranquility of knowing that I am innocent of these charges."" In both trials, Spanish prosecutors have asked that all charges be dropped against Garzon. But, under Spanish law, a private prosecution is also allowed and it is the lawyers for these parties that are pressing the charges against Garzon, judicial authorities and Garzon's lawyers said. In the financial corruption case that Garzon was investigating, and which still has ongoing trials against defendants in various parts of Spain, Garzon ordered wiretaps against some defendants being held in jail, and some of their conversations were with their lawyers. These lawyers later filed charges against Garzon, saying he had overstepped his judicial authority in ordering the wiretaps and also violated their constitutional rights. Garzon later said that if he planned to investigate the defense lawyers themselves, he would have done so, but that the wiretaps were due to suspicions that the defendants in the corruption scandal were moving funds even while they were in preventative prison. The trial is expected to open with preliminary questions, and if there are no major delays, Garzon might testify on Tuesday. It is due to last three days, a Supreme Court spokesman said Tuesday. The case next week involves alleged abuse of judicial power against Garzon while investigating mass graves under the Franco regime, some of which are still being dug up in Spain. A small civil servants union called Manos Limpias, or Clean Hands, brought charges against Garzon in the Franco case, saying the he ignored a 1977 amnesty law approved by Spanish parliament, two years after Franco's death. ""Parliament unanimously approved the amnesty law. Judge Baltasar Garzon takes a stance as if they're crazy. What does he think? That he's better than them,"" said Miguel Bernard, leader of Manos Limpias. Bernard denies critics' charges that his group is a tiny far-right front, but he told CNN he was proud to receive an honor just last month from the Francisco Franco Foundation. Outside the ornate 18th century Supreme Court building, a demonstration in favor of Garzon occurred Tuesday at the door where court officials entered. Human rights groups have been closely following the cases against Garzon. ""It is very ironic that Garzon, who has become a symbol internationally of justice, should be prosecuted at home for the very things that he became a hero for around the world and in Latin America in particular,"" Reed Brody, of Human Rights Watch, told CNN recently. Garzon, 56, spent 22 years as an investigating magistrate at the National Court, which handles cases of terrorism and other delicate cases. He has investigated the late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, the Basque terrorist group ETA, and drug traffickers. At times in the past, Garzon has been considered a darling of the Spanish right or the Spanish left, depending on the cases he was investigating. His critics say he is too flamboyant, always too willing to speak in front of the cameras. Since his suspension in 2010, Garzon has been working as a legal adviser outside of Spain on human rights cases and judicial issues, including in Latin America. A third case against Garzon, for alleged improprieties in organizing some courses at New York University that had major Spanish corporations as sponsors, is still in the investigation phase and not trial date has been set. In that case as well, Spanish prosecutors have not pressed charges but private prosecution has.","Garzon is known for going after former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and Osama bin Laden .

"(CNN) -- A sharp increase in the price of North Sea oil helped drive U.S. gasoline prices up about 12 cents a gallon since late January, according to a new nationwide survey. The latest Lundberg Survey found the average price of regular gasoline rose to $3.51 per gallon, publisher Trilby Lundberg said Sunday. The survey canvasses about 2,500 filling stations in the continental United States twice a month. West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark fuel, remained largely flat between January 20 and Friday, when the most recent survey was conducted. There's a glut of the fuel on U.S. markets, so its price went up only 21 cents a barrel between surveys, Lundberg said. But Europe's benchmark Brent crude -- another fuel commonly used in American gasoline -- traded up by $7.45 per barrel over the same period. Lundberg blamed the jump on reduced production from North Sea platforms, tensions among Iran, its Persian Gulf neighbors and Western powers and a dispute between Sudan and newly independent South Sudan that has cut off southern oil from global markets. ""Brent is highly sensitive to these events,"" she said. Meanwhile, U.S. retailers have little margin to absorb the increased fuel prices, meaning pump prices may edge up ""a few more pennies"" in the coming weeks, Lundberg said. The lowest prices in the latest survey were in Denver, where regular gas cost an average of $3.01 a gallon. The highest were on New York's Long Island, at $3.82. Average prices in some other cities: . Atlanta: $3.54 . Baltimore: $3.52 . Billings, Montana: $3.03 . Boston: $3.60 . Chicago: $3.63 . Houston: $3.42 . Jackson, Mississippi: $3.38 .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- With South Korea returning to an uneasy calm down after a fatal artillery attack on an offshore island Tuesday, North Korean watchers in Seoul were scrambling to explain what may have been the thinking behind Pyongyang's fatal attack. Experts offered a range of opinions, saying that recent events could be a show of strength designed to bolster the reputation of the successor to the state's leadership, and suggesting that North Korea's recent actions fit into a predictable pattern of provocation. Others, however, warned that North Korea's military brinksmanship will continue regardless of who is in charge in Pyongyang, and warn that if South Korea does retaliate, it could ignite a potentially lethal --- and uncontrollable -- cycle of escalation. Read more CNN coverage on North Korea . Even South Korea's defense minister was drawn into the speculation. ""Our judgment is that North Korea carried out the attack to consolidate the succession process in the country by showing off the leadership of Kim Jong Un,"" South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted Defense Minister Kim Tae-young as saying in a meeting with lawmakers. Kim Jong Un, the third son of ailing North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, was named a four-star general just before a rare Workers Party Congress in September, and was named to the party's powerful military committee. He has since been seen widely alongside his father and senior generals, leading North Korea watchers to believe that a succession process is now under way, designed to place the younger Kim in his father's place on the latter's passing. South Korean pundits agreed with the minister. ""The first reason for this attack is the instability of Kim Jong Un. That is the fundamental reason,"" said Young Howard, who heads the NGO Open Radio for North Korea, which maintains a network of contacts north of the two Koreas' demilitarized zone. ""Constant military tensions help him to keep the support of his military, and to unite the North Korean people."" Others suggested that it is the militaristic nature of North Korean society, rather than the current succession process that is the key to its behavior. ""I think there is a danger in the West's tendency to interpret all North Korean actions in the context of topical events, in other words, by saying everything North Korea is doing is aimed at ensuring a smooth succession for Kim Jong Un,"" said Brian Myers, author of ""The Cleanest Race,"" an authoritative study of North Korean propaganda. ""This is implying that once Kim Jong Un is firmly seated in power, this behavior is not going to continue, and I think that is dangerous. If you are a military first regime, you flex your muscles; this is what North Korea is, and this is what it does."" While some in the South had hoped that Kim Jong Il's successor might be reform-minded, recent events, and Kim's strong identification with the North Korean People's Army, suggests a continuation -- or possibly a buttressing -- of the regime's current Songeun, or ""military first"" policy. Still, the apparently calibrated pattern of recent North Korean provocations --- last week, it was revealed that North Korea had displayed a new and well-equipped uranium enrichment plant to visiting U.S. scientists -- is predictable, another expert said. ""The North Koreans asked in late summer for a resumption of aid and essentially they were ignored, so now they are sending a message to South Korea --- by shelling an island -- and to United States --- with their uranium plant --- that they are not withering away, they are still here and still dangerous,"" said Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert at Seoul's Kookmin University. ""They chose the soft spots of both sides, so this is a way to a send a message to both the White House and the Blue House: ""We are here, we are crazy, we are dangerous. And our last paycheck is long overdue."" Read more from Andrei Lankov . The Blue House is the South Korean presidential residence. Alternatively, North Korea could have felt legitimately threatened, said another expert, citing the fact that Pyongyang had demanded the halt to a South Korean firing exercise off their shared coast --- the South Korean side refused to heed the demand -- before it opened fire. ""The North Koreans sound like communist lunatics, and fanatics, when in fact most soldiers in the North Korea army are tending rabbits and farming crops,"" said Michael Breen, a biographer of Kim Jong Il. ""There is good reason for them to be nervous: There is firing off their coast. They have to make a judgment call, so they start, and the whole world thinks they are bad guys, and that Kim Jong Un is strengthening its position, but it could have been a miscalculation."" Tuesday's attack was the second time this year that the North Korea has introduced a weapons system that has been unused on the peninsula since the 1950-53 Korean War, South Korea says. In March, a South Korean warship, the Cheonan, was sunk in what a South Korean investigation says was a North Korean submarine torpedo attack. The North has denied sinking the warship. Tuesday's artillery exchange was the first such since an armistice, rather than a peace treaty, halted the fighting in summer 1953. While South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has demanded massive retaliation should North Korea repeat its actions, that raises a risk of dropping the peninsula into a potentially uncontrollable vortex of retaliation and counter-retaliation. Still, there are limits to the country's forbearance. ""The South has been pretty tolerant, but how much can you tolerate?"" asked Dan Pinkston, who heads the International Crisis Group's Seoul office. ""I don't know what the red line is, but if you don't retaliate, this is giving a green light"" to North Korea. Should retaliation take place, could it unleash Korean War II? ""I think it is unlikely, I think it will cool off,"" Pinkston said. ""But it is dangerous.""","Opinions vary widely among North Korea watchers .

"(CNN) -- Kenyan pair Wilson Kipsang and Mary Keitany won the men's and women's races at the London Marathon Sunday to serve notice of their gold medal credentials for the Olympics later this year. The race also acted as a trial race for selection for the Kenyan team for the London Games and Kipsang and Keitany were impressive winners on both counts. Kipsang, who has run the second fastest time of all time, finished over two minutes clear of a class field to win in two hours, four minutes and 44 seconds -- just four seconds outside the course best set by compatriot Emmanuel Mutai in winning last year's race. Fellow Kenyan Martin Lel outsprinted fellow former London champion Tsegaye Kebede of Ethiopia for second place to seal his place for the Olympic marathon which will take place over many of the same roads in the capital in August. Keitany led a Kenyan sweep of the podium places as she defended her London title with a commanding performance. Her time of two hours, 18 minutes and 36 seconds was a new Kenyan record. 2011 world champion Edna Kiplagat finished second, more than a minute adrift with world silver medalist Priscah Jeptoo a further 24 seconds behind in third. Behind the elite runners over 37,000 started the 32nd staging of the famous race which finishes on The Mall in front of Buckingham Palace. Prince Harry was at the finish to present trophies to winners.","Wilson Kipgang wins men's race at London Marathon .

"(CNN) -- John Terry has been stripped of the captaincy of England's national soccer team due to his court case over charges of alleged racial abuse, which starts in July. However, the English Football Association said that the Chelsea defender would still be able to play at the Euro 2012 finals, which will finish before the hearing begins on July 9. Terry's lawyer entered a not guilty plea at Wednesday's initial court visit, when the judge decided it would be better to start the case after the tournament because Chelsea's submission said key players would not be available as witnesses until then. ""The Board has discussed the matter in detail and has collectively decided it is in the interests of all parties that John has the responsibilities of captaincy removed at this time,"" the FA said in a statement on Friday. ""This decision has been taken due to the higher profile nature of the England captaincy, on and off the pitch, and the additional demands and requirements expected of the captain leading into and during a tournament."" The FA said the decision in no way suggests that Terry is guilty of making racial comments to Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand during a Premier League match last October. When Chelsea and QPR met again in an FA Cup tie last weekend, the FA canceled the traditional pre-match handshake to defuse any tensions between the players. The FA said it had explained the decision to Terry and national coach Fabio Capello, who was not part of the discussions. The Italian can select the 31-year-old for England's next game against the Netherlands on February 29 and the Euro 2012 tournament in Poland and Ukraine from June 8-July 1. Terry has represented his country 72 times, first becoming captain after the 2006 World Cup. Ferdinand's older brother Rio said on Friday that he did not want to replace Terry as captain, as he did two years ago. ""I don't want to be England captain after the last episode, just want to concentrate on playin for utd&if I make the squad then as ever I'll be delighted,"" the Manchester United player wrote on social networking website Twitter. Terry will keep his role as Chelsea captain, according to his manager Andre Villas-Boas. ""It's really an FA decision. I have nothing to say about it. I don't agree with it,"" the Portuguese coach told reporters ahead of Sunday's Premier League match against Manchester United, which Terry will miss due to a knee injury. ""The statement from the FA was pretty clear on what was their decision-making. John will continue to be our captain. It (the trial) doesn't compromise on my decision-making. It obviously compromises on the FA's decision-making."" The FA's decision was backed by the British government, the UK Press Association reported. ""I completely support the FA's decision,"" Sports minister Hugh Robertson said. ""It would have been impossible for John Terry to have continued as captain with this charge over his head.""","English FA decides that John Terry should not be England skipper ahead of his court case .

"(CNN) -- Former Gov. Jeb Bush recently argued in an op-ed that Hispanic voters will represent the margin of victory in the 15 swing states that will decide who will win the race for the White House. Is his political intuition right? And if it is, how do both parties significantly increase their chances of winning the Hispanic vote? Determining what qualifies as a swing state is not an exact science, but the best estimate nine months out is as follows: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. The key for political parties is registering Hispanics to vote. According to the U.S. Census, 84% of Hispanic registered voters reported voting in 2008. In North Carolina, not generally considered a ""Hispanic state,"" from 2000 to 2010 the Hispanic population grew 111%. Between January 2008 and November 4, 2008, Hispanic voter registration in North Carolina grew by 62%, from 42,000 to 68,000. Obama won the state by only 14,177 votes. Since then, Hispanic voter registration in North Carolina has nearly doubled to 130,615. According to the U.S. Census, in 2010 there were 492,330 Latinos of voting age in North Carolina, representing a clear opportunity for both parties. In a tight race, Hispanic voters could be the margin of victory in 12 of the 15 swing states. (For more state by state data, click here) Three important points about Hispanic swing voters: . -- Hispanics lean Democratic, but it's not a base Democratic vote. Hispanics cast their ballots on issues and in favor of the candidates rather than for the party, much like 40% of the population, which is now considered independent. -- Campaigns need to communicate to Hispanics in both English and Spanish. A strategic move behind President Obama winning 67% of Hispanic vote was his campaign's outspending McCain in the Spanish language media by five to one. -- Hispanic adults are more engaged in the social Web than non-Hispanics, over-indexing as creators, critics, collectors, joiners in and spectators of social networks. In addressing the concerns of this demographic, no candidate can ignore the issue of immigration reform, particularly when it comes to young, first-time voters. Each month 50,000 Hispanics in the United States turn 18. These young voters power Latino social networks, connecting on Facebook and tweeting voters across the country. Imagine the response when the hardworking mom or dad of these young voters is called a ""criminal"" by a candidate. A recent Pew survey found that Latinos, by 91%, support legislation known as the Dream Act that would give legal status to illegal immigrants who earn college degrees or serve in the military for two years. Imagine the waves across social media when the Dream Act is not aggressively pursued or summarily dismissed. And immigration -- and its power to alienate or attract voters -- is the key for both parties, not just Republicans. Yet, so far for both parties, immigration has been kryptonite. President Obama broke his promise to introduce an immigration reform bill during his first year in office. He deported 1.2 million Latinos, including 46,000 parents of American citizens. His draconian policies left thousands of frightened children languishing in foster care, which brought an onslaught of negative Spanish-language media. Heading into the presidential campaign, President Obama's approval rating among Latinos has plunged 36 points since April 2009 -- from 85% to 49%, according to a recent Pew survey. Obama's potential opponent, Republican front-runner Mitt Romney, wants to make life so unbearable for Hispanics working here illegally that they will ""self-deport."" Passing apartheid-like laws to pressure Hispanic undocumented workers to leave the country is central to Romney's platform. Witness the laws passed in Alabama, Arizona and South Carolina, whose chief architect, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, happily endorsed Romney, advises the campaign and acts as a surrogate. To win over Hispanic voters, both President Obama and the GOP nominee need to smother the kryptonite that the issue of immigration has become with a lead blanket of comprehensive immigration reform, supported by strong majorities of Hispanic swing voters and a majority of independents and the general public. Only then can the conversation between Hispanic voters and the candidate really begin. In the 2008 election there was a 30% swing of Hispanic votes away from the Republican Party's share of the vote in 2004. This swing vote was enough to elect Barack Obama to the White House and turn six states — Colorado, Florida, Indiana, New Mexico, Nevada and Virginia — from red to blue. Any candidate or campaign that ignores Hispanic swing voters does it at their peril. For a Spanish-language version of this article, click here / Lea este artículo en español .

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- Turkey's Constitutional Court has rejected a proposed ban on the country's Islamic-rooted ruling party -- the Justice and Development Party, or AKP -- for alleged anti-secularist activities, the leader of the court said Wednesday. The party of Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan's faces possible closure for alleged anti-secular activity. Six justices voted in favor of banning the party, four voted for financial penalties and one justice rejected the case, court leader Hasim Kilic said. Seven of the 11 justices would have had to vote in favor of the ban for it to pass. Instead, the court ruled that the AKP will lose half of its government funding, he said. The penalties will apply to funds the AKP was to receive next year, meaning it will get about 23 million Turkish lira, or just over $19 million -- according to Turkey's treasury. President Abdullah Gul, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and former parliament speaker Bulent Arinc were among the 71 party members the prosecutor wanted banned from public office for the next five years.  Watch what the decision means » . The case marked the pinnacle of the sharp and serious political tensions between the AKP and its outspoken critics from the nation's secularist establishment. Those critics believe the AKP is intent on undermining the secular constitution and nature of the modern Turkish state and on intimidating political opposition. Secularists were outraged at the AKP's recent attempt to lift bans on headscarves at public universities. The move failed after the Constitutional Court overturned the amendment in June. Headcoverings were banned in the early 1980s by Turkey's universities because they were seen as political symbols and conflicted with the nation's secular governing system. The government accuses its critics of using the courts to try to deny the AKP its legitimate victory from last year's elections. AKP says it is promoting democracy and pursuing goals that would bring Turkey into the European Union. Since late last year, police have been arresting people accused of being part of Ergenekon, a group alleged to be conspiring to overthrow the government. Earlier this month, 86 of those arrested -- including former generals, businessmen, and prominent journalists -- were charged in connection with the alleged coup plot. Turkey's economy has prospered under AKP rule and Turkey maintains positive relations with a variety of countries, including Iran, Iraq, the United States and Israel. But recent attacks blamed on Kurdish separatists and the ongoing political crisis have put that progress at risk. Turkey's largest city, Istanbul, was hit Sunday by its deadliest terrorist attack in five years. An explosion -- which happened a day before the Constitutional Court convened on the AKP ban -- killed 17 people, including a 3-year-old child, and sparked immediate outrage. The government blamed Kurdish rebels, but the Kurdistan Workers' Party -- or PKK -- posted a statement on its Web site denying any involvement. Turkey, a strong U.S. ally and NATO member, is a democratic state and has long been regarded as a bridge from Asia and Europe and from the West to the Muslim world. Although it is a predominantly Muslim nation, it has taken the trappings of religion out of public life, in accordance with the policies of Kemal Ataturk, the revered founder of the modern Turkish republic. AKP is not the first political party that Turkey's courts have tried to close. More than 20 political parties have been banned by Turkey's judicial system in recent decades. CNN's Talia Kayali and Paula Hancocks contributed to this report.","Turkey's Constitutional Court rejects a proposed ban on the country's ruling party .
Six of 11 justices voted to ban the party but seven votes were needed .

"(CNN) -- Scottish champions Rangers have made preparations in court for the club to go into administration as they wait to discover if they will be forced the pay the UK government over $78 million in tax. The Glasgow-based club, who have been champions of Scotland 54 times, confirmed they had filed documents at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, which gives them ten days to appoint an administrator. Rangers, who form one half of the famous 'Old Firm' rivalry with city neighbors Celtic, are awaiting the outcome of a tribunal which will rule whether they owe Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) more than Â£50 million ($78m) in tax. The club's chairman, Craig Whyte said there was ""no realistic or practical alternative"" to Rangers' decision and said he was committed to ensuring their long-term future. If the club were to go into administration they would be docked ten points by the Scottish Premier League, which would see them remain second but fall 14 points behind leaders Celtic. In a statement on the club's website Whyte said it was clear since his takeover in May 2011 that ""the club was facing massive financial challenges both in terms of its ongoing financial structure and performance and the potential consequences of the HMRC first tier tax tribunal."" He added: ""I have taken the decision that the most practical way to safeguard the long-term future of the club is to go through a formal restructuring process. It may still be possible to avert this but that is not the most likely way forward. ""What is of paramount importance is the long-term security, survival and prosperity of this great football club."" The case against Rangers centers around the use of employee benefits trusts (EBTs) which the club previously used to pay their players. HMRC insist the club used the method as a way to avoid paying tax and Whyte said Rangers must prepare for the worst. He added: ""There is no realistic or practical alternative to our approach because HMRC has made it plain to the club that should we be successful in the forthcoming tax tribunal decision they will appeal the decision. ""This would leave the club facing years of uncertainty and also having to pay immediately a range of liabilities to HMRC which will be due whatever the overall result of the tax tribunal. ""In blunt terms, if we waited until the outcome of the tax tribunal, the risk of Rangers being faced with an unacceptable financial burden and years of uncertainty is too great.""","Scottish champions Rangers pave the way for the club to go into administration .

"(CNN) -- When the Supreme Court hears an extraordinary three days of arguments this week about the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, thousands of words will pass between the justices and the lawyers appearing before them. Still, it's likely that the single most important word in the case will never be uttered in the courtroom: . Obama. The Supreme Court can make or break presidencies. Almost a dozen years ago, five justices thrust George W. Bush into the Oval Office. A generation earlier, in United States v. Nixon, a unanimous court effectively ended the presidency of Richard M. Nixon by ordering him to provide the Watergate special prosecutor with the White House tapes. Now, to a great extent, the court will render a verdict on the current president's first term. The Supreme Court and election year blockbusters . The stakes for Barack Obama can hardly be overstated, both substantively and politically. Health insurance for 30 million citizens hangs in the balance in this case. Obama took on the challenge that had defeated every Democratic president since Lyndon Johnson -- how to expand access to health care for millions of citizens who didn't have it. Obama won a brutal battle to get the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act through Congress, but it will matter little if the court invalidates the law. Obama is also, of course, a candidate for re-election, and a defeat in the Supreme Court would be a disaster for his chances to win again. If the court strikes down the law, the Republican candidate, presumably Mitt Romney, could say that the Supreme Court proved his own point -- that the incumbent is an out-of-the-mainstream liberal. And Romney could add that his own health care plan, for all its similarities to Obamacare, passed muster in the courts. Read a transcript of Monday's court arguments . For any president or any politician, losing is never good politics -- and a Supreme Court defeat would mark Obama as a loser in a significant and dramatic way. The specifics of the case are complex: What is the scope of the commerce clause of Article I of the Constitution? When is a challenge to a federal law premature? How does a court separate challenges to specific provisions of a law from a claim that an entire law is unconstitutional? But the larger issue in the case reflects a fundamental division in American politics that has persisted for generations: What is the role of the federal government? Obama is heir to a political tradition of activist government, which asserts that the people can rely on programs that protect them from life's misfortunes. The alternative tradition is based on libertarian principles, which hold that government interference in private markets generally does more harm than good. What makes this case so extraordinary is that this debate, as a constitutional matter, looked settled for decades. After Franklin D. Roosevelt made nine appointments to the court during his long tenure in the White House, the Supreme Court embraced a broad conception of government power, especially when it comes to regulating the national economy. Constitutional challenges to government power became rare, and successful ones rarer still. The commerce clause became, in effect, a blank check for Congress. But elections have consequences, and conservative presidents have appointed conservative judges, especially to the Supreme Court. Throughout the'70s, '80s and '90s, moderate Republicans such as Lewis Powell and Sandra Day O'Connor reflected the modern consensus that allowed a vibrant government role in the national economy. But moderate Republicans are disappearing, including on the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Roberts and Samuel Alito reflect the modern conservatism of the man who appointed them, George W. Bush. The legal approach of Clarence Thomas advanced the tea party agenda before the name even existed. Antonin Scalia has defined judicial conservatism for a generation. That's four votes right there. Four Democrats -- Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan -- can be counted on to embrace the post-FDR model of government involvement in the economy. As always, that could leave the case in the hands of Anthony Kennedy, the swing vote. The outcome is uncertain, even if the stakes are not. The language will be arcane, sometimes nearly incomprehensible to nonspecialists. The subject will be principles, not personalities. And so those of us in the courtroom might never hear the name of the man with the biggest stake in the outcome. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Toobin.","Jeffrey Toobin: Supreme Court hears challenge on health reform; high stakes for Obama .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Bob Andrews lost his sight in the Vietnam War but the patriotic American is keen to serve his country again by helping to revive a Ryder Cup competition for blind golfers. Blind golfer Tony Shearman with guide Martin Poole. Former U.S. Marine Andrews was 22 when he was robbed of his vision in 1967 after a grenade explosion left him unable to see. Andrews only occasionally played golf when he was younger. But when he lost his sight his interest in the sport really developed and he became involved in the development of the U.S. Blind Golf Association. Andrews is excited by the possibility of a return of blind golf's version of the Ryder Cup, which was last contested in 1995. And as a former president of the USBGA who now sits on the board of the International Blind Golf Association, Andrews is hopeful the tournament can be revived. ""I would love to see a Ryder Cup for blind golfers make a return. We had some great days back in the 1990s and played some great courses such as Wentworth,"" he said. ""The Ryder Cup itself is really popular and I think that matchplay in a team scenario is ideal for blind golf so bringing it back is something we should all work towards. ""Of course, there are different levels of blindness and provided that the criteria can be laid down -- which has caused some problems in the past -- then I think we could have a brilliant event on our hands."" Tony Shearman, of the English Blind Golf Association, agreed that there is interest in a Ryder Cup competition for blind golfers on his side of the Atlantic. He added: ""Blind golf is really growing and expanding as a sport in Europe and further afield. I think there is a real appetite among the top players here to get some sort of match up between the U.S. and Europe if at all possible. ""We also have some of the best players, including current world champion Mike Loten, so it would be a really good contest. If something can be sorted out that would be brilliant,"" he finished. Blind or partially sighted golfers have a sighted coach who assists the golfer in describing distance, direction and characteristics of the hole, and helps with club head alignment behind the ball, prior to the stroke. From this point, the golfer is on their own, and it is their skill that determines the resulting stroke. Other than the coach, there is only one relaxation to the Royal & Ancient Rules of Golf: Blind or partially sighted golfers are allowed to ground their club in a hazard. Andrews, who lives in Florida, revealed that blind golfers use several techniques to aid them just before they make the shot. ""Some golfers like to visualize what the whole looks like and get as much information as possible from the sighted coach to try and paint a picture in their mind of what the layout of the hole might be,"" he told CNN. ""But I prefer to play the numbers game. What is the par for hole? What is the length of the hole? Once I know these things I can calculate the power needed for my shots and pretty much know how far I need to hit the ball and which club I need. ""Without doubt, putting is the most difficult -- I try to read the contour of the greens through my shoes to get a feel for how hard I have to hit the ball, whether there is a gradient et cetera,"" Andrews explained. ""A lot of the time, with advice from the coach, blind golfers can make it to the greens in more or less the same number of shots as sighted players,"" he said. ""Most of the golf I play is against players who have full vision. And let me tell you they don't cut me any slack whatsoever -- not a single stroke -- especially if the loser buys the beer!"" he joked. While the sighted coach is essential to the blind golfer, having an extra person can also bring a fresh set of problems. ""Sometimes having a coach can overcomplicate things for you with the amount of information and often when they leave stuff out it can actually help you,"" Andrews explained. ""For example, I would hit over a lake easier if I didn't know I was doing so -- but if I know it is there then all of a sudden it puts more pressure on you,"" he said. ""The other thing is that you are playing as part of a team,"" he continued. ""You might be on fire and playing the best golf of your life but if the other part of that team is having a bad day it can mean you don't shoot the score you want.""","Vietnam veteran Bob Andrews is keen to revive a Ryder Cup for blind golfers .

"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- The scene after a bomb exploded in the center of Oslo on Friday reminded New Yorker Ian Dutton of what he witnessed after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States. The scale of the Oslo explosion was smaller than that of 9/11, but the stunned feeling and confusion in the aftermath were eerily similar. ""Seeing the emergency response gives me that same feeling in my spine of being in someone's crosshairs,"" Dutton said. The roads near the government buildings that were the target of the attack were free of most people except emergency responders, whose reflective yellow jackets contrasted with their surroundings. Debris covered the streets -- pieces of metal, poles and glass littered the area. Photos from the state-run broadcaster NRK showed emergency personnel putting people on stretchers and wheeling them through the debris from the blast. Video showed one government building with its windows mostly blasted out along one side. The blast could be felt for miles, witnesses said. ""It rocked me out of bed,"" Dutton said. ""The building that sustained the explosion had a helipad on its roof and now has beams hanging from it,"" Dutton said. Most of the windows were blown out, and curtains were dangling. ""I can see the warped metal of the building,"" he said. There was a line of yellow ambulances by the scene, and a police cordon kept onlookers back. ""I didn't know Oslo had so many ambulances,"" he said. ""Everything is like a movie,"" said Paul Ronneberg, who works three blocks from the explosion. ""You can feel some kind of mystic energy surrounding the town. It's very quiet. Most of the city center is closed of the police. The smiling Norwegian people aren't smiling anymore."" Emily Anderson, a 22-year-old waitress from Fargo, North Dakota, was in Norway on her second day of a family vacation. ""I was in a store with a younger sister and a younger cousin and we were in there shopping and heard a humongous bang and felt an explosion,"" she said. ""We were on a lower level of a store and when we heard it, we gathered at the front doorway of the store. You could see tons of smoke pouring out of this building. It was extremely loud."" Others on the street appeared to be in shock, she said. ""I thought we were going to die. It was scary. It felt like 9/11."" ""It sounded like a thunderclap, but louder than a thunderclap could be,"" said Anderson's 33-year-old cousin, Dawn Lubka, a nurse from Minneapolis who was in her room at the Comfort Hotel Borsparken in Oslo when the blast occurred. She said she initially assumed it was a construction accident, as there are lots of new buildings and a new opera center going up nearby. But when she looked online, she found out what had really happened. ""I asked the concierge, politically, why would they have bombings here? The Norwegians couldn't believe that it could be a bombing in their city. He said, honestly, 'It's because we're friends with you. Because (Norway) is helping with troops in Afghanistan.'"" Morten Vaage said he was about 800 meters from the explosion when it occurred after he had attended a parade to welcome his brother and other soldiers back from Afghanistan. At the parade, the Norwegian defense minister, Grete Faremo, had addressed the soldiers ""and emphasized how lucky we are to live in this country of Norway, where we are safe and free,"" he said. The explosion soon after contrasted sharply with her words. ""It did not feel like Norway,"" he said. ""I heard the explosion and the whole central (train) station shook. ... People were shocked; some were crying, some were bleeding."" Ulrik Fredrik Thyve was finishing a day's work when he heard the ""huge, enormous bang."" ""The explosion was immense; my office felt like it contracted, expanded, and windows were blown all over the building,"" he said. ""Dust, smoke, people bleeding everywhere. I walked out and towards ground zero to see if there was anything to do."" Police evacuated him and his co-workers from the area.

"(CNN) -- The Dalai Lama announced Thursday his plan to retire as political head of the Tibetan exile movement, according to his website. ""Tibetans need a leader, elected freely by the Tibetan people, to whom I can devolve power,"" the exiled spiritual leader said in a statement. ""Now, we have clearly reached the time to put this into effect."" The Dalai Lama remains the head of state for now, according to Tempa Tshering, his representative in India, and will remain the group's spiritual leader. What the Dalai Lama's 'retirement' means . ""On March 14, (the) parliament will meet in Dharamsala (India) and decide whether to approve his request,"" Tshering said. ""He wants to make a change. He has always believed in democracy and he wasn't elected as head of state."" If the changes are made, leadership of the group would be passed onto an elected leader. ""Since I made my intention clear, I have received repeated and earnest requests both from within Tibet and outside, to continue to provide political leadership,"" the DalaiLama said in his statement. ""My desire to devolve authority has nothing to do with a wish to shirk responsibility. It is to benefit Tibetans in the long run. ""It is not because I feel disheartened. Tibetans have placed such faith and trust in me that as one among them I am committed to playing my part in the just cause of Tibet,"" he said. ""I trust that gradually people will come to understand my intention, will support my decision and accordingly let it take effect."" The Chinese Foreign Ministry panned the announcement, calling the Dalai Lama a ""religious crook,"" who is trying to splinter China. ""He is the mastermind of political activism,"" said Jiang Yu, ministry spokeswoman. ""He has said many times he is leaving but this seems to be one of his tricks to deceive the international community."" In Nepal, 11 people were arrested Thursday for displaying ""Free Tibet"" banners and shouting anti-Chinese slogans, police said. Some of the arrests took place near the Buddhist monastery of Boudhanath in the capital, Kathmandu, on the anniversary of a failed Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule. The Dalai Lama fled China 52 years ago on March 10, 1959, after the failed uprising. The exile group is headquartered in Dharamsala in northern India. The Dalai Lama told CNN in October that he would like to retire at some point. ""I'm also a human being. ... Retirement is also my right,"" he said while on a speaking tour of North America. Without saying exactly when, he said, ""Sooner or later, I have to go. I'm over 75, so next 10 years, next 20 years, one day I will go.""

"(CNN) -- Ohio authorities on Saturday advanced their investigation into killings tied to a Craigslist job listing when they identified the last of three bodies found last month, a sheriff said. The body of Ralph H. Geiger, 56, of Akron, Ohio, was identified by the Licking County coroner's office, said Sheriff Stephen S. Hannum of Noble County. His corpse had been discovered by investigators November 25 in a shallow grave in eastern Ohio. He and two other men found dead -- also in different shallow graves -- are believed to have been killed after answering a Craigslist ad to work on a cattle farm in eastern Ohio, authorities said. Brogan Rafferty, 16, of Stow, Ohio, who is a high school sophomore, is facing charges of aggravated murder and attempted murder in the killings, and prosecutors are seeking to try him as an adult, according to CNN affiliates WKYC and WJW. In court documents filed by prosecutors, Richard Beasley, 52, of Akron, Ohio, is also alleged to have been involved in the killings. But he hasn't been charged yet specifically in relation to the case. Beasley did plead not guilty this week to promoting prostitution charges -- an unrelated case -- and he was being held in lieu of $1 million bail, WKYC reported. Rafferty's father, Michael, told WJW a week ago that his 16-year-old son had been ""manipulated"" and ""corrupted,"" insisting that his son is a ""mild-mannered gentleman."" The father also said that his son unwittingly dug the graves at Beasley's direction, WJW reported. The boy's mother said her son denied killing anyone and added that Beasley portrayed himself as ""a chaplain"" who gave food to the homeless. Last week, another victim was identified as Timothy Kern, 47, of Massillon, Ohio, who died from gunshot wounds to the head and whose body was found in a shallow grave behind an Akron mall, authorities said. The other murder victim has been identified as David Pauley, Noble County Sheriff's office dispatcher Kevin Macri told CNN on Saturday. The South Carolina man's body was also found last month in a shallow grave with a gunshot wound to the head, according to WKYC. The investigation into the killings began the night of November 6, when a Noble County deputy sheriff responded to a call and came upon a ""white, middle-aged man being treated for a gunshot wound to the right arm,"" according to Hannum. The wounded man, who is from South Carolina and was not identified by police, told the sheriff he had answered an ad on the Craigslist website offering work caring for cattle on a 688-acre property. He met with the two suspects and drove with them toward Stock Township. After being told a road was closed due to a landslide, the South Carolina man got out of the car to start walking toward the property, which he was told was nearby. He told the sheriff that, while walking through a heavily wooded area, he then turned around ""to see a gun pointed at his head. He deflected the gun and ran"" -- getting shot in the arm while fleeing, the sheriff explained last month. The victim hid for seven hours in the forest before going to a house and requesting help, Hannum said last week. Zach Kern, 19, told CNN last week that he last saw his father, Timothy, on November 12 after he had gone with another son for the job interview. ""He was all stoked about it,"" Zach Kern said of his father's feelings about the opportunity to work on the cattle farm. ""My brother ... thought the whole situation was sketchy."" Zach Kern said his father, divorced and with three children, worked ""odd jobs"" including recently as a street cleaner in Canton. He said that his father saw his children daily, adding that the whole family is struggling to come to grips with his death. ""We're just trying to get through this,"" Zach Kern said. In his last Facebook posting, dated November 10, Timothy Kern wrote: ""Just got one of the strangest job offers. A good offer but strange. The job is to watch over 680 acres south of cambridge. Odd jobs and such but mainly just secure it. Trailer, utilities, salary. Drawbacks? No cell phone service, kids are up here, and i have to move this Sunday.""

"(CNN) -- In sweeping discipline that one analyst called ""historic,"" New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton was suspended without pay for the entire 2012 season and former Saints defensive coach Gregg Williams was suspended indefinitely in a series of NFL punishments Wednesday for the team's bounty program targeting opponents. Under the bounties, the team paid bonuses for knocking opposing players out of a game, the NFL said. Saints General Manager Mickey Loomis was suspended without pay for the first eight regular-season games of the 2012 season, the NFL said. Assistant Head Coach Joe Vitt was suspended without pay for the first six regular-season games, the league said. The team was also fined $500,000 and will forfeit its second-round draft picks in 2012 and 2013, the National Football League said. The club issued a statement apologizing and taking full responsibility for ""these serious violations."" ""We recognize our fans' concerns and we regret the uncertainty this episode has created for them,"" the Saints' statement said. ""We are humbled by the support our organization has received from our fans today in the wake of this announcement, and we ask them to continue to stand with us, as they have done in the past, when both our team and our city have overcome greater adversities. ""There is no place for bounties in our league and we reiterate our pledge that this will never happen again,"" the team said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell will review the status of Williams, now with the St. Louis Rams, at the end of the season and decide whether to reinstate him, the league said. Williams apologized ""wholeheartedly"" in a statement and said his leadership role in the bounty program was ""not a true reflection of my values as a father or coach."" ""I highly value the 23 years that I've spent in the NFL. I will continue to cooperate fully with the league and its investigation and I will focus my energies on serving as an advocate for both player safety and sportsmanship,"" Williams said. ""I will do everything possible to re-earn the respect of my colleagues, the NFL and its players in hopes of returning to coaching in the future."" In issuing the punishments, Goodell described the Saints' violations of league rules ""particularly unusual and egregious."" He added that ""a strong and lasting message must be sent."" Goodell said he is reviewing with the NFL Players Association discipline for players involved in the bounty program and will address the matter later. One sports analyst, Jim Trotter of Sports Illustrated, said the discipline is ""historic."" ""One of the reasons they could be so strong against the Saints was that there was a paper trail,"" Trotter said, referring to e-mails. ""I don't think other teams would be dumb enough to put it in writing,"" Trotter said of the bounty system. ""I definitely believe they are trying to make an example of them."" The NFL already is facing class-action lawsuits from former players of various teams who claimed that league play led to concussions, head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a dementia-like brain disease. ""The league has to be concerned about lawsuits,"" Trotter said. The NFL investigation found the Saints had an ""active bounty program"" during the 2009, 2010 and 2011 seasons in which ""bounty"" payments were given for ""knock-outs"" and ""cart-offs"": plays in which an opposing player had to leave the game, the league said in a statement. The bounties even identified specific players as targets, the league said. The investigation found that the Saints showed ""a deliberate effort to conceal the program's existence from league investigators, and a clear determination to maintain the program despite express direction from Saints ownership that it stop as well as ongoing inquiries from the league office,"" the NFL said. The Saints won the Super Bowl in 2010, in the midst of the bounty program. Goodell said the ""pay-for-performance"" program ""undermined the integrity of the game."" The league found that Payton, as head coach, failed to supervise players and coaches, didn't inquire into the facts of the bounty program though he was aware of the league's inquiries, and encouraged ""the false denials by instructing assistants to 'make sure our ducks are in a row,' "" the NFL statement said. Goodell added: ""When there is targeting of players for injury and cash rewards over a three-year period, the involvement of the coaching staff, and three years of denials and willful disrespect of the rules, a strong and lasting message must be sent that such conduct is totally unacceptable and has no place in the game. ""Beyond the clear and continuing violations of league rules, and lying to investigators, the bounty program is squarely contrary to the league's most important initiatives -- enhancing player health and safety and protecting the integrity of the game,"" the commissioner continued. ""Let me be clear. There is no place in the NFL for deliberately seeking to injure another player, let alone offering a reward for doing so,"" Goodell said. On his Twitter account, Saints quarterback Drew Brees wrote: ""I am speechless. Sean Payton is a great man, coach, and mentor. The best there is. I need to hear an explanation for this punishment."" Saints starting linebacker Jo-Lonn Dunbar also tweeted: ""Can we all say #excessive."" At a news conference Wednesday afternoon, St. Louis Rams Head Coach Jeff Fisher said that the indefinite suspension of his defensive coordinator, Williams, didn't come as ""a complete surprise."" But he said Williams was ""surprised and shocked."" Fisher said the Rams had no idea when they hired Williams ""that this would happen."" ""He made a mistake, and he admitted to that mistake, and he's remorseful, and he regrets the decision he has made, and he has accepted the consequences,"" Fisher said of Williams. On Wednesday, the NFL laid out a narrative of the Saints' bounty program. Players regularly made cash ""donations"" to a pool and were ""fined"" for mental errors, loafing and penalties, the NFL investigation found. At least one assistant coach, Williams, also occasionally contributed to the pool, but the NFL found no evidence that any team money went to the fund. Payments were made for plays in which opposing players were injured and for interceptions and fumble recoveries, the NFL said. ""The investigation showed bounties being placed on four quarterbacks of opposing teams -- (Minnesota's) Brett Favre, (Carolina's) Cam Newton, (Green Bay's) Aaron Rodgers, and (Arizona's) Kurt Warner,"" the NFL said. Favre and Warner have since retired. Several players pledged money for bounties on specific opponents, ""with defensive captain Jonathan Vilma offering $10,000 to any player who knocked Brett Favre out of the NFC Championship Game in 2010,"" the NFL said. In the three seasons of the bounty program, the Saints were among the top five teams in roughing-the-passer penalties and ranked in the top six teams for unnecessary roughing penalties, the NFL said. After a January 2010 playoff game, Saints defensive players were fined $15,000 for fouls against the Arizona Cardinals, and after the NFC Championship against the Minnesota Vikings, the Saints defense was fined a total of $30,000 for four illegal hits, several of which were directed against Favre, the NFL said. Assistant head coach Vitt acknowledged to investigators that the team's ""defensive meeting preceding the 2010 NFC Championship Game may have 'got out of hand' with respect to Brett Favre,"" the NFL said. A document written after a preseason game stated ""1 Cart-off -- Crank up the John Deer (sic) Tractor"" in reference to a hit on an opponent, the NFL said. ""Similar statements are reflected in prepared documents or slides in connection with other games in multiple seasons. A review of the game films confirms that opposing players were injured on the plays identified in the documents,"" the NFL said. Last year, before the opener, head coach Payton ""received an e-mail from a close associate that stated in part, 'PS Greg Williams put me down for $5000 on Rogers (sic),'"" the NFL said. Payton told investigators that the e-mail referred to a ""bounty"" on Green Bay's Rodgers, the NFL said. Williams ""acknowledged that he designed and implemented the (bounty) program with the assistance of certain defensive players"" after being told by Payton to make the defense ""nasty,"" the NFL found. Williams kept records, determined the amount and recipients of the payouts, and distributed the ""envelopes with cash to players who 'earned' rewards,"" the NFL said. But Williams was first questioned about the bounty program in early 2010, ""he intentionally misled NFL investigators and made no effort to stop the program after he became aware of the league's investigation,"" the NFL said. CNN's Tim Clark and Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.","NEW: ""This will never happen again,"" the apologetic Saints team says .

"(CNN) -- ""Game of Thrones,"" the wonderfully bloody and lustful series, is back for a second season starting April 1 on HBO. Kit Harington plays Jon Snow, the illegitimate son of Ned who is also known by the moniker, ""the bastard."" Before he had even graduated from drama school, the Worcestershire native won the lead role in the West End production of ""War Horse."" Calling from London, the 25 year old actor is unfailingly polite, apologizing profusely for having missed a scheduled time to chat. Harington also admits (jokingly) that he can't really consider himself an English actor because he never appeared in the ""Harry Potter"" series. ""It's mad isn't it?"" he remarks. ""I kind of wanted to audition for 'Harry' when it was first being done but I think I was a year too old."" The actor talked to CNN about the new season of his hit series (HBO is owned by CNN's parent company), the dirty business of acting on the show and his swordsmanship. CNN: What can we expect this season? Kit Harington: Basically you can expect the world we're in to break apart in a way. Everything we've established in this world, this world disintegrates around us. But it's very much in the vein of where we left it. It gets more brutal I guess, more blood and guts and more sex. CNN: Don't you love that? Harington: I do, I think it's important in a way. In our show the sex can be a source of humor. It can also be more serious than that, it sort of tells the story of how women are treated in the world. It kind of strikes a balance in that way I think it's important for shows to show sex. CNN: Are you encouraged to not wash your hair? Harington: I don't wash it anyway when I'm filming. It's my choice in a kind of strange little way. I think when we shot the pilot one of the things that was wrong about it was that everybody looked too clean. There wasn't enough dirt on people's faces. Hair was too slicked back. When they saw the pilot they rang and said, ""Can you grow your hair? Grow a beard, we want it to look a bit dirtier and grubbier and more visceral."" We were in Iceland for about a month and I kind of let it build up. It was very, very nice to wash it by the end. CNN: Do you also refrain from showering? Harington: No. I shower. CNN: So you're not really committed to the role. Harington: (Laughs) Yeah possibly. I can try that next season, although I think people might have complaints. CNN: Do you put dirt under your fingernails? Harington: Yeah we go into hair and makeup and they just shove loads of dirt on you. CNN: Everyone must have reeked back then. Harington: The sets reek as well. I remember for season one there was a gutted deer carcass they brought on and this wasn't a fake prosthetic deer carcass and by the end of the day it had started to ferment and the smell coming off it was unreal. On any day on the set you've got horse s***, oh sorry -- pardon -- and it can be quite a disgraceful place to be. CNN: Your character is called the bastard. Harington: It's a weird one that because in the world we set it in it means the same thing but it also means something different. It's strange but I quite like it. CNN: Ever been called it in public? Harington: There have been a couple of times when I've been called it on the street and I've said, ""Hey wait why are you calling me..."" Oh that's right, I see. CNN: Have you become handy with a sword? Harington: There's a huge difference between stage fighting and real sword fighting. I feel comfortable with a sword now, I quite enjoy wielding one. I wouldn't profess to be good in a real life and death situation. Enough to maybe hopefully impress the ladies. CNN: You were in the London stage production of ""War Horse."" Were you upset that you weren't cast in the movie? Harington: It was kind of a weird win win situation for me in that I was ramping up for ""Thrones"" when it was being cast, anyway, so I kind of had long hair and a beard and I didn't really look like a young farm boy anymore, but I did go for it and I got a recall. For me it was like I'd done ""War Horse"" for a year and if I got the film, great, but at the same time I kind of wanted to move on by that stage. So I didn't mind at all when it went no further. CNN: Is your name really Kit? Harington: It's my name. It's short for Christopher. I didn't know my name was Christopher until I was 11. I went to school, you do these exams and I put down Kit Harington and the teacher said, ""That's not your name,"" and I said, ""Yeah I think I'd know my own name!"" They were like, ""No no your name is Christopher."" I was a bit pissed off with my mum. You didn't tell me my name till I was 11!","Kit Harington plays Jon Snow, the illegitimate son of Ned, on HBO's ""Game of Thrones""

"Beverly Hills, California (CNN) -- Whether inside or outside the Beverly Hilton hotel where singer Whitney Houston died Saturday afternoon, the grief and shock were the same. They were just expressed differently -- by the famous indoors and by the everyday fan outdoors. Inside the hotel that occupies a full block, the music industry's biggest names gathered in elegant attire for an annual pre-Grammy party that had been long planned by Houston's mentor, Clive Davis. But a party just didn't seem right, participants said as they walked down the red carpet. Some, like songwriter David Foster, thought twice about attending a gala at the same hotel where 48-year-old Houston died in her room just hours earlier. ""We debated whether to come tonight and we realized it was going to continue and it was going to be a memorial,"" Foster said. ""It's just shocking,"" he said of the death. When the party started, legend Tony Bennett listed the names of great entertainments who recently died: Michael Jackson, Amy Winehouse, and now ""the magnificent Whitney Houston,"" he said. Bennett then made a well-understood reference to Houston's past problems with drugs, and he called on ""everyone to get our government to legalize drugs"" so persons don't have to get it from ""gangs"" under the table, he said. The country needs to ""legalize drugs like they did in Amsterdam,"" Bennett added. He then sang ""How Do You Keep the Music Playing"" and received a standing ovation with the last line: ""Hope the music never ends."" Davis opened his remarks about the ""unspeakably tragic news of our beloved Whitney's passing."" Davis has long hosted a party the day before the Grammy Awards, the music industry's most celebrated event. ""I do have a heavy heart, and I am personally devastated by someone so close to me for so many years,"" Davis told the gathering of artists and entertainers. ""My heart goes out to her daughter Bobbi Kristina and her mother, Cissy,"" Davis said. Houston's mentor then asked for a moment of silence, saying, ""We dedicate this evening to her."" Outside, as a coastal chill settled over people who gathered until the small hours of Sunday morning, fans and media flocked to two places: the front and back entrances of the sprawling hotel complex. In between, they laid roses and flickering candles. At the front entrance, a Beverly Hills police officer pushed back mourners and journalists from the entryway and said that they had to stand on the public sidewalk, pointing to the line dividing public space and private property. Many of the 100 persons carried the flame of a candle. Singing accompanied the vigil, including such Houston standards as ""The Greatest Love of All."" One singer, Pepper Mashay, who met Houston once about 10 years ago, started singing ""My Love is Your Love"" in memory of Houston. Mourners, as well as journalists, immediately started recording video of the sidewalk performance on their cameras or smart phones. Mashay remarked how Houston struggled with drug problems. ""Pain -- they're carrying a lot of pain,"" Mashay said about Houston's drug woes. ""It could be relationships from the past. All we can say is that she's at peace now."" Then Mashay added, remembering that Houston has a teenaged daughter: ""There's a teenager out here who's lost her mother."" But it was at the back of the hotel -- at the service entrance -- where the largest group of fans, mourners, media and paparazzi gathered. About 200 persons assembled on the ficus-tree-lined sidewalk. Everyone was waiting for whether Houston's body was going to taken away by authorities through the service door. A police vehicle marked ""Crime Lab"" was parked at the door, also joined by a large truck marked ""rental"" -- which conveniently shielded off spectators from the best view of the entrance. The rear door was also being used by artists such as Tony Bennett and Jennifer Hudson attending Davis' party. The entertainers apparently were seeking to avoid the public, but it hardly worked Saturday night. At one point, a woman in the crowd shouted: ""Alicia!"" as singer Alicia Keys walked by. The throng surged. Paparazzi and fans with cameras pushed the hardest to get to the front of the line, where the public sidewalk met the private driveway. Keys entered the back of the hotel, and then the pack of spectators eased and resumed friendly conversation in the cool night air beside the seven-foot tall bushes. Some fans wept, as they played Houston's music videos on their smartphones. One fan, Tya Conerly, 31, just had to stop by the hotel, even tough she, her girlfriend and Conerly's daughter should have been making the two-hour drive back home to San Diego. Conerly's daughter, Isreal, turned 11 years old on Saturday, and the group of three drove to Los Angeles to do some shopping and have a celebratory dinner for Isreal's birthday. It was also a celebration of Conerly's 31st birthday on Friday. But when Conerly's girlfriend, Crystal James, 26, received a phone call from her father saying that Houston had died, none of the three could believe it. Conerly thought it was another Twitter rumor of a celebrity's death, and she used her phone to check it out the information. She found that Houston had indeed died -- at the Beverly Hilton. The day become a birthday that Isreal will never forget, she said. So the two women and girl visited the hotel -- and decided to join the crowd at the back door, wondering when the coroner or police would remove Houston's body. ""We just wanted to come by and show some support,"" Conerly said under a towering ficus tree by the rear driveway. ""It's just so sad,"" she added. Then she referred to Houston's history of drug abuse. ""Everyone has their own demons, and some overcome them and some never do,"" Conerly stated. ""Sometimes life gets the best of us.""","Inside the Beverly Hilton Hotel, entertainers hold a long planned pre-Grammy party .

"Health.com -- People who regularly use tanning beds may double or even triple their risk of developing melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, according to a new study. The study found that people who have ever tanned indoors have about a 75 percent higher risk of melanoma, on average, than people who have never tried it. But the risk of melanoma was much higher among frequent and long-term indoor tanners. Compared with those who had never touched a tanning bed, people who spent more than 50 hours under the lights were three times more likely to develop melanoma, according to the study, which is the largest of its kind to date. People who frequented tanning salons for more than 10 years or who logged more than 100 sessions were about 2.5 times more likely to develop the cancer. The study comes as an FDA advisory panel is pondering tougher regulations on indoor tanning, including use restrictions (if not an outright ban) for people under age 18. At a meeting in late March, the panel discussed strengthening skin-cancer warnings at tanning salons and moving tanning beds to a class of medical devices that includes CT scanners, among other measures. Health.com: 30 most flattering bathing suits this summer . Amy Waldrop, of Clifton, Virginia, who was 41 years old when she first learned she had melanoma, told the FDA panel that her doctors said her use of tanning beds as a teenager was most likely responsible. ""Even after seeing my surgical scars, my teenage daughters have expressed an interest in using tanning beds,"" says Waldrop. ""They've told me that if tanning beds were that bad, they wouldn't be legal."" The testimony the FDA panel heard in March was ""pretty compelling,"" says Dr. Lynn Drake, a dermatologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston, and a nonvoting member of the panel. ""This new study adds to the body of evidence supporting the fact that indoor tanning poses significant risks."" Health.com: Find the best self-tanner for you . Teens, however, do not seem to be more susceptible than adults to artificial ultraviolet (UV) rays. The study results suggest that a person's melanoma risk is more closely linked to total exposure than to the age at which he or she first tans indoors. ""Given our findings, the age you start indoor tanning may matter less than how much you do it,"" says the lead author of the study, DeAnn Lazovich, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Minnesota. ""Maybe a ban should also be considered for adults."" Nearly 70,000 people in the U.S. got a melanoma diagnosis in 2009 and more than 8,000 died from the disease, according to estimates from the National Cancer Institute. Melanoma is deadly because it can invade deep into tissues and spread to other parts of the body, unlike other types of skin cancer, which are relatively easy to remove. Melanoma is the second-most-common cancer among people ages 15 to 29, and appears to be on the rise overall. The new study, which appears in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention, included nearly 1,200 melanoma patients in Minnesota and a cancer-free control group. Of the melanoma patients in the study, 63 percent had tanned indoors at least once, compared with 51 percent of the melanoma-free individuals. Health.com: Is it a mole...or skin cancer? Lazovich and her colleagues also measured the melanoma risk associated with different types of tanning machines. Compared with people who had never tanned indoors, those who tanned in high-speed and high-pressure machines had roughly three and 4.5 times the risk of developing melanoma, respectively. High-speed machines use higher amounts of ultraviolet-B (UVB) light while high-pressure machines use more ultraviolet-A (UVA). However, the researchers couldn't say definitively that one type of machine is more dangerous than the other, because few study participants could remember the exact machines they used and because UVA and UVB output can depend on factors such as maintenance, not just the model of the machine. The new findings seem likely to bolster the government's efforts to regulate indoor tanning. When the FDA panel met in March, the foremost scientific evidence was a review of 19 studies conducted by a World Health Organization working group, which found that tanning indoors at least once increased a person's risk of melanoma by 15 percent. (For people who started tanning at age 35 or younger, the increase in risk rose to 75 percent.) The WHO group later deemed tanning devices to be carcinogenic. But the organization emphasized some shortcomings in the research, such as the inability of most studies to tease apart the effects of indoor tanning versus sunbathing or to pinpoint how the extent of tanning-bed use -- also known as the ""dose"" -- affects skin-cancer risk. Health.com: 5 ways to sun-proof your skin . Lazovich's study was specifically designed to fill these gaps in the existing research. John Overstreet, a spokesperson for the Indoor Tanning Association, a trade organization representing tanning facilities and suppliers, said in an e-mail that unanswered questions remain. He noted that vitamin D, which is produced by the skin with moderate UV exposure, may have cancer-fighting benefits. ""Science is still wrestling with this issue and there's certainly still more to learn,"" Overstreet said. ""We welcome a more complete body of research that will allow us to advise our customers how to achieve their goals without unnecessary risk of exposure."" The Federal Trade Commission recently charged the Indoor Tanning Association with exaggerating the benefits of indoor tanning and falsely denying the associated skin-cancer risks. According to Drake, the health benefits of tanning -- as opposed to limited sun exposure -- are a myth. ""A healthy tan is an oxymoron,"" she says. ""A tan is simply a response to injury, whether it's obtained indoors or outdoors.""

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- The Yemeni cabinet has approved the draft of a law that will give President Ali Abdullah Saleh and his aides immunity from prosecution. The draft was submitted to parliament for approval and is expected to be approved within days, said Yahya al-Arasi, a senior vice presidential aide. Ghaleb al-Odaini, the spokesman for the opposition Joint Meeting Parties (JMP), said the law will pass but expect lawmakers to make changes to it before approving it. Under the terms of a Gulf Cooperation Council-brokered deal, Saleh has agreed to step down as president on February 21 in exchange for immunity from prosecution. The law, if approved in its current form, will also give immunity to officials who worked under Saleh during his 33-year rule. A day after the draft was approved, thousands of protesters rallied Monday in more than a dozen provinces against the proposal. Some waved banners that showed a picture of Saleh holding a butcher knife in his bloodied hands. Others, however, saw the merit in the proposal. ""We are against the immunity bill, but it will play a big role in ending the Saleh family rule in Yemen and give us a chance to build a new nation,"" said Abdullah al-Kuraimi, a youth activist in Sanaa. Yemen's Prime Minister Mohammed Basendowah defended the immunity bill saying that it will help Yemen avoid violence through the immunity. ""We granted President Saleh immunity to rid the country from a civil war or possible bloodshed,"" he said. He said it was a necessary political solution. ""For those who think a revolution can force Saleh out of power, they can try,"" he said. Senior Saleh aides said the president will head to Saudi Arabia for medical treatment after he steps down. Meanwhile, parliamentarians argued vehemently Monday with Saleh's aides refusing to accept Vice President Abdu Rabu Hadi as the unified candidate for the February 21 presidential elections. Sultan Barakani, the head of the ruling General People Congress bloc in parliament, said discussions on Hadi should be delayed until February, giving time for Saleh's immunity law to pass. Aides to Hadi have accused Saleh -- both of whom are in the same political party -- of being behind the rising tensions, whether by sitting quietly as his supporters chastised Hadi or siding against the vice president. The vice presidential aides said that Saleh and his supporters appear unhappy with Hadi's actions in recent months, including his steadily decreasing the powers of the president and his most ardent loyalists.","NEW: Prime Minister says the immunity bill will help Yemen avoid bloodshed .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A high-frequency radar in California detected the March 11 tsunami that devastated Japan, raising hopes for the development of a new early warning system, a University of California at Davis oceanographer said. It was the first time a tsunami has been observed on radar, said Professor John Largier, an oceanographer at the University of California at Davis and an author of a new paper describing the work. ""We have the hardware set up. We have the system operational. It's a software challenge that we show we can achieve"" for the West Coast, Largier told CNN Tuesday. His paper appears this month in the journal Remote Sensing. A consortium of universities in California already has a high-frequency radar system set up for the West Coast to detect changes in the ocean's currents. To develop an early warning system for tsunamis on the West Coast, software would be needed, Largier said. Such a detection system could provide a 15-minute warning for a tsunami approaching northern California and an early warning of an hour for southern California, where the shallow continental shelf along the coast is bigger, Largier said. The U.S. East Coast and southeast Asia would have to set up a system and software from scratch, but an early detection system could provide an hour's warning for the Eastern Seaboard and several hours for southeast Asia, where the coastal shallow waters are much bigger, Largier said. For the past decade, Largier and his colleagues have used a high-frequency radar array at the university's Bodega Marine Lab to study ocean currents off California. That radar array is state-funded, but researchers are concerned about the costs of continuing to operate it, Largier said. Researchers from Hokkaido and Kyoto universities in Japan and San Francisco State University and Largier used data from radar sites at Bodega Bay; Trinidad, Calif.; and two sites in Hokkaido, Japan, to look for the tsunami offshore. The radar doesn't pick up the actual tsunami but rather changes in currents as the wave travels, the scientists said. As the waves enter shallower coastal water over the continental shelf, they slow down, increase in height and decrease in wavelength, the scientists said.","A tsunami has been observed for the first time on radar, an oceanographer says .

"(CNN) -- Italy -- an economic giant of the eurozone -- is failing on the global stage and must adapt if it is to survive, the head of coffee giant Illycaffe has warned. Andrea Illy, CEO of Trieste-headquartered Illycaffe, told CNN his country's woes would be ""just the beginning of our problems"" unless its businesses learned to compete in the international marketplace -- something they had largely failed to do. ""The Italian economy is wrong in the sense that it is not conscious enough about how important it is to become competitive in the global arena,"" he said. ""Let's say we don't really step up: what we have suffered until now... is just the beginning of our problems."" Italy's economy makes up 17% of the eurozone -- almost three times that of bailed-out Greece, Portugal and Ireland combined -- and, as the third-largest economy in the bloc, is regarded as ""too big to fail."" Illy's comments come as the borrowing costs of Spain, another pillar of the bloc, push toward 6%, feeding fears the debt crisis is spreading to larger economies. Italy's borrowing costs passed the psychological 7% level -- beyond which countries are considered unable to fund themselves -- last November, before dropping back. According to Illy, Italian businesses have been slow to adapt to the demands of a globalized economy -- unlike many German businesses, for example, which had aggressively pursued a path of international expansion through creating foreign partnerships. ""Some entrepreneurs did it: few, not enough,"" he said. ""In the meantime, the relative size of the Italian industries in most of the sectors has been declining."" He said the far-reaching reforms being implemented by new Prime Minister Mario Monti were ""absolutely"" necessary for Italy to regain its economic vitality. ""This country needs a break in Italian politics in order to reform,"" he said. ""Otherwise there will be no growth."" Illy is the grandson of Francesco Illy, who developed the modern espresso machine and founded the company in Trieste in 1933. Today, Illycaffe sells its products in more than 130 countries around the world. The company faced a significant challenge in competing ""in a more crowded, competitive market arena,"" he said. But, conversely, ""opportunities are becoming much larger,"" he added. He saw a strong future for the company in the premium sector of the coffee market, which had undergone significant changes in the past decade or so. Previously, he said, the market had been ""the shape of an anvil... with a big mainstream part and a very small narrow premium coffee segment."" Today, he said, it was more like an hourglass, with a substantial market for premium, specialty coffees. ""This is the future,"" he said. ""It will be more and more high quality, like wine."" Being an internationally competitive coffee brand did not mean aiming to have as many outlets as Starbucks, he said. ""I would like to have 1% of what they have, but to reach the same awareness.""","The head of Illycaffe says Italian business has failed to compete internationally .

"(CNN) -- After months of bomb threats at the University of Pittsburgh, an anonymous group that calls itself the Threateners has claimed responsibility for the most recent e-mail threats and announced to the school's student-run newspaper that it will stop sending them. Michael Macagnone, whose term as editor-in-chief of The Pitt News ended Sunday, said the paper received an anonymous e-mail Friday claiming that the bomb threats plaguing the school since February 13 would end if university officials revoked a $50,000 reward for anyone who came forward with information that led to an arrest. The paper received a second e-mail Saturday, after university officials revoked the reward, saying there would be no more threats, Macagnone said. The university has received more than 140 threats since February, according to spokesman Robert Hill. The threats have not yielded any explosives, but the majority of them have resulted in evacuations of dorms, libraries and other campus buildings. Hill confirmed that the university had withdrawn the reward but would not comment on why it did so. The author of the anonymous e-mail to The Pitt News said that the Threateners began sending the bomb threats March 30 because the university issued a reward for ""some young kid who'd pranked the university,"" Macagnone said. The group said it was not responsible for threats before that date and also said it was not affiliated with anyone who had been ""publically identified as suspects."" Macagnone said he handed the first anonymous e-mail over to police Friday. The paper published a report on the e-mail Saturday, after a 24-hour period without any threats, which the anonymous author promised in the first e-mail. ""We started thinking the e-mail was a little bit more authentic when it accurately predicted that gap,"" Macagnone said. Since the second e-mail promising an end to the threats, no more have been reported through the school's emergency alert system. Despite the lull, university officials are restricting final exams, scheduled to start this week, to five campus buildings. All of them will be swept for explosives at the beginning of each exam day. According to a letter posted on the university's website by Senior Vice Chancellor Patricia Beeson, any buildings that receive bomb threats will be checked for explosives but evacuated only if law enforcement officials deem it necessary. ""These arrangements reflect the expert advice we have received from law enforcement professionals, the experience we have gained over the past several weeks, and the special circumstances associated with finals week,"" the letter says. The Justice Department said in a statement April 11 that investigators were making ""significant progress."" U.S. Attorney David J. Hickton said they were focused on ""potential suspects."" Investigators have remained mum on any potential leads. An FBI spokesman declined to comment on the investigation, and a Justice Department spokeswoman did not return calls for comment. Katherine Anne McCloskey, 55, and Seamus Johnston, 22, of Cambria County, Pennsylvania, had been subpoenaed in connection with the investigation. The pair testified before a grand jury April 17, according to Johnston. Johnston said FBI officials returned to the couple's apartment the following day and seized their computers, cell phones and other files. ""I feel very violated,"" said Johnston, who denies any connection to the bomb threats at Pitt. Johnston, who is transgendered, is filing a lawsuit against the university alleging discriminatory treatment after being charged with trespass, indecent exposure and disorderly conduct after using the men's locker room for a weight-training class during his junior year, he said. He said he has since been expelled. ""I feel that we're being investigated solely because I have a lawsuit pending against the university,"" Johnston said. The FBI also seized a server from the New York headquarters of Internet service provider May First/People Link on Wednesday, according to a statement from the company. The server was operated by the European Counter Network, a provider that runs an anonymous remailer service, allowing people to send e-mails completely anonymously, according to the statement released by May First/People Link Director Jamie McClelland. McClelland added that the server was seized in accordance with a search warrant issued by the FBI the previous week requesting all of the information, including IP address, in connection to bomb threat e-mail messages relayed through their servers.","University has received 140 bomb threats since February .

"(CNN) -- Senegal claimed the 16th and final place in the Olympic men's soccer tournament after a 2-0 win over Oman in Monday's playoff in England. Ibrahima Balde headed the African side ahead after just 90 seconds but Senegal did not seal the win until two minutes from the end when substitute Abdoulaye Sane scored the second goal. A crowd of more than 11,500 turned out to watch the game at the Ricoh Arena, which will be known as the City of Coventry Stadium when it hosts matches during the Olympics. The draw for the tournament takes place in London on Tuesday. Senegal finished fourth in the African Under-23 Championship to qualify for the playoff, while Oman won a three-team Asian tournament. Both teams were looking to qualify for the Olympics for the first time. Senegal could have had more goals to show for their superiority in the first half, but striker Kalidou Yero wasted several chances and Oman keeper Omar Al Abri saved from Sadio Mane and Moussa Konate. Oman, coached by Frenchman Paul Le Guen, threatened more in the second half. Waleed Al Saadi had a shot deflected behind and Mohammed Al Balushi shot narrowly wide from the resulting corner. And as Oman committed more numbers to attack, Senegal settled the result on the counterattack when Sane escaped down the right and shot past Al Abri. Senegal joined fellow African sides Gabon, Morocco and Egypt in the men's tournament which begins July 26 with the opening matches at Hampden Park, Glasgow. Brazil, Spain, Mexico and hosts Great Britain have been seeded and will be kept apart in the draw for the group stage.","Senegal score in the second minute and the 88th minute to beat Oman .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Two Nigerian labor groups suspended their nationwide strike Monday over the elimination of the country's fuel subsidy and urged demonstrators to go home ""in order to save lives and in the interest of national survival. The Nigeria Labour Congress and the Trade Union Congress cited successes gained by demonstrators, including an announcement Monday by President Goodluck Jonathan slashing fuel prices, in its announcement suspending the strikes. ""In the past eight days through strikes, mass rallies, shutdown, debates and street protests, Nigerians demonstrated clearly that they cannot be taken for granted and that sovereignty belongs to them,"" NLC President Abdulwahed Omar and Peter Esele, president of the Trade Union Congress, said in the statement. But a third organization, the Joint Action Front, issued a statement deploring the suspension and urging continued strikes and protests until the government agrees to restore gas prices to what they were before the government ended the subsidy. ""Nigerians should not be discouraged by the abrupt and unwarranted suspension of strike by its Labour partner; neither should the militarization of the protest centers deter Nigerians in their resolve to rid the polity of this class of looters and profiteers that are responsible for mass poverty, unemployment, social insecurity and untold hardships of the majority of Nigerians,"" JAF Secretary Abiodun Aremu said in the statement. In an earlier statement on the group's blog, Aremu said the group and a related organization, the Labor and Civil Society Coalition, had decided Sunday that they would continue their strikes and mass protests after talks with the government failed. ""However early this morning, our joint leadership advised Nigerians to continue the strike but (said they) should stay at home in view of the resolve by the Federal Government to unleash violence on Nigerians who want to exercise their right to protest and procession,"" Aremu said in the statement. The Joint Action Front is part of the National Labour Congress and has organized many of the protests and rallies against the government's decision to end the fuel subsidy. On Monday, the government deployed troops in Lagos, and military forces set up armed checkpoints at most key bridges and along major roads. Eyewitnesses told CNN that police and the army were not allowing protesters into demonstration zones, but there were no confirmed reports of violence. Scattered demonstrations began in Nigeria after Jonathan announced on January 1 that the government would end the popular fuel subsidy, which was widely seen by citizens as one of the few perks of living in the oil-rich but largely impoverished nation of more than 160 million people. The government has said the removal of subsidies would free up billions of dollars to boost the economy and improve the country's infrastructure. The removal caused the price of fuel and other goods to spike and became a rallying point for Nigerians angry over corruption and the alleged misuse of oil revenues in a country where most citizens battle grinding poverty. Fuel that had cost about 65 nairas (40 cents) before the subsidy was lifted rose to 141 nairas (86 cents). On Monday, after more than a week of protests, Jonathan announced in a speech that the government would reduce fuel prices to 97 nairas (60 cents) per liter. He cited ""the hardships being suffered by Nigerians."" Aremu rejected the Nigerian government's concession and said his group would only accept a return to prices before the government cut the fuel subsidy. ""The people have every right to tell the presidency and this class of looters and profiteers that Nigeria belongs to Nigerians,"" Aremu said. It was unclear Monday whether the Nigeria Labour Congress or the Trade Union Congress would accept the fuel-price cut and call for a permanent end to the strikes and protests. Last week, a major oil union, Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria, had threatened to halt production in solidarity with protesters if the two sides didn't reach an agreement. A move to halt production would reverberate on the global market. Nigeria is the world's eighth-largest crude exporter. Charlie Robertson, a chief economist at the global investment firm Renaissance Capital, said earlier this month that a subsidy removal could help Nigeria in the future. ""If they're prepared to try this petroleum subsidy removal then perhaps they can push through electricity reform, too. If they do that, Nigeria's growth can be, instead of 7%-8% a year, 10% or 11%,"" Robertson said. But there is a widespread lack of trust in the government to provide the infrastructure; Nigeria is regularly ranked among the most corrupt countries in the world. Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said Nigerians should not let the past determine the future. She said the goal now is to regain the citizens' trust and move forward. ""They cannot say because of mistakes in the past the country should not move forward,"" she said.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Technology is changing golf in such a way that the next generation of players could be learning their skills on computer screens rather than golf greens. A keen golfer playing the virtual game. South Korea's Y.E. Yang became the first Asian-born male winner of a major when he won the U.S. PGA Championship but there is a possibility the region's next star will come from cyber golf. There are an estimated 3.5 million golfers in South Korea but many of them have never seen an 18-hole course out in the open. Their game lives in the virtual world - forced indoors because most of the 260 golf courses in South Korea are expensive and oversubscribed. A round of virtual golf will cost between $20 to $30 and the format has seen a proliferation of users - just over five years ago there were 300 golf cafes but now there are over 3,000 operating some 12,000 simulators. Watch CNN's Justin Armsden's report on virtual golf in South Korea. » . Youngchan Kim, president of Golfzon who own around 60 percent of the simulator market, revealed that the continuing success of virtual golf lies with its accessibility to the masses. ""In Korea it is very expensive to play golf in the field and it requires a lot of time. So the expensive and time-consuming factors were resolved through virtual golf,"" he told CNN's Living Golf. ""Virtual golf or golf cafes are very popular in Korea at the moment. It's only about 10 percent of what it regularly costs to play in the field."" Simulated golf is a fast-growing pastime with industry officials estimating seven out of every 10 simulators sold globally are installed in South Korea. Indeed Golfzon confirmed that broadcasting live virtual golf tournaments is the next step to satisfy the thirst for the sport in the region - although its popularity is not restricted to South Korea. James Day, director and founder of Urban Golf in the UK, admitted that virtual golf has a strong appeal outside of Asia and attract over 1000 customers a week to their two branches in London. ""Golf is changing at the moment and virtual golf has rewritten the rules of the game. For example, we don't have a membership or a dress code and we provide the equipment so it is accessible to more people,"" Day explained. ""There is a huge appetite for virtual golf and with over 500 people coming through the door at our two sites means we are set to open a two new places in the future to cope with the demand. ""The only disappointing thing is that there is has been little recognition by some of the official bodies within the game who do not seem as enthusiastic to embrace it. ""The ball tracking technology is exceptionally accurate and it is now at the level whereby it will reach a 100 percent accuracy in the next few years so virtual golf is becoming a serious practice option for professionals."" Dr Mark Smith, head of the Golf Education and Research Group at the University of Lincoln, admitted that a future talent could emerge having developed their game primarily through virtual play. He told CNN: ""Nothing beats playing golf in its purest form out on a proper outdoor course but the core skills can be developed, analyzed and improved on virtual machines. ""In theory there is nothing to prevent a player from rising through the virtual world and developing a level of ability with transferable skills to the outdoor game. ""And with the kind of statistics being talked about in Asia it would not be a surprise if a player came through the ranks whose first taste of the game had been on a computer screen rather than the course green.""","Most of the 260 golf courses in South Korea are expensive and oversubscribed .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Locked in a long-running border dispute, India and China Tuesday agreed to set up a new system aimed at maintaining peace along their treacherous Himalayan boundary. Called a ""working mechanism for consultation and coordination on India-China border affairs,"" the system will be composed of civilian, military and diplomatic officials from both sides, the Asian neighbors said in a joint statement in New Delhi. The statement came after the second day of delegation-level talks led by China's state councilor Dai Bingguo and Indian national security adviser Shivshankar Menon. ""The working mechanism will address issues and situations that may arise in the border areas that affect the maintenance of peace and tranquility and will work actively toward maintaining the friendly atmosphere between the two countries,"" it said. The two nuclear-capable nations, armed with heavy military power, stated that peace was ""very significant"" for ""mutual trust and security."" In the past too, both countries had signed several agreements to ward off tensions along their contentious borders. Ahead of the talks that began Monday, Dai noted in an article in an Indian publication that both nations were required to tap what he called a huge potential for cooperation. ""We are now in the second decade of the 21st century. Looking ahead, China-India relations have huge potential and broad space for cooperation,"" he wrote in the Hindu newspaper. ""What we face is a golden period to grow China-India relations. The world has enough space for China and India to achieve common development, as there are so many areas for us to work together,"" Dai added in the column. Fifty years ago, the two Asian giants fought a brief but bitter border war. Both sides accuse each other of occupying parts of its territory along the Himalayas. New Delhi, for example, regards Arunachal Pradesh along Tibet as its ""integral"" and inalienable"" part of India. China lays claim to 90,000 square km (34,750 square miles) of land in that mountainous region governed by India. India accuses Beijing of ""occupying"" about 38,000 square km (14,670 square miles) in the Kashmir region. India also alleges Pakistan has ceded 5,180 km (3,220 miles) in Kashmir to China. India's refuge for the Dalai Lama has also been a major irritant in its ties with China, which calls the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader a ""splittist"" -- a charge he denies.

"Beijing (CNN) -- With a few masterful strokes, Remon Wang turns the cuddly panda into a menacing state security agent, creating another wildly popular cartoon image across Chinese cyberspace. Donning an olive-green military coat and shooting red flames out of his eyes, Wang's character delivers a powerful kick to a subdued American superhero, who hopelessly lies on the ground with his camcorder knocked over. The headline screams above: ""Pandaman vs. Batman premiere in China; cast: Christian Bale, National Security."" The 38-year-old Chinese political cartoonist first drew the creature in December after learning of the ""Batman"" movie star's failed attempt to visit a prominent blind Chinese activist whose nearly 15-months of house arrest has drawn international criticism. A CNN camera captured the scene of guards roughing up Bale and stopping him from entering the activist's village. ""It just came naturally to me when I saw footage of those guards in military coats,"" Wang said, explaining the birth of Pandaman to CNN over the phone from his home in central Hunan Province. ""Panda is a national treasure, and 'national treasure' and 'state security' sound the same in Mandarin."" An instant hit with Chinese netizens, Pandaman went viral online within a few hours, generating countless comments and inspiring colorful imitations. Before long, however, censors -- who act on orders from government propaganda officials -- removed the image from the public feed of Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. For Wang, who signs his work as ""Rebel Pepper,"" such a fate for his drawing is hardly unexpected. The advertising illustrator-turned-political cartoonist switched careers only two years ago but already knows well the daily battle faced by what he says is a ""rare breed"" in China. ""I'm a news junkie who loves drawing, and my advertising background trained me well to work under tight deadlines,"" he said. ""I do this out of passion -- and I don't think you'll see many people join the few of us anytime soon because of all the limits and risks."" Wang jokingly labels himself a ""hardcore reincarnationist"" on Sina Weibo, which he says has deleted his account for more than 180 times thanks to the sensitive nature of his posts. Although his pseudonym on the site was not accessible for a while, he managed to keep signing up with different names. Despite the censors' best effort, Rebel Pepper continues to thrive in cyberspace, lampooning everything ranging from Beijing's pollution, what he sees as China's limits on religious freedom to North Korean leader Kim Jong Il's untimely death. Calling any Internet restrictions doomed to fail, Wang especially enjoys interacting with like-minded peers online. When someone commented on the Bale story by tweeting, ""now that Batman has been beaten up, the only way forward is to organize Shrek, Wolverine, Iron Man and the Green Hornet for a group visit,"" Wang quickly drew a second Pandaman cartoon. Titled ""Pandaman 2: Superhero All-Star Contest,"" the evil bear character -- still sporting his signature military coat -- strikes a classic kung fu pose while facing off against a slew of fighters for justice, including Batman, Superman and V from ""V for Vendetta."" ""People do feel more comfortable commenting using humor rather than direct criticism,"" said Jeremy Goldkorn, founder of Chinese media-monitoring website danwei.org and a leading commentator on China's social media. ""I think it's also an expression of many absurd things that happen in China -- in some way, the only rational reaction is to laugh."" With more than 130,000 followers on just one of his several websites, Wang's rising fame online has opened doors for him to traditional media. A newspaper in Taiwan has hired him as a cartoonist and several liberal Chinese publications also print his regular contributions. Ultimately, though, he aspires to become not just a satirist but also an iconoclast. ""Sometimes my cartoons give me a sense of accomplishment,"" he said. ""But what I really want is to wake up my fellow countrymen by injecting a sense of civil society in their minds. China will change one day and I hope my work will help reduce the number of brainwashed citizens in the meantime."" This kind of lofty goal has already brought Wang a harsh reality check. After he created cartoons last year for a group of independent candidates who defied government warnings to run for seats in local legislatures, he says state security agents showed up at his door -- twice. ""I know their bottom line,"" he said. ""If you draw mostly as a hobby, they leave you alone. But if you draw to rally people around a political cause, you're crossing the line."" Recounting his initial fear of official reprisals, Wang says he's since moved on and now feels undeterred by the potential consequences of his work -- and Pandaman hasn't prompted another ""Pandamen"" visit, yet. ""Getting such visits -- it's like how a virgin feels about having sex,"" he deadpanned. ""You're scared before the first time, but after that you're just not nervous anymore.""","Wang first drew Pandaman on learning of Christian Bale's attempt to visit an activist .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- One Goh, the 43-year-old California man charged with fatally shooting seven people this month at the Oikos University in Oakland, has not eaten while being held in jail without bail, the Alameda County Sheriff's Office said Tuesday. ""He came to our custody three weeks ago, and he is drinking water -- liquids -- and he's not eating food. We say 'he is not eating' because a strike would be in protest of something, and he is not,"" said Sgt. J.D. Nelson of the sheriff's office. ""He says he is not eating because he feels shame, but what that means nobody really knows,"" Nelson added. Goh is receiving psychological care, Nelson said. Goh, who is Korean-American, is charged with seven counts of murder with special circumstances and three counts of attempted murder in a mass shooting earlier this month at Oikos, a small college that caters primarily to the Korean-American Christian community. His next court appearance is April 30. District Attorney Nancy E. O'Malley has said Goh voluntarily left Oikos in November because he was upset. Goh ""wanted some money back for tuition he had paid, and it is also clear that he focused on one particular administrator at the school who was not present at the school"" on the day of the shooting, O'Malley told reporters. The seven fatally shot victims, all from California, were: Katleen Ping, 24; Judith Ona Seymour, 53, of San Jose; Lydia H. Sim, 21, of Hayward; Sonam Choedon, 33, of El Cerrito; Grace Eunhea Kim, 23, of Union City; Doris Ifeyinwa Chibuko, 40, of San Leandro; and Tshering Rinzing Bhutia, 38, of San Francisco, according to prosecutors. Goh is also charged with the attempted murder of Dawinder Kaur, 19; Ahmad Javid Sayeed, 36; and Grace Kirika, 43, O'Malley said. Goh allegedly used a .45-caliber gun with four fully loaded ammunition magazines, and most of the rounds were fired, authorities said.","One Goh, 43, is charged with seven counts of murder in mass shooting at Oikos University .

"(CNN) -- In ""Black Diamond,"" best-selling author Martin Walker uncovers the trouble behind truffles. Before you crack open the pages of Walker's new novel, make sure and pour yourself a glass of red wine. Better have some cheese with a baguette close at hand too, because this book is deliciously good. The title, ""Black Diamond"" refers to France's highly-prized truffles of the same name. They're knobby, round, roughly the size of a golf ball and so sought-after that a pound will cost you several thousand dollars. Set in the south of France, specifically the Perigord region, this is Walker's third mystery featuring Bruno Courreges, chief of police in the sleepy town of St. Denis. This time out, Chief Bruno must investigate a price-fixing scandal involving the international multimillion-dollar truffle market. There's a murder -- two of them, in fact -- arson and a conspiracy, Asian thugs and some unsavory secrets from France's colonial past. While the plot is a page-turner, the real allure of this novel lies with the author's other ingredients: the rich French food, the historical detail of the picturesque region and the eccentric cast of characters, including a truffle-hunting basset hound named Gigi. It's an enticing mix of the savory and suspenseful, a recipe for a great read. Besides his career as a novelist, Walker is also a senior director of the Global Business Policy Council, a private think-tank based in Washington, He is a historian, an award-winning journalist and editor emeritus at United Press International. CNN spoke to him recently from his home in France. The following is an edited transcript. CNN: For new readers, tell me more about Chief Bruno and how he became the hero of your series? Walker: When we bought a holiday home in the Perigord region of France, I joined the local tennis club and met a wonderful man, our village policeman, who became my tennis partner, my good friend and my guide and teacher on French cooking, hunting, how to train dogs, make jam and enjoy the splendidly relaxed and convivial way of life. He's a man who understands the difference between the law and justice and he keeps the peace in an admirably low-key way. He spends his mornings teaching the local children to play rugby in winter and tennis in summer. We have no crime, because all the kids grew up knowing him and would hate to disappoint him. He struck me as a marvelous character for a novel, and then as a reporter I was covering the 2005 riots in Paris when young immigrants began torching cars by the thousand, and I knew I wanted to write about Europe's big challenge of adapting to large-scale immigration and about the way the modern world and globalization impacts a small, traditional community like mine. And so I had my theme, my plot and my hero. CNN: Your new book focuses on the multimillion-dollar truffle trade. Tell me more about this big business. Walker: Truffles are at the heart of classic French cuisine. They are the emperor of mushrooms, with a strange power to perfume and flavor and enhance a dish, from meat and eggs and cheese to a dessert like crÃ¨me brulee. The truffles of Perigord, the famous Black Diamonds, are the most renowned and along with the white truffles of Piedmont are the most expensive, selling for over $2,000 a kilo for the finest quality. In a good year, the Perigord will produce over 50 tons, which adds up to a $100 million industry. In recent years, fraud has crept into the market, in the form of cheap Chinese truffles, which is part of my story. And most Perigord truffles are found the traditional way, by trained dogs searching and digging in the woods. These 'wild' truffles are incomparably better than the farmed variety people are trying to produce in plantations. Favored locations for truffles are a closely guarded family secret, and we even had one recent case of a truffle hunter shooting at someone trespassing on 'his' favorite spot. CNN: Your books are filled with mouth-watering details on French food and wine. Like Bruno, are you also a master chef and wine connoisseur? Walker: A strange thing about the wonderful food of Perigord, with its ducks and venison, its foie gras and truffles and fine wines, is that it turns out to be a healthy diet. People in Perigord have the lowest rate of heart disease in France, but it can be tough on the waistline. Luckily it's an outdoor life with lots of sport and exercise, and lots of walking in the woods to find truffles and hunting for venison and wild boar and game birds like the becasse. I love to cook, but I'm not in the same class as my wife or Pierrot, my policeman friend. It's a wonderful hobby because I'm always learning and it gives friends and family so much pleasure. It made me start my own vegetable and herb garden and now I've even started keeping chickens to produce my own eggs with glorious golden yellow yolks. I call my cockerel Sarko, after the French president (Sarkozy), and all the hens are named after women politicians. So far, Angela Merkel lays the most eggs, Margaret Thatcher is the bully who gets to the food first, Hillary Clinton will eat anything and Carla Bruno is the pretty one. Wine is one of the great pleasures of life, and between the great wines of Bordeaux and the much cheaper (but very good) wines of the Bergerac I'm spoiled for choice. Increasingly I buy wines direct from vineyards that I know and visit, often buying en primeur, which means I buy it this year and collect it next year or the year after it has matured in the barrel. My friends and neighbors all have their favorites, and we swap wines and drink together and compare notes over a good meal, and often it's not the most expensive wines that give the most pleasure, but a wine that somehow perfectly matches the food, the mood and the company. CNN: Your books paint an idyllic picture of life in the French countryside, how would you describe it? Walker: We know that human beings have lived in the valley of the river Vezere, which is my home, for over 40,000 years. This is the centre of pre-history and the great cave paintings of Lascaux are just up the road. The Romans built a town near here and the invading Arab armies in the eighth century crossed the river near my house on their way to their historic defeat at the battle of Tours, when the Frankish army saved Europe for Christendom. The valley is filled with castles from the Hundred Years War, with chateaus from the centuries of French elegance, and it was also an important battleground between the French resistance and the Nazi occupation in World War II. I love this sense of living history, and try to bring it into my books. It's a key part of the unique charm of the Perigord, and along with its food and wines, its warm and gentle climate, its enchanting landscape and lovely old stone buildings and friendly people, it adds up to a little corner of paradise and I love it dearly. So if my books are not just crime novels, but also a little bit travel books and a little bit cookery books and a little bit history, they are also in a way love .

"Washington (CNN) -- Turkey's foreign minister called for a new international initiative for Syria to protect civilians and increase pressure on President Bashar al-Assad to stop his bloody crackdown, saying his country would not remain indifferent to a ""massacre in its back yard."" In the wake of the U.N. Security Council's failure to pass a resolution, Ahmet Davutoglu says like-minded countries should look for ways outside the United Nations system to end the killing and deliver aid to civilians under artillery attack from government forces, particularly in the besieged city of Homs. ""Now we need to revitalize a new international initiative,"" Davutoglu told reporters Friday. ""We hope that with such a strong message those who are supporting Bashar al-Assad or (the) regime at this moment, they will have to make a reassessment,"" Davutoglu said, referring to Russia and China, which vetoed the resolution. ""What we need today is to send a strong message to the Syrian people that they are not alone,"" he added. Al-Assad, Davutoglu said, has lost all credibility both inside Syria and around the world. He pointed to the increasing number of defections from the Syrian army, estimating that about 40,000 soldiers had abandoned their posts following orders to attack civilians. Turkey is NATO's most important Muslim member state and has emerged as a key diplomatic troubleshooter in the Middle East in recent years, working closely with the Arab League to help formulate the Security Council resolution on Syria that was vetoed last week by Russia and China. Ankara also has tried to broker the nuclear standoff between Iran and world powers. Davutoglu told reporters he believes that Iran is ready for talks about its nuclear program. Davutoglu said Turkey had talks with Assad and then worked with the Arab League, but Ankara's hopes faded when President Assad failed to implement a road map for reforms. ""We wanted Assad to be Gorbachev, but he chose to be Syria's Milosevic said Davutoglu, comparing the parallels between the events in Syria and the massacres carried out by the former Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, in Bosnia during the '90s. While Turkey has long maintained it is against foreign military intervention, Davutoglu said his country cannot stand idly by while regimes open attack against their people. ""If there is an oppression by an autocratic leader against the people, nobody can expect us or the international community to be silent,"" Davutoglu said later Friday during a speech to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""When I went to Damascus last August, I made it very clear to [al-Assad], I said Mr. President if there is any foreign attack against you we will be siding with you, but if you fight against your own people and force us to decide to be either with you or with the people, we will be with the people."" Davutoglu said he would propose new ways to turn up the heat on the Assad regime when he meets Monday with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, but declined to provide specifics. Last week in Bulgaria, after the UN resolution failed to pass, Clinton pledged to work with the the ""Friends of a Democratic Syria"" worldwide to support the Syrian opposition's peaceful plans for change. Senior State Department officials said the evolving coalition of like-minded countries will discuss ways to bolster the opposition,strengthen existing sanctions against Damascus and seek further ones to block funding and arms shipments to the Assad regime. The State Department is also trying to find a way to provide humanitarian aid to Syrian civilians, which Davutoglu called a ""must."" ""It is time for humanitarian access to these cities,"" he said, particularly referencing cities like Homs that are being shelled by Syrian forces. There must be some international initiatives for this humanitarian access."" He said Turkey was currently providing refuge for some 12,000 Syrians who have fled the fighting and would host as many as needed, but said those civilians left behind were in dire need, although he didn't specify how it could be delivered. ""If Russia and China want to help to Syria, they must be helpful for this humanitarian access. This is not foreign intervention,"" he said, alluding to Russian fears the West will back a Libya-style foreign military campaign. On Iran, Davutoglu said previous efforts to reach agreement between Tehran and the so-called ""P5 plus one"" failed because of a lack of trust on both sides. But he said Iran now seems more willing to discuss a deal that would curb its ability to produce weapons-grade uranium. ""I think this time, Iran has seen that there is a need for negotiation,"" he said. ""This time, I am more optimistic."" But Davatoglu was unequivocal when it came to where Turkey stands over the possibility of an Israeli military strike on Iran's nuclear program. ""A military strike is a disaster,"" he said at Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""It is not reasonable, it is not feasible, and we will be against it, we will never, never endorse any military strike,"" Davutoglu said.","Turkish foreign minister says efforts could be outside United Nations .
Al-Assad, the minister says, has lost all credibility .
Ahmet Davutoglu is meeting with Clinton on Monday .
He is more optimistic over talks with Iran on nuclear issues ."
"(CNN) -- A word of warning: You might notice a few more unshaved upper lips proudly displayed by men in the next few weeks. Don't worry, it's not males the world over being lazy. They're actually growing that Fu Manchu for a good cause. During Movember (the month formerly known as November), men around the globe grow mustaches (hence the name) while raising money for men's health issues. Movember started in Australia in 2003. It has spread from down under to South Africa and Europe, and five years ago it reached American shores. This will be the fifth year Sydney native Neil Van Helden has participated in the global charity event. Van Helden came to the United States two years ago for work and said he is just like any other guy. Submit your Movember photos to iReport! His reasons for joining the Movember movement are simple: ""I had family members deal with prostate cancer and friends with depression issues. ... There's not a whole lot out there in terms of support for men with charities. It's not talked about that much."" He said men in general aren't good at committing to regular health screenings. ""We're pretty terrible at it."" But before you sign up and start growing a 'mo all willy-nilly, there are rules for this sort of thing, as laid out by the nonprofit group. First and foremost, the registered participant must start November 1 clean-shaven. Second, you need to maintain your mustache: Grooming is key. There are also rules pertaining to gentlemanly behavior, as well as rules preventing the mustache from touching one's sideburns (as this is a beard) or joining the mustache's handlebars to your chin (as this is a goatee). The goal is to get your friends to donate money to your Movember cause, which is then donated to the Prostate Cancer Foundation, LiveStrong and other men's health research and awareness programs. So far Americans have raised $7.5 million for Movember. Worldwide, participants have raised $174 million, which, according to Movember, makes the group the largest nongovernment funder of prostate cancer research in the world. According to the American Cancer Society, one in every six men will get prostate cancer during his lifetime, and one in every 36 will die from the disease. Behind lung cancer, prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men. Van Helden got some interesting looks when he started growing his stateside 'stache. ""It's a lot bigger thing in Australia. Every second guy has a mustache. Everyone applauds it,"" he said. With a chuckle, he added: ""Back home, the ladies like it when you have a mustache growing in Movember. Here, not so much."" First-time mustache grower Michael Erickson is excited about his friends' reaction to his new facial hair. He has never grown a mustache and was prompted to join Movember by some Twitter buddies. The ""marriage of social media and Movember is perfect,"" said Erickson, who is actively involved in social media in his job as director of marketing for a popular restaurant group in Atlanta. For Erickson, Movember kills two birds with one stone. ""I wanted to help bring attention to men's health issues, which is something, I believe, that doesn't get the attention it deserves. Plus, I always wanted to try to grow a mustache."" Like most men, he recognizes that he doesn't go for health screenings as often as he should. ""That's another reason I'm doing this: to make a commitment to myself to take better care of my own health."" At the end of the month, parties are held around the globe to celebrate those ""who sacrificed their upper lip for the month."" Men dress up as famous mustache-sporting characters, such as the Village People. Van Helden went as Sherlock Holmes last year-- complete with tweed and his pants tucked into his socks. He likes that ""everyone (there) has something in common. You're all there for a good cause."" 'Stache soirees have grown in popularity, prompting the fifth annual ""Stache Bash,"" put on by the American Mustache Institute. This year the bash will be held in Chicago, which was deemed to be America's most mustache-friendly city. The event also benefits LiveStrong and the Prostate Cancer Foundation. The facial hair advocacy group has been around since 1965 and touts itself as ""committed to battling a demonstrated discriminatory culture against people of mustached American heritage"" by ""promoting the growth, care and culture of the lower nose forest."" All jokes aside, the American Mustache Institute and Movember hope to raise awareness about an often less thought about issue, men's health. So, if you happen to see more mustaches in November, don't give that person a funny look. Instead, think about donating to their hairy cause or at least be inspired to get a health screening.","During November men grow mustaches to raise money for men's health issues .

"(CNN) -- As criminal attorneys, we know that tragic cases very often bring festering social issues into public view. Bill Cosby was right: The Trayvon Martin case brings to the surface troubling questions not only about race but also about the role of handguns in our society. Now that the shooter, George Zimmerman, has been charged with second-degree murder, his defense under Florida's ""Stand Your Ground"" law will become the focus of discussion. This law is grounded in a factual error and a deeply flawed principle. The factual error is that a proliferation of handguns makes us safer. The flawed principle is that somehow the right to bear arms needs to be enlarged to a right to resolve disputes with guns. The notion that guns make us safer is a fallacy. People with guns in their homes are much more likely to be killed with their own gun -- by accident, domestic violence or suicide -- than to use it ever against an intruder, according to Arthur Kellermann, writing in the New England Journal of Medicine. Similarly, people who carry guns are more likely to be shot and killed than those who are unarmed. A University of Pennsylvania study found that people carrying guns were 4.5 times more likely to be shot and 4.2 times more likely to be killed. That study's author, Charles Branas, has speculated that one reason may be that guns give carriers a sense of empowerment that causes them to overreact in tense situations. That may be precisely what happened in the case of Zimmerman. Florida's Stand Your Ground law changed the previous understanding of self-defense in a simple way. Traditionally, one could only claim self-defense if there was no reasonable chance to retreat from a situation where one felt threatened. The revised law says if you feel threatened with imminent great bodily harm, you may use force, including guns, against the person you find threatening, even if there is a reasonable opportunity to retreat. What this invites is the settling of personal disputes with guns, as evidenced by a 300% increase in the number of killings by private citizens justified by ""self-defense"" in Florida since the law passed. Most murders involve young men, often as both shooter and victim, as in the Trayvon Martin case. Young men, of course, often get in conflicts where they are threatening one another: that is, where both of them are trying to scare the other with ""imminent great bodily harm."" Florida's law may allow one of those chest-bumping young men, without consequence, to end the mutual dispute by shooting the other dead on the street. When it is over, the only witness may be the shooter, and his version of events will presumptively control. There is no morality in this rule. Nothing in our Constitution even vaguely promotes the redress of grievances with guns; the ""redress of grievances"" clause of the First Amendment has nothing to with the ""right to bear arms"" described in the Second Amendment. Rather, what the Constitution protects is the ability to redress our grievances by petitioning our government. There may be no more damning indictment of our society than this: We too often seem to be equipping our young men with the guns and excuses to kill one another, rather than the safe schools and knowledge it takes to frame a good and righteous petition. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers.","Writers: ""Right to bear arms"" does not include a right to use guns in disputes .
Gun owners most likely to be killed by their gun, writers say, and more likely to be shot .
Disputes solved with guns, they say, and justifiable homicides tripled since Florida law enacted .
After a person is killed, the only witness may be the shooter, writers say ."
"Los Angeles (CNN) -- California Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law a measure that will allow undocumented immigrant students to receive privately funded scholarships administered at public universities and community colleges, officials said Tuesday. The law was needed because the University of California and California State University systems avoided giving the private scholarships to their undocumented students, citing vagueness in laws, said Luis Quinonez, legislative aide to the new law's author, Assemblyman Gilbert Cedillo. Also, community colleges in California often raised money from private sources and diverted those funds to independent nonprofit groups, which in turn gave those funds as scholarships to undocumented students, Quinonez told CNN on Tuesday. Under the new law, community colleges will be able to give those privately financed scholarships directly to undocumented immigrant students, Quinonez said. Since 2005, bills containing an identical measure were vetoed four times by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, but on Monday, Brown, a Democrat, ceremoniously signed the law on the back of Cedillo, who has long championed the proposal, Quinonez said. Cedillo, D-Los Angeles, told CNN on Tuesday that the new law will help boost the California labor force with educated workers, especially as a million college graduates who are baby boomers are projected to retire by 2025. He also said ""thousands"" of undocumented students will now be able to achieve their personal dreams. ""Education is for life, but their legal status will change,"" Cedillo said of the undocumented immigrant students. ""Something is going to happen that their status is going to change"" some day, he added. The new law is called California's Dream Act. It differs from a proposed federal bill called the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors -- or DREAM -- Act, which would create a path to citizenship for immigrants who entered the United States illegally as children under the age of 16 and have lived in the United States for at least five years, obtained a high school or General Education Development diploma and demonstrated ""good moral character,"" according to a White House fact sheet. ""Signing this Dream Act is another investment in people,"" Brown said at Monday's signing. Angelica Salas, executive director for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, a regional immigrant rights organization, praised the new law. ""While many states have chosen to legislate hate and division by approving anti-immigrant laws, California's governor sends a strong message that investing in today's student population, regardless of their immigration status, is smart, practical, and the right thing to do,"" Salas said in a written statement. The law requires undocumented immigrant students to have attended a California high school for three or more years, to have attained a diploma or a GED, to have filed an affidavit with the college stating they have applied for a lawful immigration status or will apply as soon as they are eligible to do so, Quinonez said. The new law also applies to citizen or resident students who may have left the state and want to return to a California higher education institution; they too have to meet the same high school attendance and diploma or GED criteria, Quinonez said. The University of California system's 10 campuses have about 670 undocumented students who could benefit under the new law, Quinonez said. The UC system has a total enrollment of 237,000, according to a Cedillo statement. Figures for undocumented immigrant students in the Cal State and community college systems weren't available, Quinonez said. Cedillo has also introduced a Dream Act Part II, which would allow undocumented immigrant students to receive state-funded financial aid at higher education institutions, Quinonez said. That measure, which passed the Assembly in June, is scheduled for a vote in the Senate Appropriations Committee on August 25, Quinonez said.","Public colleges in California have raised funds for private scholarships .
But the private scholarships did not go directly to undocumented immigrant students .
A new law now allows for the award of such privately financed scholarships .

"New York (CNN) -- The sister and mother of Adis Medunjanin, accused in a suspected plot to bomb New York's subways, testified at his trial Wednesday in Brooklyn federal court. Alisa Medunjanin, a 30-year-old nurse, gave a tearful account of how she, her brother and their parents were awakened in the middle of the night by more than a dozen FBI agents who stormed into the family's Queens, New York, apartment during a September 2009 raid. Crying on the stand, she said agents ""told us to get on the ground and put up our hands. Then, they cuffed us."" She testified that she and her mother were later escorted to the lobby of the apartment building while federal agents questioned her father and brother. Confessed plotter describes target selection in court . Speaking through a Bosnian interpreter, Medunjanin's mother, Favila, told jurors that FBI investigators showed up at her work and told her that her son should ""tell them what he knows."" Defense lawyers want to show that federal agents intimidated the family and unfairly coerced Adis Medunjanin into making incriminating statements. Prosecutors say Medunjanin, a Bosnian-born American, conspired with admitted terrorists Najubullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay to detonate bombs in New York subways in 2009. Medunjanin has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction and receiving terrorist training from al Qaeda. Medunjanin faces life in prison if convicted. Co-conspirators Zazi, an immigrant from Pakistan, and Ahmedzay, an immigrant from Afghanistan, have already pleaded guilty. Closing arguments are expected Thursday.","Family members give tearful accounts of FBI raids at their home .

The film caught the attention of a global audience with its mix of Bollywood melodies and a strong emotional and dramatic narrative. It also caught the eye of the Academy Awards and was nominated for the best foreign language film prize. He told TIME Magazine: ""I think in many ways that the Western audience, especially the American audience, is very similar to the Indian audience. Indians like films to sweep us off our feet. We don't necessarily need things to be realistic or subtle."" But Khan has mixed up his roles and projects, from 2005's ""The Rising"" where he played Mangal Pandey the near-mythical hero of an early Indian uprising against the British, to ""Taare Zameen Par"" that deals with childhood aspirations and social conventions. He's taken a brief break from social issues for his latest venture, ""Ghajini,"" an out-and-out action flick for which he bulked up, much to the delight of the Bollywood paparazzi and gossip machine. After that, a comedy is in store. Despite increasing international attention, it doesn't seem that India will be losing one of its favorite sons of the silver screen to Hollywood or Europe any time soon. ""I do strongly feel that we have a lot of talent here, and a huge potential to entertain the world, and I feel we should do it in our own way. I don't think we should tailor ourselves. We should retain our own style of story-telling,"" Khan says on his blog.","Aamir Khan is the guest for a special live edition of Talk Asia .

"(Mashable)  -- Digg has launched an overhaul and redesign of the struggling social media service in an attempt to bring users back and regain some momentum. This rollout incorporates three major changes for the site. The first is a redesign of the site based on user feedback. It places the key Digg topics -- Gaming, Technology, Science, etc. -- at the top of the page rather than on the side. Story pages have been cleaned up, and the ""submit"" box has been given more prominence. It now sits at the top of every page, while search has been been reduced to a magnifying glass icon that will display the search box when you click it. The second part of the update focuses on profile pages and the return of profile statistics. At the top right of every profile page are the Digg, commenting, submission and following stats for every user. Digg says it took ""much longer"" than expected to import the Digg data from V3 to the current version. It's definitely incomplete, though -- my stats say I've made zero submissions and zero comments in my many years on Digg, both of which are definitely not true. Some data is still missing. Finally, Digg has added a new slew of opt-in notifications for when your stories hit ""Top News."" While ""Top News"" has lost much of its prominence since ""My News"" was made the default, it's still a point of achievement to have a story you submit reach the front page, so it makes sense that many people would want to be notified when that happens. These notifications will appear either by e-mail or on-site. The changes are designed to counteract Digg's painful decline by adding the most-requested user features. Users famously revolted after the New Digg launched last August. Since then, Digg has been in decline, enough to force Digg to lay off more than one-third of its team. The new features will be rolled out over the next few weeks and will be offered at an opt-in basis. Overall, they're nice updates, but the company still has a long way to go to regain user trust and woo users back to its platform. Every little bit counts, though, when you're trying to turn things around. Check out the before and after screenshots, and let us know what you think of the redesign in the comments below. © 2011 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- Having been criticized by his great rival Rafael Nadal for not taking a stand over players' rights, Roger Federer began his bid for a fifth Australian Open title with a comfortable straight-sets victory on Monday. The 16-time grand slam champion joined Nadal in round two, matching the Spaniard's smooth progress in Melbourne with a 7-5 6-2 6-2 win over Russia's Alexander Kudryavtsev. World No. 172 Kudryavtsev, making his tournament debut, matched the Swiss third seed early on as he battled to 5-5 in the first set. But Federer shrugged off pre-tournament back concerns as he conceded only four more games to beat a player who won just three ATP Tour matches last year. The 30-year-old, whose last major title came in Melbourne in 2010, will next play Germany's 93rd-ranked Andreas Beck. ""I really tried to put in an effort to every point, play as hard as I could, first to see how the back felt, try to get into it, hopefully win, and then see how I feel tomorrow,"" Federer said, before insisting his relationship with Nadal had not been affected. ""Things are fine between us, you know. I have no hard feelings towards him. It's been a difficult last few months in terms of politics within the ATP, I guess, trying to find a new CEO and chairman. That can get frustrating sometimes. But for me, obviously nothing changes in terms of our relationship."" His fellow former world No. 1 Nadal came into the tournament having announced to international reporters that he would no longer be making statements about grievances over scheduling and pay. He then told Spanish media on Sunday that he thought ATP player council president Federer should take more of a public role over issues such as where the Davis Cup fits into the busy calendar. ""His (position) is easy: do not say anything, all positive, I am a 'gentleman,' others get burned. We each have our opinion and maybe he likes the circuit. Me too, I like it, and I think it's better than most sports. That does not mean you cannot be better and that you should change things that are bad,"" the 25-year-old said ahead of Monday's 6-4 6-1 6-1 win over Ukraine-born American qualifier Alex Kuznetsov. ""I say a lot of good things about tennis, because thanks to this sport I have had experiences in my life I could never have dreamed of, but to finish your career with pain in all areas of your body is not positive. ""He finishes his career as fresh as a daisy because he is physically privileged, but neither Murray nor Djokovic and I are fresh as a daisy."" Nadal, the 2009 champion, had hoped he was over his injury problems going into the two-week event, but revealed after his opening win that he needed an MRI scan after hurting his right knee yet again in practice. ""I was much more scared about the first match than the rest, because today now I have 48 hours to the next match,"" said Nadal, who retired hurt against Andy Murray in 2010 and suffered a hamstring injury in last year's quarterfinal defeat by David Ferrer. ""So I am really confident that having had the worst feeling that I ever had in my knee yesterday and today was able to play -- I have fantastic hope that's going to happen the same for after tomorrow."" He also admitted some remorse over his previous day's attack on Federer. ""Probably I am wrong telling that to you, especially because these things can stay, must stay in the locker room,"" Nadal said. ""I always had a fantastic relationship with Roger. I still have a fantastic relationship with Roger."" Nadal, who could meet Federer in the semifinals, will next play Germany's former world No. 2 Tommy Haas. The 33-year-old Haas, now ranked 190th after years of injury problems, beat Ukraine-born U.S. resident Denis Kudla in four sets. Argentine 11th seed Juan Martin del Potro, the last man outside of defending champion Djokovic, Nadal and Federer to win a singles grand slam, progressed with a 2-6 6-1 7-5 6-4 win over France's 91st-ranked Adrian Mannarino. The 2009 U.S. Open champion will next play Slovenia's world No. 103 Blav Kavcic. Czech seventh seed Tomas Berdych also went through to round two along with American No. 8 Mardy Fish and No. 16 John Isner, Spanish No. 10 Nicolas Almagro and No. 18 Feliciano Lopez, Ukraine's No. 13 Alexandr Dolgopolov and Swiss No. 21 Stanislas Wawrinka. Isner will next play 2006 semifinalist David Nalbandian, whose Finnish opponent Jarkko Nieminen retired with a stomach muscle injury at 6-4 4-2 down the day after winning the rain-delayed Sydney Invitational title. Wawrinka will play Marcos Baghdatis, the 2006 runner-up from Cyprus who lost in the Sydney semis on Friday. Fish faces Colombia's 71st-ranked Alejandro Falla while Berdych plays Belgium's Olivier Rochus. Australian teenager Bernard Tomic eliminated Spanish 22nd seed Fernando Verdasco -- a semifinalist in 2009 -- and the 19-year-old will next play American Sam Querrey. Djokovic begins the defense of his title against Italy's Paolo Lorenzi on Tuesday, while last year's runner-up Andy Murray faces American teenager Ryan Harrison.","Third seed Roger Federer shrugs off criticism and injury worries to win opening match .

"(CNN) -- From krill to king crabs, the collapse of a 160-square-mile portion of the Wilkins Ice Shelf in Antarctica could mean many changes for wildlife at the bottom of the world. Krill may not be the most exotic of creatures, but climate change could affect them like any other animal. Most inhabitants of our planet will never get a firsthand look at a polar bear at the North Pole or a penguin at the South. But polar scientists already see changes in plants and animals from rapidly warming temperatures. ""Because of their extreme environments, they tend to be highly sensitive to temperature changes,"" said marine biologist James McClintock of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. ""Therefore, what we see happening in the poles should be taken as warning of what may be coming elsewhere,"" said McClintock, who studies the physiology and ecology of aquatic and marine invertebrates in Antarctica.  Watch how the ice shelf is a sign of trouble » . According to the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center, in the past 50 years, the western Antarctic peninsula has undergone the biggest temperature increase on Earth: up .9 degree Fahrenheit, or .5 degree Celsius, in each of the past five decades.  How the ice is disappearing » . Although krill may never be as majestic as whales or as adorable as penguins, these small shrimp-like crustaceans in the waters of the Antarctic are crucial to the region's ecology. And they might be among the first in the animal kingdom to have to adapt to warming temperatures. Scientists already are observing declines in polar krill populations that could be tied to a decrease in annual winter sea ice. ""As babies, krill live under the sea ice and graze on microalgae. With a decline in sea ice, there is less habitat for young krill,"" McClintock said. But there may be a non-global-warming explanation for the decrease. Once heavily hunted, humpback whales that feed on krill have made a comeback in Antarctic waters. So it is also possible that more whales are simply eating more of these tiny crustaceans. Another warming ocean event that scientists are studying closely is the migration of king crabs. Marine remotely operated vehicles have captured photos of these giant crabs on the Antarctic Slope, where underwater land starts to rise up to the southernmost continent. It's the first time in tens of millions of years that these predators have appeared that close to Antarctica. Crabs and other marine invertebrates die when the water is too cold, because they cannot flush magnesium out of their systems. But even slightly warmer seawater allows the animal to regulate that element. McClintock says that if these new predators keep moving, they could wipe out other Antarctic species. Snails, brittle stars, sea spiders and some marine worms have evolved without armor and other protections they would need to survive alongside the king crab. Scientists studying Adelie penguins on Antarctica's western peninsula see that species suffering major declines. Ironically, an increase in snowfall could be among the most dangerous ""warming"" effects for this animal. ""In Antarctica, as the air temperature warms up, the humidity rises and the ability of snowfall to occur increases,"" McClintock said. That snowfall can affect the mortality of penguin eggs. Another possible impact of climate change in the Antarctic is acidification. Seawater has long been known to be good at absorbing carbon dioxide. But one effect of that absorption is that it turns the ocean water more acidic. Organisms that make shells or have skeletons that are exposed to seawater, such as clams, snails and sea butterflies, could see their shells dissolve in water that is too acidic. Plants and animals that have survived and thrived in the brutal conditions of Antarctica for millions of years have had to make plenty of adjustments. ""Wildlife will be impacted, but they are pretty adept at dealing with a topsy-turvy world,"" said Ted Scambos, lead scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. ""The ecosystem is pretty resilient,"" he said. Scambos first spotted the disintegration of the Wilkins Ice Shelf in February. He cautions that the poles will be the leading edge of what's happening in the rest of the world as global warming continues. ""Even though they seem far away, changes in the polar regions could have an impact on both hemispheres with sea level rise and changes in climate patterns,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC, said Sunday it will free its remaining 10 government hostages and stop kidnapping civilians for money. It did not address the fate of its civilian captives, nor did the group renounce kidnapping for political purposes. Calling its police and military hostages ""prisoners of war,"" FARC vowed in a statement published on its website to continue its fight against the state. The leftist rebels have been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s. While severely weakened in recent years, the group has continued to carry out kidnappings and attack security forces. ""We are very happy for the 10 hostages who will be released and their families,"" Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos wrote on Twitter soon after the announcement. He recognized FARC's decision to renounce kidnapping as an ""important and necessary step,"" but said it didn't go far enough. In December, the FARC announced the planned release of six national police officers: Luis Alfonso Beltran, Cesar Augusto Laso, Carlos Jose Duarte, Jorge Trujillo, Jorge Humberto Romero and Jose Libardo Forero.

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Rival dissident army officers are claiming to lead the increasingly armed rebellion within Syria, exposing rifts within the opposition. In an interview by telephone with CNN, Maj. Mahar Naimi introduced himself as a spokesman for the ""Higher Military Council,"" a newly formed organization that now claimed to lead armed defectors within Syria. ""This council represents the people fighting in Syria,"" Naimi said. He added that the council was led by Gen. Mustafa Sheikh, an officer who defected from the Syrian military. But Naimi's claim was quickly rejected by another defecting officer, Col. Riad al Assad, who spent much of the last year claiming to lead a ""Free Syrian Army"" of rebel soldiers from a refugee camp on the Turkish border with Syria. ""This man represents himself,"" Assad said in reference to Sheikh. ""He has nothing to do with the Free Syrian Army ... those people are representing themselves and do not represent the revolution and the Free Syrian Army. They don't represent anybody."" Assad spoke to CNN by telephone from the Turkish border region. ""This is a conflict for leadership, which happens in all organizations and political parties,"" explained a Turkish diplomat, who spoke to CNN following diplomatic protocol on condition of anonymity. World seeks next step as deaths mount . The diplomat confirmed that more than a month ago, Sheikh had come to the same refugee camp in Turkey that housed Assad. The diplomat added that the general had tried to assume command over the colonel. It is not clear how much command and control any of the exiled officers have over defecting troops and other armed opposition groups inside Syria. But another former army officer based in Istanbul told CNN neither the Higher Military Council nor Assad's Free Syrian Army represented a rebel faction currently battling government forces in the besieged city of Homs. Ancient city in the cross hairs . ""We are not working under the control of the Free Syrian Army or the Higher Military Council, we are independent,"" said Lt. Bassim Khaled, who claimed to represent the rebel ""Al Faroukh Battalion"" in Homs from his places of refuge in Istanbul. During the more than 10 months since the uprising began in Syria, competing civilian exiles have also claimed leadership of the revolution.

"(CNN) -- In the last week, Jeremy Lin has gone from an unknown professional basketball player struggling to get time on court to an overnight sporting and media sensation. CNN takes a closer look at the first U.S.-born player of Chinese or Taiwanese descent to play in the NBA, and how he's becoming more popular with every game. Who is Jeremy Lin? Born to parents Shirley and Gie-Ming on August 23, 1988, Lin is an Asian-American NBA player for the New York Knicks. He wears the jersey No. 17 and plays as point guard. As a professional basketballer he's not overly tall, measuring 6 feet, 3 inches (191 centimeters) and weighs 200 pounds (90.7 kilograms). He played for four years at Harvard, and has spent just one year as a professional player. Career highlights: . Following his stint at Harvard (where he was twice named to the all-Ivy League), Lin failed to get drafted by an NBA franchise, and instead signed as a free agent with the Golden State Warriors in July, 2010. In December 2011, Lin signed with the New York Knicks after being cut by the Houston Rockets. His 109 points in his first four starts this past week have surpassed Allen Iverson's to become the most by any player since the NBA-ABA merger in 1976. 'Linsanity': Why the hype? Everyone loves a battle-against-the-odds story, and Lin fits the bill perfectly. The reasons for his meteoric rise to become a U.S. basketball sensation are numerous, but it all starts with talent. In just weeks he's gone from one-time bench-warmer to team savior, leading the Knicks to five straight victories and averaging more than 20 points per game, while his field goal percentage during this winning streak tops 50%. In Friday's game against Kobe Bryant's L.A. Lakers, he reeled off 38 points in that victory alone. Lin also stands out due to his academic prowess, being the only current NBA player who has a Harvard degree, and is the first Harvard graduate to play in the league for almost 60 years. Harvard grad Lin has shot at basketball immortality . Then there's the race factor: Lin is the first U.S.-born player of Chinese or Taiwanese descent to play in the NBA, which is helping to tap into the significant market of Asian-American basketball fans. This in turn is spilling over to NBA devotees in general. Why Jeremy Lin's race matters . ""He's amazing, how could you not be excited,"" asked a punter watching Lin play on TV in a bar in Minneapolis on Saturday. ""I mean look at the Knicks, have you followed them for the last 10 years? And then this guy shows up and he knows how to play the game -- you've got to be excited."" His ethnicity is even having an effect globally -- even though Lin hasn't built up celebrity status in the Chinese leagues like retired center Yao Ming did, the Chinese interest is already there, with 900,000 followers on Weibo, China's answer to Twitter, already secured. The NBA has also said its TV partners in Asia will soon start showing Knicks games. On top of his athletic and academic abilities, Lin is also drawing fans for his public devotion to Christianity who are thinking about the role model he'll be for their children. Lin has said he was raised in the church and became a Christian in high school. After beating the Lakers on Friday, he said, ""I just give all the praise to God."" He also said in an interview in 2010 that he wants to be a pastor post-NBA. A marketer's dream . From a marketing perspective for the Knicks, Lin's popularity is proving a boon -- last week his No.17 jersey was outselling those of LeBron James and Kobe Bryant. And with the PR damage from the recent NBA lockout and the steady decline of old superpowers like the L.A. Lakers and the Boston Celtics, the league is looking for new personalities to draw fans into the sport. With his multicultural attraction, Ivy League background and come-from-nowhere storyline, Lin has that in spades.","Lin is the first U.S.-born player of Chinese or Taiwanese descent to play in the NBA .

"Brighton, England (CNN) -- Graham Coxon is tired. He's wet. But he's standing outside the concert in the rain smoking a cigarette and talking cheerfully to fans after an energetic performance in Brighton. The long queue of admirers, many from overseas, is testimony to his fame, but if truth were told, most of them just want to meet the lead guitarist from Blur. And if they were disappointed that Coxon didn't play any songs written during his time in the multi-million-selling Britpop band, the fans don't let on. Well, not much anyway. What Coxon serves up for most of the concert in the atmospheric beachside Concorde 2 venue is a cacophony of white noise in keeping with the storm lashing in off the ocean outside. With up to four guitars, bass and drums, Coxon is not an act for the faint-hearted. But melodies do shine through: occasionally on older songs such as ""All Over Me"" and the finale ""Tripping Over,"" the volume eases for him to show what an interesting voice he has, one that was criminally under-used on the seven Blur studio albums. Coxon's virtuoso musical talent on guitar is also richly on show -- he has been described by Oasis songwriter Noel Gallagher as the greatest guitarist of his generation. Many of the songs are from his new album A&E, which marks a return to a rockier sound than his previous, more acoustic work. Coxon seems in his element as a front man: his between-songs chat is limited to an occasional ""cheers"" but he seems to be having a scream. Towards the end he lets his hair down by doing his famous back-flip and plays guitar with his teeth and behind his back. There's no showing for favorites such as ""Bittersweet Bundle of Misery,"" off the most Blur-like album ""Happiness in Magazines, and while there are half-hearted calls for Coxon's big Blur hit ""Coffee and TV,"" it's never going to happen. While he will always be defined by that band -- who reform again for the Olympic Games closing concert in August -- Coxon has now produced eight solo albums and is entitled as much as Damon Albarn is to a life after, or even alongside, Blur.","Graham Coxon serves up cacophony of white noise, but talent shines through .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Marine who used his Facebook page to criticize President Barack Obama has been discharged, a Marine Corps spokesman said Wednesday. Sgt. Gary Stein was given an ""other-than-honorable"" discharge, said Capt. Brian Block, a spokesman for the Marines. Among other comments posted to his Facebook page, Stein called Obama a liar and suggested he would not follow some orders issued by the president. An other-than-honorable discharge is given to a Marine who commits a ""serious offense"" that significantly differs from conduct expected of a Marine, the Corps said. A statement from the Marines said it approved the findings of a military board, which in March recommended the discharge. The board found Stein violated rules limiting political conduct by service members. The Facebook page for Stein's Armed Forces Tea Party had a post Wednesday saying the discharge will be postponed until the results of a medical condition, with which he was diagnosed Monday, are returned and treatment is discussed. ""I have spent the last 9 years honorably serving this great nation and the Corps,"" Stein wrote on his personal Facebook page. ""Even though I will be discharged no one can take the title of Marine away from me. I thank my family and friends for their support and love. Today is just the start of the rest of my life. Semper Fi."" Stein said earlier this month that the case against him was weak, based on personal opinion and not on legal aspects. Stein, who is based at Camp Pendleton near San Diego, California, called Obama a liar in a January 26 post to the Armed Forces Tea Party Facebook page. Two days later, he said the president is ""the 'Domestic Enemy' our oath speaks about."" Opinion: Marine's Facebook posts on Obama go too far . In a March 4 posting, Stein questioned Obama's birth certificate. Another discussion on the site in March said Stein would refuse to obey orders given by Obama. He later clarified to say he meant illegal orders, which he has explained as orders such as sending the military to Syria without congressional approval. ""The allegations drummed up against me are no more than an agenda by the Marine Corps to use me as an example,"" Stein previously said in a statement posted to his page. ""If I am guilty of anything it would be that I am American, a freedom loving Conservative, hell bent on defending the constitution and preserving Americas greatness."" While the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects the free speech rights of ordinary citizens, a Defense Department rule prohibits service members from engaging in some forms of political activity. Among the prohibited activities are publishing partisan political articles or serving in an official capacity with a partisan political club. Stein has said that he carefully followed the Defense Department directive. The Facebook page notes that it does not represent and is not affiliated with the military or government. Nearly 30,000 people ""like"" Stein's Armed Forces Tea Party page. Facebook members responding to news of Stein's discharge Wednesday were largely supportive. ""You've got to be kidding me. OTH's (other-than-honorable discharges) are given to Marines who grossly violate the UCMJ (Uniform Code of Military Justice), as in drug use, excessive DUI's, adultery, etc. This is a joke,"" one wrote. ""So disappointed in the Corps. This is a poor decision,"" wrote another. Another Facebook member, however, said Stein's punishment was expected. ""For any of you that thought that he was going to get anything but 'Other than honorable' ... you really dont know jack about the military,"" he wrote. CNN's Adam Levine contributed to this report.","Sgt. Gary Stein was given an ""other-than-honorable"" discharge, official says .

"(CNN) -- Thailand is a constitutional monarchy situated in the heart of Southeast Asia. Bordered by Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia and Malaysia, the country has a population of roughly 67 million people. The capital, Bangkok, combines the modern skyscrapers of a bustling Asian metropolis with the ancient temples and monuments of previous Thai civilizations, dating back hundreds of years. Bangkok: A tale of two cities . Buddhism is the country's major religion, although according to the Thailand National Statistics Office there are also minority Christian and Islamic communities. Thailand has a diverse landscape with a jungle hinterland in the north and beaches to the south. Thai islands in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Thailand are home to some of the region's most spectacular beauty spots. Since the modern nation state's founding in 1932, Thailand has been served by a constitutional monarchy and is the only country in Southeast Asia to avoid coming under European colonial rule. The current head of state is King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who has reigned since 1946, making him the world's oldest serving monarch. The King is viewed by most Thais as a symbol of stability and a unifying force in what has often been a politically divided country. The extent of this polarization is borne out by the fact that Thailand has seen more than 18 attempts at military coups since the early 1930s. The county's political climate has been turbulent in recent years punctuated with scenes of civil unrest and violence. In 2006 former Prime Minister, Thaksin Shinawatra -- a charismatic populist who drew the majority of his support from the urban working classes and rural poor -- was deposed and forced into exile in a bloodless coup. Post-coup elections in 2007 were won by allies from Shinawatra's party, however Thailand's Constitutional Court ruled that the three main coalition partners were guilty of electoral fraud. This decision opened the door for the leader of the country's main opposition party, Abhisit Vejjajiva, to form a coalition government in late 2008. Vejjajiva's Democrat Party, which draws the majority of its support from Thailand's middle and upper classes, found itself with a majority in parliament. A formal parliamentary vote appointed him as prime minister. Large scale protests against Vejjajiva's government led by supporters of the political pressure group the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UFDD), commonly known as ""the red shirts"", lead to large scale protests in 2009 and 2010. The demonstrations turned violent in May 2010 when the military intervened to confront thousands of protestors who had occupied parts of Bangkok, demanding the removal of Prime Minister Vejjajiva. More than 80 people died while hundreds more were wounded. The democratic elections in mid-2011 saw Vejjajiva defeated at the polls and Yingluck Shinawatra -- sister of the deposed Thaksin Shinawatra -- elected as the country's first female prime minister. In her first months in charge Yingluck has had to deal with a busy in-tray, including responding to some of the most severe monsoon floods to afflict the country in living memory. More than 300 people have died as a result of the floods and over 100,000 have been forced from their homes. Deadly floods wreak havoc in Thailand . Yingluck has also had to remain attentive to an ongoing border dispute with Cambodia and a long standing terrorist threat from Islamic Malay separatists based predominantly in the countries southernmost provinces. In spite of these threats and the country's volatile political life, Thailand has remained one of the strongest performing economies in Southeast Asia. Indonesia is the only nation in the region that has a larger annual output according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Thailand operates a free enterprise economy and is generally pro-investment, according to data from the CIA World Factbook. It is a major exporter of machinery and electronic components, agricultural commodities, and jewellery. Combined, these industries account for over half of the country's GDP. Another major sector for Thailand's economy is tourism. The country is home to five UNESCO World Heritage sites. The Tourism Authority of Thailand has stated that it expects to receive more than 19 million visitors in 2011 alone. Given the extent of recent flooding however, with some internal analysts predicting that parts of Thailand may remain under water until early 2012, this figure may yet be revised downwards.","Thailand is a constitutional monarchy that borders Malaysia, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia .
The country has the second biggest economy in the Southeast Asian region .
Thailand has overcome political violence, military coups and natural disasters in recent years ."
"(CNN) -- Senegal's opposition June 23rd Movement is calling for a mass rally in Dakar on Tuesday to protest a ruling allowing President Abdoulaye Wade to run for a third term as well as to demand the release of dozens of government critics arrested in the wake of weekend rioting that followed the decision. The group is also demanding that Senegal's highest court, the constitutional council, allow three independent candidates, including Grammy-winning musician Youssou N'Dour, to seek the presidency of the West African nation, spokesman Amath Dansokho said Monday. The court rejected their candidacies on Friday in the same ruling that granted Wade and 13 others spots on the February ballot. The court ruled that the candidates -- N'dour, Abdourahmane Sarr and KÃ©ba Keinde -- failed to gather 10,000 valid signatures. The court ruled Wade could stand for re-election despite a provision in the country's 2001 constitution that limits the president to two terms in office. Wade is in his second term in office. But the court ruled that his first term, won in a 2000 election, could not be counted toward the term limit because that election came before the constitution took effect. ""Between these two points of view, there must naturally be an arbiter,"" presidential spokesman Serigne Mbacke Ndiaye said Monday. ""In our country, we have chosen as our arbiter the constitutional council."" The opposition, however, does not trust the decision of the council, because all five judges were appointed by Wade and are widely thought to have limited independence. Danshohko called the decision a ""constitutional coup."" U.S. State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland said Wade should step aside. ""The statesmanly-like thing to do would be to cede to the next generation, and we think that would be better."" She added, ""We work with the government the people elect. But again, our view is that Senegalese democracy is strong enough to move to the next generation."" The ruling Friday set off riots in the capital of Dakar. Demonstrators set tires on fire and engaged in running street battles with authorities, with some protesters blocking roads by placing barricades in and around several city neighborhoods. One police officer died in the violence, while a journalist was injured, as police were trying to disperse crowds, according to a state news report. Ndiaye said the planned Tuesday protest will mobilize only a small fraction of the population. ""Today, the truth is that the Senegalese people are fundamentally attached to Abdoulaye Wade,"" he said. In addition to its electoral demands, the June 23rd Movement is seeking the release of Alioune Tine, a top member of the movement, and dozens of others the group says were arrested on Saturday after the riots. The group is also seeking the release of Barthelemy Dias, a Socialist Party official accused of shooting a man to death during clashes in December. Although West Africa has a history of military coups and civil wars, Senegal largely has been an exception. It has never experienced a military coup. However, political tensions have increased leading up to the February election. In June, thousands of protesters clashed with police in Dakar after Wade proposed changes to the constitution that his critics alleged were meant to make it easy for him to win re-election.

"(CNN) -- A day after Syrian forces overran the Homs neighborhood of Baba Amr, opposition groups said Friday that government forces had executed 14 civilians there and the Red Cross said an aid convoy seeking to deliver food and medical care was turned back. ""It is unacceptable that people who have been in need of emergency assistance for weeks have still not received any help,"" said International Committee of the Red Cross President Jakob Kellenberger. ""We are staying in Homs tonight in the hope of entering Baba Amr in the very near future. In addition, many families have fled Baba Amr, and we will help them as soon as we possibly can."" Amid claims by opposition groups that Syrian officials were keeping aid workers out of Baba Amr to conceal atrocities, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon cited reports of summary executions, arbitrary detentions and torture and called for an immediate end to the violence and for humanitarian aid agencies to be granted unfettered access. Syria's U.N. ambassador, Bashar Ja'afari, said his government has been the victim of ""extremely virulent rhetoric"" based on ""hearsay"" from the opposition. ""We are not claiming that the situation in those regions is perfect; we do not deny that there has been a deterioration in the quality of services provided by the state in those regions, but the primary reason for this is the armed attacks,"" he said, alluding to repeated government assertions that foreign terrorists are behind the violence. At least 75 people died, including the 14 civilians reportedly executed in Homs and 16 others who died in Rastan when a shell fired by Syrian forces exploded in a crowd of demonstrators, according to the Local Coordination Committee of Syria, an opposition group. Deaths were also reported in Idlib, Hama, Aleppo, Deir Ezzor, Dourna, Daraa and Lattakia, according to the LCC. White House spokesman Jay Carney decried what he called the ""trigger happiness"" of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime, saying that ""the brutality being carried out in the city of Homs in the last 24 to 48 hours is disgraceful and horrific."" ""The European Council remains determined to ensure that those responsible for the atrocities being committed in Syria are held accountable for their actions, and we'll coordinate closely and assist those working to document these appalling crimes,"" council President Herman van Rompuy said. A convoy of Red Cross trucks and Red Crescent ambulances reached Homs Friday after receiving authority from the Syrian government to enter Baba Amr on Thursday, a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross. But after waiting for hours outside the Baba Amr district, ICRC officials said they were told they would not be allowed to enter. ""We reiterate the appeal we made several days ago, for a daily 2-hour halt in the fighting to allow humanitarian assistance,"" Kellenberger said. Together with the reports of continuing violence in Syria, the refusal to allow aid trucks into Baba Amr paints a ""very, very alarming"" picture,"" said Rupert Colville, a spokesman for he U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. ""It's just going from bad to worse,"" said Colville. British Prime Minister David Cameron called the situation in Syria ""absolutely appalling,"" and demanded that humanitarian aid be allowed wherever it is needed. ""Above all,"" he said, ""what I think matters is building the evidence and the picture so we hold this criminal regime to account, and to make sure it is held to account for crimes that it is committing against its people."" He spoke to reporters outside a meeting of leaders of the European Union in Brussels, Belgium. French President Nicolas Sarkozy announced Friday that France would close its embassy in Damascus and the European Union recognized the opposition Syrian National Council as the legitimate representative of Syrian people. ""The European Council remains determined to ensure that those responsible for the atrocities being committed in Syria are held accountable for their actions, and we'll coordinate closely and assist those working to document these appalling crimes,"" council President Herman van Rompuy said. The European Union issued a statement demanding al-Assad's regime bring an immediate end to ""the massive violence and human rights abuses inflicted to the civilian population."" Kofi Annan, the former U.N. secretary-general, who has been tapped by Ban to serve as joint special envoy with the League of Arab States on Syria, was to travel next week to regional capitals, including Damascus. The U.N. Security Council unanimously called on al-Assad to grant immediate access to its humanitarian chief, Valerie Amos. Amos was denied access this week by the government, according to Ban. But on Friday afternoon, Ja'afari said she would have been welcomed. ""I personally sent information to the secretariat staff to say that the Syrian government accepted the principle of Mrs. Amos' visit and we requested a date for the visit and that to be communicated via diplomatic channels. How can it be claimed now that Syria refused to welcome Mrs. Amos and did not allow her to visit Syria?"" The statement by the Security Council was signed by its 15 member nations, including China and Russia, a Soviet-era ally and arms dealer to Syria. Those nations previously blocked a U.S. resolution condemning the violence and calling for a transfer of power. Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United Nations, Abdallah Y. Al-Mouallimi, turned up the heat on Friday saying his country and other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council ""are fully prepared to be at the forefront of any joint effort aimed at saving the Syrian people and bolstering its ability to protect itself from authorities that have lost their legitimacy by shedding the blood of their own people."" He likened the lack of an international response to the attack on Thursday in Baba Amr to other failures to act to halt killing. ""It is as if we were witnessing a new Srebrenica, as if the international community learned nothing from the lessons of Rwanda, Kosovo or Gaza."" That provoked anger from Ja'afari. ""To liken that to the massacres of Srebrenica, Rwanda or Gaza, this is a disrespectful, misleading statement when it is issued by an Arab voice in this international organization,"" the Syrian ambassador said. ""This is a misleading statement that serves only Israel and the enemies of the Arabs."" Also on Thursday, a U.N. Human Rights Council resolution condemned Syria's ""widespread and systematic violations of human rights"" and called on the regime to permit aid groups in to distribute relief. Despite pressure from the United Nations, the United States, the European Union and member nations of the Arab League to end the violence, al-Assad has continued to push forward with the crackdown. The conflict erupted in March of 2011, when al-Assad's Alawite minority-dominated government launched a crackdown against a predominantly Sunni anti-government protest movement that eventually devolved into an uprising with an armed resistance. Al-Assad is an Alawite, an offshoot of Shiite Islam. The United Nations estimates more than 7,500 people have died, while Syrian opposition group LCC says more than 9,000 people have died during the conflict. The Syrian government says more than 2,000 security personnel have been killed in the violence. Human Rights Watch, citing local sources, said 700 people had died in Homs alone since the Syrian military began its most recent campaign there in early February. CNN cannot independently confirm reports of casualties because Syria has severely restricted the access of international journalists. Much of the attention recently over the violence in Syria has focused on Baba Amr, a neighborhood of five square miles that endured 26 consecutive days of shelling before rebel forces announced a ""tactical retreat"" on Thursday. The Free Syria Army's retreat from Baba Amr leaves civilians vulnerable. ""There is nowhere to go,"" said British journalist Paul Conroy, who was wounded in his stomach and leg and then smuggled to Lebanon in a six-day journey from Baba Amr. ""The area is ringed by snipers so any attempt at leaving the neighborhood is met by active sniper fire. I think most people in Baba Amr had to unfortunately accept their fate."" Though he has reported before from war zones, Conroy said he considers the situation in Baba Amr to be unique. ""This is a medieval siege and slaughter. I would say quite categorically that's the most ferocious, vicious, and unnecessary that I've seen and there are actually no military targets within Baba Amr. All of the intense shelling is directed at the civilian population."" Syrian forces, backed by tanks, surrounded the neighborhoods of Bab Tadmur and Jib al-Jandali, the Revolutionary Council of Homs said. Intense fighting was reported in the two Sunni-dominated neighborhoods, and a video posted by an opposition activist purported to show smoke rising from Bab Tadmur after a shelling attack. On Friday, Syrian authorities handed over the bodies of journalists Marie Colvin and Remi Ochlik to the Syrian Arab Red Crescent Society and the International Committee of the Red Cross, a Red Cross spokesman said. Colvin and Ochlik were killed last week when a makeshift media center in Baba Amr came under attack by shelling. French journalist Edith Bouvier was wounded in the attack. Bouvier and journalist William Daniels, who was trapped in Baba Amr with her, returned Friday to France. The opposition group Avaaz said it helped Bouvier and Daniels to escape.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Authorities in California on Friday identified the man whose severed head, hands and feet were discovered this week as 66-year-old Hervey Medellin. The victim was from Los Angeles, said Lt. David Smith with the Los Angeles County coroner's office. Earlier in the day, Los Angeles police completed their biggest search in recent memory, with 120 investigators scouring seven acres in the Hollywood hills looking for more body parts. But the search, which began Tuesday, didn't find additional limbs or a torso, and detectives were continuing their investigation, police said. Upon concluding the hillside search, police Friday reopened Bronson Canyon Park beneath the Hollywood sign and urged hikers and other recreational visitors to be careful and not walk the trails alone. The body parts happened to be located near the home of actor Brad Pitt, and authorities interviewed his bodyguard for possible leads, police said Thursday. ""It's standard procedure for us to have our detectives canvass the neighborhood,"" Los Angeles Police Cmdr. Andrew Smith said. The bodyguard saw nothing unusual, he added. Meanwhile, the dog walker whose golden retriever, Ollie, discovered the head in a park Tuesday below the Hollywood sign said she at first thought the head was a movie prop. ""Our assumption was that there was always people filming up there, and it was a prop,"" Lauren Kornberg, who was walking with her mother at the time, told HLN. ""We walked down the ravine and got closer and realized it was a freshly severed human head."" Authorities believe the dismemberment occurred in a place other than the park, Smith said. Officers, coroner's investigators, helicopters, all-terrain vehicles, a SWAT team trained in climbing skills and mounted officers searched the section of Bronson Canyon, next to Griffith Park, Smith said. The coroner's cadaver dog located the two hands and two feet scattered across the brushy and steep terrain, police said. Authorities believe the human remains were placed in one spot and then were spread by wild animals, Smith said. The body parts were hidden until the animals found them. ""You could say it was a determined effort to hide them,"" Smith said of the body parts, declining to elaborate. A search on Wednesday located first one hand, about 50 yards from where the head was found. Another hand and then two feet were found just before waning daylight forced an end to that day's search, police said. The real-life Hollywood mystery began Tuesday afternoon as Kornberg and her mother were walking dogs in the park below the Hollywood sign. In the interview with HLN, Kornberg said she was walking eight dogs when one of them, the golden retriever named Ollie, ran away from her. Kornberg was joined by her mother, who was walking her own dog. ""We were wandering the trail and the dogs are sniffing around, and he (Ollie) pulled away from me and made a beeline for some brush. He was barking,"" Kornberg said. ""A few minutes later, he had something in his mouth, which he immediately dropped,"" Kornberg said. The object rolled down the ravine, Kornberg said. Kornberg and her mother discovered it was a human head belonging to what she described as a white man. ""We were pretty much gasping, saying, 'Oh, my God!' I was shaking. It felt like a script,"" Kornberg said. ""It still doesn't feel real."" The secluded trails, adjacent to Griffith Park, are a favorite place for residents, including many celebrities, to walk their dogs or hike. The coroner's office is examining whether the man was dead when the dismemberment occurred, and what kind of instrument may have been used to remove the head and limbs, Smith said. Police don't have a theory on what happened. ""Right now, we're keeping an open mind ... on why this poor person was dismembered and deposited up there,"" Smith said. Detectives estimated the man had been dead since Sunday. CNN's Mike Martinez, Irving Last, Alan Duke, Rosalina Nieves and HLN's Selin Darkalstanian contributed to this report.","The victim is identified as 66-year-old Hervey Medellin .

"Toulouse (CNN) -- French police had no grounds on which to arrest gunman Mohammed Merah before he carried out three attacks in which seven people died, Prime Minister Francois Fillon told French radio station RTL Friday. Merah, 23, who was shot dead by special forces Thursday after a siege lasting more than 30 hours in the southwestern city of Toulouse, was wanted in the killings of three French paratroopers, a rabbi and three children ages 4, 5, and 7. Merah, a French citizen of Algerian descent, had been put under surveillance after trips to Afghanistan and Pakistan, officials have said, leading commentators to ask why he was not stopped sooner. He claimed to have attended an al Qaeda training camp, according to Paris prosecutor Francois Molins, and was on the U.S. no-fly list for that reason, a U.S. intelligence official said. And Toulouse lawyer Eric Mouton, acting for a woman named only as Aicha, to protect her privacy, told CNN she filed a complaint against Merah in 2010 over alarming behavior Merah displayed toward her children. Aicha claimed that Merah had beaten up her daughter, 19 at the time, and held her son, 15, against his will in a room for several hours, forcing him to watch videos of violent combat and of people's throats being slit. Mouton said he would meet with Toulouse prosecutor Michel Valet later Friday to discuss the case. It is not known if any action was taken against Merah at the time. Fillon defended the police and intelligence services, saying they had done a remarkable job in finding the killer within 10 days of the first attack, on March 11. Fillon acknowledged that some questions should be asked, particularly with regard to surveillance. But, he said, ""there was no single element"" that would have allowed the police to arrest Merah before the killings began. ""We don't have the right in a country like ours to keep under permanent surveillance without a judicial decision someone who has committed no offense,"" he told RTL. ""We live in a country under the rule of law."" Crowds gathered in a square in central Toulouse at noon Friday to remember those killed in the attacks. Toulouse Mayor Pierre Cohen called the rally in solidarity with the families of the victims and as a demonstration of unity against anti-Semitism and racism, CNN affiliate BMF-TV reported. CNN iReporter Henry Krisch said the mood at the commemoration was ""eerily silent and depressed,"" as the names of the seven dead were read out and a minute's silence was held. Meanwhile, investigators carrying shovels, metal detectors and hammers re-entered Merah's apartment Friday, continuing their search of the premises. A police cordon surrounding the property was removed in the afternoon, exposing the messy aftermath of the gun siege to those at the scene. The first floor balcony from which Merah jumped, still firing, before being shot in the head, has been boarded up. Bullet holes pock the walls and nearby cars, and broken glass lies scattered around. Elizabeth Allannic, a spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor, said the detention of Mohammed Merah's mother, brother and his brother's girlfriend had been extended Friday. Police tracked Merah down via his mother's computer IP address, which was apparently used to respond to an ad posted by the first victim, officials said. Interior Minister Claude Gueant initially told reporters it was the IP address of Merah's brother that led investigators to him. Fillon said the French domestic intelligence service, the DCRI, had done its job ""perfectly well, it identified Mohammed Merah when he traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan, it questioned him and it monitored him, he was under surveillance, on a list, and it was thanks to that listing that he was identified. ""It watched him for the necessary period, and it led to the conclusion that there was no indication or trace that Mohammed Merah was a dangerous man."" Investigations will determine whether Merah acted alone, the prime minister told RTL. He added: ""We must not mix religious fundamentalism with terrorism."" French President Nicolas Sarkozy vowed increased legal measures to punish those who pursue extremist activities online or travel overseas for indoctrination and training. He spoke Thursday as campaigning resumed for the French presidential election, with the first round of voting due next month. Rival candidate Francois Hollande, appearing at a rally Thursday night, said questions will have to be asked about the Merah case, French media reported. Earlier, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told radio network Europe 1 that ""light must be shed"" on events leading up to the shootings by Merah. ""I understand that one can ask whether there was a failing or not. As I don't know if there was a failing, I can't tell you what kind of failing, but light must be shed on that,"" Juppe said. The day after his third and final attack, on a Jewish school, Merah was tracked down to an apartment in Toulouse, where a siege began in the early hours Wednesday. It finally came to a bloody end Thursday morning, when Merah emerged from a bathroom in his apartment and fired more than 30 shots at police who had burst in to end the standoff, Molins said. Merah then jumped out a window onto a balcony, still shooting, and was found dead on the ground, officials said. He died from a gunshot wound to the head, Molins said. After Merah's death, Sarkozy said everything had been done to bring him to justice alive but security forces could not be exposed to further risk. Authorities said the young man cited a variety of reasons for the killings, including the missions of French troops abroad, the oppression of Palestinians and France's ban on the wearing of Islamic veils. After Merah was killed, police found video he had recorded of the attacks, ammunition and ingredients for explosives, Molins said. In the video of the first shooting of a French soldier in Toulouse, Merah told the soldier, ""You kill my brothers, I kill you,"" Molins told reporters. Another video shows Merah gunning down two more French soldiers in Montauban. He is heard saying ""Allahu Akbar,"" or ""God is great,"" Molins said. Gueant said Merah had been under surveillance by French intelligence for years. He had ""already committed certain infractions, some with violence,"" Gueant said. Merah was sentenced 15 times by a Toulouse juvenile court when he was a minor, Molins said. The charges mostly involved theft. In the first shooting on March 11, Imad Ibn Ziaten, a paratrooper of North African origin, arranged to meet a man in Toulouse who wanted to buy a scooter Ziaten had advertised online, the interior minister said. The victim said in the ad that he was in the military. Four days later, two other soldiers were shot dead and another injured by a black-clad man wearing a motorcycle helmet in a shopping center in the city of Montauban, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Toulouse. In the attack at the private Jewish school Ozar Hatorah on Monday, a man wearing a motorcycle helmet and driving a motor scooter pulled up and shot a teacher and three children -- two of them the teacher's young sons -- in the head. The other victim, the daughter of the school's director, was killed in front of her father. Police said the same guns were used in all three attacks. CNN's Diana Magnay, Saskya Vandoorne, Anna Prichard and Alex Felton contributed to this report.","NEW: Witness: The mood was silent and somber as the victims' names were read out at a rally .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Saturday reluctantly signed a defense authorization bill, saying he was concerned about some in Congress who want to restrict options used by counterterrorism officials. ""I have signed this bill despite having serious reservations with certain provisions that regulate the detention, interrogation, and prosecution of suspected terrorists,"" he said of the $662 billion legislation. The White House had lifted a veto threat against the bill after legislators made changes in language involving detainees. In particular, the legislators added language to make clear that nothing in the bill requiring military custody of al Qaeda suspects would interfere with the ability of civilian law enforcement to carry out terrorism investigations and interrogations in the United States. The House approved the bill on December 14, and a 86-13 vote in the Senate the next day completed the necessary congressional action. At issue was the president's authority in deciding whether people detained in terrorism investigations would be held in military or civilian custody. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the legislation includes a ""national security waiver"" that allows the president to transfer a suspect from military to civilian custody if he chooses. ""I want to clarify that my administration will not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens,"" Obama said in a statement Saturday. ""Indeed, I believe that doing so would break with our most important traditions and values as a nation."" Obama said a section of the bill provides the ""executive branch"" with broad authority on military custody for non-citizen detainees. The legislators also agreed on tough sanctions language for the Iranian Central Bank, aimed at punishing Iran for its nuclear program. The measure ""will put real additional pressure on the Iranians so they are going to pay a bigger and bigger price, if they continue to move towards nuclear weapons,"" said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. In addition, legislators agreed to tough new restrictions on Pakistan to ensure that country is not participating in the manufacture and transport of improvised explosive devices, or IEDs -- the hidden bombs that have caused havoc for coalition forces in Afghanistan. ""Ultimately, I decided to sign this bill not only because of the critically important services it provides for our forces and their families and the national security programs it authorizes, but also because the Congress revised provisions that otherwise would have jeopardized the safety, security, and liberty of the American people,"" the president said Saturday.","Obama has concerns about flexibility of counterterrorism efforts .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A faulty thermometer is likely to blame for rising temperatures inside a stricken nuclear reactor at the Fukushima-Daiichi plant, authorities said Monday, as Japan prepares to mark one year since a devastating earthquake and tsunami triggered a nuclear meltdown. The plant's operators, Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) said temperatures inside the Reactor Pressure Vessel of Unit 2 have been gradually increasing since February 2 and on Monday hit a high of 89.2 degrees Celsius. The reading is significant because an error margin of 20 degrees Celsius for the gauges takes the temperature well above 100 degrees Celsius, one of the pre-conditions for a ""cold shutdown."" Japan declared the shattered plant was in ""cold shutdown"" last December, a welcome milestone in a fraught battle to contain one of the world's worst nuclear disasters. Should we be concerned? A nuclear expert agreed that a faulty temperature gauge inside the Unit 2 reactor is the most likely cause for the higher heat reading. Michael Friedlander, a former senior operator at U.S. nuclear power plants, told CNN that the prospect of another catastrophic explosion at the Fukushima-Daiichi is ""virtually zero."" Scientists warn of Tokyo quake threat . ""If the reactor was going to become critical it would have become critical in March of last year, not now,"" he said. Another possible, though less likely, explanation, according to Friedlander, is that re-routing of pipe work in the last month or so has inadvertently taken cooling water away from where it was needed. How has TEPCO responded? Under Japanese nuclear safety regulations, operators are obliged to begin cooling methods when temperatures rise above 80 degrees Celsius. Authorities at the Fukushima plant have been pumping more water and boric acid into the feed water system and into the core spray system in attempt to bring the temperature down. Boric acid is included in the water to mop up stray neutrons. TEPCO said the higher reading is at odds with temperatures taken at other points within the reactor which indicates that it's probably faulty. ""Following our cooling efforts temperatures at the two other locations are declining steadily while that at the location in question keeps rising. This leads us to think that the thermometer at the location in question is not functioning properly, rather than the actual temperature rising,"" Junichi Matsumoto, TEPCO spokesman, said Monday. The company said it has also been analyzing gas levels within the building and says there's been no increase in radiation, or any other reading that would indicate that the reactor is heating up. TEPCO said it was continuing to monitor the situation. What happens if the temperature gauge is correct and the reactor is heating up? According to Friedland, one year on from the accident the amount of residual heat and radioactivity inside all three stricken reactors is relatively low. ""In the worst case scenario, if they were to completely lose injection and lose the cooling impact, the water in there would heat up and at some point it would begin to boil. And at some point they would have to get rid of that heat, but we're talking about something that would transpire in a matter of days and weeks, not in a matter of minutes and hours,"" he said. He said the greatest risks the reactors now pose are to the environment, and that any threats to the surrounding area pale in comparison to the devastation already delivered. ""The biggest real risk is that a pipe breaks and that hundreds of thousands of gallons of highly radioactive water ends up underground or ends up leeching back into the ocean or something like that. That's the real bottom line."" What is the state of the stricken reactors? It's been almost one year since an 8.9-magnitude earthquake sent a tsunami on a collision course with the Japanese coast killing more than 15,000 people, wiping out whole villages and industries and threatening nuclear mayhem. A hydrogen explosion then fire at the Fukushima-Daiichi plant triggered a nuclear emergency on a scale not seen since the Chernobyl disaster in the Ukraine in 1986. Amid criticism that it was acting too slowly and indecisively in the face of disaster, TEPCO flooded three of its unstable reactors with water. It continues to do so while efforts continue towards long-term recovery. ""The reactors are no more or no less stable than they were in April of last year. They fundamentally continue to be reliant on a feed-and-bleed cooling mechanism,"" Friedland said. The other three reactors at the plant weren't operational at the time of the disaster but they've since been shutdown, as have nuclear installations across the country. Where to now? It's a long road ahead, and one that the Japanese have acknowledged could take decades to navigate. ""They have to get the spent fuel pools stabilized and that's largely done,"" Friedland said. ""The next issue is going to be getting the fuel out of the reactors, the fuel that was in the reactors when the accident occurred. That's probably going to be four or five years in the making, maybe even longer,"" he said. The disaster displaced more than 100,000 people as far away as 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the plant. The levels of radiation in the area closest to the plant are still dangerously high. TEPCO faces a staggering clean-up and compensation bill and has been forced to accept public funding to stay afloat. On Monday, the Japanese government approved an extra injection of 690 billion yen ($8.9 billion) for the troubled utility. Tokyo threatens to withhold TEPCO aid . However, trade minister Yukio Edano has threatened to block TEPCO's access to extra funds if the company doesn't grant the government sufficient voting rights.","TEPCO says a faulty temperature gauge may be behind higher readings .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- In a meeting Friday with his Italian counterpart, British Foreign Secretary William Hague sought to explain why Rome had not been consulted before a failed rescue attempt that resulted in the deaths Thursday in Nigeria of two hostages -- an Italian and a Briton. ""Mr. Hague made clear that there had been a limited opportunity to secure the release of the two hostages whose lives were in imminent and growing danger,"" said a joint UK-Italian statement issued by Britain's Foreign & Commonwealth Office. ""Under these circumstances it was only possible to inform Italy once the operation was already getting under way."" The meeting between Hague and Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Terzi di Sant'Agata took place at a foreign ministers meeting in Copenhagen. ""Mr. Terzi expressed deep sorrow and disappointment over the tragic outcome of the operation and both ministers agreed on the urgency of sharing full information to facilitate the reconstruction and understanding of these events,"" the statement said. Britain's failure to consult Rome before the failed rescue attempt was ""inexplicable,"" the Italian president said earlier Friday. Italy said Britain did not inform it before the attempt, carried out in conjunction with Nigerian forces, to rescue Briton Chris McManus and Italian national Franco Lamolinara, who were kidnapped last year. ""A clarification on the political-diplomatic level is also needed,"" Italian President Giorgio Napolitano said. The kidnappers killed the men while the raid to free them was under way, according to British government sources briefed on the matter. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has said the men were killed before the joint forces could reach their hideout in the northern state of Sokoto. A spokesman for British Prime Minister David Cameron told Britain's Press Association the government notified Rome as ""the operation was getting under way,"" describing it as a ""very fast-moving"" situation. The UK ambassador to Italy, Christopher Prentice, spoke to Italian authorities in Rome on Friday ""on his own initiative to explain events,"" the British Foreign Office said. Nigerian forces, with support from Britain, launched the operation after receiving credible information about the captives' location, Cameron said. McManus and Lamolinara worked for the construction and civil engineering firm B. Stabilini and Co., which is based in Abuja. A message on the company's website Friday read simply ""In loving memory of Chris & Franco. RIP from all your friends at B. Stabilini & Co. Ltd."" McManus, 28, was from northwest England, the British Foreign Office said. Lamolinara, 47, and married with two teenage children, hailed from the northern Italian town of Gattinara, the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported. Jonathan blamed the kidnapping and killings on Boko Haram, the militant Islamist terror group responsible for dozens of attacks in Nigeria in the past two years. The circumstances behind the men's deaths were unclear, but Jonathan said authorities detained the alleged captors. ""Perpetrators of the murderous act, who have all been arrested, will be made to face the full wrath of the law,"" the president said in a statement on the government website. But a statement posted on a pro-jihad forum on which the militant group has been active in recent months denies any link. ""The hostage-taking operation was not a Boko Haram one, we have always claimed responsibilities for our attacks, beware allowing the Kaffir [infidel] government of Nigeria to mislead you,"" it says. In December, a Nigerian group calling itself ""al Qaeda in the land beyond the Sahil"" announced that it had captured McManus, according to the Press Association in Britain. Cameron said he had worked to free the two men since they were kidnapped in May 2011 and authorized the rescue attempt. Authorities could not find the men for months, he said, but eventually got credible information about their location, and ""a window of opportunity"" presented itself. ""The terrorists holding the two hostages made very clear threats to take their lives, including in a video that was posted on the Internet,'' Cameron said. ""Boko Haram"" translates from the local Hausa language as ""Western education is forbidden."" Authorities have said the militant group is behind attacks that have killed scores of people in recent years.

"(CNN) -- A drug counselor at California high school pleaded not guilty Wednesday to secretly videotaping students engaged in sexual activity with each other, and to possessing child pornography. Gilbert Olivares, 34, turned himself in late Monday, according to his attorney and the Salinas Police Department. His bail was set at $1 million. He entered his plea in Monterey County Superior Court to 19 felony charges brought by the district attorney. Allegations include lewd act upon a child, contact with a minor for sexual offense, possessing child pornography and using a minor to do or assist prohibited acts, according to the criminal complaint. Olivares' attorney, Andrew G. Liu, said he could not comment on specifics of the charges and his client's stance. ""We are at a very early stage,"" Liu told CNN. ""I have just received 71 pages of police reports and I have not had time to review them yet."" Olivares was first arrested last week at Salinas High School, initially on 11 charges, according to authorities. Olivares posted $50,000 bail at that time and was released, according to police Sgt. Christopher Lane. The criminal complaint alleges Olivares inappropriately touched the buttocks of a 14-year-old, identified as John Doe. The two allegedly also had conversations via Facebook. On further investigation of items seized from the counselor's home, detectives found 14 videos made by Olivares in his office at the high school, police said in a statement. ""The videos are of teenage students engaged in sexual activity with each other within Olivares' office, during school hours,"" the statement says. ""It appears the videos were taken without the knowledge of the victim students and Olivares is not in the room at the time. We continue to work closely with Salinas High School to help identify any possible victims in these cases."" Police said the forensic search of Olivares' computer also yielded dozens of pictures and videos depicting child pornography. They are not believed to depict children who attended the school and were probably downloaded from the Internet, police said. A new arrest warrant on multiple charges was obtained Monday and bail was increased to $1 million. ""The bail is unusually high and that might be subject to challenge in the future,"" Liu said. Olivares' preliminary hearing was scheduled for April 5. ""He is innocent until proven guilty and we're looking forward to a fair hearing in court,"" said the attorney. ""He has the strong support of a loving family."" Olivares is employed by an organization that counsels youth on drug and alcohol abuse, police said. Although he worked as a counselor at Salinas High School for five years, he was not an employee of the school district.","Counselor at California high school faces multiple charges .

"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) -- James Brandon is concerned about getting old and looking older. So the 44-year-old events planner from Canada decided on plastic surgery to help bring his boyish looks back. Surgeon Williams Bukret and patient James Brandon. Like many people struggling through the global economic crunch, cost was a concern, and Brandon soon realized that having surgery at home was beyond his budget. So he began investigating options overseas and quickly settled on a city that has become one of the most popular destinations in the world for plastic surgery -- Buenos Aires, Argentina. ""I learned that Argentina has a high standard and long history of plastic surgery,"" Brandon said. In August, Brandon traveled 5500 miles (8,800 kilometers) south from Toronto to Buenos Aires for liposuction, a nose job and eye lift -- all at a fraction of Canadian costs. ""For what I'm getting done probably, it would have cost me about $50,000 dollars back home and here [in Argentina] it's about $10,000 or $11,000,"" he said. Argentina's weak peso and world-renowned surgeons have turned it into a Mecca for cosmetic surgery tourism.  Watch how Argentina is attracting cosmetic surgery patients » . Thousands arrive annually for procedures and then stick around to soak up the sexy urban vibe of Buenos Aires, a city where looking your best is paramount. ""I've definitely noticed here that people are obsessed with the way they look. I've seen many people with plastic surgery,"" says Brandon. Ever since Argentina devalued its currency in 2002, dozens of plastic surgery tour operators have opened in Argentina, offering promotions for international clients that include 'tummy tucks and tango' as well as trips to snow-capped Andean peaks, subtropical waterfalls and polo ranches. Would you consider plastic surgery? Sound off below . Estimates say that 1 in 30 Argentines has gone under the knife, making surgeons here some of the most experienced on the globe. Medical tourism has seen a huge jump over the past decade, and is projected to be a $100 billion dollar global industry by 2010, according to the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions. ""You can get excellent plastic surgery here at two or three times less than the cost in the United States or Europe,"" said Dr. Williams Bukret, a Buenos Aires-based surgeon who performs around 180 plastic surgery procedures a year, most of them for foreign clients. ""In our society we understand that it is important to feel better, to feel good and to look great,"" he said. But some say that Argentines are too obsessed with their image, leading to high rates of eating disorders, especially amongst young women. Experts partly blame the country's volatile history - especially the ruthless military regime that ruled in the 1970s and 80s -- for these body image issues. ""We had a difficult past and we try to forget. And so we try always to be young and always beautiful. It's difficult for us to understand our past,"" says Dr. Mabel Bello, director of the Argentina Association Against Bulimia & Anorexia. Striving to look beautiful in Argentina can be a burden, especially if you are a foreigner, says Boston-native Tracey Bates, who has lived in Buenos Aires for the past 18 months. Bates recently elected to have rhinoplasty surgery in Buenos Aires, and has also welcomed several American friends who have traveled to the city for their own plastic surgery procedures. ""There is a pressure here, you hear it from all the Americans that come: 'Maybe we are a little bit chubbier than them. All the girls here are beautiful with perfect skin' -- so it would be a pressure,"" says Bates, 35. James Brandon felt the pressure as well. It is what led him to Buenos Aires for cosmetic surgery, as well as his decision to record his experience for a planned documentary film about plastic surgery within the gay community. ""I am turning the camera on myself and in the process maybe learning more about myself, learning why I really want to do this, and why I feel the pressure,"" he says. As long as the pressure persists - and the price is right - people will continue to travel in search of that perfect look.","Thousands visit Argentina for cheap cosmetic surgery .

"(CNN) -- Responding to Pope Benedict XVI's comment that Marxism ""no longer responds to reality,"" Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said Friday that his country respects all opinions. ""We consider the exchange of ideas useful,"" Rodriguez said at Havana's historic Hotel Nacional, adding that his country is perfecting its system. The pontiff answered reporters' questions about the Caribbean communist island on the papal plane Friday as he began a six-day trip to Mexico and Cuba, according to the Vatican. He arrived in Mexico on Friday afternoon. ""With this visit, a way of cooperation and dialogue has been inaugurated, a long road that requires patience but that leads forward,"" the pope said, according to the Vatican. ""It is evident today that Marxist ideology as it had been conceived no longer responds to reality,"" Benedict continued. ""New models must be found, though with patience,"" the pontiff said. He also responded to questions about the role of the church in combating Mexico's drug trafficking violence. ""It is certainly a great responsibility for the Catholic church, in a country in which 80% of the people are Catholic. We must work against this evil, which is destructive of mankind and (especially) of our youth,"" Benedict said, according to the Vatican. ""The church's great responsibility, therefore, is to educate consciences, to educate in the moral responsibility and to unmask evil, to unmask this idolatry of money that enslaves men; to expose these false promises, lies, deceits, we must see that humanity needs the infinite,"" the pope said. Benedict also spoke to how Latin America is celebrating two centuries of independence. ""Naturally, the church must always ask herself whether enough is being done for social justice on this great continent,"" the pontiff said. ""The church is not a political power, not a party but a moral reality, a moral power."" Pope Benedict XVI arrived in the geographic center of Mexico on Friday afternoon, commencing his tour. The pope arrived in the state of Guanajuato, where he will meet with President Felipe Calderon Hinojosa on Saturday and then preside at Mass on Sunday in the Parque Bicentenario of Leon, Mexico's fourth largest city, the Vatican said. On Monday, he will depart for Cuba. Benedict XVI will visit Santiago de Cuba and Havana, where Fidel Castro's communist government expelled Catholic church officials after his 1959 revolution. The government did not re-establish formal ties with the Vatican until a visit by Pope John Paul II in 1998. The pope's visit is to mark the ""bicentenary of the independence of the peoples of Latin America; the Mexicans' enthusiastic desire to welcome the Pope; the 20th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Mexico and the Holy See; and the 400th anniversary of the discovery of the image of 'Nuestra Senora de la Caridad del Cobre' in Cuba, with its concomitant Holy Year,"" a Vatican spokesman said. The pope's visit to Mexico will be ""a journey of hope,"" Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi said in a statement. Mexicans are ""a people with immense resources and potential, but currently afflicted by serious problems which weigh on their present and future, first among them the problem of violence,"" Lombardi said, an apparent reference to the carnage caused by drug cartel warfare. The Vatican also struck a theme of ""hope for Cubans"" in describing Benedict's journey to the communist nation that had at one time been officially atheist. Cubans ""feel they are on the threshold of what is potentially a new epoch, in which John Paul II's words on the reciprocal openness of Cuba and the world may be realized in a climate of development, freedom and reconciliation,"" Lombardi said. Benedict is committed to a ""continental mission"" in Latin America, launched at the Aparecida Conference, where the church seeks to continue making her ""inspirational contribution to the progress of the continent, so that human and Christian values may guarantee integral human development, despite the difficulties and dangers of our time,"" Lombardi said.

"(EW.com) -- Poor Erika Van Pelt. The clear-voiced mobile DJ went all out on ""American Idol"" and all she got was this lousy Kris Jenner haircut. (I said I liked it yesterday, but everything looks different now.) Erika just never had a proper ""Idol"" moment on the live stage, and she's not a tiny teen. I think it boils down to that. The tiny teens will overtake us all. They're outside your window, waiting to strike, right now. You just can't see them because they're so young, and quick, and relevant. Pinch yourself. Are you even there? You may have become obsolete just reading this. Heejun Han and DeAndre Brackensick joined Erika in the bottom three. The Hair Up There was a tepid mess Wednesday night, but Heejun, who wore ""I've given up"" track pants for the results show, should have been the one to go home. Jimmy Iovine hammered home Steven Tyler's ""wake up call"" remarks to Heejun from Wednesday in his taped comments, comparing Heejun's clownish performance of ""My Life"" to ""four minutes of a bad Adam Sandler movie that goes straight to DVD."" Heejun, shown in the corner of the screen during Jimmy's rant, was all ""So what, Adam Sandler is awesome, you b****** still can't faze me!"" But Jimmy threw it down. ""Interscope has to spend a lot of money on someone who wins the show, and that's not it."" Seacrest asked Heejun to respond, and the class clown offered two confounding non-clarifications for his behavior. 1) ""When I was ripping the clothes off, it was a metaphor for who I really am,"" and 2) ""I'm not trying to be a star. I'm just really happy where I am, so...."" It's to Erika's credit that she didn't slap him here, knowing she was probably headed home in a few minutes instead of this bleary-eyed prankster who'd just announced he wasn't too interested in a singing career after all. Oh honey. That attitude simply will not fly, especially when you work with kids in J. Lo's native Bronx. ""You shouldn't sell yourself short. You should teach those kids they can be stars, too,"" Jenny sweetly reminded Heejun, her ""superpink"" gown blowing up a giant bubble of disappointment that soon encapsulated all three judges. Ryan had to cut to commercial and then pop the bubble with one of Randy's spare pins. Psssssst. J. Lo. Heejun Han is not a star!!! Here is a star. THIS! Is ""American Idol."" No, seriously, this is practically the logo for the show, but way better. Haley Reinhart is a bada** b*tch. To perform the hell out of her new single ""Free,"" Haley Reinhart wore a long, gauzy red gown with some severe Angelina Leg and a sparkly hair clip that put Randy's pin collection to shame. Aggggh! I've watched this maybe....15 times? 20? And I spent the afternoon listening to ""Free"" and Haley's studio recordings from season 10 of ""Idol"" on Spotify. I'd forgotten how much I love her -- and what a stunning visual performer she is. I lose my breath a little whenever she throws one arm up in the air with her signature ""I love singing!"" dreamy expression and head tilt. But that's probably because I'm so unhealthy and never get off of my couch. Let's go, America! Make Haley happen! ""The breakout star known as Lana Del Rey"" barely croaked out ""Video Games"" in a pre-taped segment. If you're unfamiliar with this creature, she is an old woman who crawled out of a dumpster behind a vintage clothing store in east L.A. and wandered onto ""the scene."" They scrubbed her off, restricted her to a diet of cigarettes and virginal white clothing, and now she's everywhere. I don't quite understand it either. I will say that Lana Del Rey's studio recordings are a million bazillion times better than anything she does live. This demo version of ""Diet Mtn Dew"" in particular was my first introduction to her and is not terrible. Does she suffer from chronic severe pain, do you think? Why does she always look so wretched as she whimpers out notes? My guess is that she knows they're going to be the wrong ones so she's just bracing herself. We all are. Meanwhile, Steven Tyler's birthday is coming up, so the Top 10 awkwardly sang to him with....JOE PERRY! No one in the first few rows knows who that is! How uncomfortable! Anyway, the surprise appearance was a big deal because Aerosmith's lead guitarist had been pretty vocally anti-""Idol"" back when Steven first decided to do the show. I could still sense his inner cringe, but hey, it's Steven's birthday. The graphics department even went all out with WIGGLING COMIC SANS. Oh, ""Idol,"" you shouldn't have. Please don't ever again. So this week the Top 9 -- Colton, Jessica, Phillip, Hollie, Elise, Skylar, Joshua, DeAndre, and Heejun (did I just name my Top 9 Power List?!) -- will move into the ""American Idol"" mansion. Hopefully this one won't flood. But I do hope someone falls down the stairs like Lauren Alaina. I don't want anyone to get hurt, but I want it to happen. It'll be fine. ""It's a cool mansion,"" confirmed Ryan. ""All mansions are cool."" He would know! Are you pissed about these results? Do you think the judges should have used their save on Erika even though clearly voters weren't connecting with her?

"(CNN) -- Looking back, all the fuss was a bit silly. Giants quarterback Eli Manning was asked during a radio interview before the season if he thought he was in the same class as Tom Brady, his more heralded counterpart with the Patriots. What was he supposed to say? ""No, actually, Tom is much better than I am. He is also more handsome. Everyone knows that!"" Of course not. He answered the question the way any proud athlete, with a Super Bowl MVP on his fireplace mantle, would: . ""I consider myself in that class,"" he told 1050 ESPN in New York during training camp, back in August. ""Tom Brady is a great quarterback, he's a great player and what you've seen with him is he's gotten better every year. He started off winning championships and I think he's a better quarterback now than what he was, in all honesty, when he was winning those championships. ""I think now he's grown up and gotten better every year and that's what I'm trying to do,"" he said. ""I kind of hope these next seven years of my quarterback days are my best."" It was hardly controversial stuff. But because it came from Eli Manning, who goes out of his way to be bland during interviews, it was back page stuff for the New York tabloids. And because he put himself in the elite category of NFL quarterbacks, it became a story that lingered on sports radio for weeks. Eli? Elite? After the season he's had -- and the postseason he's still having -- the debate is being settled. Manning has the red-hot Giants in the NFC Championship game, one victory against the San Francisco 49ers this Sunday away from a second Super Bowl appearance. His numbers during the regular season were the best of his career: A franchise-record 4,933 yards, 29 touchdown passes and 16 interceptions (down from 25 last season). He was at his best when under pressure -- an NFL-record 15 of his touchdown passes came in the fourth quarter, helping to lead the Giants to six fourth-quarter victories. He did all this in a season after two of his top targets, receiver Steve Smith and tight end Kevin Boss, signed with the Eagles and Raiders, respectively. And he did it despite a running game, once regarded as one of the best in the league, that was ranked dead last in production. ""He told the New York media he was an elite quarterback, and he was right when he said it,"" Giants defensive tackle Justin Tuck said. ""I've been here seven years with him, and I think he's playing the best ball he has in those seven years."" But Manning will never be defined by numbers alone, not when three other quarterbacks -- all in the NFC -- threw for more than 5,000 yards in the pass-happy NFL this year. Manning is at his best in big games, and many times, he's done it against his more highly regarded contemporaries. In leading the Giants to victory in Super Bowl XLII, he defeated Tony Romo, the Cowboys quarterback who many thought was a better player; Brett Favre, who holds most of the NFL passing records; and Tom Brady, who has three Super Bowl victories to his credit. This season, he outplayed Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers, the reigning Super Bowl MVP who had -- statistically speaking -- arguably the best season for any quarterback in league history. ""He makes big play after big play,"" Giants CEO John Mara said in the victorious locker room after the 37-20 victory over the Packers. ""I never cease to be amazed. He's pretty special."" Mara was talking to the media just a few yards away from Manning, who was celebrating with his family. His father, Archie, who quarterbacked for the then-awful New Orleans Saints, was there. So was his mother, Olivia, and their oldest son, Cooper, all basking in the glow of victory. The most famous Manning, however, was not: Peyton, the Indianapolis Colts quarterback, missed the entire season with a neck injury that still has not fully healed. His potential return is such a question, that even actor Rob Lowe tweeted that he heard he would retire. The Colts and Manning's family denied the rumor. But this postseason, at least, Eli Manning is the lone member of the family in the postseason. If he were to beat the 49ers and win the Super Bowl, he'd get his second championship before Peyton and put himself in an exclusive club. Only 10 quarterbacks have won two Super Bowl titles. Seven of them are in the Hall of Fame, and two others (Brady and Ben Roethlisberger of the Steelers) are still playing. If the first title didn't completely put him in the elite category, a second one would end the debate. ""It's easy to say, 'Yeah he won, but ...'"" former Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman, who has three titles, said. ""When you win a second Super Bowl or multiple Super Bowls, it eliminates a lot of those buts. It puts you in the conversation of the all-time greats and in the conversation for the Hall of Fame."" Eli isn't thinking about a legacy. He's not thinking about anything other than the 49ers defense and another road game in the playoffs. The Giants are 2 Â½ point underdogs, but with four straight victories and a vastly improved defense, nobody would be surprised if they won. A few weeks ago, Manning was asked if he regretted the answering the are-you-elite question the way he did. ""Well, the question was if I thought I was an elite quarterback and basically, I was just saying that I did,"" he replied. ""I'm usually not into the business of ranking and rating quarterbacks and comparing myself to other guys. Looking back, I thought I gave an honest answer, and I don't regret anything."" His answer was honest. It was also accurate. Because after the season he's had, who could question that he belongs in Brady's class any more?","Giants QB Eli Manning said he's in the same class as Patriots quarterback Tom Brady .

"(CNN) -- In a Pakistani public park, Sarfraz Shah begs not to be shot. He is unarmed but quickly surrounded by paramilitary forces in camouflage cargo pants and Ranger T-shirts. Shah pleads with the men carrying automatic rifles. ""I am helpless,"" he cries. ""Please do not fire."" Then, two shots and screams of pain. The crimson of blood colors the ground beneath him. Shah begs to be taken to a hospital. He bleeds to death. The chilling scene was captured on video by a local television cameraman and broadcast across Pakistan's networks. It was the latest in a series of human rights incidents that has horrified the south Asian nation and deeply eroded public confidence in security agencies. ""This kind of anger among the public and even politicians hasn't been seen before,"" said Zohra Yusuf, chairwoman of the Pakistan Human Rights Commission. ""It was the way the young man was brutally shot dead in close quarters,"" she said. ""And the footage showed very clearly that he was not armed. The footage itself is so crystal clear. It tells the whole story."" Shah, age 17 and dressed in a dark shirt and jeans, tried to rob people at a fairly new park named in honor of slain former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, police say. Karachi police official Rafiq Gul said Shah pointed a pistol and wanted to steal cash and cell phones. Shah's gun was confiscated and he was handed over to park security and then to the Rangers, police say. Shah apparently tried to snatch the Rangers' guns, Gul said. That's when the soldiers opened fire. Thursday evening, Pakistani television stations were abuzz with the shooting. Journalists accused the security forces of serious breaches of human rights. They brought up the torture and killing of journalist Syed Saleem Shehzad, an expert on al Qaeda killed in late May. Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence is suspected in the killing. Shehzad had told Human Rights Watch about threats he received from the ISI and the global monitoring agency has urged a complete investigation. The spy agency's reputation had already fallen after the killing of al Qaeda mastermind Osama bin Laden by U.S. forces. Also in May, police and paramilitary forces in Quetta killed five Chechen citizens who were labeled at the time as suicide bombers but turned out to be unarmed civilians. Yusuf said one of the slain was a woman who was seven months pregnant. Pakistan's Supreme Court on Friday ordered transfers for the heads of the Sindh Rangers and the provincial police force, according to Ikram Chaudhry, a senior Supreme Court lawyer. Chaudhry said the court also ordered hearings in a lower court. But part of the problem, said Yusuf, is that Pakistanis feel that often, security forces act with impunity without ever having to face justice. ""Almost all go unpunished -- they do not face the kind of justice that a civilian would face,"" she said. ""The question of impunity encourages this kind of trigger happiness."" Yusuf acknowledged that Pakistan is rife with terrorist incidents and that security forces often must act swiftly. ""They do tend to panic and overreact,"" Yusuf said. ""They shoot to kill rather than take other measures."" Interior Minister Rehman Malik vowed justice but tempered his comments about Shah. ""There should be no doubt that this video shows an unjust action,"" he said. ""Action will be taken against the soldiers, but no one should forget he [the victim] is a criminal. He pointed a pistol at two women and then he tried to rob them. ""There are two things -- one, his criminal record, and another, an unjust killing,"" Malik said. ""I assure the relatives of the victim the investigation will be transparent and neutral and the results will be made public. These are the criminals that create problems for the public; but it does not justify killing like this."" Shah's family insisted that the Rangers had killed an innocent man. ""My son was innocent,"" his mother said. ""They killed him."" Yusuf said that after Shah's killing, it will take a lot to restore the trust of the Pakistani public. Nobody, she said, knows anymore whether they will be next.","Sarfraz Shah begs for his life on the video .

"Sanford, Florida (CNN) -- Current and former neighbors call George Zimmerman caring, passionate and polite, a regular guy they enjoyed being around. But critics of the investigation into the death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin at the hands of the Florida neighborhood watch volunteer have portrayed Zimmerman in other terms. They say he recklessly pursued Martin and possibly engaged in racial profiling. They're demanding that Zimmerman, 28, be arrested in the death of Martin, who was shot last month while walking to the house of his father's fiancee after a trip to a Sanford convenience store. Zimmerman has said he acted in self-defense. The debate that has riveted the nation in the past few days has largely been framed in racial terms. A police report describes Zimmerman as white; his family says he is Hispanic and he has wrongly been described as a racist. Martin was African-American. On Wednesday, Martin's father, Tracy, said race played a role in the police investigation. ""Had Trayvon been a white kid ... Zimmerman would have been arrested,"" he said. Critics have accused the Sanford Police Department of mishandling the case. Police Chief Bill Lee announced Thursday he is stepping down ""temporarily"" because he was becoming a distraction to the investigation. The president of the NAACP, Benjamin Jealous, said Lee failed to do his job. ""The reality is that this chief had probable cause to lock up a man who shot a boy in cold blood -- because he shot a boy in cold blood -- and he failed to do that,"" Jealous said. Gov. Rick Scott announced Thursday that he was appointing Angela B. Corey of the 4th Judicial Circuit as state attorney in the investigation. Members of Martin's family were among demonstrators Wednesday in New York for a ""Million Hoodie March,"" a reference to the attire the 17-year-old was wearing when he was shot. ""A black person in a hoodie isn't automatically suspicious,"" an online protest page said. ""Let's put an end to racial profiling."" A former high school classmate painted a different picture of Zimmerman. ""A race thing? That is definitely not the case,"" Eric Gross of Greenville, South Carolina, said on Thursday. ""He is by far not anywhere near a racist. I wasn't there, but he was a good guy."" The two attended Osbourn High School in Manassas, Virginia. Zimmerman attended a four-month law-enforcement program in 2008 at the sheriff's office, said Kim Cannaday, spokeswoman for the Seminole County sheriff's office. In his application for the course, Zimmerman wrote: ""I hold law enforcement officers in the highest regard and I hope to one day become one."" Opinion: Why black people don't trust police . Zimmerman has remained quiet over the shooting. His father said Zimmerman moved out of his home after receiving death threats. CNN has made numerous attempts to contact him, but has been unsuccessful. The paths of Trayvon Martin and Zimmerman intersected on February 26. The watch volunteer saw the youth and called 911 to report a suspicious man, authorities said. ""Something's wrong with him. Yep. He's coming to check me out,"" Zimmerman told a police dispatcher in a 911 call released Monday. ""He's got something in his hands. I don't know what his deal is. Send officers over here."" The teen started to run, Zimmerman reported. When he said he was following, the dispatcher told him, ""We don't need you to do that."" Shortly afterward, neighbors began calling 911 to report a fight, then a gunshot. By the time police arrived, Trayvon Martin was dead. Martin was unarmed. In a police report, Officer Timothy Smith said Zimmerman stated he was ""yelling for someone to help me,"" but the victim's family said it was the teen asking for help. The death has sparked allegations that Zimmerman took Florida's ""stand your ground"" law too far by chasing after the teen. Police added that while it was suggested Zimmerman not chase him, it is ""not a lawful order that Mr. Zimmerman would be required to follow."" ""Mr. Zimmerman was not acting outside the legal boundaries of Florida Statute by carrying his weapon when this incident occurred,"" Lee said recently. ""He was in fact on a personal errand in his vehicle when he observed Mr. Martin in the community and called the Sanford Police Department."" Lee added that Zimmerman had a permit for the weapon. Zimmerman's family has denied that race played a role, saying he has many minority relatives and friends. ""The portrayal of George Zimmerman in the media, as well as the series of events that led to the tragic shooting, are false and extremely misleading,"" his father, a retired magistrate judge, wrote in a letter published in the Orlando Sentinel. ""Unfortunately, some individuals and organizations have used this tragedy to further their own causes and agendas."" ""George is a Spanish-speaking minority with many black family members and friends,"" Robert Zimmerman wrote. ""He would be the last to discriminate for any reason whatsoever."" Frank Taaffe, a neighbor in Florida, told CNN's John Zarrella that Zimmerman ""had a passion for the safety of our neighborhood and he demonstrated to the rest of us that one person could make a difference. And he was an average guy, just like me."" Zimmerman was a student at Seminole State College, but the college said Thursday that it had ""taken the unusual but necessary step this week to withdraw"" him from enrollment. It cited the high-profile nature of the controversy and said the decision was based on concern for the safety of Zimmerman and the students on campus. Heated debate has erupted over whether Zimmerman used a racial slur during the 911 call, a recording of which was released this week. ""We didn't hear it. However, I am not sure what was said,"" said Sgt. David Morgenstern of the Sanford Police Department. ""I have listened to the tapes, and I have not heard them use a racial slur,"" concurred City Manager Norton Bonaparte. A top CNN audio engineer enhanced the sound of the 911 call, and several members of CNN's editorial staff repeatedly reviewed the tape but could reach no consensus on whether Zimmerman used a racial slur. Whether Zimmerman used such language before shooting Martin is key, according to CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin. ""It's extremely, extremely significant because the federal government is not allowed to prosecute just your ordinary, everyday murder,"" he said. ""Two people fighting on the street is not a federal crime. However, if one person shoots another based on racial hostility, racial animus, that does become a federal crime."" Toobin said that if ""very shortly before"" the shooting, ""Zimmerman used this racial epithet to refer to the person he openly shot, that very much puts it within the FBI's and the Justice Department's ambit of a case that they could prosecute."" Police say they have not charged Zimmerman because they have no evidence to contradict his story that he shot in self-defense. Taaffe told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell that his friend was only inquiring about why Martin was in the area, considering there had been documented incidents involving young black men in the neighborhood committing crimes. But he said that in no way did Zimmerman target Martin. ""Zimmerman is not a racist,"" he told Velez-Mitchell. ""George Zimmerman is a caring man."" In Manassas, Virginia, former neighbor George Hall recalled Zimmerman as being a polite young man. Hall wrote a positive recommendation for Zimmerman, who he said wanted to attend a police academy. Hall called the Zimmermans good neighbors. ""They were all good. Helpful, friendly, cheerful. I never saw anything negative in any of them,"" he told CNN's Brian Todd. ""I just never did. I'm floored. I really am."" CNN's Kim Segal, Mallory Simon and Dugald McConnell contributed to this report.","Protesters have called for George Zimmerman's arrest .

"(CNN) -- This week, Americans were confronted -- yet again -- with more of the same refusal by President Barack Obama to take on the greatest long-term threat to our economic and health care security. Consistent with his track record, the president's annual budget proposal offers no credible reforms for our entitlement programs that will ensure their solvency in the years to come. Instead, his budget reflects the same disregard he demonstrated last month, in his 7,000-word State of the Union address, in which only 40 words were used to talk about Social Security and Medicare. The fact is Social Security and Medicare, vital to the welfare of tens of millions of Americans, account for nearly half of all federal spending. That percentage will continue to increase in the coming years. Left on its current trajectory, overall entitlement spending is projected to more than double by 2049, thus consuming 100% of all tax revenue. It should be no surprise that the payroll tax-supported trust funds that pay out Social Security and Medicare benefits are speeding toward a financial collapse. The Congressional Budget Office projects that Medicare in its current form will be bankrupt by 2022. Social Security's chief actuary calculates that a 23% cut in benefits in 2036 will be required in order to maintain solvency of the Social Security Trust Fund. Of the two programs, Social Security can be shored up for nearly a generation with simple modest reforms. Medicare reform is far more complicated. However, if Congress passes a bipartisan Social Security reform, then the momentum of that accomplishment can prompt leaders of both parties to tackle Medicare reform. Last year, I introduced the Defend and Save Social Security Act, which would ensure that Social Security is solvent for the next 75 years, through very gradual yearly increases of only three months per year in the retirement age and a modest adjustment to the annual cost-of-living increases . It would keep core benefits untouched and requires no new taxes. Enacting such modest, incremental changes would avoid bankrupting the trust fund and forcing a 23% cut in core benefits in 2036 . As with Social Security, much-needed changes to Medicare would require open debate. Several promising proposals for reforming Medicare have been brought forward in Congress. I applaud those of my colleagues of both parties who are working to find responsible solutions to this important issue. Senators Tom Coburn and Joseph Lieberman have proposed a plan that would: (a) adjust the Medicare eligibility age to reflect gains in life expectancy; (b) cap out-of-pocket costs to protect recipients from bankruptcy in the event of a major illness; and (c) require wealthier beneficiaries to pay higher premiums. Another proposal, coming from Rep. Paul Ryan and Sen. Ron Wyden, offers seniors a choice among Medicare-approved private plans, which would compete alongside a traditional Medicare plan. The fact is Medicare as we know it may not exist in coming years if Congress does not take steps now to preserve the program. Every year we do nothing makes the inevitable task of structural reform all the more difficult. Constructive dialogue and timely reforms are required to assure health care security for millions of current and future retirees. In recent years, critics of the various entitlement reform proposals have claimed that many of the proposed changes will ""kill"" Social Security and Medicare. But, in fact, as the numbers show, the status quo will kill these programs. Criticizing serious attempts at entitlement reform without offering alternatives to the status quo is the least compassionate and least responsible option for Americans. Entitlement reform cannot wait. Just as Social Security and Medicare programs were enacted with broad bipartisan support, securing and saving these programs will require nothing short of both parties of Congress working together. Ultimately, it will hinge in large part on President Obama's level of courage to confront this pressing issue. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter . Join the conversation on Facebook .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A medical doctor in Vancouver, British Columbia, said Thursday that California arson suspect Harry Burkhart suffered from severe mental illness in 2010, when she examined him as part of a team of doctors. Dr. Blaga Stancheva, a family physician and specialist in obstetrics, said both Burkhart and his mother, Dorothee, were her patients in Vancouver while both were applying for refugee status in Canada. ""I was asked to diagnose and treat Harry to support a claim explaining why he was unable to show up in a small-claims court case,"" Stancheva told CNN in a phone interview. She declined to cite the case or Burkhart's role in it. Stancheva said she and other doctors including a psychiatrist diagnosed Burkhart with ""autism, severe anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression."" The diagnosis was spelled out in a letter she wrote for the small-claims court case, Stancheva said. Stancheva, citing doctor-patient confidentiality, would not elaborate further, nor would she identify the psychiatrist involved in the diagnosis. Burkhart, a 24-year-old German national, has been charged with 37 counts of arson following a string of 52 fires in Los Angeles. The charges are in connection with arson fires at 12 locations scattered through Hollywood, West Hollywood and Sherman Oaks, according to authorities. Stancheva said the refugee applications by Burkhart and his mother were denied by the Canadian government, and she has not seen Burkhart since early March of 2010. ""I was shocked and dismayed at what happened in Los Angeles, and it appears he was not being treated for his depression,"" she said. Burkhart was in court on Wednesday for a preliminary hearing. Prosecutors said his ""rage against Americans,"" triggered by his mother's arrest last week, motivated his ""campaign of terror"" with dozens of fires in Hollywood and nearby communities. Burkhart kept his eyes closed and remained limp during most of his hearing, requiring sheriff's deputies to hold him up. The district attorney called his courtroom behavior ""very bizarre."" ""This defendant has engaged in a protracted campaign in which he has set, the people believe, upwards of 52 arson fires in what essentially amounts to a campaign of terror against this community,"" Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Sean Carney said. ""The people believe he has engaged in this conduct because he has a hatred for Americans."" Carney told the court Burkhart would flee the country if he was allowed out of jail on bond, but Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Upinder Kalra said he had no choice but to set bail. To go free while awaiting trial, Burkhart must post a $2.85 million bond and surrender his German passport. It was revealed that Burkhart is also under investigation for arson and fraud in relation to a fire in Neukirchen, near Frankfurt, Germany. The worst arson sprees in the city's history began last Friday morning with a car fire in Hollywood that spread to apartments above a garage, but no new fires have happened since Burkhart was arrested Monday, Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley said. No one was hurt in the fires, but property damage costs are likely to reach $3 million, authorities said. Cooley called it ""almost attempted murder,"" because people were sleeping in apartments above where Burkhart allegedly set cars on fire with incendiary devices placed under their engines. The criminal complaint filed Wednesday also alleged that the fires were ""caused by use of a device designed to accelerate the fire,"" Cooley said. ""If found true, the allegation could mean additional custody time for the defendant."" ""In numerous instances, the cars were parked in carports, resulting in the fires spreading to the adjacent occupied apartment buildings,"" a sworn affidavit from a Los Angeles arson investigator said. ""The vast majority of these fires occurred late at night when the occupants of the apartment buildings were asleep."" Investigator Edward Nordskog's affidavit detailed Burkhart's behavior a day before the fires began, when he was in a federal courtroom during extradition proceedings for his mother. ""While in the audience, the defendant (Burkhart) began yelling in an angry manner, 'F--k all Americans.' The defendant also attempted to communicate with his mother who was in custody. Shortly thereafter, the defendant was ejected from the courtroom by Deputy U.S. Marshals,"" Nordskog wrote. Dorothee Burkhart was arrested a day before on an international arrest warrant issued by a district court in Frankfurt, Germany, said federal court spokesman Gunther Meilinger. The 53-year-old German woman is wanted on 16 counts of fraud and three counts of embezzlement, he said. The charges include an allegation that she failed to pay for a breast enhancement operation performed on her in 2004, Meilinger said. Most of the German charges, however, stem from phony real estate deals that Dorothee Burkhart allegedly conducted between 2000 and 2006. ""It is my opinion that the defendant's criminal spree was motivated by his rage against Americans and that by setting these fires the defendant intended to harm and terrorize as many residents of the city and county of Los Angeles as possible,"" Nordskog wrote. A search of Burkhart's Hollywood apartment found newspaper clippings about the Los Angeles fires and articles from Germany reporting similar car fires in Frankfurt, Germany in September, 2011, the investigator said. ""It is my opinion based on my experience that it is highly likely the defendant has a history of setting arson fires in Germany before he came to the United States,"" Nordskog wrote. Burkhart's mother is scheduled for another extradition hearing Friday, while he is due back in court for arraignment on January 24. Meanwhile, both Burkharts are housed in a Los Angeles jail.","NEW: A Canadian doctor says she was part of a team examining Harry Burkhart in 2010 .

"London (CNN) -- Authorities arrested eight people Saturday -- including five journalists of Britain's bestselling Sun newspaper -- as part of an inquiry into alleged illegal payments to police and officials. The other three are a police officer, an employee of the Ministry of Defence and a member of the armed forces, the Metropolitan Police said. A search was carried out at News International's offices in east London, the police said, as well as the homes of those arrested. News International, which owns the Sun, is a U.K. subsidiary of media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Following the arrests, Murdoch, chairman and CEO of News Corp, issued a personal assurance to one of his executives to continue to own and publish The Sun newspaper, according to an internal staff memo sent by News International Chief Executive Tom Mockridge. Mockridge also said he was ""very saddened"" by the arrests of deputy editor Geoff Webster, picture editor John Edwards, chief reporter John Kay, chief foreign correspondent Nick Parker, and John Sturgis, who is a news editor. The five journalists were arrested at their homes, police said. ""I understand the pressure many of you are under and have the greatest admiration for everyone's continued professionalism,"" Mockridge wrote. ""The Sun has a proud history of delivering ground-breaking journalism. You should know that I have had a personal assurance today from Rupert Murdoch about his total commitment to continue to own and publish The Sun newspaper. ""Today we are facing our greatest challenge,"" Mockridge said. The Sun's editor, Dominic Mohan, said in a statement: ""I'm as shocked as anyone by today's arrests but am determined to lead The Sun through these difficult times. ""I have a brilliant staff and we have a duty to serve our readers and will continue to do that. Our focus is on putting out Monday's newspaper."" Mohan has said the paper has a readership of more than 7.7 million. The arrests are part of Operation Elveden, an investigation running in parallel with a police inquiry into alleged phone hacking by the media, the police statement said. Late Saturday, all eight people were released after posting bail, police said. News Corp.'s Management and Standards Committee said it had provided the information to the Elveden investigation which led to Saturday's operation. Elveden has been widened out to include alleged corruption involving public officials, as well as the police. The five journalists, with ages between 45 and 68, were arrested at their residences in London, Kent and Essex on suspicion of corruption, aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office, and conspiracy in relation to both offenses, police said. News Corp. said in a statement that it ""remains committed to ensuring that unacceptable news gathering practices by individuals in the past will not be repeated."" The other three suspects were arrested on suspicion of corruption, misconduct in a public office, and conspiracy in relation to both these offenses. A 39-year-old officer with Surrey Police is being questioned at a London police station, the Met Police said. The Ministry of Defence employee, a 39-year-old woman, is being questioned at a police station in Wiltshire, as is the member of the armed forces, a 36-year-old man. The police said the operation ""relates to suspected payments to police officers and public officials and is not about seeking journalists to reveal confidential sources in relation to information that has been obtained legitimately."" The Ministry of Defence said it was a matter for the Metropolitan Police and that it could not comment on an ongoing police investigation. The latest arrests come two weeks after four current and former Sun employees and a London police officer were arrested in connection with Operation Elveden. News Corp. established its Management and Standards Committee in the wake of the summer 2011 scandal over alleged hacking of voicemail, which led to the closure of the News of the World Sunday tabloid. The revelation that a murdered 13-year-old girl's phone was hacked by journalists in search of stories -- and that many other crime and terror victims, politicians and celebrities had also been targeted -- prompted widespread outrage in Britain. News Group Newspapers, part of News International, paid out hundreds of thousands of pounds this week to settle lawsuits over phone hacking from celebrities and politicians, including a former Tony Blair spokesman, Alastair Campbell. The latest settlements meant News Group Newspapers has settled 59 of the 60 lawsuits against it. British Prime Minister David Cameron set up an independent inquiry into press ethics and practices in response to the scandal. Mohan defended his newspaper in testimony before the Leveson Inquiry earlier this month. ""The Sun is a private enterprise that performs a public duty with a public interest: to inform a mass readership so that British democracy can function properly,"" he said in a written witness statement. ""The Sun is occasionally boisterous and often cheeky but it is always a loyal companion to our readers, male and female. It relates to them in a more passionate way than any other title and in doing so it has become Britain's best-selling newspaper."" Two parliamentary committees are also investigating the scandal. There have been 17 arrests in relation to Operation Weeting, the phone-hacking inquiry, and 21 in connection with Operation Elveden. Three people have been arrested in connection with both investigations. A third police inquiry is investigating alleged email hacking. No one has been charged.

"(CNN) -- North Korea has more uranium enrichment facilities than it has admitted to previously, a U.S. scientist charged Thursday. Prof. Siegfried Hecker of Stanford University told CNN his conclusion is based on his study of recent satellite images and other research, and what he saw when he was invited by North Korea to visit its Yongbyon nuclear power plant in 2010 to see its secret uranium enrichment program. ""When I saw the sophistication and scale of that uranium enrichment facility at Yongbyon in a building that I had been in before that housed something totally different, it was clear that they started the program long before the time that they had said, which was April 2009. So my conclusion was, they had to have another site someplace else,"" said Hecker. The Stanford University scientist visited Yongbyon in November, 2010, and reported that he saw a facility that housed 2,000 centrifuges and was producing low-enriched uranium. It could, however, he wrote then, ""be readily converted to produce highly-enriched uranium (HEU) bomb fuel."" Hecker, an emeritus director of Los Alamos National Laboratory, also estimated that North Korea has between four and eight plutonium bombs, each of which could do damage similiar to that of the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki in Japan at the end of World War II. He is in South Korea attending international nuclear conferences ahead of the Seoul Nuclear Security Summit next week. North Korea, although not officially on the agenda, will be discussed in bilateral meetings at the summit, which will be attended by more than 50 heads of state, including U.S. President Barack Obama. Hecker's assessment comes just weeks after the United States agreed to a deal with North Korea in which Pyongyang would allow United Nations weapons inspectors back into the country in exchange for food aid. North Korea ejected inspectors from the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency from its Yongbyon nuclear complex in April 2009, about a month before it conducted its second nuclear weapons test. However, per the new agreement, the inspectors will only have access to the sites to which North Korea has admitted having, not the ones Hecker suspects are still undisclosed. As part of the deal, Pyongyang also agreed to refrain from nuclear tests and long-range missile tests, but just last week announced it would launch a rocket with a satellite attached in mid-April. ""I wasn't so surprised that they would do a space launch,"" said Hecker, who is also the co-director of the Center for International Security and Cooperation. ""What I was surprised at is, first of all they even agreed to a missile moratorium but then immediately turned around to say, 'We're doing this space launch' and quite frankly, that makes a mockery of the agreement."" North Korea says it has a right to a peaceful space program and invited international space experts and journalists to witness the launch, the state-run Korean Central News Agency said last week. The satellite would be sent into orbit in mid-April to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, North Korea's founder and current leader Kim Jong Un's grandfather.","Hecker visited the Yongbyon nuclear plant in 2010 .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A judge declared a mistrial Monday in actress Nicollette Sheridan's wrongful termination lawsuit against ""Desperate Housewives"" creator Marc Cherry and ABC. The jury told the judge they were deadlocked at 8-4, in favor of the actress, after three days of deliberations. They needed nine jurors to agree on a verdict. Sheridan sued, claiming her character was killed -- and her acting job eliminated -- in retaliation for her complaining that Cherry hit her during a rehearsal for the ABC comedy. Lawyers for Cherry and ABC's Touchstone Television argued the demise of her character was a creative decision unrelated to the workplace complaint. ABC executives testified that Cherry gained their permission to have Edie Britt -- the sassy blonde played by Sheridan -- die in May 2008, four months before an incident in which Cherry allegedly struck Sheridan. The hit during a rehearsal was just ""a light tap on the head"" intended to demonstrate ""a piece of physical humor"" Cherry wanted Sheridan to perform, the defense said in opening statements. Sheridan testified that Cherry hit her because he was frustrated during a discussion over her lines in a scene. ""It was a nice wallop to my head"" she said. One juror who voted for Sheridan's case said afterward that the defense story ""just didn't hold water for me."" Beverly Crosby, a retired elementary school principal, said her decision to find the studio liable was based on her doubts about the credibility of several defense witnesses, which included high-level ABC executives. ""There were a lot of people that some of the jurors found not too credible,"" Crosby said. Juror Johnny Huynh, who also voted for Sheridan's side, said it seemed to him that ABC executives scripted their stories ""just a little bit."" ""I don't say they was scripted,"" Huyhn said. ""It's more like the story don't match for me."" Sheridan lawyer Mark Baute said while there was no victory, the jury's 8-4 vote did send a message to ABC and parent company Disney. ""They had 10 witnesses tell their little scripted story, with no documents, and eight jurors looked at their best, their presidents, and said, 'No, I'm not buying it, I'm not buying what you're selling, Mr. President,' "" Baute said. Lawyers will now prepare for a retrial, because an out-of-court settlement is not expected, he said. ""My view is that Disney is the unhappiest place on Earth, so why would there ever be a settlement offer?"" Baute said. ABC lawyer Adam Levin said the retrial will be ""far more narrow than the previous case"" since the judge tossed out Sheridan's battery complaint, leaving only the wrongful termination issue against the studio. In fact, Cherry is no longer a defendant, he said. The jury of nine women and three men began deliberating on Wednesday but told the judge on Monday morning they were hopelessly deadlocked. Although the show's line producer reported the hitting incident to the studio's human resources department, there was no investigation until an ABC senior executive saw a National Enquirer story about it at a grocery store two months later, according to testimony. What followed was a ""fake"" investigation designed ""to protect the money machine known as 'Desperate Housewives,'"" Baute said. ""Nobody wants the 'Desperate Housewives' applecart turned upside down."" The human resources investigator did not interview Cherry or Sheridan about the incident, only three people who worked for Cherry, Baute said. Five months and 11 episodes after the rehearsal incident, Cherry informed Sheridan that Britt would die during a show taping the next day, ending her five-year run on ""Desperate Housewives."" ""To my estimation, it wasn't handled correctly,"" juror Crosby said. ""It wasn't handled the way it should have been handled."" Sheridan was asking for $5.7 million in damages from ABC and Cherry, although the actress was paid $4 million in her last year of work and is still earning royalties from her vested interest in the hit series.","NEW: Juror says she questioned credibility of ABC's witnesses .

"(EW.com) -- The changes to Fox's singing competition shows have only just begun. After weeks of dramatic headlines about ""Idol's"" slipping ratings and ""Factor's"" talent departures, Fox's president of alternative entertainment Mike Darnell spoke to EW about the challenges faced by ""American Idol"" and ""The X Factor"" -- and his strategy for remaining on top. Given their large number of hours and consistent ability to win time periods, one could argue that ""Idol"" and ""Factor"" are the No. 1 network's most important shows. So what does it mean when the bulk of the ""Factor"" cast abruptly gets pink-slipped and ""Idol"" has CBS' ""Big Bang Theory"" nipping at its heels on Thursday nights? With ""Factor"", the sudden exodus of host Steve Jones, judge Nicole â€ªScherzingerâ€¬ and executive producer Simon Cowell's longtime TV-spouse Paula Abdul may have stunned observers (L.A. Reid will return). Yet the move was somewhat less surprising to followers of the UK version, which sheds judges every few seasons. In a genre where tough-love auditions are the heart of the format, Darnell described being a star on ""Factor's"" debut as not entirely dissimilar to being a contestant. ""Season one was basically an audition act,"" said Darnell late last week. ""Simon got one big new star out of it -- L.A. Reid, and that was great casting. There's going to be a natural reassessment."" Viewers largely accepted the departure of Jones and â€ªScherzinger, yet the loss of Abdul raised concern. She may not have been the strongest contributor to the show, the reasoning went, but she didn't seem to be an overt problem either. ""Paula was an interesting call,"" Darnell said. ""She and Simon are great friends, so it was just a dynamic conversation about what's the nature of the group going to be. And I think we decided to pull the Band-Aid off as quickly as possible."" Fox hopes to fill the spots over the next several months. It's reasonable to expect the network will pursue big music stars, with the caveat that prospective judges also should also have workable chemistry with Cowell. The bottom line is that Fox wants to take a show that was already typically winning its night and find every way possible to improve it -- including brainstorming creative changes apart from the on-air talent. ""There definitely will be lots of different changes in the show,"" Darnell said. That said, Darnell dismissed one TV critic complaint that the show seemed ""inauthentic."" ""That's the kind of stuff that pundits talk about that doesn't mean anything to the audience,"" he said. ""It was a very consistent audience for that show. The audience that stuck with the show loved it."" Over on ""Idol,"" Darnell faces the trickier challenge of keeping an 11-year-old hit feeling fresh and compelling without altering its popular fundamentals. Asked why ""Idol's"" ratings have softened, Darnell agreed with TV analysts who point to the flood of singing competition shows. Idol used to be an annual event. Now there's wide-eyed young singers, brutal judges and suspenseful eliminations on TV all year around. The other programs include Fox's own ""Factor,"" of course (when Cowell decided to launch a U.S. version of his UK hit, Fox had little choice but to get on board, lest risk losing him to a rival network). ""There's no question there's a glut of [singing competition shows that are] affecting the numbers for Idol,"" Darnell said. ""It's the granddaddy, it's run is unprecedented. I think that considering all the other shows and its age, it's doing quite well. Having both shows on our air has put us in an incredibly strong position as a network."" ""Idol"" is still a No. 1 for the season and averages about 20 million viewers a week. While ""Big Bang"" and ABC's ""Modern Family"" are closing the gap, ""Idol"" generates more than 50 hours per season compared to roughly 11 for half-hour comedies (no drama series come close to Idol's numbers). Like with the recent ""Factor"" headlines, Fox has weathered plenty of second-guessing media coverage over the past several years of ""Idol"" panel changes. Some pundits predicted Cowell exiting the show two years ago would be a fatal blow, especially since the ratings were already declining. Yet when looking at the ratings, ""Idol"" changes over the years seemed to help offset audience erosion. ""Idol"" typically only dropped about 10-12 percent each season despite its age, often returned better than most industry observers expected. After last year's well-received addition of judges Steven Tyler and Jennifer Lopez, making further alterations would have appeared foolish -- why fix a show that wasn't broken? But with the new season's ratings down more than 20 percent, it raises the question: Is ""Idol"" at a point where it now requires major changes each season to keep fans' interest? Though making a judgement on next year's ""Idol"" panel is months away, Darnell noted viewers can expect to see some twists this season. ""There's always freshening up,"" he said. ""We've done rule changes, we've eliminated the middle rounds, we put in the judges' 'save.' And there will be some changes coming to the show this year that no one knows about yet, [though] they're more modest than last year. What you try to do generally is if you have a year of big changes, you try to let those settle for at least another year. Change can help, or it can kill you if it's the wrong change. You never want to change the core of the show, no matter what the competition is doing, because that's what people come back for."" One frequent point of viewer debate is the number of good auditions vs. humorously bad auditions. As with every aspect of his shows, Darnell has given the matter plenty of thought and experimented with different possibilities. ""We used to have more bad than good,"" he said. ""Over the last three years we've gone the opposite direction. I think it's a balancing act. One of the things that separate 'Idol' from the other shows is that we have the fun and funny auditions, that's why those [opening weeks] numbers are usually big. If you go too far in one direction or the other, that's a mistake. And you have to be careful about which bad auditions are shown. The William Hungs of the world work, but people dressed as bananas don't. They have to be sincere auditions."" And if the unthinkable happens. If ""Idol,"" after eight seasons as TV's top-rated entertainment program, should slip ... Darnell predicted the network -- and the show -- will survive just fine. ""It would be nice to reign forever as No. 1,"" Darnell said. ""But if 'Idol' ever becomes a second- or third-place show, it still has a much bigger impact and value than most other shows because it accounts for so many more hours. Obviously all shows come down, but to still be at this level is amazing, and we're really grateful for that."" See the full article at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- It is not possible to dial an Iranian number from an Israeli telephone. It will simply not go through. That lack of communication stems from the government level, where there is no dialogue between the two countries aside from public speeches meant to carry weighty threats of war to each camp. That is why it was so difficult for Ronny Edry, an Israeli graphic designer based in Tel Aviv, to get his message across to the people of Iran. ""My idea was simple, I was trying to reach the other side. There are all these talks about war, Iran is coming to bomb us and we bomb them back, we are sitting and waiting. I wanted to say the simple words that this war is crazy,"" said Edry. Using his graphic design skills and his wife's help (she is also a graphic designer), he plastered memes over pictures of himself, his wife, his friends and his neighbors. He then posted them on the Facebook page of Pushpin Mehina, his small design school, with a resounding message: . IRANIANS . we will never bomb your country . We *Heart* You. The response, said Edry, was overwhelming. ""In a few hours, I had hundreds of shares and thousands of likes and it was like something was happening. ""I think it's really amazing that someone from Iran poked me and said 'Hello, I'm from Iran, I saw your ""poster"" on Facebook,' "" Edry said. ""I thought it was crazy because I never spoke to an Iranian in my life. I woke up my wife: 'There is someone on Facebook from Iran!' "" He posted his designs for anyone to take and plaster over their own photos. The photos and posts have been flooding the page. Edry says he started the campaign to get past the harsh words and talk directly to Iranians to see whether there really was anything to fight about. Iran's nuclear development program is causing alarm in Israel and its Western allies. Critics in the West say Iran is trying to develop a nuclear weapon while Iranian officials insist their nuclear program is for peaceful energy generation only. Experts: Israel would face challenge in bombing Iran nuclear sites . Edry has received thousands of messages from people in Iran sending a statement to Israel, he say. He shared one private message from Iran, without revealing the identity of the sender: ""We love you too. Your word reaches out there, despite the censorship. And Iranian people, aside from the regime, have no hard feelings or animosity towards anybody, particularly Israelis."" One post on the Pushpin Facebook page says: ""We share a common history, have been sharing both our great and ancient cultures, languages and poetry together. ... We are so similar, and politicians cannot cut a tie that has been tied thousands of years ago. I am proud to have you as my friends."" Not all the responses to the campaign were positive, however. One meme says ""Iranians We *Heart* You SO MUCH we are coming over."" The first meme was posted Wednesday, and Edry says he hopes the dialogue will not end merely with Iranians and Israelis. He noted the tension involves more than these two countries and he would like to include allies and neighboring countries in the conversation. ""The idea is to put the message out there that we don't want this war."" ""At the end of it, I will be the one doing this war. Bibi is not going to take the gun,"" he said, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanhayu, ""I will have to. Before I go into another war, maybe I check this one a bit better."" When asked whether this style of campaign could work with Israelis and Palestinians, Edry said that it was probably already past that point, but now Israel has the chance to capitalize on an opportunity to start fresh with another regional neighbor. ""We are [right next to] Palestinians, so communication was not a problem. This situation is different because [Israel is] now just starting to talk to Iran,"" he said. ""And maybe just by talking we can end it."" In an Israel Public Opinion survey by Shibley Telhami and the Dahaf Institute conducted February 22-26 among a nationally representative sample of 500 Israelis (margin of error is +/- 4.3%), only 19% of Israelis expressed support for a pre-emptive attack on Iranian nuclear facilities without U.S. backing. And while 45% believe an Israeli strike would weaken the Iranian government, 44% believe it would actually strengthen it. The United States has pushed for a nonmilitary solution, including tougher sanctions and diplomatic negotiations. The growing tensions between the two countries have already impacted other countries as well: Israel blamed Iran for a Valentine's Day bombing in Thailand and for a bombing the next day in India that targeted Israeli diplomats.

"(CNN) -- Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who underwent surgery this week to remove her thyroid, did not actually have cancer, her spokesman said Saturday. Fernandez underwent the procedure for what doctors said was papillary carcinoma in her thyroid gland. A post-surgery examination, however, showed that there were no cancerous cells, and the original diagnosis of cancer has been discarded, spokesman Alfredo Scoccimarro said. Fernandez was released from the hospital and will continue her recovery from the presidential residence, he said. ""We thank God and all the Argentinean people for the blessings received,"" Fernandez said on her Twitter account Saturday morning. Given the new diagnosis, planned radiation therapy will not be necessary, the spokesman said. Her 3 1/2-hour operation had been called a success without complications. Hundreds of supporters had waved flags and banners outside the Austral Hospital, located about 60 kilometers (35 miles) from Buenos Aires. Before the operation, Fernandez handed over power to Vice President Amado Boudou until January 24. Fernandez, 58, was sworn in for a second four-year term last month after she won re-election with more than 54% of the vote. She became Argentina's president in 2007. Her husband, Nestor Kirchner, was president from 2003 to 2007. He died in October 2010. During Fernandez's presidency, Argentina's economy has enjoyed sustained growth of about 8% annually. CNN's Claudia Dominguez contributed to this report.","President Fernandez underwent surgery this week .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Elections to select Hong Kong's top official, known as the Chief Executive, are supposed to be predictable. An election committee of 1,200 Hong Kong people, drawn largely from pro-business, pro-establishment circles, cast their ballots and China's preferred candidate wins with a healthy majority. The city-state returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, though as a Special Administrative Region (SAR), which means it retains a high level of autonomy, only ceding control of foreign relations and defense matters to Beijing. The city has developed into one of the world's great financial centers. Hong Kong's seven million residents do not get to vote but the winning candidate is supposed to be ""acceptable"" to them. The entire process is designed to avoid unpleasant surprises. The two main candidates -- 59-year-old Henry Tang, son of a well connected tycoon, and 58-year-old C Y Leung, of more humble origins, but impeccable pro-Beijing credentials -- were supposed to conduct gentlemanly campaigns, culminating in Tang's eventual victory as the favorite of China's leaders and Hong Kong's tycoons. But the mud started flying. Tang's private life became a public nightmare. First he was forced to own up to a string of marital infidelities. Then a media circus descended on one of his homes, using cherry pickers and cranes to film over the high walls of the luxury property looking for evidence of illegal construction work. Tang's clumsy response, first denying, then blaming his wife for the work drew widespread condemnation. Never a popular figure, Tang's opinion poll ratings tumbled and some of his backers began to question his electability. Meanwhile C Y Leung ran into his own troubles. He is currently under investigation for a conflict of interest case involving a construction project when he was in government office. There are also allegations of ""black money"" -- that his campaign had been in contact with organized crime figures. He also is reputed to be a closet communist, and to hold hardline views on public order and press freedom. Even outgoing Chief Executive Donald Tsang has found himself embroiled in controversy amid allegations he had breached anti-bribery regulations by traveling on luxury yachts and private jets owned by wealthy friends. But despite his problems, Leung continues to show a consistent lead over Tang in public opinion polls. Beijing is apparently now pressuring committee members to switch to Leung. But it remains to be seen whether enough members of the election committee will listen. One of Asia's richest men, Li Ka-shing, has said that he will continue to support Tang. The pro-business Liberal Party, controlling 28 votes, says it cannot vote for Leung, while leaving it to individuals members whether they vote for Tang or not. Beijing's hand has tipped the balance in favor of Leung, but he is not yet a shoe-in. The fact of the matter is that neither candidate is very popular and a number of members of the election committee are threatening to cast blank ballots. If no candidate can get more than 50% of the votes the election will be annulled. It would need to be re-run in May, no doubt with some new faces. While this might be an acceptable outcome to many in Hong Kong, it would be a huge loss of face for Beijing, showing that it was unable to control the situation. This Sunday there will be something unprecedented at a chief executive election in Hong Kong -- suspense.","An election committee of 1,200 Hong Kong people will choose new Chief Executive .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A federal immigration court judge in San Francisco put a deportation proceeding on hold Friday for a gay California man who is an undocumented immigrant and married to a U.S. citizen, the couple's attorney said. Alfonso Garcia, 35, who came to the United States as a boy with his parents, and his husband, Brian Willingham, 37, are petitioning the federal immigration service for legal residency based on their marriage, said attorney Lavi Soloway. The judge put Garcia's deportation proceeding on hold while Garcia's legal residency, or green card, application is being processed, Soloway said. The next immigration court hearing is October 25, the attorney said. The couple lawfully married in New York and are registered domestic partners in California living in the San Francisco Bay area, but the federal immigration court doesn't recognize gay marriage under the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as between opposite sex couples, Soloway said. The federal law is being challenged on constitutional grounds, with rulings expected this summer in federal appeals court, but the case hasn't reached the U.S. Supreme Court. The couple is hoping the federal marriage law is nullified before the October 25 hearing, Soloway said. ""If they were an opposite-sex couple, we wouldn't have this discussion right now,"" Soloway said of Garcia's efforts to secure legal U.S. residency as a man married to a U.S. citizen. ""What this case is about is a Mexican man who was brought to the United States as a child and has lived here for 20 years, as has his whole family,"" Soloway said. ""But he doesn't have lawful status."" ""We have a whole campaign around this case and other cases like it,"" Soloway said, referring to the Stop the Deportations campaign and its website, in which gay and lesbian bi-national couples are fighting deportation, separation and exile caused by the Defense of Marriage Act and U.S. immigration law. Garcia's undocumented status was discovered during a routine traffic stop in July, which led to a background check, the couple said. Garcia's parents are legal residents applying for U.S. citizenship, the attorney said. Garcia and Willingham met in October 2001. ""As a gay American citizen, the federal government offers me zero, zilch, nada, null access to the federal rights that all married couples have,"" Willingham said on the couple's Web page. ""This is not an issue of separate but equal. There are no separate federal rights for married gay couples. There are no rights at all. This is not a front of the bus, back of the bus issue. This is the federal government telling us to get the hell off of the bus."" President Barack Obama has called for a legislative repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, and while Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee voted last year to send a repeal to the full Senate floor, the measure is seen as having no chance of getting passed by the Republican-led House. If Garcia is deported, he will be barred from returning to the United States for 10 years, his attorney said. ""I've spent most of my life in the United States. This country is my home, and Brian is my husband. I don't want to lose everything we have built together and be told I can't come back to the U.S. for 10 years. I just want to know we can be together. I just want to know the solemn oath we made to one another will count in the eyes of the law,"" Garcia said in a statement.","NEW: Deportation on hold for Alfonso Garcia, an undocumented immigrant .

"(CNN) -- Bodies in the streets. Bloody faces pleading for help. Bandaged children in hospitals. The horrific scenes and pleas coming out of Syria mount as activists claim President Bashar al-Assad's regime has been ratcheting up attacks, which the government denies. What's behind the increase in violence, what effect did the Arab League monitors have and what may the future bring? CNN's Nic Robertson returned a few weeks ago from a rare look inside Syria, where the government has been placing restrictions on international journalists and refusing many of them entry at all. He explains what's happening in this Q&A transcript, edited for length and clarity. Q: What is happening in Syria and why is it seemingly getting worse? Robertson: (The violence) is significantly worse. It's become quantifiably worse since Bashar al-Assad unleashed the full force of his military army on Homs, on places like Zabadani that we visited with the Arab League monitors. When the monitors were there, the army wasn't shelling these towns. They weren't using tanks this way. They weren't firing mortars into these civilian areas. That's begun in the last week or so, all these injuries. And when we were there, there were perhaps 20 or 30 people being killed a day. Now the numbers are up in the hundreds. So it's quantifiably worse. Assad has decided to ratchet up the firepower, to crush this uprising once and for all to break their spirit, to seal these areas off so they can't get in, so that they can't get medical supplies in, so that they can't bring weapons in to support themselves. Q: Are these reports from people and what you saw on the ground about hundreds of people being killed, are they accurate? Robertson: We're not there and we can't verify the number of people that are being killed. What we see on the video that's sent out from there, that seems to be shot on cell phones, is maimed people. ... I've been in this business for a long time, and it's some of the worst I've seen. There was a young child with everything below his nose missing, caught by a shell, children that are killed. There's no doubt that there is shelling that is causing civilian casualties, that is damaging houses, that appears to be damaging hospitals, and we also understand, targeting the places where this video is being fed out of Homs. It is a siege in the medieval sense of the word. Q: Has it come to a crisis point, or are they close to a crisis point where all hell breaks loose? Robertson: Again, not being there, it's very hard to gauge. But when you listen to the desperation in people's voices, and you see the way that they're talking and the terms they're characterizing it in, yes, the situation is desperate. They say they're running out of medical supplies. Doctors are using secondhand sutures to stitch people up. They don't have anesthetics to give to people. When you have these kind of wounds coming in -- the survival rate is negligible. The young man who lost his face, he died for lack of treatment, nothing else -- for lack of treatment. Bread is in short supply. Basic food things are in short supply. What al-Assad is trying to do is crush the will of the rebels, of the opposition here, so that they will give up, so that they have no other option. He's also sort of trying to put the international community in a position whereby whatever the international community does through its desire to stop this (crisis), it will perhaps play into his hands, the idea of humanitarian envoys. Q: What about this notion that perhaps monitors on the ground or other people helping them out really plays into al-Assad's hands -- how so? Robertson: We've already seen it. The monitors were on the ground before, monitoring what was supposedly al-Assad pulling his troops and his heavy armor back. Their report at the end of a month said that he hadn't complied. These monitors don't have weapons. They have flak jackets, helmets and armored cars, some of them. They have no way of imposing their will, if you like, on Assad's forces. They can't stop them shooting. The notion that they could sort of get in between the opposition, these enclaves, and save them from the tank fire is a preposterous proposition. The only reason it would stop would be because Assad decided to tell his army to stop firing and stop shooting. And he appears to be nowhere near that kind of decision. ... If anyone thinks that Arab League monitors backed with some semblance of United Nations training can go in and stop the kind of artillery fire and gunfire that's going on, then think again. Because there were monitors there who wouldn't even cross police road checkpoints, never mind go into contested areas. There were some monitors who were willing to do that, but they're not set up and protected and equipped to go in and stop tanks firing and stop two forces shooting at each other. Q: So why are we even talking about this then? Robertson: One of the reasons we're talking about this is because al-Assad, backed by Russia, created a scenario on the ground where the West is watching huge, horrible humanitarian suffering. We're the ones that are saying: What can we do to help? How can we stop this? Russia and al-Assad would like nothing better than to see us divided, see the international community brought to a position where they will compromise for something less, i.e., not a removal of al-Assad, i.e., not going in with a military intervention. Maybe just protecting the people, saving the people. That's what they're aiming for in the short term right now. Q: You were recently in Damascus. How strong of support does the regime have in the capital city? Robertson: About 20 to 30% of the population supports al-Assad. There's 10% Alawite -- this is the sect that al-Assad is from -- (and) about 10% Christian. And the message that Assad sells his people is that, You're only going to be safe under me. The Sunni majority, if they get power, you will be forced out of your homes and businesses. Q: We saw what happened in Libya. Do you think that's ultimately going to happen in Syria? Robertson: We're a long way from that. Al-Assad still has 20 to 30% support of the population. They still buy his message that he is fighting terrorist groups who are backed by an international media conspiracy. He has the support of Russia right behind him. There's no strong U.N. resolution against him. And he is a smarter guy with a stronger army that hasn't given up on him yet. And the rebels there, the opposition, don't have what the Benghazi, the east of the country, a huge base where they can operate from. They have tiny little enclaves that we're seeing being shelled right now. Baba Amr and places like that. It's not that we haven't seen this type of thing before. If you think back to Bosnia, when Russia was supporting the Serbs there, politically, not militarily on the ground, there were tiny little enclaves, the infamous Srebrenica. The Serbs, after three years of standing back and shelling it, after the U.N. -- we're talking here about Arab League monitors, where the U.N. provided safety and security in Srebrenica -- the Serbs still went in and massacred 7,000 people. So what al-Assad and Russia are looking at here is a scenario where the international community could settle for something less, i.e., trying to protect these areas. And that will be no protection.","CNN's Nic Robertson recently returned from a rare look inside Syria .

"(CNN) -- One of three siblings accused of robbing a bank and trying to kill police officers last year has accepted a plea deal that calls for at least nine years in prison, according to court documents. Lee Grace Dougherty, 29, pleaded guilty Thursday in a Colorado courtroom to one count of attempted first-degree assault and two counts of felony menacing, CNN affiliate KRDO reported. Prosecutors will drop the laundry list of other charges against her, including five counts of attempted second-degree murder, according to the plea agreement. She faces a maximum of 28 years in prison when she is sentenced on April 30, according to court documents. Dougherty and her brothers, Dylan Stanley Dougherty and Ryan Edward Dougherty, are all accused of taking part in a multistate crime rampage that gripped the nation last year. The trio is accused of an armed bank robbery in Georgia and the attempted murder of a Florida police officer on August 2. They escaped from Florida with police in pursuit after they shot out a police cruiser's tire, according to authorities. The next week, the trio surfaced in Colorado and were again pursued by police. They were arrested after a high-speed chase on a rural stretch of interstate. They crashed their car along a rural road and police say they were shooting at officers with an AK-47 during a chase at speeds of up to 120 mph. Just before they were captured, she pointed her pistol at a Colorado police chief, but the chief fired his .40-caliber handgun first, wounding her in the right upper thigh, according to court documents. ""I deserved to get shot,"" she later told the FBI. ""I pointed the gun at the cop.""

"COLLEGE PARK, Maryland (CNN) -- At 94, Barbara Podoski finally gets to tell the story of how she punched a German sergeant in the face during World War II, when she was a secret U.S. interrogator. Barbara Podoski remembers giving a Nazi prisoner of war a ""knuckle sandwich"" during questioning. Her story was one of many brought to light Thursday, when the National Archives released declassified personnel records from the old Office of Strategic Services, the CIA's predecessor. The names include Julia Child, who would later become a famous chef. Child was stationed in Sri Lanka and China as a researcher for the head of the OSS, Gen. William Donovan. Two other OSS operatives, William Casey and William Colby, later led the CIA, the intelligence agency that replaced the OSS.  See which famous figures worked for the OSS » . Podoski was on hand for the release Thursday in a climate-controlled, high security room at the National Archives where thousands of documents are stored in an area normally off-limits to the public . She said she and thousands of other OSS agents were told not to talk much about their work. Their employment files had remained sealed. ""They used me mostly to interrogate prisoners of war,"" said Podoski, a native of what then was called Czechoslovakia. ""I was multilingual."" Podoski said she became a U.S. citizen and joined the Army as WWII began. She recalled preparing to question the sergeant, a Nazi prisoner of war. ""He was very vociferous against America and was vilifying President Wilson,"" Podoski said. ""I told him to stop, and he didn't, so I took my little fist and hit him over the face. I gave him a knuckle sandwich. ""I was very ashamed of myself because I had a pistol under my jacket, and he was unarmed,"" she added.  Watch Podoski describe her spy career » . The German she questioned told her that Adolf Hitler was using Czechs and Slovaks to do ""dirty work"" along the Italian Front. To counter that, she borrowed a Czech typewriter from the Vatican, and distributed an underground leaflet encouraging them to abandon the Germans. ""Within a week, about 600 guys, with my appeal, crossed the lines,"" she said, smiling. She was honored for her intelligence-gathering efforts with a Bronze Star that she wore with other military awards Thursday, after years of secrecy. ""Today, it's history,"" she said.","National Archives releases personnel records from CIA's predecessor on Thursday .

"New York (CNN) -- Technology and globalization are putting the jobs of millions in America's middle class at risk, says analyst Fareed Zakaria. In a cover story for Time called ""How to Restore the American Dream,"" Zakaria writes, ""We have just gone through the worst recession since the Great Depression. The light at the end of the tunnel is dim at best. Sixteen months into the recovery, the unemployment rate is higher than it was in the depths of all but one of the postwar recessions. ... ""Americans are far more apprehensive than usual, and their worries seem to go beyond the short-term debate over stimulus vs. deficit reduction,"" according to Zakaria. ""They fear that we are in the midst of not a cyclical downturn but a structural shift, one that poses huge new challenges to the average American job, pressures the average American wage and endangers the average American Dream."" The author and host of CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" spoke to CNN on Friday. Here is an edited transcript: . CNN: You wrote in your Time cover story that the American middle class is being ""hollowed out."" What does that mean? Fareed Zakaria: Well, if you think about it, middle class to most Americans means somebody who has a good high school education, somebody who didn't go to fancy schools or grow up in a fancy suburb, but somebody who is working on a factory floor as a foreman, or a manager, or maybe in sales or administration. What's happened to these people is that these jobs have a certain kind of routine nature to them. What technology has done over the last 10 or 15 years, it's become possible to do many of these tasks through computer programs. Now computer programs need to be monitored and supervised, but it takes far fewer people to do that ... and the people supervising computers need to be more high-end, more skilled people. CNN: How does that work out in practice? Zakaria: Take the example [former GE CEO] Jack Welch gave. He said information technology been around since the 1980s and 1990s, when it was mostly streamlining back offices. Now it's transformed every department from sales to marketing to administration. You used to just use computers to streamline, for example, the payroll system. Now it's completely ubiquitous, affecting every aspect of business. Read Zakaria's ""How to Restore the American Dream"" Welch gave the example of a company he's involved in buying. It had $12 billion in revenue in 2007 with 26,000 employees. With the greater efficiency that comes with technology, the same company, when it returns to that level of revenue in a few years, will have only 14,000 employees. That's roughly half the people generating the same revenue. That's the basic dilemma -- companies have gotten so efficient, and there's enormous pressure on these simple routine tasks that used to employ lots of people. CNN: Is globalization of companies also a factor in hollowing out the middle class? Zakaria: Clearly, the second big part of this is globalization. Most big American companies are now global companies. The world market has tripled or quadrupled over the last 20 years, as the number of potential consumers greatly increased once the Soviet system collapsed, and China and India liberalized their economies. It's added as many as a billion and half consumers to the world market. Companies have benefited enormously from it, but these new consumers are willing to work for much less. That's a huge factor, you can't deny it. Technology may be a bigger driver than trade, but globalization is easier to understand -- when you have an autoworker in Mexico willing to work for $7 an hour versus $28 an hour in the U.S. The best way to think of it is that technology and globalization are working together to produce these results. CNN: You give the example of a radically cheaper car that is being produced in India? Why is that important? Zakaria: It's called the Nano. It costs a little more than $2,000 in India and when it's sold in the U.S., it will cost about $7,000 once it has safety features such as air bags and meets U.S. crash requirements. It's a good car. This is a perfectly nice car, looks a lot like Mercedes' Smart Car, except that the Smart Car costs $22,000. The most important thing may be the parts -- every part in that car costs a fraction, as little as 1/16, of what it costs to manufacture in the United States. So where will the U.S. car companies get their parts made if they're trying to be competitive? They will be tempted to buy those parts manufactured in India. You can't even call it outsourcing since these are global companies with global supply chains. They will invest more in their Chinese operation, or their Brazilian operation, and less in the U.S. operation. They will be doing what they need to do to survive in a competitive global market. CNN: So what can be done? Zakaria: We are going to have to move up the value chain. Ultimately you don't want to be making products that people can make somewhere else in the world at half or a quarter of the price. You have to take on the more complex aspects of manufacturing. The car is becoming two things, it's a manufactured product, but it's also a very highly sophisticated computer. Think of your GPS system, audio system and so on. Each of these components has to be coordinated. Can we make the high-end aspects of the car? Can the U.S. be dominant in design, in the computer electronics part of it. It's very tough to be competitive on the pure manufacturing of the chassis. CNN: What's the impact on people? Zakaria: They have to hone their skills so they are really good at this stuff, at the skills of complex manufacturing and electronics. I don't mean to say everyone has to become a brain surgeon, but there's a difference between skilled labor and highly skilled labor. The Germans have maintained their manufacturing base because they've concentrated on complex manufacturing. They don't try to make Toyota cars; they make BMWs. That means a lot of education and retraining. And the most important thing is education. You can only retrain somebody who knows how to read and write and do math. To the extent that U.S. schools are failing at this, there is a basic problem. You can't retrain somebody who has a fourth-grade reading level, and when they don't have any basic math in the first place. We've gone from having the best test scores 25 years ago to having the worst in the industrialized world today. That's probably the single most important problem.","Fareed Zakaria: Technology, globalization threatening middle-class jobs .

"(CNN) -- DARPA, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, funds some of the world's most far out, forward-thinking research into new military technology. Something like Q Branch in the James Bond movies, DARPA is constantly working on what it describes as ""radical innovations."" But where James Bond has the character Q to build his exploding pens, DARPA often funds private companies and external organizations to develop its high-tech hardware. It is currently funding research into, among other things, a robot ostrich, a flying car and a plane that could stay airborne for five years at a time. While some of the technologies it is supporting might seem more suitable for science fiction than the battlefield, the fact that DARPA is willing to fund them is a sign they are at least possible -- if not always plausible. Don't forget, DARPA's Arpanet program is widely credited as being the precursor to today's internet. So here are some of DARPA's most incredible research programs, which could change the future of warfare, and might one day have applications that extend far beyond the military. Disc-Rotor Compound Helicopter . The Disc-Rotor is a collaboration between DARPA and Boeing. Hoping to marry the best features of a helicopter and an airplane, the Disc-Rotor program aims to develop a new type of aircraft capable of a seamlessly transitioning from hovering like a helicopter to flying like a plane. The design is propelled by rotor blades that extend from a central disc, letting it take off and land like a helicopter. But those blades can also retract into the disc, minimizing drag and letting the Disc-Rotor fly like a plane, powered by engines beneath each wing. Vulture . DARPA's Vulture program is developing the technology to enable an ""airborne payload"" to remain in the sky for more than five years at a time, performing intelligence, surveillance and communication missions. In practice, that means developing unmanned aircraft that act like satellites. Boeing is again working on the project, researching its ""SolarEagle,"" a solar-powered, unmanned craft with a 120-meter wing span. It is designed to operate at altitudes above 18,000 meters. Boeing hopes it will make its first demonstration flight in 2014. ChemBots . Tech company iRobot worked with DARPA on its ""ChemBots"" program. The aim was to build soft, flexible robots that could deform their bodies to move through openings smaller than themselves (e.g. under doors) to carry out covert tasks. IRobot used a transitional -- or ""jamming"" -- material, with properties of both a solid and a liquid, to create a flexible robot that can crawl on six floppy legs. While DARPA's funding has now expired, iRobot is still researching soft robotics and ""jamming"" technology. LANdroids (Local Area Network droids) DARPA also funded iRobot to research its LANdroids program. The aim was to give soldiers reliable communications in urban areas by creating pocket-sized robots they could scatter as they moved through an area. The robots would each act as a node in a wireless communications network. As the soldiers move, the robots would autonomously move with them, filling gaps in the network. According to iRobot, the LANdroid it created weighed around one pound, was highly mobile and used a flipper mechanism for self righting and obstacle climbing. Following the DARPA research, iRobot has developed a throwable robot for soldiers that will be available from 2012. It says the robot could be used to investigate hard-to-access places such as tunnels and ditches. Falcon HTV-2 . The ultimate goal of the Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 (HTV-2) program is to create a vehicle that can fly anywhere in the world in less than an hour -- while enduring temperatures in excess of 1,925 C (3,500 F). DARPA has already produced and flown a test HTV-2 -- an unmanned, rocket-launched aircraft that travels at Mach 20 (about 13,000 miles per hour). At that speed a flight between New York City and Los Angeles would take less than 12 minutes. HTV-2 made its maiden flight in April 2010, but crashed into the Pacific after just nine minutes. A second flight, in August 2011, lasted a similar time before meeting the same end. Following the second flight HTV-2 program manager Major Chris Schulz said: ""We do not yet know how to achieve the desired control during the aerodynamic phase of flight. It's vexing; I'm confident there is a solution. We have to find it."" FastRunner . This ""robot ostrich,"" called FastRunner, is a joint project between DARPA, MIT and the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC). It aims to build a two-legged robot that can cover a moderately rough terrain ""as fast as the best human sprinters."" The Florida group has been running computer models it says show that when built, its robot could go from zero to 20 miles per hour in 15 seconds, with a top speed of 27 mph. An Olympic 400-meter runner moves at around a 20.5 mph. Why an ostrich? Because it's the fastest two-legged animal on land, said Sebastien Cotton, a research scientist with the IHMC. ""All the inspiration is coming from the ostrich so we spent a lot of time studying ostriches and trying to figure out which movements are essential to its locomotion,"" said Cotton. The team plans to build and test a real robot in 2012. Phoenix . Communication satellites orbit more than 20,000 miles above the Earth. When they break they usually have to be replaced by launching a new satellite, even though many of these broken satellites still have usable parts, such as antennae and solar arrays. The Phoenix program is trying to find a way to remove and re-use valuable components from broken or ""retired"" satellites -- in essence, recycling space junk. DARPA envisions small ""satlets"" or ""nano satellites"" being carried to a broken communication satellite by a ""tender"" satellite, and then robotically attaching to the broken satellite's antenna. But before it can become reality they must develop new robotics and remote imaging systems, and design grappling tools to grip, cut, and modify satellite parts. Shrike . DARPA has funded aerospace company AeroVironment's development of the Shrike -- a vertical take-off-and-landing unmanned aircraft ""small enough to be carried in a backpack."" Intended for use in military surveillance, the Shrike has four rotors and is equipped with a high-resolution camera that transmits real-time video. It can hover in place for up to 40 minutes and can also land, or ""perch,"" in a discrete location and transmit video from its perch for several hours. Once it's finished filming it takes off vertically and flies back to base. Transformer . The Transformer program aims to build a flying car for the battlefield. And the car will need to fly itself. The aim is to create a vertical take-off-and-landing vehicle that can carry four people more than 250 miles on one tank of fuel. Six contractors are working on the project, including Lockheed Martin, AAI Corp. and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Sanjiv Singh, a CMU research professor of robotics, said: ""In practical terms ... the vehicle will need to be able to fly itself, or to fly with only minimal input from the operator. And this means that the vehicle has to be continuously aware of its environment and be able to automatically react in response to what it perceives."" Cognitive Technology Threat Warning System (CT2WS) The Cognitive Technology Threat Warning System program is developing binoculars that can identify threats from a long distance and then inform a soldier of the danger. It will use wide-angle optics and digital imaging, but the really clever bit is its use of ""cognitive visual processing algorithms"" and ""operator neural signature detection processing."" That means monitoring the subconscious patterns in a soldier's brain to detect a threat the soldier has perceived before they are even consciously aware of it. Nano Air Vehicle (NAV) The Nano Air Vehicle (NAV) program is developing a tiny, ultra-light air vehicle for indoor and outdoor military missions. The program has already produced an impressive prototype robotic hummingbird, complete with fast-flapping wings that let it hover and fly.","U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency funds tech research .

"(CNN) -- The man accused of killing a 9-year-old Indiana girl allegedly told police he beat her in the head with a brick, dismembered her body and stored parts of it in his freezer, according to court documents released Tuesday. Michael L. Plumadore, 39, is charged with one count of murder in the death of Aliahna Lemmon, whose remains were found Monday night. She had been missing since Friday. Plumadore, described as a family friend, was being held without bond Tuesday after his initial court appearance. A hearing is scheduled for Friday. Allen County Sheriff Ken Fries told HLN's Nancy Grace on Tuesday night that comments by Plumadore during the investigation indicated he was key to solving the case. In the probable cause affidavit released Tuesday, investigators with the Allen County Sheriff's Department said Plumadore eventually admitted striking the girl repeatedly in the head with a brick while she stood on the front steps of his mobile home in the early hours of December 22. He stored the body in garbage bags in a freezer at his house until evening, according to the affidavit, when he allegedly began to dismember it with a hacksaw. Plumadore allegedly told investigators he threw parts of the body in a nearby commercial trash bin, but kept the head, hands and feet in his freezer, according to the document. The document does not disclose a motive for the girl's death. An autopsy was conducted, but Fries did not disclose the findings. Amber Story, the girl's grandmother, had described Plumadore as a neighbor and close family friend. She said Aliahna and her two sisters were staying with Plumadore for about a week while Aliahna's mother recovered from the flu. Prior to the suspect's arrest, Story said she believed the girl could have sleepwalked out of Plumadore's Fort Wayne home early Friday morning and been taken. She said Aliahna suffered from partial hearing loss and partial blindness and has gotten out of her home while sleepwalking before. Fries cited ""small inconsistencies"" in Plumadore's pre-arrest statements. Investigators did not believe the sleepwalking scenario, the sheriff told Grace. The sheriff said the case was an ""emotional roller coaster,"" with officials initially hoping Aliahna would be found alive. CNN's Deanna Proeller and Rick Martin contributed to this report.","NEW: Inconsistencies found in suspect's account, sheriff tells HLN .

"(CNN) -- Libya went out of the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations despite a 2-1 win over Senegal in their final Group A match at Estadio de Bata Sunday. Ihab El Busaifi scored twice for the surprise qualifiers to give them their first victory in the tournament, but they finished three points behind group winners Zambia and two adrift of runners-up Equatorial Guinea. Senegal, who had gone into the finals as one of the favorites, finished rock bottom of the group with three losses. Zambia defeated co-hosts Equatorial Guinea 1-0 Sunday to win the group on seven points.

"(CNN) -- Alaska's vast expanse of wilderness and natural beauty is captivating to its residents and visitors alike. Whether you're new to this fascinating state or a native Alaskan, it takes time to explore all the Land of the Midnight Sun has to offer. ""I feel even if we do a lot of homework online, it won't be enough to have a good vacation in Alaska,"" iReporter Uday Ellala said. Don't let this wide-open landscape intimidate you. Traveling to Alaska is well worth the planning. ""Alaska is an amazing, enchanted place,"" iReporter Joan Splinter said. ""The scenery is unbelievably beautiful, and the people are warm and welcoming."" iReporters, both tourists and locals, shared their favorite experiences and tips for navigating your way across the state. First-timers . Don't feel overwhelmed by Alaska's sheer size -- or treat this like it's your only opportunity. First-timers in Alaska should try to immerse themselves, iReporter Laura Grabhorn said. ""Instead of going for the whirlwind, pick a couple of destinations and spend a few days there. From Seattle, you can get to Sitka in less than two hours. Rent a car and enjoy the place!"" she said. Go with a plan for what you want to see and experience for your ""immersion."" Also, don't forget to keep the season in mind when making your plans. ""If your first visit to Alaska is in the summer, your next trip must be in the winter,"" Splinter said. ""Winters are magical: peaceful, amazing sunrises and auroras. It is easily my favorite season there of all!"" iReporter Adyson Ellis has a few tips of her own for the summer. ""Make sure you have hotel reservations, as rooms can get booked a year in advance. Be prepared for high gas and food prices, and in the smaller communities, there are limited places to eat, so plan accordingly."" Because hot weather is rare in Alaska, don't forget to bring layers of clothing, especially if you go out on the water. ""First-timers should see glaciers, attempt to go fishing on a stream or the ocean and, of course, consume much fresh seafood,"" iReporter Russ Dale suggested. Cruising through . Photographer and iReporter L. Craig Smith knows the importance of making the most of your trip. His recommendation? ""A cruise through the Inside Passage of Alaska to explore and experience the small and beautiful mining and logging towns, as well as witnessing up close the beautiful glaciers."" To take a gander at the wild side of Alaska, get your adventure on in the Kenai Peninsula, Smith suggests. iReporter Dino Robert U. Eleazar recommends taking a cruise to maximize your time in Alaska -- and visiting multiple cities. ""I've been to Juneau, Ketchikan, Skagway, Sitka and Icy Straight Point, amazing places. At least you can visit not just one place in Alaska, but the cruising experience is really the best,"" he said. Road trippin' For those with the opportunity to see Alaska by car, iReporter Joan Splinter advises to venture along the road rarely taken. ""There is nothing like seeing Alaska by land. Homer -- a haven for artists and sportsmen alike -- is the crown jewel of the peninsula. The four-hour drive from Anchorage to Homer can easily take you six hours or more if you stop to photograph the amazing scenery along the way,"" she said. You can also adventure through Alaska with horseback riding, kayaking, float planes and water taxi tours, Splinter said. Where to eat and stay . In Juneau, Laura Grabhorn recommends several places to grab a bite. ""My absolute favorite is Hangar on the Wharf: awesome food in a friendly and low-key spot. It used to be the Juneau airport, and now you can eat and see float planes taking off and landing and enjoy the mist and clouds as they tumble down the mountains."" She also suggests the Twisted Fish Company in Juneau and the Larkspur Café in Sitka. Joan Splinter loves visiting Homer, and when she does, she stops by Fat Olives or Cosmic Kitchen. ""For fine dining, Cafe Cups cannot be beat by any restaurant in Alaska or the lower 48."" She usually stays at the Timber Bay Bed & Breakfast or the Ocean House Inn. When Grabhorn is in Juneau, she stays at the Alaska Beach Cabin on Indian Cover with a waterfront view. In Sitka, she suggests staying at the Shee Atika Totem Square Inn. ""Lovely people, and they'll help you find your way around town and give you water for your stroll."" Feasting in Alaska: Dried moose, whale blubber and spit-roasted yak . Favorite spots . As iReporter Paul Tamsai said, ""I would recommend the Denali area, but there is no place that I would not recommend."" While Juneau, the state capital, is a favorite with its museums, art galleries and live shows, iReporters ventured all across the state. ""I love Seldovia!"" said Alicia McDonald, a former Anchorage resident. ""The town is in such a beautiful setting, the people are great, the sunsets are gorgeous, the views are humbling ,and there is such a peacefulness to the area."" iReporter Russ Dale felt similarly about Ellamar. ""There is no way to describe the breathtaking sights I saw, no way to describe the glee and transformation of a free soul on the edge of the untamed wild.""","iReporters share their tips and photos for venturing through Alaska .

"(CNN) -- Argentina is a huge, diverse country. Large cities and breathtaking vistas are just some of your travel options there. Every journey has to start somewhere, and many people choose to begin in the capital city, Buenos Aires. Not every adventure is about climbing mountains or rafting rivers. Sometimes, the thrill you seek comes from culture and urban exploration. CNN's Jose Manuel Rodriguez recently visited Buenos Aires while on assignment for Café CNN, and carved out time to share some travel suggestions. Explore history, culture . Buenos Aires is defined by intensity, beauty, glamour, architecture, tango and an unexpected nightlife. Not to mention, good steak. But the flavors of Argentina are not just steak and Malbec wine. International cuisine is everywhere in Buenos Aires. The great French restaurant Petanque, located at 596 Defensa, is a cozy place where you can sample local foie gras and wine from Salta in the foothills of the Andes. Beyond the cuisine, there are many points of interest not to be missed during a visit to Buenos Aires. The neighborhood of San Telmo has witnessed many of the city's transformational events. During the mid-19th century, it was home to the wealthiest of Buenos Aires. By the end of that century, the area was affected by an epidemic of yellow fever and many of its residents migrated to the north. Restoration of part of this architecturally rich neighborhood began in the 1970s, leading to a wave of artists, bohemians and antique shops. Today it is the most significant root of South America's antique markets and features 500 shops that offer all sorts of vintage collections. On Sundays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., a flea market fills the Plaza Dorrego as eager tourists and collectors search varied and eccentric antiques. The 'Soho' of Buenos Aires . The area of ""Palermo Soho"" arose from a real estate boom in the area that brought fashion designers, artists, galleries and restaurants to the traditional neighborhood of Palermo. These new arrivals refurbished old houses, making the area a fashionable destination filled with art and good food. It's called Soho colloquially, evoking the legendary Soho areas in New York and London. The area is surrounded by boutiques, exclusive salons, gourmet tearooms and restaurants that serve fusion food. The restaurant Casa Cruz is one of the best around. Elegant, understated and modern, it's one of the most expensive and luxurious in Buenos Aires. The ambiance is its best asset, although the art and sophisticated cuisine are not far behind. The top-flight menu makes it a favorite of celebrities. Casa Cruz is located at Uriarte 1658, and in that same area there are excellent places for afternoon tea with an English flair. Pierina Tea House, at Gurruchaga 1875, blends elegance, good taste and tradition. Just past Juan B. Justo street begins ""Palermo Hollywood,"" a nickname inspired by the producers and TV channels that settled in the area. The residential area has gained plenty of nightlife, and there are many ""grills"" where you can eat delicious Argentine beef. Romanticizing Argentina's history . Perón Perón offers an ample menu and is located at Angel Carranza 2225. The restaurant aims to recreate the aesthetic of the Peronist '40s. Throughout the restaurant there are propaganda posters for the Peronist party, which is one of the oldest political parties in Argentina. It originated with the government of Gen. Juan Domingo Perón, who was married to Evita Duarte. The restaurant has an atmosphere of camaraderie and great fanfare. Diners who meet here embrace and celebrate shared jokes at long tables like an extended family. Among its customers are the young and old, activists and even a few anti-Peronists. Political discourse is everywhere in the air here and discussed with passion. To better understand this passion, visit the Evita Museum. The museum, located at Lafinur 2988, explores the life of the woman whose husband, Juan Domingo Peron, was twice elected president of Argentina. Evita Perón is a mythical figure in Argentina and around the world, praised and criticized by many. Perón's body was laid to rest in the historic Recoleta Cemetery, and the burial site is a popular tourist destination. For further museum exploration, tour the Casa Rosada where the president's offices are housed. The Government Palace and the Museum of the Bicentennial are nearby, bringing together the complex political, social and cultural aspects of Argentina.","Buenos Aires is a starting point for many visits to Argentina .

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- The United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution Friday expressing its intent to, eventually, send U.N. peacekeeping forces back to the fractured, unstable nation of Somalia. Islamist insurgents display their weaponry Friday in Mogadishu during a parade. The resolution was sponsored by the U.S., in one of the final Bush Administration initiatives at the United Nations. The passage of the resolution follows the exit of a U.N.-backed, Ethiopian peacekeeping force that completed a two-year deployment in Somalia Thursday. There is wide-spread concern among diplomats and regional leaders in the Horn of Africa that, with the withdrawal of Ethiopian forces, a power vacuum will be filled in Somalia by regional Islamic extremist groups, some with links to al-Qaeda. The U.N. resolution sets forth a process that aims to bring stability and sovereignty to Somalia, which has been racked by violence and lawlessness since the government was overthrown in 1991. First, the resolution expresses renewed support that an African Union force currently deployed in Somalia -- known as AMISOM -- remains on the ground. The A.U. contingent is currently comprised of 2,600 troops. The U.N. resolution calls on the African Union to strengthen those levels to 8,000. The resolution then requests that U.N. Secretary-General, Ban Ki-Moon, submit a report by April 15, 2009 updating the situation in Somalia, and it asks that he develop the mandate for a U.N. peacekeeping force. Finally, a decision on U.N. peacekeeping is requested by June 1, 2009. However, the process is off to a rocky start. Last month, Ban said that requests to U.N. member nations for peacekeeping forces for Somalia were received negatively. Also, throughout, one of the key players in the Somalia decisions will likely be Susan Rice, President-Elect Obama's nominee for new U.S.- U.N. Ambassador, and a specialist on African issues. At her confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in Washington on Thursday, Rice told senators that she is ""skeptical about the wisdom of a United Nations peacekeeping force in Somalia at this time.""","Resolution expresses intent to send U.N. peacekeeping forces to Somalia .

"(CNN) -- Debris from a cargo ship that ran aground off the coast of New Zealand last year, and split in two over the weekend, washed up on a local beach Monday. Four shipping containers also came ashore on Waihi Beach, and another seven are within a mile of the shore, Maritime New Zealand said in a statement. Police closed public access to the beach. People are being encouraged to steer clear of the water, and to report whatever debris they see. So far, the reported debris includes timber, milk powder and plastic material. ""There is inevitably going to be a lot of mess and disturbance for the next few days while this is cleaned up and we would like people to use common sense and stay well away from the debris -- in some cases this will mean staying out of the water as well as away from material washed up on the beach,"" National On Scene Commander Alex van Wijngaarden said in the statement. The Rena, a Liberian-flagged vessel, struck the Astrolabe Reef, about 12 nautical miles off the city of Tauranga, on the North Island, in October. It split in two over the weekend, triggering fears of a fresh oil spill. Hundreds of tonnes of oil have already leaked from the ship, leading New Zealand's environment minister to call the spill the country's most significant maritime environmental disaster. But on Monday, maritime officials said there is ""no indication of a significant release of oil from the Rena, although a sheen of oil is still visible off the vessel."" Between 200 and 300 containers on the ship were lost overboard when it broke in two, Maritime New Zealand said.","Police close Waihi Beach as shipping containers come ashore .

"(CNN) -- South Africa is a destination with soul that will wend its way into your heart over the course of a few days. It can be hard to leave, and many choose to make it home after getting a taste of the culture and endless variety of new experiences. You're on the Cape now, and things are captivatingly different here. iReporter Neal Piper considered making the move after one visit to South Africa. ""In all of my travels, Cape Town is on the top of my list of places I would like to call home. In a matter of a week you can go on a safari, cage diving with great white sharks, hike Table Mountain, learn how to surf, appreciate many types of wines in the wine region and learn about a rich culture that has seen a lot of change in our lifetime. This is only a taste of what this beautiful region has to offer."" Visiting the new South Africa . Travelers can be put off by warnings of crime or danger concerning South Africa, but as with any adventure, plan accordingly and travel with caution. It may be a vacation, but it always pays to be aware. ""Johannesburg has a reputation as a dangerous city, but reputations rarely tell the entire story,"" iReporter Christopher Scott Walker said. ""While crime is a serious problem in the city, the locals were among the friendliest people that I have ever encountered. The wildlife in South Africa is amazing, but I encourage everyone to spend time with the amazing people as well."" Prepare to explore a country full of adventures. The hardest part will be planning how to experience the most of South Africa while you're there. Below, iReporters share their tips and favorite things to do. Dive right in . iReporter Sara Ruedy had never left the U.S. until she ventured to South Africa with her boyfriend. The first stamp on her passport became an unforgettable adventure. Consider an exciting brush with danger during your trip. ""Cage dive with great white sharks in Gansbaai,"" she said. ""My boyfriend, Steve, and I spent four hours on a boat with 10 others and were given the opportunity to get in a shark cage in the water as great whites approached us head-on."" Table Mountain is considered a (tamer) must for first-time visitors to South Africa. Ruedy loved it for the panoramic views. iReporter Jennifer Traubel encourages visitors to make the hike. ""For non-hikers, taking the cable car up and down can be tempting, but it is absolutely worth the climb. You can take the cable car down as your reward!"" History is rich in South Africa, and it's worth taking the time to absorb. Robben Island, a World Heritage site, is brimming with stories. ""A ferry can be taken from the V&A Waterfront in Cape Town for a tour of Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela was exiled as a political prisoner for 27 years,"" Ruedy said. ""Island tours are particularly interesting because they are given by ex-political prisoners themselves who share their personal experiences."" iReporter Ethel Marie Chadwick fell in love with South Africa and Cape Town when she traveled to visit her cousins living in the area. Her tip? Explore everything! ""Visit Cape Town, the Vrede en Lust Wine Farm, Sun City and go on a safari. December is a great time to go: It's summer there!"" South African eats: A sweet lesson at the Magic Kingdom . Get wild with your food . The flavors can be exotic, literally. If you want a new kind of culinary experience, try the local cuisine, although some is more geared toward tourists. ""A good -- though admittedly touristy -- restaurant in Johannesburg that I made a point to eat at was Carnivore,"" Walker said. ""Carnivore is a restaurant that serves game meat, including crocodile, giraffe, kudu and zebra."" iReporter Jennifer Traubel also recommends the warthog casserole at the Wild Fig Tree Restaurant in Sabie. If you want a little normalcy alongside the wild cuisine, fresh seafood is a great option. ""Saul's Taverna in Cape Town is not fancy or flashy in any way, but the food is a great experience,"" Ruedy said. ""The restaurant offers Greek, Portuguese and Italian food with an African flair, including the popular kudu and warthog meats. We ordered the best-tasting calamari we've ever had."" South African eats: How Emily got her appetite back . Venture off the beaten path . Seasoned travelers know that making the most of your trip sometimes involves making up your own itinerary. ""The most interesting things and most rewarding are seen and experienced off the beaten path to get a real taste of how South Africans truly live and not just the typical tourist traps,"" iReporter Lulis Leal said. Leal enjoyed going on a safari while she was in South Africa but recommends renting a car and making your own, especially if you want to take photos. She ventured through Kruger National Park. ""I was blown away with the natural beauty of the park and having an opportunity to see the animals in their own natural environment was a very amazing, interesting and humbling experience. There is so much to see and do in Kruger National Park that it would take weeks to see it all. ""My advice to first-time travelers would be to be patient and keep a flexible schedule. While Americans may always appear to be in a rush, in South Africa things are done more slowly. Everything is savored and relished.""","South Africa is rich with exciting adventures and rich cultural experiences .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's all-powerful spy agency could face an unprecedented challenge from the nation's high court after a lawyer representing seven victims urged contempt of court charges Friday. The Supreme Court had given the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency until midnight Friday to produce the seven men, who according to attorney Tariq Asad, were arrested without due process and injured while in custody. The ISI has also been ordered to explain the deaths of four other detainees. Asad said he filed a petition after the Supreme Court adjourned Friday's hearing without the presence of the seven detainees. A three-judge panel gave the ISI a new Monday deadline to produce the men. ""The court wants the detainees in court today and they're not accepting any excuses,"" said Asad. ""The court has said they have until midnight to produce the detainees, even if it means bringing them to court in a helicopter."" The court did not spell out consequences if the ultimatum is not heeded. But the case breaks new ground in that the ISI has long been thought untouchable. Legal proceedings could expose the inner workings of the highly secretive agency like never before. On Thursday, the spy agency's lawyer presented the court with medical certificates for four of the seven detainees to show they were hospitalized, and he asked permission from the court to present confidential letters explaining the whereabouts of the other three men, Asad said. The ISI blamed the death of detainee Abdul Saboor, 29, on natural causes, but his mother said scars on his body prove the agency tortured and killed her son. ""He had so many marks on his body,"" Rohaifa Bibi said, pointing to numerous scars in a picture of her son's corpse. ""When they showed me the body, he was just skin and bones."" Saboor and his brothers made a living by printing Korans at a Lahore shop, Asad said. He said they were law-abiding but did acknowledge that all of the detainees were suspects in several militant attacks, though they were acquitted of the charges in 2010. A lawyer for the ISI told the Supreme Court that the spy agency did detain the men for further questioning but said they were set free. The ISI denies any role in the four deaths they have been ordered to explain. Human rights groups have documented ISI-sanctioned intimidation, torture, enforced disappearances, and killings. The Asian Human Rights Commission urged Pakistan's judiciary to prosecute those who are responsible for keeping the people under illegal custody. Otherwise, it said, the courts will be complicit.

"(CNN) -- Kei Nishikori became the first Japanese male to reach the quarterfinals of the Australian Open since 1932 when he held on to earn a shock five-set win over sixth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on Monday. Nishikori, ranked 26th in the world, blew a two-set lead before beating the Frenchman for the second time in his career, triumphing 2-6 6-2 6-1 3-6 6-3 in three and a half hours. The 22-year-old, who will next face world No. 4 Andy Murray, beat his previous best grand slam performance -- reaching the fourth round of the 2008 U.S. Open. He is the first Japanese male player to reach the last eight of one of the four majors since Shuzo Matsuoka at Wimbledon in 1995. ""This is the first quarterfinal for me,"" an exhausted Nishikori, told reporters after his second successive five-set match. ""I feel I'm stepping up. It was tough because he was still playing well in the fifth. I was having trouble with making returns. I started getting nervous ... But still I was playing aggressive on important points. I was making good serves. So that helped me to get the games."" Nishikori beat world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the Basel semis in October before losing to Roger Federer, having learned a lesson in his thrashing by Murray in the last four in Shanghai in his preceding tournament. ""He kind of destroyed me. But I have no pressure now. He's one of the players I have to play like him. I learn a lot of things from him. It's going to be tough, but I try to do my best tennis."" Nishikori said he hoped he could inspire Asian men's players, as China's Li Na did for the region's women last year by reaching the Australian Open final and then winning the French Open. ""It's an honor to make a lot of histories, to be the No. 1 player in Japan. But that never gives me pressure,"" said Nishikori, who is a graduate of the Nick Bollettieri academy in Florida which has produced many top players such as Andre Agassi, the Williams sisters and Maria Sharapova.. ""There's a lot of good players in Asia. But, yeah, I'm happy to get to the top from Asia, and hopefully I can be like Li Na for the men."" Fourth seed Murray, the runner-up in Melbourne for the last two years, was coasting 6-1 6-1 1-0 against Kazakhstan's Mikhail Kukushkin when the world No. 92 was forced to retire with a left hip flexor injury. ""I'll definitely be fresh for the next few rounds hopefully,"" said Murray, who has yet to win a first grand slam title despite reaching four finals. ""I just need to make sure I do the right things the next couple days to get ready for the quarters."" Top seed and defending champion Novak Djokovic survived a spirited third-set fightback from former world No. 1 and home-crowd favorite Lleyton Hewitt to seal a 6-1 6-3 4-6 6-3 triumph in the late match. Hewitt, granted a wildcard for the tournament after a long fitness struggle has seen him dropped to 181st in the rankings, showed glimpses of the form which took him to two grand slam titles. But Djokovic -- a four-time grand slam winner including three major titles in 2011 -- eventually proved too strong and the Serbian world No. 1 eventually saw off the 30-year-old Hewitt in just under three hours in a match that went past 1 a.m. local time. ""I played some loose points and got him back into the match. But credit to him as well for being competitive, for not giving up,"" Djokovic said. ""This is something you can expect from Lleyton who is very well-known for his fighting spirit. He had the crowd, he had the big support. It got intense. Especially the start of the fourth set we had some great rallies."" Fifth seed David Ferrer awaits Djokovic in the next round after the Spaniard eased to a 6-4 6-4 6-1 victory against French No. 17 Richard Gasquet. Seventh seed Tomas Berdych booked his place in the last eight with a four-set success against Spanish No. 10 Nicolas Almagro on Sunday, but the Czech was booed by the Hisense Arena crowd for refusing to shake his opponent's hand at the end of the match. It followed an incident in the fourth set where Berdych accused Almagro of purposefully aiming a volley at his face, with the ball striking him on the arm. ""Whoever has played the tennis knows that the court is pretty big, and you always have some space to put the ball in,"" said Berdych told reporters. ""And not even if you stand each other like three or four meters close to the guy, just try to hit it straight to your face, you know. I was just able and lucky to somehow fell down. ""I already take it as a past, it's just one thing that what happened from the side of Nico ... So I think if they want to look at it like that, then I think maybe we both did some mistake."" Berdych's last-eight opponent will be 2009 champion Rafael Nadal, the second seed who beat fellow Spaniard Feliciano Lopez 6-4 6-4 6-2.","Kei Nishikori becomes first Japanese man in 80 years to reach Australian Open last eight .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Ali Abdullah Saleh is no longer Yemen's president, but he is still wielding political clout as the head of the ruling party. Saleh has threatened to withdraw all members of his party from the national government and warned the prime minister he could face imprisonment. Protesters took to the streets in mass demonstrations over the past year, calling for Saleh's departure from office. He finally stepped down last month in exchange for immunity in part of a power transfer deal brokered by the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council. However, he remains president of the ruling General People's Congress party. Tension has escalated between Saleh and the new regime after new President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi said he was planning major reforms, said Yahya al-Arasi, Hadi's spokesman. Prime Minister Mohammed Saleh Basendowah recently attended a ceremony at Change Square in Sanaa and condemned the old regime's attacks against unarmed youth protesters. The square was the base of the protests that erupted last year against Saleh's rule. As a result, Saleh threatened to imprison Basendowah if he does not listen to his orders, a presidential aide who asked not to be named because of the sensitive nature of the issue. ""Saleh informed the prime minister to take orders from him or else he will take him to prison,"" the aide said. ""Saleh has not yet realized that he is not president and such actions will turn the country into chaos. Saleh must leave the country if the international community seeks to see a stable Yemen."" Saleh threatened to withdraw all members of his party from the national government to protest the way Hadi's administration is dealing with the political crisis in the country, embroiled in discord and violence. ""The former president is complicating matters and making it difficult for factions to go forward with reforms in Yemen,"" al-Arasi said. Hadi has taken precautionary measures, his spokesman said. He will announce the formation of a new unity government if Saleh orders his party officials to step down from their posts. Senior GPC officials told CNN that Saleh was angered at the president and prime minister's stances. ""Both men are trying to damage the image of the GPC leader. Saleh is still the president of the largest party in the country and must be treated with respect,"" said a senior GPC aide who asked to remain anonymous. But opposition parties condemned Saleh's verbal attacks on the prime minister. They called on Hadi to stand against Saleh and what they say are his efforts to ruin the country after he was forced out of power. Mohammed Qahtan, a senior opposition Joint Meeting Parties official, said it's sad that Saleh's GPC officials are remaining quiet about Saleh's maneuverings. ""We regret the fact that Saleh threatens the prime minister and his party leaders are quiet. The GPC have to choose between joining the government under President Hadi or standing with a person who lost all legitimacy to power in Yemen,"" Qahtan said.","Ali Abdullah Saleh still heads the ruling GPC party .
The new PM condemned the old regime's attacks against young people .
There have been tensions between Saleh and the new president ."
"(EW.com) -- [Spoiler Alert: Plot points for The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, book and movie, are discussed here.] . Fans of Stieg Larsson's original novel may have noticed that David Fincher's adaptation of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" made a few changes to the story, although more in terms of what was left out than what was stuck in. That's because any adaptation of a book of this length is going to need a bit of streamlining unless you want to opt for the recent trend of Hollywood mitosis that's splitting everything up into an infinite series of Part 1s and Part 2s. Fincher estimates that about 350 pages had to go in order to get the story down to watchable movie length, and according to screenwriter Steven Zaillian, much of that was in the very beginning. 'Magic Mike': Peek at male-stripper movie . ""I think there were probably about a hundred pages setting everything up,"" Zaillian tells EW, ""in terms of Blomkvist and his situation. There's probably another 50 or 60 pages of [Larsson] doing the same thing with Salander. Those things obviously had to go."" One of the few subplots to get dropped entirely was Blomkvist's romantic liaison with Cecilia Vanger, one of the more amiable of the clan he is investigating, which the filmmakers skipped for both time and to tone down the emphasis on the protagonist's philandering. ""Mikael had a relationship with her that went on for a lot of pages,"" laughs Zaillian. ""I'm a fan of the book -- I like it very much -- but when I was reading it at a certain point I thought, am I reading Shampoo? Is this Warren Beatty or is this Mikael Blomkvist? I didn't drop those things in order to make him more sympathetic. It was really just that they were unnecessary to the story."" 'M: I 4' is box office champ: $26.5M . But probably the biggest change that readers will pick up on is in the ending, where two strands of the narrative have been fused into one. It's nothing too major, but when you're working with a novel as popular as this, everything becomes sacred text. ""I wasn't trying to do something different or trying to fix something,"" says Zaillian. ""I just thought it was a good idea. when I read the book, I thought, 'Why are we going so far afield for this mystery to be resolved? Might it be a little more interesting if it's solved a little closer to home?' That's all there was to it. I kind of felt it was right for the character."" See full article at EW.com.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Criticism of lax food safety standards at Chinese companies abounded on microblogging sites in China on Tuesday following the latest scare involving dairy products in the country. Tests found that cartons of milk made by Mengniu Dairy Co., the largest Chinese dairy company, had excessive levels of aflatoxin M1, a substance that can cause liver cancer. The tests were carried out by the Chinese Administration of Quality Supervision in an inspection of nationwide milk products on Saturday. The toxin came from contaminated feed consumed by the cows that produced the milk, China's official news agency, Xinhua, reported. The milk cartons did not make it to market but remained in storage during the inspection, according to a statement from the company on Sunday. Mengniu said that it had destroyed all the toxic milk as it sought to reassure consumers on its commitment to product safety. Mengniu ""once again would like to sincerely apologize to all consumers,"" said the statement. ""We should earnestly learn from this lesson and comply with state and company quality and inspection standards with precision and care, making sure our product quality from every sector is approved in the future."" Users commenting on Chinese social media sites offered scathing opinions about the management of Chinese companies following Mengniu's admission of problems. ""Businesses in China are destroyed by Chinese businessmen themselves,"" said one user on Sina Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. ""Don't ever blame us on buying foreign goods."" ""If I have a baby one day, I will also buy safer milk powder produced overseas,"" the user wrote Tuesday. ""Let us boycott Mengniu altogether, show the shameless businessmen our strength."" said a posting by another user. Food safety scandals have blighted the dairy industry in China since 2008, when melamine-tainted milk killed at least six babies and caused kidney stones and urinary tract problems in hundreds of thousands of children. Twenty-one people were tried and sentenced for their roles in the scandal, and two of them were executed. In April, the police in Southwestern China seized more than 26 tons of melamine-tainted milk intended for use in ice cream, according to local officials. Journalist Xiaoyu Luo contributed to this report.","The Chinese dairy company 'sincerely' apologizes to customers for the problems .

"(EW.com) -- And then there were (probably) two. Multiple reports have surfaced on the web today that filmmakers Francis Lawrence and Bennett Miller are the final two contenders for the director of ""The Hunger Games"" sequel ""Catching Fire."" (The Los Angeles Times appears to have first broke the story.) The choice for the replacement of ""Hunger Games'"" Gary Ross -- who bowed out of the ""Catching Fire"" gig last week, citing the tight production schedule -- are pretty stark. Lawrence has extensive experience with visual effects-driven action sequences from his first two films, 2005â€²s supernatural thriller ""Constantine"" and 2007â€²s post-apocalyptic thriller ""I Am Legend"" -- which shares a similarly bleak tone to ""Catching Fire."" But his latest effort, the 2011 period drama ""Water for Elephants,"" fizzled at the box office, and landed mixed reviews for its handling of the star-crossed romance between Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon. Many complained that the weakest part of ""Hunger Games"" was the romance between Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence, no relation), and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), and the romantic angle is far more front-and-center for ""Catching Fire."" Miller, by contrast, has practically no first-hand experience with CG-effects-heavy action scenes, and ""Catching Fire"" features more exotic locations that would likely call for extensive green-screen and effects work. Miller does, however, have an Academy Award nomination to his name for his debut feature, the 2005 biopic ""Capote,"" and last year's ""Moneyball"" won Miller wide acclaim. He could bring an actor-friendly pedigree to the franchise, and it would certainly be a high-profile boost to his career trajectory. But Miller has another film, the true-life drama ""Foxcatcher,"" that's aiming to start production this fall, with Steve Carell and Channing Tatum attached and Mark Ruffalo in talks to join. That project would almost certainly need to be put on hold; it seems unlikely that Lionsgate would be willing to delay production on ""Catching Fire"" until after Jennifer Lawrence finished shooting the ""X-Men: First Class"" sequel next spring, especially since they didn't do it for Ross. Lionsgate reportedly may have their decision made by the end of this week. A rep for the studio declined to comment when reached by EW. See the full article at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- It started out as a typical spat between a mother and child, the kind parents and kids around the world have thousands of times every day: Holger Kragh wanted to take his coat off during a walk in the woods. His mother wouldn't let him. The 3-year-old stormed off -- and vanished. The little boy and his mother were on a field trip Sunday morning with other children and teachers in northwest Denmark. When Holger was still missing at lunchtime, his parents called the police, sparking an intensive search. Police, dog patrols, the military and emergency services scrambled to find the boy. As news of his disappearance spread, hundreds of members of the public also fanned out to help search the area, Tranum Klitplantage, in north Jutland. Police got an unprecedented number of calls offering assistance, commissioner Poul Badsberg of North Jutland police told CNN. In the end, they even sent out an ice cream truck, hoping that Holger would hear its bells and follow the sound. But as night fell Sunday, as temperatures dropped to near freezing and rain began to fall, there was no sign of him. The search continued Monday morning, a bright clear day -- and then the news broke, in the form of a shout as CNN affiliate TV2 was broadcasting live. ""Ja!"" comes the roar from just off-screen. The camera swings to find police team leader Flemming Bruun Jacobsen pumping a fist in the air, his other hand holding a phone to his ear. ""They found him?"" reporter Cathrine Reinert asks, though it couldn't be clearer from Jacobsen's face what he's been told. ""They found him!"" the policeman shouts back. ""Where?"" Reinert asks as he puts his phone down. ""I don't know yet. We're sending a police car to get him,"" Jacobsen says with a grin. Then, unable to contain himself, he raises both fists and erupts once again: ""Yes!"" The boy was found by a member of the public on horseback 4 to 5 kilometers (2.5 to 3 miles) from the place where he was last seen, Badsberg said. He was in good health and good spirits, the police commissioner said. Holger was reunited with his weeping parents, and his mother, Heidi Kragh, carried the tired, slightly bewildered-looking boy into an ambulance to be taken to a hospital for precautionary tests. For the record, he was wearing his coat. CNN's Collin Vanbuskirk contributed to this report .","Holger Kragh, 3, argues with his mother on a trip and storms off .

"Magdalena, Colombia (CNN) -- To the unaccustomed eye, a man toting 120 books while riding a stubborn donkey would seem nothing short of a circus spectacle. But for hundreds of children in the rural villages of Colombia, Luis Soriano is far from a clown. He is a man with a mission to save rural children from illiteracy. ""There was a time when many people thought that I was going crazy,"" said Soriano, a native of La Gloria, Colombia. ""They'd yell, 'Carnival season is over.' ... Now I've overcome that."" Soriano, 38, is a primary school teacher who spends his free time operating a ""biblioburro,"" a mobile library on donkeys that offers reading education for hundreds of children living in what he describes as ""abandoned regions"" in the Colombian state of Magdalena. ""In [rural] regions, a child must walk or ride a donkey for up to 40 minutes to reach the closest schools,"" Soriano said. ""The children have very few opportunities to go to secondary school. ...There are [few] teachers that would like to teach in the countryside."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes . At the start of his 17-year teaching career, Soriano realized that some students were having difficulty not just learning, but finishing their homework assignments. Most of the students falling behind lived in rural villages, where illiterate parents and lack of access to books prevented them from completing their studies. To help bridge the learning gap, Soriano decided to personally bring books to the children. ""I saw two unemployed donkeys at home and had the idea [to use] them in my biblioburro project because they can carry a heavy load,"" Soriano said. ""I put the books on their backs in saddles and they became my work tools."" Every Wednesday at dusk and every Saturday at dawn, Soriano leaves his wife and three young children to travel to select villages -- up to four hours each way -- aboard a donkey named Alfa. A second donkey, Beto, follows behind, toting additional books and a sitting blanket. They visit 15 villages on a rotating basis. ""It's not easy to travel through the valleys,"" Soriano said. ""You sit on a donkey for five or eight hours, you get very tired. It's a satisfaction to arrive to your destination."" At each village, some 40-50 youngsters await their chance to get homework help, learn to read or listen to any variety of tall tales, adventure stories and geography lessons Soriano has prepared. ""You can just see that the kids are excited when they see the biblioburro coming this way. It makes them happy that he continues to come,"" said Dairo Holguin, 34, whose two children take part in the program. ""For us, his program complements what the children learn in school. The books they do not have access to ... they get from the biblioburro."" More than 4,000 youngsters have benefited from Soriano's program since it began in 1990. Soriano says countless others have been helped, too; parents and other adult learners often participate in the lessons. Soriano has spent nearly 4,000 hours riding his donkeys, and he's not traveled unscathed. In July 2008, he fractured his leg when he fell from one of the donkeys; in 2006, he was pounced on by bandits at a river crossing and tied to a tree when they found out he had no money. Despite these injuries, which left him with a limp, Soriano has no intention of slowing down. In addition to the biblioburro program, he and his wife built the largest free library in Magdalena next to their home. The library has 4,200 books, most of which are donated -- some from as far away as New York City. They also run a small community restaurant. Soriano's hope is that people will understand the power of reading and that communities can improve from being exposed to books and diverse ideas. ""For us teachers, it's an educational triumph, and for the parents [it's] a great satisfaction when a child learns how to read. That's how a community changes and the child becomes a good citizen and a useful person,"" Soriano said. ""Literature is how we connect them with the world."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- It was 1985. Belting out the words to Whitney Houston's ""The Greatest Love of All,"" a 14-year-old girl in Dallas, Texas, stood in front of her bathroom mirror, believing the song's message of strength and self-worth. ""This was daily,"" says Deon Q. Sanders, 40, who now lives in Grand Prairie, Texas, and continues to sing Houston's music at weddings and other events. She laughs when she remembers her early obsession. ""I can remember my mom screaming, 'Would you please hush!'"" There was something about Houston's music that made children and teenagers want to learn the words and dance along. You didn't have to know anything about the singer's personal life to be inspired by the music. In the days after Houston was found dead in a Beverly Hills hotel, childhood fans reminisced on CNN iReport about the singer who provided the soundtrack to their young lives. Her funeral is Saturday in Newark, New Jersey. Fans remember Whitney Houston at the Newark, New Jersey, church where she grew up . Whitney Houston's self-titled debut album generated three No. 1 singles -- ""Saving All My Love for You,"" ""How Will I Know"" and ""Greatest Love of All."" Her second, ""Whitney,"" came out two years later in 1987 with chart-topping singles ""I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me),"" ""Didn't We Almost Have It All,"" ""So Emotional"" and ""Where Do Broken Hearts Go."" Houston would later struggle with drug addiction, health problems and a rocky marriage to Bobby Brown. But iReporters remember her at her prime. The ""Whitney Houston"" cassette was often playing when Cory Surovek's mom picked him up from school in her gold Mercedes Benz. Surovek, now 29 and an architect in Los Angeles, says ""How Will I know"" would come on, and he and his mother would lip sync and dance in their seats. ""Whitney's voice wailed over our conversations of my day in class and often provided the soundtrack of our impromptu dance parties at any given stoplight,"" Surovek wrote in his iReport. Houston's music was ""essential to the earliest memories that I have of me being 'me,' with my mom, in that Benz, dancing, laughing, singing, loving."" Dana Brenklin, then 9 years old and an aspiring singer, knew she had found her vocal role model when she first heard Houston singing ""You Give Good Love"" on the radio. ""She was just singing and singing and then she got to the bridge and she just soared, and I was like, 'Oh my god, who is this person?'"" says Brenklin, 36, who has won several singing contests with Houston numbers. ""When you saw her on TV, she looked kind, she looked nice, she looked pretty and she seemed happy and bubbly. You see her, and you hear this and you just want to take the ride with her."" Brenklin was in the studio audience a couple of years later when Houston taped the video for ""Celebrate New Life"" by BeBe & CeCe Winans. Brenklin's memories of seeing Houston are hazy, but she still remembers ""how nice she was and how pretty she was"" in person. To Tessa Jackson, a black teenager at a predominantly white high school, Houston was a style icon -- ""as beautiful as she was talented."" Jackson, who lives in New Orleans, Louisiana, remembers when the video for ""You Give Good Love"" first aired on MTV. ""I sat mesmerized in front of the TV watching her. She made me and other girls like me feel like we didn't have to be blonde and blue-eyed to be beautiful and admired,"" Jackson wrote. ""I wish she knew how much she did for my and my friends' self-esteem."" Houston's music appealed to children of all races, financial circumstances and family situations. Maurice Daniel was a boy in Detroit, Michigan, trying to stay on the right path, and his middle school principal ended each morning's announcements with ""Greatest Love of All."" The song's inspirational message, and the powerful voice that delivered it, made an impact. ""There was a lot of crime and a lot of negative things ... I would cling to anything that would give me some type of inspiration because I didn't want to live what I was seeing,"" Daniel wrote. ""It would stay in my head all day. It inspired me to [do] right and I have been doing right to this day at age 35."" Daniel now works with the youngest children at a juvenile detention center in Detroit, putting the words of the song into practice: . ""I believe the children are our future, . Teach them well and let them lead the way . Show them all the beauty they possess inside..."" ""That song motivated me,"" Daniel says. ""There's not too many songs out there right now that are doing any type of motivation."" Kristen Parker's two daughters were babies when Houston's music hit the charts, but it played a big part in playtime. The girls and their mom would sing into hairbrushes and dance on the bed while the music blasted. Years later, Houston's voice offered a bright moment in the family's darkest time. Parker's younger daughter, Ashley, was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2004. After a year in the hospital, when there was nothing more they could do, Ashley's sister and her friends brought Houston's CDs to New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Nearly 40 children, ranging from 5 to 19 years old, danced around the pediatrics floor to ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody."" ""[Houston] had no idea the smiles she had put on these poor sick children's faces,"" Parker wrote. ""Not one of those poor babies of ours survived their battle. ... I know not any of us parents will forget, although it was only minutes, the smiles of our children dancing for the last time to Whitney's amazing voice."" Parker says she will hold that memory with her forever.","Childhood fans of Whitney Houston reminisce .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- In Tripoli, ""no guns"" signs outnumber ones that say, ""no smoking."" Khadija Teri made that telling observation in her blog a few days back. She witnessed men drawing weapons while arguing on the street. ""Seeing men shouting, waving guns and pointing them at each other just because of a silly argument is frightening,"" she wrote. A year after the start of the Libyan revolution, human rights groups describe a nation of lawless militias who commit crimes with impunity and threaten to destabilize the nation by hindering efforts to rebuild. Amnesty International said abuses committed by militias amount to war crimes and the monitoring group called on Libyan authorities to rein them in. Otherwise, Amnesty said, the risks Libyans took to demand justice in their homeland, could end up being in vain. A year ago, Libyans dared to take to the streets of Benghazi, their simmering anger heated to a boil by the arrest of human rights lawyer Fathi Terbil. As many as 2,000 protesters gathered outside of government offices. They chanted slogans against Moammar Gadhafi, the man who had ruled them with a firm grip for four decades. It was unimaginable then that he could ever be ousted from power. But the Libyans persisted, inspired by their neighbors to the east and west. They called for a ""Day of Rage"" on February 17. After that, the protests intensified and spread and eight long months later, after brutal fighting and a NATO air campaign, Gadhafi was defeated. This week, Libyans could hardly believe a year has passed by. Since October, when Gadhafi was captured and killed, many aspects of life seem normal. But in important ways, Libya has foundered. Perhaps the nation is no different than any other that is recovering from trauma and massive upheaval. Frustration is palpable on the streets, as is an unease about what the future might hold. As Libyans prepare to celebrate their freedom, revolutionary fighters in the capital are on high alert and additional checkpoints have sprouted everywhere. Ordinary Libyans cling to the optimism that blossomed with the first protests in Benghazi last February. Building a nation after four decades of tyranny is no easy task, they say. At the main plaza that Gadhafi called Green Square (it's now known as Martyr's Square), revolutionary music blares from cars. But many still fear former regime loyalists might try to disrupt anniversary celebrations or somehow still destroy the new Libya. In recent days, text messages have circulated among former regime loyalists calling for their own uprising to ""liberate (Tripoli) from the NATO revolution."" Videos by what is being self described as the Libyan ""resistance"" have also emerged on social media sites. Only 17% of Libyans feel people can be trusted, found an Oxford Research International poll, touted as the first national survey of Libya and startling in some of its revelations. Consider that only 29% of Libyans said they would prefer to live in a democracy; 35% said they would still prefer rule by a strong leader. And 16% of the 2,000 Libyans surveyed were ready to resort to violence for political ends. That means 630,000 people are potential fighters, in addition to the 280,000 people who previously picked up a gun. The revolutionary militias on the streets call themselves their nation's heroes. They are the ones who drove out Gadhafi, after all. They insist on retaining arms to protect their revolution, especially given that military and police presence is virtually nonexistent. Mohammed, 28, says Libya's government is weak; its defenses not strong enough. The nation needs a government that can quickly integrate revolutionary factions under one umbrella; one that can activate a functioning judiciary. Recruit a national army, he says. Without strong national reconciliation measures, Mohammed fears that Libya will risk civil war. ""I am hoping for the best every day,"" he says. But he worries. And is not alone in his fears. Criticism has been rising of the National Transitional Council and the performance of the interim government. Many Libyans say they are frustrated with the slow pace of rebuilding, not unusual for a nation almost starting from scratch. But the question is will the Libyan government be able to maintain confidence of its people? Other Libyans decry the lack of transparency in decision-making and the government's inability to impose authority over the the militias. Tripoli residents complain of daily cuts in electricity and an ill-equipped health care system. Some of that frustration has surfaced very publicly. Last month angry protesters stormed the NTC headquarters in Benghazi and the deputy head of the council, Abdulhafidh Ghoga resigned from his post amid the protests. Government officials argue that they have inherited a mess left behind from the four decades of Gadhafi rule. They have pleaded for patience. Anes AlSharif, the former spokesman for the Tripoli Military Council, an umbrella group of the armed factions in the capital, blames the current situation on the lack of leadership by the civilian authority. ""There is a feeling growing that the NTC is not doing enough towards driving this revolution from phase one to phase two in this transitional period,"" he says. Libyans have only to look at Egypt to see how prickly the revolutionary journey can be. ""It is a government with no real power and what it really needs is to have a partnership with the guys who are on the ground and make them a part of this state,"" AlSharif says. Voters are set to go to the polls at the end of June to pick a national assembly that will be tasked with drafting a constitution. The goal before was to get rid of Gadhafi. Now, Libya's leaders will have to unify the nation with new goals -- ones that respect the enormous sacrifices of the Libyan people, AlSharif says. ""We need to be faithful to their sacrifices to our country and to ... remember the goal of this revolution was not one to get rid of the Gadhafi regime and to create chaos,"" he says. ""This would be a disaster, an ultimate betrayal to our guys who fell in the fight for freedom and to establish an advanced modern state."" The objectives may seem lofty at times, but Friday, Libyans are taking stock in what they have already gained. ""We never believed that this revolution will come and now it's a reality so we feel like we are in a dream,"" says Minister of Planning Essa Tuwegiart. Journalist Ramadan Jarbou, however, knows it's very real. He no longer has to dote on each word, consider its consequences. No one bothers him after he publishes an article. The Benghazi writer erupts in stinging statements about Gadhafi's neglect of Libya. ""I can express myself,"" he says. And that, he says, was why the revolution was worth it. Jomana Karadsheh reported from Tripoli and Moni Basu, from Atlanta.","Tensions are high on the first anniversary of Libya's revolution .
Human rights groups warn that armed militias threaten Libya's stability .

"Singapore (CNN) -- A Singapore court ruled Friday that four people can be extradited to the United States to face conspiracy charges after electronic components from a U.S. company were smuggled to Iran and ended up in explosives in Iraq. The case is part of an effort by the U.S. to link Iran with attacks on its forces in Iraq. The four Singaporeans -- three men and a woman -- were arrested in late October. They contested the extradition proceedings, and have 15 days to appeal. U.S. authorities indicted them, as well as an Iranian citizen, on charges of funneling thousands of radio frequency modules from the United States to Iran. The Iranian citizen, Hossein Larijani, remained at large at the time of the indictment. The United States alleges that 16 of the radio frequency modules were later found in improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Iraq that had not detonated. The explosive devices are often the weapon of choice for militants in Iraq, who regularly used them to attack U.S. and coalition convoys. David Adelman, the U.S. ambassador to Singapore, welcomed the ruling. ""This ruling reflects the strong spirit of cooperation between the United States and Singapore in combating transnational crime, including the illicit trade in arms and equipment that can pose significant threats to the United States and the international community,"" Adelman said in a statement. Following the court's decision Friday, two of the Singaporeans -- Lisingm Yong Nam and Wong Yuh Lan, the female suspect -- will be extradited to be charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States in relation to the radio frequency modules. The other two -- Lim Kow Seng and Hia Soo Gan Benson -- will be sent to the United States to be charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States regarding the smuggling of dozens of military antennas, like those used on military aircraft and ships, from the United States to Hong Kong. Lim Yong Nam, Lim Kow Seng and Hia plan to appeal, their lawyer said. Wong's lawyer said he needed to talk to his client before saying whether she would appeal. In making a decision on the extradition, the judge, Chia Wee Kiat, weighed the evidence provided by the U.S. indictment, citing emails, documents and affidavits from the U.S. case. Chia said that if the alleged acts had indeed been committed, they would also be considered ""conspiracy and cheating under Singapore law."" He noted that the Singapore court's role in considering the extradition request had been ""to decide whether there is a prima facie case."" Chia said that ""the task of resolving doubt and weighing the evidence should be left to the trial judge."" The U.S. indictment alleges that the Singaporeans conspired to buy 6,000 radio frequency modules from an unidentified company in Minnesota and ship them through Singapore to Larijani in Iran. The United States has in the past noted that Singapore -- a major global transshipment port -- needs to tighten its export controls, in particular of so-called ""dual use"" items, which can have both a civilian and military purpose . In this case, the radio frequency modules from the U.S. company have various commercial applications, including wireless local area networks to connect printers and computers in offices. The United States says that radio frequency modules from the same U.S. company were recovered in 2008 and 2009 by coalition forces in Iraq as part of remote detonation systems for improvised explosive devices. Prosecutors allege that the defendants told the Minnesota company that Singapore was the final destination for the components they were buying and also filed false paperwork with the U.S. government, saying the parts would be used in a Singapore telecommunications project. The Singaporeans have been held without bail since their arrest, except Lim Yong Nam, who was released on bail on medical grounds. They will all remain in prison until their extradition, except Lim Yong Nam, the judge said Friday.","A Singapore judge says the four can be extradited .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The Los Angeles Unified School District board on Tuesday fired Miramonte Elementary School teacher Martin Bernard Springer just hours after he was formally charged with three felony counts of lewd acts upon a girl under age 14, a school spokesman said. Springer, 49, of Alhambra, California, has 30 days to appeal his firing, school spokesman Tom Waldman said. Springer pleaded not guilty late Tuesday afternoon in a Los Angeles County court to three felony counts of lewd acts on a child over three months in 2009. The judge set his bail at $300,000 on the condition that Springer stay more than 250 feet away from witnesses and alleged victims, stay more than 100 feet away from any school or facility with children and be with an adult supervisor when he's around children. Springer's preliminary hearing is scheduled for February 16. Springer was the second teacher at Miramonte charged with lewd conduct with pupils. Last week, former Miramonte teacher Mark Berndt, 61, was arrested and accused of taking bondage photos of more than two dozen students in his classroom, including some with suspected semen-filled spoons at their mouths. The school board fired Berndt a year ago; Berndt appealed but he dropped the appeal and resigned last spring, Waldman said. On Tuesday, the school board also fired a third teacher, music teacher Vance Miller at Hamilton High School, in the wake of unrelated allegations of sexual misconduct with students, Waldman said. Miller could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday. The school board unanimously approved the two latest firings during a closed session and announced its decisions publicly afterward, Waldman said. The three counts against Springer involve one girl who was identified only as ""Jane Doe"" and ""under the age of 14 years."" The complaint alleged the crimes occurred in April, May and June of 2009, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said. If convicted, Springer would face a maximum state prison term of 12 years, prosecutors said. Springer was arrested Friday and accused of fondling two girls in the classroom, but Tuesday's charges involve only one alleged victim. Berndt, who taught for 30 years, is being held in lieu of $23 million bail: $1 million for each of the 23 counts he faces of lewd acts on a child. When asked about the difference between Springer's $300,000 bail and Berndt's $23 million bail, spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said the charges against Berndt are more serious, involving bondage, for example. Meanwhile, students at Miramonte Elementary School will return to class later this week to a new staff, because administrators do not want any more ""surprises"" at the Los Angeles school that is at the center of two child abuse cases. The school will be closed Tuesday and Wednesday to ""take a break,"" said the Los Angeles Unified School system. The district is the nation's second largest. When classes resume Thursday, a new staff and social workers will be at hand to receive students, said District Superintendent John Deasy. ""I can't have any more surprises at Miramonte,"" Deasy told an auditorium packed with parents Monday night. ""And if there are more, then we'll have to deal with that."" Everyone from current custodians to teachers at Miramonte will be relocated indefinitely, school officials said. Staffers are expected to get special training, Deasy said. The Miramonte staff members are being relocated neither permanently nor temporarily to a new school, school officials said. It will be up to the district to decide in the future where they will be assigned, they said. Technically, they are still considered Miramonte employees. Staffers and students will be questioned as part of the ongoing criminal investigation. Parents will also be given the option of transferring their children to one of four elementary schools in the area. ""The actions we are taking are not a condemnation of the entire staff,"" Deasy said. The moves weren't enough to appease outraged parents, who are demanding additional safeguards for the students. ""We're saying enough is enough,"" community leader Morris Grifton said at a demonstration Monday. ""We want cameras in the classrooms, in the hallways and around the school."" Monday night, about 100 parents fumed outside the South Region High School No. 2 auditorium, unable to get into a meeting with the superintendent because it was over capacity. ""The school authorities should have planned this meeting correctly to allow everyone in,"" said one parent, Gustavo Morales. ""If there's not enough room in the auditorium, then they should have at least had it in the football field."" Parent Bessy Garcia, the mother of two children who were among Berndt's alleged victims, spoke of betrayal. ""He wasn't only a teacher. He was our personal friend,"" she said. ""He tricked us. We thought he was the best person in the world."" She described how she and her two children were having trouble sleeping, eating and functioning as they wrestled with last week's disclosures. ""It's been like hell,"" said another parent, Claudia Rivera. ""We're just trying to get some answers."" The investigation into Berndt began in October 2010, when a drugstore photo technician told police he found images of blindfolded children in a processing order. After an initial investigation, investigators notified school authorities, who removed Berndt from his classroom in January 2011. The developments come as the school district is dealing with another case of alleged lewd behavior, involving a janitor at another school. On Sunday, the mother of a student at Germain Elementary School reported ""inappropriate contact"" between the custodian and her child, a Los Angeles Police Department statement said. The man, Paul Adame, was arrested and charged with a felony, police said. He has been released on $100,000 bail. At Miramonte, officials hope the steps they are taking will help assure parents they're serious about ""a thorough, vigorous and fair investigation of all allegations"" ""The safety, welfare and education of students is our No. 1 priority,"" the teachers union, United Teachers Los Angeles, said in a statement Monday night. ""We know that the public understands that the vast majority of teachers are doing remarkable work every day to motivate and educate the children of Los Angeles."" The replacements at Miramonte will come from a pool of applicants, including former employees, said district spokesman Waldman. ""We have had a lot of layoffs and budget cuts here and will also look at recent retirees,"" he said. CNN's Jaqueline Hurtado, Greg Botelho, Antoinette Campbell, Greg Morrison, Tom Larson, Stella Chan, Alan Duke, Carma Hassan and Casey Wian contributed to this report.","NEW: Miramonte Elementary School teacher Martin Bernard Springer pleads not guilty .

"Hernando, Mississippi (CNN) -- The ""Reward"" sign being nailed above the convenience store counter takes on a little more meaning here in Desoto County, Mississippi. At the Old Road Store, it's personal. In 1992, this is where Joseph Ozment, the man whose photo is on the reward poster, gunned down a store clerk. He was sent to prison for life, and no one imagined they'd hear from him again. In this small town, south of Memphis, Tennessee, his picture is back up and people are wondering how someone who committed such a brutal crime could be pardoned by their former Gov. Haley Barbour -- and law enforcement authorities can't seem to find Ozment. ""It's just an every minute, constant, in the back of your mind, where is he, what is he doing?"" said Mary McAbee, the sister of Rick Montgomery, the store clerk shot to death by Ozment. ""I'm fearful. He's a cold-blooded murderer to do what he's done and if he thinks that he may go back to prison, what's he got to lose?"" she said. Mississippi authorities are looking for Ozment. He received one of more than 200 pardons issued by Barbour during his final days in office. Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood is challenging the validity of the pardons. He said Ozment and three other murderers did not meet the constitutional requirements to be granted a pardon, and he wants to see the men put back in jail to finish their life sentences. A Jackson, Mississippi, judge will hear the case next week. In the meantime, she has issued subpoenas, commanding all the men to appear in court, but Ozment has yet to be found to be served his subpoena. He was picked up by his mother on January 8 from the governor's mansion, where he was a trusty, serving his time. He hasn't been seen since. ""He's avoiding service. His mother knows it. All of his relatives know,"" Hood said. ""We've been to all of their houses knocking on doors. I know he's gotten the word and he's trying to run and avoid service,"" Hood said. Hood has announced that a reward is being offered for anyone who can help locate Ozment. Police can't arrest him because he has been pardoned, and he has committed no new crimes. If he does not comply with a subpoena, a judge has the authority to hold him in contempt, the attorney general's office said. Authorities said they believe Ozment may be in northern Mississippi. One of the men who worked the murder case in the early 1990s said the latest developments are incredibly troubling. ""Ozment already proved he can't live in our society, by our rules,"" said John Champion. ""He committed the ultimate act by taking somebody's life, so, no, he should never be out,"" he said. Champion was a young assistant district attorney working his very first case in the office. Today, he is the district attorney. He was there in court when Ozment pleaded guilty to murder in the case and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. According to a transcript of Ozment's confession to police, Ozment admitted being part of a robbery so he could have ""Christmas money."" He entered the convenience store with a friend who shot the clerk, Montgomery, three times. Montgomery crawled from around the counter and Ozment looked at him and shot him twice. ""I didn't want him to identify me or the other guy, so I shot him twice. ... I shot him in the head,"" Ozment said in the police confession. Ozment said his share in the robbery was ""between 50 and 60 dollars."" ""When he was shot, and he fell to the ground, they said he was begging for help. ... You can't imagine how that feels,"" said McAbee, Montgomery's sister, as she began to cry. ""And then for him to shoot him in the head ... to know that he was all alone. That's the worst feeling, to know that you can't help someone that you love,"" she said. Champion said he remembers the day well. He said he passes the convenience store every day on his way to work and remembers the brutality and cold-bloodedness of the crime. He said he never dreamed he'd see the day that Joseph Ozment walked free. ""All of the healing that's done over the last 18 years is all for naught. And all of the work that we did, all of the work that law enforcement did on this case, is all for naught. Why were we there?"" he asked about Barbour's pardon. Barbour has defended his pardons. On Friday, he appeared live on CNN's ""John King USA."" He told King that Ozment and the others have been rehabilitated. ""He has no obligation to do anything. He's been pardoned. He's a free man,"" said Barbour. But that's not the kind of thing a sister who lost a brother wants to hear. ""Its just the pain that we have to live with every day and now we're doing it all over again,"" she said. Kind of like the reward poster. No one ever dreamed they'd need one again.","Reward offered for information leading to Joseph Ozment .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Apple rolled out a high-definition iPad on Wednesday with a faster processor, a better camera and a display screen that promises to be dramatically sharper than the current model, the iPad 2. ""It is amazing,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said at a San Francisco unveiling. ""We've taken it to a whole new level, and we are redefining the category that Apple created with the original iPad."" The new 9.7-inch display screen will feature a ""retina display"" of 2047 by 1536 pixels, compared with the current model's 1024 by 768 pixels. To break it down, that's a total of 3.1 million pixels on the display screen. ""Your retina in your eye cannot discern those individual pixels,"" said Apple Senior Vice President Phil Schiller. ""The images on it look stunning."" The new iPad will be available in the United States and 9 other countries March 16 and cost the same as the iPad 2 -- from $499 to $829 based on storage capacity and Wi-Fi capacity. Pre-orders were opened at Apple's online store on Wednesday. The new version will be available in the U.S. on AT&T and Verizon and will be the first iPad to connect to 4G networks (a fact that, at least for now, remains academic in most cities). It also will go on sale Friday in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Switzerland, the UK and the U.S. Virgin Islands. ""This new iPad has the most wireless bands of any device that has ever shipped, and it is truly revolutionary,"" Schiller said. And the new iPad will be the first to run on 4G wireless networks, a source familiar with the device's specifications told CNNMoney on Wednesday. It will have a a 5-megapixel camera, representing a significant leap from the current iPad's so-so lens. Surprisingly, ""the new iPad"" was as close to a name as Apple gave the gadget Wednesday. Predictions had bounced back and forth between ""iPad 3"" and ""iPad HD"" before the event. But the announcement ended without an official name being announced. Whether that means Apple plans to abandon an iPhone-like naming routine (iPhone, iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S) in favor of occasional upgrades to ""the iPad"" remains to be seen. On Wednesday, Cook also announced an updated version of Apple TV, the company's Web-TV integration device that competes with products like Google TV, Roku and Boxee. The system supports 1080p, or ""Full HD"" high-definition video, up from the current model's 720p. It will be available for $99 starting next week and could pave the way for what's expected to be Apple's next project: a fully integrated high-definition television. ""Across the year, you're going to see a lot more of this kind of innovation,"" Cook teased at the end of Wednesday's event. ""We are just getting started."" When the iPad was introduced in early 2010, tablets already existed, but none had become popular with mainstream consumers. Some analysts wondered if there would be a market for a device that falls somewhere between a smartphone and a laptop but doesn't fully replace either. The answer was a resounding ""yes."" The company has sold more than 55 million iPads worldwide to date. Before his death in October, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs predicted that 2011 would be the ""year of the copycat"" in the tablet space. In large part, it was, and that was bad news for Apple's rivals, as competitors from HP to Samsung to Motorola tried unsuccessfully to offer a viable alternative to the iPad. The new iPad will arrive in a somewhat trickier landscape. By going smaller and simpler, Amazon made a splash with its Kindle Fire over the holidays, while rival bookseller Barnes & Noble countered with its popular Nook Tablet. Both devices start at $199. The new Acer Iconia A500 offers more memory than the iPad 2, while other companies have begun flooding the market with devices that are smaller and cheaper than Apple's standard-bearer. Just last week, Microsoft rolled out its Windows 8 operating system for tablets, suggesting that Windows-based tablets could be making a serious run. In a move perhaps designed as a shot at these rival upstarts, Cook announced Wednesday that the price on the iPad 2 will be slashed $100. So, a 16GB, Wi-Fi-only model will sell for $399, making it more competitive with the lower-end tablets. Apple surprised many observers last year when the iPad 2 was priced the same as the original iPad: ranging from $499 to $829, depending on 3G capability and storage capacity. Cook also announced Wednesday that the 25 billionth app has been downloaded from the App Store. Perhaps significantly, that app was downloaded in China.","NEW: Apple unveils a high-definition iPad .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- By busloads and by church flocks, volunteers throughout the country spent Saturday performing the noble task of cleaning up humanity's home -- planet Earth. ""The nation's largest community improvement movement,"" as the volunteer groups are known, got their hands dirty and feet wet as they cleaned walkways and waterways around the United States. Keep America Beautiful -- the nonprofit group that sponsored the Great American Cleanup ""National Day of Action"" -- organized trash-clearing activities in nearly all 50 states, as well as special large-scale events in 10 locales, including Los Angeles. In all, 10,000 volunteers were projected to participate. ""Oh my goodness. The volunteers, the energy, the enthusiasm. To watch the kids learn how to plant a tree was amazing to watch. It becomes theirs,"" said Gail Cunningham, senior vice president of Keep America Beautiful and managing director of the Great American Cleanup. ""It brought nature alive for the volunteers."" One of this year's spotlight sites was the namesake waterway of the nation's second largest city, the Los Angeles River. Saturday's activities coincided with the Friends of the Los Angeles River's 23rd La Gran Limpieza, which translates to The Great Cleanup. About 450 people, including 250 from a local Mormon church, collected 400 bags of trash -- including a king-size mattress, an animal skull, and a discarded wheelbarrow -- from one stretch of the river, said Shelly Backlar, the river group's executive director. Volunteers were bused to cleanup sites. ""People are saying they can't believe what they are finding,"" Backlar said. ""Everyone is smiling and really enjoying the river."" Added volunteer Judy Bloom, 48: ""I spent a couple of hours picking up several bags of trash and it was primarily plastic, about 90%. ""There was an element of surprised in respect to how much this is caused by littering,"" Bloom said. The other nine locales for the big-scale cleanups were Oakland, California; Cocoa, Florida; Indianapolis; Cobb County, Georgia; Hampton Roads, Virginia; Houston; Shreveport, Louisiana; Philadelphia; and Nashville. Tidying up the country isn't a matter of just ""waving a magic wand,"" said Cunningham. ""It's understanding each person can make a difference."" ""Each volunteer for one hour of work is worth $21.79, and we had 5.2 million volunteers last year"" during a period from March 1 to May 1, she added. ""The United States saved $113 million last year that would have otherwise paid government employees."" Last year's clean-up activities in 16,500 communities resulted in the removal of 177 million pounds of litter and debris; beautification of 177,000 acres of parks, public lands and open spaces; and planting of 166,000 trees and 1.5 million flowers and bulbs, according to Cunningham's group. Last year, Los Angeles' La Gran Limpieza collected 25 tons of trash from cigarette butts to ""river treasures,"" as Backlar put it, consisting of shopping carts, a hammock, a sleeping bag and a Barbie doll with dreadlocks. From coast-to-coast, groups were relying on the volunteer spirit of the millennial generation and college students. ""There is passion for engagement and volunteerism from the millennials. They are active. It's inspiring to see,"" said Cunningham. Christine Flowers, executive director of Keep California Beautiful, said Saturday's volunteer activities supplement state and local government efforts -- which cost taxpayers about $500 million a year -- to address illegal dumping and littering. ""When people get their hands dirty and get engaged, they care more for the environment and their community,"" Flowers said. ""Volunteers learn something new and it gives them passion and fire to better the environment.""","NEW: ""People are saying they can't believe what they are finding,"" leader says of trash cleanup .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki began her latest bid for a first grand slam title with a 6-2 6-1 win over Anastasia Rodionova on Monday, joining last year's finalists Kim Clijsters and Li Na in the second round of the Australian Open. Top seed Wozniacki looked in good shape as she wrapped up victory against the Russia-born Australian in 76 minutes, but the Dane admitted she was worried about a wrist injury she suffered during last week's quarterfinal defeat at the Sydney International. ""I was a bit nervous before the match. I didn't know exactly what to expect. But it feels better,"" the 21-year-old told the WTA Tour website. ""I'm very happy about the way I felt out there today. I got into the rhythm as the match went on tonight."" Who will be the 2012 Australian Open victors? Wozniacki will next play Georgia's 83rd-ranked Anna Tatishvili, who beat Australia's Ashleigh Barty 6-2 7-6 (7-4). Former No. 1 Clijsters made a strong start to the defense of her crown with a 7-5 6-1 defeat of Portuguese qualifier Maria Joao Koehler. The Belgian 11th seed, who will play France's world No. 98 Stephanie Foretz Gacon in the last 64, showed little sign of the hip injury which forced her out of the Brisbane International 10 days ago. ""I wanted to go out there and I wanted to start playing,"" the 28-year-old told the tournament's official website. ""I've had that ever since we came to Australia. ""I had a good off-season where we worked obviously to try to be in good shape for Australia, then you want to put that to the test and play those matches again."" Clijsters is on course for a fourth-round rematch with Chinese fifth seed Li, who eased through by beating Kazakhstan's world No. 40 Ksenia Pervak 6-3 6-1. Li, who became Asia's first grand slam singles champion with her French Open triumph last year, struggled to handle the intense heat on court but emerged victorious to set up a clash with Australia's 168th-ranked 20-year-old Olivia Rogowska. ""I was feeling at end of the first set really hot on the court.,"" she said. ""Also I was feeling no air. I couldn't breathe."" Third seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus is through after an impressive 6-1 6-0 victory over Heather Watson of Britain in the opening match of the tournament. The victory continued Azarenka's fine form coming into the tournament, having beaten Li in the final of the Sydney International on Friday. Her next opponent is Australia's Casey Dellacqua, who beat Serbia's Bojana Jovanovski 6-3 6-2. Eighth seed Agnieszka Radwanska, a quarterfinalist in 2011, came from behind to eliminate American Bethanie Mattek-Sands. The Pole's reward for a 6-7 (10-12) 6-4 6-2 success is a match with Argentine qualifier Paula Ormaechea, who claimed the first WTA Tour level match win of her career by beating 50th-ranked Romanian Simona Halep 6-1 3-6 7-5. Italian 10th seed Francesca Schiavone also booked her place in the next round. The 2010 French Open champion disposed of Spain's world No. 72 Laura Pous-Tio 6-1 6-3, and will next play Romina Oprandi. But their compatriot Flavia Pennetta made a shock early exit as the 19th seed lost 6-3 1-6 6-2 against Russian qualifier Nina Bratchikova. China's 16th seed Peng Shuai is safely through thanks to a 6-3 6-4 win against world No. 120 Aravane Rezai. Peng will next play the Czech Republic's Iveta Benesova, who beat Rezai's fellow Frenchwoman Mathilde Johansson 6-3 2-6 6-4. Former world No. 1 and 13th seed Jelena Jankovic progressed with a 6-2 6-0 demolition of Laura Robson, who was one of five British players to be eliminated in the men's and women's draws. American Christina McHale earned a surprise 6-2 6-4 win over Czech 24th seed and 2007 Australian Open quarterfinal Lucie Safarova. Belgian 28th seed Yanina Wickmayer, who won the the Hobart International title last week, lost 7-5 6-2 to Kazakhstan's 62nd-ranked Galina Voskoboeva. Spanish 26th seed Anabel Medina Garrigues went through 6-3 6-3 against Czech Eva Birnerova, while Slovakian 20th seed Daniela Hantuchova recovering from dropping the opening set to Uzbekistan-born American Varvara Lepchenko to win 4-6 6-3 6-2. German 22nd seed Julia Gorges also progressed along with Romania's No. 31 Monica Niculescu and Czech No. 32 Petra Cetkovska.","Top seed Caroline Wozniacki books her place in Australian Open second round .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer remain on course for a semifinal clash at the Australian Open after both men recorded straight sets victories in Melbourne on Sunday. Nadal, the 2009 champion, defeated fellow Spaniard Feliciano Lopez 6-4 6-4 6-2 while 16-time grand slam winner Federer breezed past Australian teenager Bernard Tomic 6-4 6-2 6-2. Federer, the world number three, will now face Juan Martin Del Potro after the Argentinean enjoyed a comfortable 6-4 6-2 6-1 victory over German Philipp Kohlschreiber. Nadal will meet Tomas Berdych in the last eight as the Czech overcame a tough encounter with Spanish tenth seed Nicolas Almagro to win 4-6 7-6 7-6 7-6. Federer rarely broke sweat against Tomic, breaking his opponent six times in a victory that took him just one hour and 44 minutes to record. He told reporters: ""Maybe the score suggested differently, but I thought we had a lot of long games, tough points, and I thought he did actually really well."" Federer will now face Del Potro -- the man who beat him in the 2009 U.S. Open final -- and the 30-year-old admitted he was in for a tough encounter. ""I think it's going to be a good match. I think he's coming back awfully strong again,"" Federer said ahead of his 1000th Tour match. ""I was sad to see that he was out for so long after his amazing year in 2009 and I thought he had a chance in 2010 to sort of make a run for world number one."" Del Potro looked in imperious form as he dismantled the unseeded Kohlschreiber. ""Roger is the best tennis player of the history, and of course he's the favorite,"" he said. ""I remember three years ago I played in the quarters against him and I only won three games. So if this time is something different and I win more games it is going to be OK for me."" Nadal enjoyed his 11th win against Lopez in 13 meetings and said he feels in better condition than the last two Australian Open tournaments, where injuries hampered his progress. ""I've started the tournament playing really well this time. I felt I've played well from the first match and today I played another complete match,"" Nadal said. ""Now I'm in the quarter-finals. I am doing the right things. I am in the right place, right moment."" There was controversy in Berdych's win as the Czech refused to shake hands with Almagro at the end of the game after claiming his opponent had deliberately hit the ball at him. Berdych was booed off by the Melbourne crowd after he had to rely on three tiebreak wins to progress into the quarters. He claimed Alamgro targeted him as they rallied at the net. ""Probably whoever has played tennis knows that the court is pretty big, and you always have some space to put the ball in,"" he told reporters. ""He should play the ball differently. That's it. ""I think maybe we both did some mistakes. So it's even, and that's it,"" he said. ""We don't have any problems at all,"" Monday's action sees number one seed Novak Djokovic take on home favorite Lleyton Hewitt while British fourth seed Andy Murray takes on unseeded Mikhail Kukushkin from Kazakhstan.

"(CNN) -- A Norwegian court concluded Monday that Anders Behring Breivik -- the man charged with killing 77 people last July, an attack he claimed merited a medal of honor -- can legally be kept in custody until his trial starts in April, according to court documents. The court acknowledged that Breivik's mental health remains an issue, noting that he may not be able to get the maximum possible punishment for the crimes if he's deemed insane. Even so, the court found legal basis to keep him in custody for the next two months because prosecutors have said that if Breivik is found insane, they will push for him to be confined to a mental health facility, court documents state. Breivik is accused of killing eight people in a bomb attack in Oslo and 69 more in a gun rampage on nearby Utoya Island on July 22. It was the deadliest attack on Norwegian soil since World War II. The latter victims were among 700 mostly young people attending a Labour Party camp on the island. He has pleaded not guilty, though he has admitted carrying out the attacks, the judge handling his case said previously. In November, prosecutors said psychiatrists had determined Breivik was paranoid and schizophrenic at the time of the attacks and during 13 interviews experts conducted with him afterward. Judge Wenche Elizabeth Arntzen told reporters in January that the court requested a second opinion because of the importance of the question of his sanity to Breivik's trial. Arizona shooting suspect Loughner to continue receiving treatment . Two new psychiatrists were subsequently assigned to carry out the evaluation, court spokesman Geir Engebretsen said. Breivik reiterated some of his extremist views during Monday's court hearing, which began with him entering with a smile and offering up a raised, clenched-fist salute in solidarity. Confirming accounts posed to him by Norwegian reporters, his lawyer, Geir Lippestad, said Breivik said he did not accept the legitimacy of the presiding judge because he didn't believe in the multicultural Norway that the judicial system is part of. The lawyer's back-and-forth with reporters was captured by Norwegian media, including national broadcaster NRK. Breivik further claimed the shooting rampage was a matter of self-defense, meant to save Norway from being taken over by multicultural forces and prevent ethnic cleansing of Norwegians, according to Lippestad. Rather than punishment, Breivik said he deserved a medal of honor, a statement that prompted derisive laughs from victims and relatives of those killed on Utoya Island. He also said nobody could believe that he was insane, describing questions about his mental makeup as ridiculous, Lippestad confirmed. Scheduled to begin April 16, Breivik's trial is expected to last 10 weeks. Authorities have described him as a right-wing Christian extremist. A 1,500-page manifesto attributed to Breivik posted on the Internet is critical of Muslim immigration and European liberalism, including Norway's Labour Party. The manifesto predicts that a ""European civil war"" will lead to the execution of ""cultural Marxists"" and the banishment of Muslims. Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said in the aftermath of the attacks that his country had been fundamentally changed, but vowed that Norway would remain ""an open society."" Journalist Olav Mellingsaeter in Oslo contributed to this report.","Anders Behring Breivik will remain in Norwegian custody until April, a court rules .

"(CNN) -- Remember the name: Joao Moreira. You may not have heard of him yet, but you soon will. Since arriving at Kranji nearly three years ago, the Brazilian has quickly become Singapore's top jockey. It's a long way from Sao Paulo, where the 27-year-old struggled when he started his apprenticeship. ""My first six months were really bad because I didn't have any experience,"" Moreira told CNN. ""(My first trainer) gave me a ride on a filly and I didn't really have control of her in the race. He said to me, 'Joao, you should look for another job because you don't have the skill to be riding horses.' ""That broke my heart. But I continued to work for him and when he saw I wasn't going to leave he started giving me advice and really helped me. After that he started giving me more opportunities, including my first Group winner. He was very important in my life and I will always appreciate that."" So what was the advice that his trainer gave him? ""Riding horses is not that difficult, but riding horses in races is really difficult. Not only do you have to have balance and skill, but you are riding against other jockeys,"" Moreira said. ""You are trying to beat them, but how? You must try to be the smartest one in the race. Really know when to make your move. Study the handicaps to see which horse is going to lead."" The advice certainly seems to have done the trick. Moreira recently rode his 100th winner for the second consecutive season. But there is one prize in Singaporean racing that still eludes him: the Gold Cup. ""I haven't had a winner in the Cup yet, so you could say it is my dream. The horse I'm riding (Martial Art) has got a chance so I'm just hoping."" What will be his strategy on Sunday? ""My horse will probably be somewhere in the middle of the field or a little bit further behind,"" he said. ""I want to be as close as possible to the fence and give my horse every chance. The distance is quite long (2,200 meters) so there's time, but you don't want to get caught wide at the first bend."" Whether or not Moreira captures his first Gold Cup on Sunday, it seems that the jockey already has one eye on his next career move. He is certainly not short of offers. Australia beckons -- he has already enjoyed success there this season and is a popular figure Down Under, where he is nicknamed ""Super Joe."" Hong Kong has also been floated as a possible next step. His fellow jockeys at Kranji are full of praise for the charismatic Brazilian. ""This guy has got a bright future,"" says veteran rider V. Sivan. ""He's young, talented and he's gifted. Singapore is a good first step for him."" Moreira is keeping his options open: ""Nobody knows yet, not even myself!""","Joao Moreira seeking to win Singapore Gold Cup for the first time on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Russia have a 2-0 lead after the opening singles' matches of their Fed Cup first round tie against Spain. Both Maria Sharapova and Svetlana Kuznetsova cruised to straight-sets victories against Silvia Soler-Espinosa and Carla Suarez Navarro respectively. Sharapova dropped just three games as she powered to a 6-2 6-1 victory, while Kuznetsova won almost as convincingly 6-3 6-1. ""It was a little tough at the beginning and I felt a bit nervous as I didn't play so well last year and I really wanted to change that result and I really concentrated on my game even despite the fact that I didn't know that much about my opponent,"" Sharapova said, FedCup.com reported. The tie between Ukraine and Italy is all-square thanks to a stunning 6-1 6-2 win for Lesia Tsurenko over Francesca Schiavone in Biella, Italy. The Ukrainian, ranked more than 100 places below the 2010 French Open champion, ran out at easy winner despite the Italian's home soil advantage. Earlier, Sara Errani had put Italy head with a comfortable 6-2 6-3 victory over Kateryna Bondarenko to give the 2010 Fed Cup champions a 1-0 lead.

"(CNN) -- Nineteen races and 19 wins. After yet another demonstration of her superiority over five furlongs (1,000 meters), there are few superlatives left to describe the extraordinary record of five-year-old Australian mare Black Caviar. Unusually for the world's top-rated sprinter, she was made to work for her victory, with long-time rival Hay List sticking firmly to her flank at the furlong marker. But after a flick of the whip from jockey Luke Nolen, Black Caviar found another gear and pulled away from the field to win the Lightning Stakes at Flemington by one-and-three quarter lengths in front of an ecstatic crowd of 22,800. Royal approval: Will unbeatable Black Caviar grace Ascot? ""He had me a bit worried for a couple of strides -- I was a little concerned,"" said Nolen of Hay List. Saturday's win was Black Caviar's ninth Group One success and the second time the Peter Moody-trained bay has captured Australia's premier sprint race, which is also the first leg in the Global Sprint Challenge. It also came after she made her debut over seven furlongs (1,400 meters) in the Orr Stakes at Caulfield the previous weekend. Black Caviar's incredible run puts her equal with Desert Gold (1915 - 1917) and Gloaming (1919 - 1921) for consecutive victories on top-class Australian tracks (other horses have won more consecutive races on low-grade country tracks), although she is the only horse to win 19 without defeat. She is currently ranked joint-second on the all-time undefeated list; although the run of 54 wins without reply put together by 19th century Hungarian horse Kincsem may yet prove unassailable, even for Black Caviar. But Australia's favorite racehorse may have run her last race on home soil, for the time being at least, with her trainer conceding that Dubai may well be her next stop en route to the Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot in June -- the target for her connections. ""I'll sit down with the owners, but if she goes to Dubai she has probably run her last race in Australia this prep,"" said Moody. If, as is widely expected, the lure of Dubai's $2 million Golden Shaheen proves too great a temptation to resist (there is a $600,000 bonus offered as part of the Global Sprint Challenge, rising to $1 million if she can win on three continents), it will mean Black Caviar's 20th race could be her toughest yet, pitting her against Sheikh Mohammed's super colt Sepoy. It throws up an additional challenge as the race is run over six furlongs (1,200 meters) on a synthetic all-weather track, rather than Black Caviar's preferred turf. A decision on Dubai is expected to be made in the coming weeks, with Moody having already revealed that Black Caviar has had all her vaccinations for both the Middle East and England. ""There is 10 weeks in between the two races, so that presents a few problems, but I am familiar with the logistics of it all and it's an option we are thinking about. She'd already had all her vaccinations for the trip to England, so that wouldn't be a concern if she was to go to Dubai.'' Number 20 proved a race too far for Black Caviar's spiritual predecessor Zenyatta, the American race mare who was the last horse to put together an undefeated streak of 19 races. There will be many racing fans both back in Australia and around the world who will be hoping Black Caviar can go one better.","Five-year-old mare Black Caviar extends her winning run to 19 races .

"(CNN) -- The sun is not yet up over Singapore's Kranji Racecourse but Michael Freedman's day has already started. ""Most days I'm up just before 5 o'clock,"" the genial Australian explains. ""I get to the stables just before half past five and the track opens at 6 o'clock. It's a little different to how they do it back home or in Europe but we have to start early because of the heat here."" The heat is just one of challenges faced by racehorse trainers working in the tropical climes of Singapore. Humidity is in the range of 70 -- 80%, while thunderstorms are an almost daily occurrence. ""It's a three shower a day city,"" jokes Freedman, who came to Singapore from his native Australia in 2008. ""It's a lot hotter here, the horses sweat a lot more, so you do make subtle adjustments to counter that."" Freedman is the youngest of four brothers, all successful trainers in Australia. ""My brothers and I have been involved [in training] for 25 or 30 years. I was part of a partnership with them until recently when the opportunity came up to set up here and train under my own name."" It meant transplanting his wife and three children -- triplets -- to a new country; a gamble that seems to have paid off: ""My wife loves it here and my kids are very happy. You just need to adjust to the way things are done here -- and sometimes they're done a bit differently!"" Freedman arrived with a small team and immediately made an impact on the Singapore scene. In contrast to Australia, where racing takes place six or seven days a week, Kranji hosts two cards a week, on Friday evenings and on Sundays. During the rest of the week the course doubles as a training ground for the 27 trainers and around 1,100 horses that are based here. Every morning before sunrise, a gaggle of trainers can be found watching through binoculars from the viewing deck as their charges are put through their paces under the floodlights. As many as 30 to 40 horses may be on the track at any one time. After completing their laps, the thoroughbreds return to the yard, drenched in foamy white sweat, from where their grooms take them back to their air-conditioned stables. The majority of the horses here are sourced from overseas and shipped to the island nation as yearlings. ""There are some from Argentina and a few from the UK and other parts of the world but the bulk of them come from Australia and New Zealand, because there's no breeding industry in Singapore. ""Once they've been here for 12 months they're considered 'local.'"" An important distinction: the Gold Cup, Singapore's most prestigious race and the third leg of the Singapore 'Triple Crown', is only open to 'local' horses. ""The Gold Cup is everything in terms of Singapore racing. It's a time honored race. It's a race that any trainer or owner or jockey would aspire to win so if we were lucky enough for that to happen on Sunday that'd be huge for us, for sure. It's not easy to win. I ran fourth in it last year. ""They race left handed, as we always do here. It's on the turf track and it's over 2,200m under handicap conditions so that makes it a very open race. My main chance, Always Certain, will be carrying top weight on Sunday which will make his job difficult but I've got a lot of faith in his ability."" As if on cue the dawn sky is ruptured by a flash of lightning, briefly rendering the floodlights redundant as the track is illuminated by white light. The horses, accustomed to the vagaries of the Singaporean climate, do not miss a stride. ""That would be our daily thunderstorm. And when it rains here it really rains: we've had two or three inches of rain here in the space of 20 minutes. Usually the rain comes and goes very quickly -- you don't often see rain sort of settling in for an entire day here. We get some pretty amazing storms here so you just work in and around it."" 'Working around it' and making adjustments is something Freedman has learned to do with aplomb since he decided to crack Singaporean racing. In a sport of few certainties, it would perhaps be fitting if the master of reinvention, the adaptable Australian who arrived in Singapore a little under four years ago, captured his first Gold Cup with Always Certain on Sunday.","Australian Michael Freedman has become a leading trainer in Singapore .

"(CNN) -- Kauto Star made racing history on Boxing Day by claiming his fifth King George VI Chase victory at Kempton Park, the first horse to achieve the feat in the 74-year history of the famous race. The 11-year-old gelding, trained by champion trainer Paul Nicholls and ridden by Irishman Ruby Walsh, took up the running from the halfway stage of the three-mile contest to finish ahead of last year's winner Long Run, with Captain Chris back in third place. Kauto Star won the race four years in succession, from 2006 to 2009, but was well beaten last year by the younger Long Run, and retirement beckoned after Long Run, five years his junior, also proved victorious in jump racing's Blue Riband chase -- the Cheltenham Gold Cup -- last March. However, Kauto Star beat his rival in their prep race at Haydock Park earlier this season, and he confirmed his resurgent form with a comfortable victory on Monday, ensuring the 2012 Cheltenham Gold Cup will once again prove an intriguing clash between the pair. Kauto Star and Desert Orchid (1986, 1988, 1989, 1990) shared the previous record of four victories in the race -- the second most prestigious level-weights chase on the National Hunt calendar -- but this victory means he is now out on his own with a remarkable five successes. ""It's amazing, he is just the best,"" Nicholls told reporters. ""We knew we had him in serious order today and if he gets to Cheltenham in that form he'll be the one to beat in the Gold Cup."" Kauto Star has twice won the Cheltenham Gold Cup, in 2007 and again in 2009 when he became the first horse in history to regain the trophy. However, he will turn 12 on New Year's Day and only two horses in the 87-year history of the race have won it at that age.","Kauto Star makes history with his fifth King George VI Chase victory .

"(CNN) -- Top French jockey Christophe Lemaire could not believe his luck after winning one of horse-racing's biggest prizes in dramatic fashion in Australia on Tuesday. The 32-year-old was able to ride at the Melbourne Cup only because Dunaden's usual mount Craig Williams was serving a ban for careless riding, and he had never seen the famed Flemington raceway before Monday. Flown in by the French-trained stayer's owner Sheikh Fahad Al-Thani, Lemaire triumphed by the narrowest of margins after a photo-finish with Britain's Red Cadeaux in the 151st running of the prestigious event. ""I was a bit anxious after the line,"" Lemaire told reporters after claiming the $6.4 million first prize for the Qatari. ""A rider on a pony told me they thought I had won and then when I turned the corner back towards the stands, everyone was applauding me. ""I wasn't supposed to ride him and didn't know until yesterday. Craig must be devastated and I hope he recovers quickly and that he will win many more big races. ""Two years ago I had a fall before Arc weekend and I missed winning four Group One races so I know what it is like to watch in your armchair. Unfortunately it's part of a jockey's life."" Lemaire rated the victory as the second finest of his distinguished career, after the winning on Divine Proportions at the 2005 Prix de Diane in Chantilly in front of his family. ""Of course I have heard of the Melbourne Cup before, but the atmosphere and the passion here, it is really something special,"" he said. Williams rode Dunaden to victory at the Geelong Cup warm-up as trainer Mikel Delzangles followed the example set by last year's winner Americain, who could only manage fourth on Tuesday behind German-bred Lucas Cranach. ""It's amazing. I thought I was beaten so it's even better,"" Delzangles said. ""We knew he was a good stayer, but I thought the race was so difficult to win. ""Maybe thanks to Americain last year, it made us realize that it was possible to do it. We were just beaten in a Group Two at Longchamp (in May), then we decided that we should look at the Melbourne Cup. ""I would like to have a thought for Craig Williams. He did a great job in preparation for the horse and he has been a gentleman.""","French-trained Dunaden wins prestigious Melbourne Cup race on Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- The devastating wall of water that struck Japan in March was the result of at least two waves that combined to create a more powerful tsunami, U.S. scientists said Monday. Ocean ridges and mountain ranges below the surface of the water channeled the waves created by the 9.0 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Japan, bringing them together far out at sea to form a ""merging tsunami,"" according to researchers from NASA and Ohio State University. The earthquake and tsunami together killed 15,840 people, according to the most recent death toll, and set off a nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Satellite data have enabled the researchers to come up with an account of the formation of the tsunami and its destructive force. ""Nobody had definitively observed a merging tsunami until now,"" Y. Tony Song, a research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said in a statement. The results of the research could help predict the risks from tsunamis in the future.

"(CNN) -- In the past two weeks, the U.S. Secret Service has had a number of agents either resign or get fired in disgrace for their actions in Colombia. The uniformed service members supporting the agents are being investigated under the Uniformed Code of Military Justice, and the media frenzy remains insatiable. Are we surprised? Isn't this story about grown men acting badly? Of course not, it's far more troubling. This is about at least one disciplined and professional organization failing to lead or act consistent with the discipline required of their service, whether it is the secret service or the military. Senators criticize military briefing on Colombia scandal . We expect them to set the standard for discipline and leadership and they failed at both. The good news is we found out about these shenanigans before this incredibly bad behavior became an acceptable new, lower standard. The problem, you see, is leadership has no variable speed, no levels of acceptance. There is but one standard. You either lead or you don't. Leadership is about getting people to do things they otherwise would not do when no one else is looking. Well, no surprise here that in our cyber world, when everything everyone does is subject to scrutiny, some one is always looking. Agent posted Palin picture on Facebook page . It's naÃ¯ve to assume otherwise. The Secret Service and their military support team were idiots to assume that they could act badly and get away with it. As citizens and taxpayers, we'd expect good discipline from these folks without having to have some one check up on them. But sadly, they failed us and demonstrated that they need supervision. They need leadership. Don't think that this band of agents and their military support was anything other than a gaggle of guys, acting more like punks that leaders. My suggestion is that there was not one leader in the bunch. If there was a leader, he failed to show up for the most important mission he accepted...protecting our President. Something did not go wrong; something is wrong. My suggestion is that the Secret Service is a great agency that failed at its core mission...to lead and act like no one is looking. However, for some inexplicable reason that challenges the agency's core, it defined leadership in an entirely unrecognizable way. These are not young ""troops"" acting out badly.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- When Yo-Yo Ma enters a room, everything changes. Yo-Yo Ma's new album, ""Songs of Joy and Peace,"" is his first holiday-themed record. His energy and warmth (he hugs everyone in sight) and curiosity (for every question you ask him, he asks two of you) envelop you like a blanket. He's also surprisingly funny. The world's most celebrated cellist introduces himself not as Yo-Yo, or Mr. Ma, or even Yo Mama (as you might expect from a wisenheimer). Instead, with a hint of mischief and a nod to the everyman celebrity of campaign '08, he offers, ""I'm Joe the cellist."" He adds, ""I get the 'plumb' jobs."" He might be right. Consider Ma's latest album, ""Songs of Joy and Peace"" (Sony), the first holiday-themed release of his career. Ma describes it as a musical party, a collection of good-time collaborations with musical buddies, James Taylor and Diana Krall among them.  Watch Yo-Yo Ma enjoy time with his friends » . ""I asked everybody to bring their favorite piece of music that signified joy to them,"" Ma said. ""And out came all of these fantastic pieces. Many of them I didn't know."" Krall applies her mellow voice and piano playing to the lighthearted ""You Couldn't be Cuter."" Ma joined Taylor in Taylor's Washington, Massachusetts, barn to record George Harrison's ""Here Comes the Sun."" Other guests include vocalists Alison Krauss and Renee Fleming, trumpeter Chris Botti and saxophonist Joshua Redman. Ma also enlists help from friends who are less mainstream such as the green-haired Galician bagpiper Cristina Pato and mandolin player Chris Thiele. Jake Shimabukuro's ukulele provides a delightfully plucky counterpoint to Ma's soaring cello on the John Lennon/Yoko Ono hit ""Happy Xmas (War is Over)."" Born in Paris to Chinese parents and raised in New York, Ma, 53, is no stranger to thinking outside the music box. In 1998 he founded the Silk Road Project, a multi-cultural exchange designed to help artists and musicians share ideas across borders. His international efforts have earned him the title of United Nations Messenger of Peace. And to Ma, his extensive travels have earned him comparison to a certain shifty-footed children's book character. ""As a musician I'm kind of nomadic, Waldo-like,"" he says. ""I show up in different places, and I'm witness to unbelievable things."" CNN caught up with Ma at Legacy Studios in New York where some of the recording took place for ""Songs of Joy and Peace."" The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: One of the things that's apparent from watching the footage of the studio sessions from this album is that everyone is so humbled to work with you, and you are just as humbled to work with them. Yo-Yo Ma: Well, I think what I loved about the sessions was that there was mutuality, if that's a word, of just being open and wanting to do the best thing possible. And so I think everybody just came with an open heart and open mind. ... The amount of talent that walked through the room was staggering for me. Day after day I thought I could die and go to heaven. ... Every day was like that. So I feel very, very, very lucky and very grateful to my friends. CNN: With the work you do, particularly with the Silk Road Project, you've really had to relax the rules of classical music. Has that been difficult? Ma: There's a part of me that's always charging ahead. I'm the curious kid, always going to the edge. But I have such deep love for the domain that I come from, whether you call it classical music or ... I don't know what you call it these days because it's no longer really definable. It's coming from a lot of places. Yes, you're right, I had to relax. It was scary. And I think the idea of transcending fear and transcending technique or understanding different frames is part of the adventure. Something's scary until you make it familiar and comfortable. I feel so much more a member of the planet community after doing this work for 10 years, because I feel like you can drop me most places and I'll be OK. I'll find out what's going on and find a way to participate. CNN: You're a big believer in the idea that music is this big unifying force in the world. What other common languages have you come across? Ma: Oh my goodness. I think there are so many basic ways of behaving that we all have. Guest-host relations ... there's no culture that doesn't have that. And there's almost no culture where there are not stories where people take in strangers. Gift giving is another act that is universal. Certainly caring for one's group, a tribal mentality. Sometimes it means putting up firewalls because it's dangerous to mingle. But in today's world it seems like we have different groupings. [We seem to have] a younger generation that actually is much more tribe-blind or they've created their own social communities. So it's interesting to live in today's world and observe how within urban or rural areas people's habits may be changing. And I think culturally speaking I'm trying to work in such a way that we can actually find more commonality than the differences, especially because often things happen so quickly. CNN: Can you ever remember a moment in your life when you felt bored? Ma: Yes. I hated that feeling so much. I think we all remember when we were much younger, how slowly time [goes]. And I think those years often were very boring years. When is summer going to come? When is Christmas going to come? Never! But I think I decided or thought about how I really would love to have an interesting life. I really would like to be involved in things and to understand things, and in some ways you've got to be careful what you wish for because I feel very, very blessed to have such an interesting life and to be able to have little snapshots of lives of people from many different parts of the world. CNN: What do you do to relax? Ma: Because so much of what I do involves people, being in a place with more trees than people immediately takes me down. I live in Cambridge [Massachusetts] and so when we go to western Massachusetts and see the mountains and trees, suddenly I'm totally relaxed and feel fabulous.","Yo-Yo Ma's new album is first holiday record for cellist .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's Supreme Court postponed a rare public hearing for the country's secretive and powerful spy agency Thursday, a lawyer for one of the alleged victims of the agency said. Long thought to be untouchable, the ISI, or Inter-Services Intelligence, has been ordered to produce seven men it's accused of holding since 2010 and explaining the deaths of four other detainees. But attorney Tariq Asad told CNN the court had delayed the hearing until Friday because other proceedings took up much of the day. Asad said it was clear the lawyer for the ISI, who was present when the postponement was announced, had not brought the seven detainees to court as ordered. The spy agency's lawyer presented the court with medical certificates for four of them to show they were hospitalized, and he asked permission from the court to present confidential letters explaining the whereabouts of the other three men, Asad said. It's not yet clear if the spy agency will produce the detainees at Friday's hearing. For Rohaifa Bibi, the proceedings are personal. Her son, Abdul Saboor, was one of the four men who died while in the custody of the ISI, the family claims. ""He had so many marks on his body,"" Bibi said, pointing to numerous scars in a picture of her son's corpse. ""When they showed me the body, he was just skin and bones."" The ISI blamed the 29-year-old's death on natural causes. His mother said the scars prove the agency tortured and killed her son. ""It's absolute lies,"" Bibi said. ""First, I read in the papers Abdul Saboor committed suicide, then they said he died of tuberculosis. When someone lies they should at least remember which lie they used."" Her outrage has the 60-year-old doing what few others in Pakistan have ever dared think -- taking on the ISI and demanding answers. Those who know the ISI's reputation know few people have ever challenged Pakistan's most feared and shadowy institution. The spy agency has long been accused of backing and toppling politicians, using militant groups as proxies and backing extrajudicial killings. The ISI has long denied the accusations, but no one from the agency ever speaks publicly on camera and no one from the ISI has ever been put on trial. Because it has the backing of the Supreme Court, the case of Saboor could be different. The court has ordered the ISI to explain why Saboor, his two brothers and eight other men were arrested and why four of them died. ""We are fighting for the rule of law,"" Asad said. Saboor and his brothers were law abiding citizens who printed Korans at a shop in Lahore, Asad said. He did acknowledge that all of the detainees were suspects in several militant attacks, but said they were acquitted of the charges in 2010. A lawyer for the ISI told the Supreme Court that the spy agency did detain the men for further questioning but said they were set free. The ISI denies any role in their deaths and holds to its claim that they died of natural causes. For Pakistan, the case is potentially a crucial test of the nation's democracy. For a grieving mother, it's a chance for justice. ""I can only hope that whoever has done this injustice to me, I hope their families suffer like I have,"" Bibi said. ""I hope one day they feel my pain.""

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan police are questioning two school caretakers after more than 170 women and girls were hospitalized with suspected poisoning, a district official said Wednesday. Police took the school employees into custody in the town of Rostaq, district administrator Moelam Hussein said. Local health officials blamed the act on extremists opposed to women's education. A total of 171 women and girls were hospitalized Tuesday, and four remained semi-conscious in the hospital Wednesday, Dr. Hafizullah Safi said. Some 25 women and girls returned to the hospital Wednesday morning, complaining of more stomach pains, fever and vomiting. They were given medication and released, said Safi, the provincial health department director. A sample of the water from the school was taken and had been sent to Kabul for testing, but it will take several days for the results. The victims range in age from 14 to 30 and were taken to a hospital in Afghanistan's northeastern Takhar province after their school's water tank was contaminated, according to Safi. No deaths were reported, but more than half the victims partially lost consciousness, while others suffered dizziness and vomiting. ""Looking at the health condition of these girls, I can definitely say that their water was contaminated by some sort of poison,"" Safi said. ""But we don't know yet what was the water exactly contaminated with."" Taliban say they trained attackers . ""It is the work of those who are against girls' education and peace and stability in Afghanistan,"" district administrator Hussain said. In 2010, more than 100 schoolgirls and teachers were sickened in a series of similar poisonings. During the Taliban's rule from 1996 to 2001, many Afghan girls were not allowed to attend school, though the schools began reopening after the regime was toppled by the U.S.-led invasion. Observers say, however, that abuse of women remains common in the post-Taliban era and is often accepted in conservative and traditional families, where women are barred from education and commonly subjected to domestic violence. Australia to accelerate withdrawal . In January 2011, Afghan Education Minister Dr. Farooq Wardak told the Education World Forum in London that the Taliban had abandoned their opposition to girls' education. But the group never offered a statement confirming or denying that claim. Female educational facilities, students and teachers, meanwhile, have come under vicious attack as the insurgency has spread outside Taliban strongholds in the southern provinces of Kandahar and Helmand. The country maintains one of the world's youngest populations.

"New York (CNN) -- Beachgoers are being warned to stay out of the water this weekend at four popular beaches around New York City after raw sewage from a Manhattan plant spilled into the Hudson River, authorities said. Health advisories also have been issued for portions of the Hudson River, the East River, the Harlem River and the Kill Van Kull, cautioning people against participating in water-related activities such as canoeing, kayaking and swimming, according to the New York City Department of Health. The sewage spill began Wednesday after a fire began in the engine room of the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant, according to a press release Friday from the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. The sewage spill was stopped Friday night, and two of the engines damaged by the fire have been brought back online, the department said. The health advisories were issued for South Beach, Midland Beach and Cedar Grove Beach on Staten Island, and Sea Gate in Brooklyn, according to the release. The beaches are not closed, but the New York City Department of Health recommends that people not swim or enter the water at those locations. They also recommend that young and elderly people, as well as anyone suffering from a medical condition, not go near the water at those beaches.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China's ruling Communist Party has expelled two former top officials from a southern Chinese village where local residents rose up last year to protest corruption and abuses of land rights. Xue Chang, the former party chief of Wukan, and Chen Shunyi, the former head of the village committee, are facing charges of corruption and election-rigging, the state-run news agency Xinhua said in a report late Monday. Other local officials were also punished, it said. The provincial authorities have also demanded that Xue and Chen return ""illegal gains"" worth tens of thousands of dollars, Xinhua reported, citing Zeng Qingrong, deputy head of the supervision department of Guangdong Province. But some villagers said the punishment did not go far enough and urged the authorities to step up their investigations. During the last four months of 2011, thousands of residents took to the streets of Wukan, protesting the seizure of their farmland by officials, expelling local Communist Party leaders and clashing with anti-riot police who surrounded the village. The unrest drew the attention of the international news media, making it a focal point for grassroots discontent in China. Senior provincial officials intervened to negotiate a deal with the villagers. That agreement allowed the residents to hold elections to choose local representatives earlier this year, and protest leaders were elected to key posts. The provincial authorities also began investigating the former village officials and the land seizures. After three months, the investigators found that former officials were ""involved in illegal transfers of land use rights, embezzling collective properties, accepting bribes and rigging village elections,"" according to Zeng, the Guangdong official. As well as Xue and Chen, 18 other village, township and municipal officials were also ""punished,"" Xinhua reported. Two of those officials have been passed on to judicial authorities ""for suspected law infringements,"" and a total of 1.06 million renminbi ($168,000) has been confiscated, the report said. But the announcement failed to satisfy Xue Jianwan, a villager whose father died after being detained by the authorities during the protests last year. ""The official report is not convincing,"" she said by telephone. ""None of us villagers would believe that a party chief would only take so little in so many years in his position."" The authorities have ordered Xue Chang, the former party chief, to return 189,200 renminbi in ""illegal gains,"" and Chen, the former village committee head, to return 86,000 renminbi. Xue Jianwan said the villagers' main concern was not the punishment of the officials, but reclaiming what had been taken from them. ""We still want to know whether we can have our land back,"" she said. The investigation is continuing, the Xinhua report said, adding that Xue Chang and Chen ""may also be handed over to the judicial authorities."" Zhang Jianxin, one of the leading organizers of the protests in the village, said that the authorities needed to do more. ""We feel the government is downplaying the problems here,"" he said. ""They were also slow and ineffective."" He agreed with Xue Jianwan that Xue Chang's current punishment was too lenient. ""Meanwhile,"" he said, ""we'll keep fighting for our rights over the land.""

"(CNN) -- From his early days as one of the first faces familiar to television audiences in the 1950s, as host of ""American Bandstand,"" Dick Clark was a constant. He wasn't just a major force in television, but in the music industry as well, up until his death on Wednesday at the age of 82. So it's no wonder that iReports flooded in from those who worked closely with Dick Clark, as well as those who only knew him as a friend who came into their living rooms, whether it be each week or only each New Year's ""Rockin'"" Eve. Dick Clark was involved with so much, from various award shows, to the popular ""Pyramid"" Game show, to ""TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes,"" that only focusing on one reason he was so loved by so many just isn't enough.

Sioux Falcone worked with Dick Clark in the 1980s. She well recalls him wearing a name tag to his own holiday party. ""I was watching CNN and my son asked who the man on television was and I told him 'actually he was my boss.' And my son didn't believe me. So I pulled out this photo yesterday and here he was wearing a name tag. I thought it was really endearing."" She also said that her fondest memory of Dick Clark was when he gave her his first desk after he moved to the west coast for 'American Bandstand.' She inquired about the piece of furniture with the office manager and a few days later Clark was at here desk. ""He said, 'I heard you want my desk,' and I said I would pay, but he said I didn't have to pay for it,"" she said. ""He helped me load his antique desk into my car,"" she said. ""He would show random acts of kindness like that.'"" 9. ""He broke color barriers"" Maxine Porter, the legal steward for the late Bill Pinkney of the R&B/soul group, the Drifters, put it this way: ""What artist of color didn't have some association with Dick Clark over the years?"" Clark is widely credited with integrating his audience on ""American Bandstand"" and, according to Porter, Pinkney was one of those musical artists of color who credited Clark with their start. ""The first comment I heard him make about Dick Clark was, 'You know, we were one of the first black acts, if not the first, on his show in Philadelphia before he went national,"" she said. ""As a little girl, watching television in Mississippi, I was not exposed to blacks in any positions of power or affluence,"" said iReporter Elnora Fondren Palmtag of Clarksdale, Mississippi. ""Dick Clark was an inspiration when he fought for the integration of his show, first for the performers on his show and later adding dancers of different races. I know he helped to launch the careers of some great black performers, but you may not see the impact he had on the poor underprivileged children of the ghettos around the country who did not know that they could be more than what they could see around them."" 8. He introduced generations to music . Mark Jensen from Branson, Missouri, was one of many loyal viewers of ""American Bandstand."" ""I watched the show every weekend, and because of the show, I heard music that I normally wouldn't have because I couldn't afford to buy records or a radio."" Jensen was inspired by ""Bandstand:"" the now singer/songwriter also goes by the stage name of Mark Catron. 7.  He was a teenage staple . Every afternoon, Janie Lambert from Hughesville, Maryland would switch on American Bandstand at home, and dance to Chubby Checker, learning to do ""the Twist"" and ""the Limbo."" ""I will never forget March 1967 when the Beatle's Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane were debuted on 'American Bandstand.' The Beatles new look and sound was eerie, strange, a little frightening but oh so very exciting. This was a big change for the music industry."" Lambert described ""Bandstand"" as ""the part of my day that I looked most forward to,' she said. ""No one can take his place."" 6. He was a mentor . Paul Revere is a member of Paul Revere and the Raiders, who hit it big in the 1960s. He worked with Dick Clark for several years and describes Clark as being a wonderful and close friend. Revere describes one of his fondest memories with Clark when he and his band were at a shoot for the '60s NBC show, ""Where the Action Is."" ""He's my guy. We saw each other six weeks ago, and I can't even believe he is gone."" He said his heart sunk when he heard the news of Clark's passing. ""When you get older you want to spend time with the people you are close to, and you keep putting things off because you always think you are going to have another day."" He said he is really glad he had the chance to see Clark six weeks ago. ""You need to always tell your friends how much they mean to you,"" he said. ""That is what I learned from this situation... I gave him a hug and told him everything I have and everything I am I owe to him."" 5. He was forever young . Kathi Cordsen remembered thinking about how ageless Dick Clark seemed on television when she tuned in to watch his show. Her fondest memory of Clark was when she would throw dance parties at her house with her neighbor friends while they watched ""American Bandstand"" in the afternoon. ""I remember always thinking how Dick Clark never seemed to age from year to year and I wondered how he did that. Good living and being a good person, that must have been what it was."" 4. He was a dancer's best friend . When Karen Folkes was a teenager, she was living in Minnesota, but she was travelling to Hollywood to dance on Dick Clark's show. Her brother, who lived in California at the time, managed to get her and her friend passes to ""American Bandstand."" She found herself in Clark's office with his now wife, Kary Wigton, who was also from Minnesota. Clark and Wigton told Folkes she could come by the show whenever she wanted. During the 1970's Folkes danced on the show 32 times. Dancers still have Dick Clark to thank, as he produced the Fox television series ""So You Think You Can Dance."" 3. He was the perfect host . Paul Martin was a British DJ living in America during the 1960s ""British invasion,"" and looked up to Clark. ""Some entertainers are trained in broadcast schools, some get lucky and just land a broadcast job on the spur of the moment, others get there because of who rather than what they know and the right connections, etc.,"" said Martin, now living in Beverly Hills, California. ""But Clark made it to the top of his profession because he was the right guy at the right time on the right show and America and the world's most popular television music program!"" 2. He was great to work for . Steven Leuck, a contractor in Eugene, Oregon, worked for Clark in his New York City home in the mid-1980s. Having grown up on ""Bandstand,"" he was ""thrilled"" to work for him. ""Mr. Clark called me at home and told me personally how much he appreciated the extra time and work it took to get [his] specialty lighting purchased, delivered and installed on time,"" he said. ""He gave me his home phone number and told me that if I should ever need anything that he could do for me that I should never hesitate to call on him. I have worked with many celebrities over the years but he was far and away the kindest, most thoughtful gentleman of all the celebrities I have ever met or had the pleasure to work with."" 1. He gave people opportunities . Maggie Kortchmar, back when she was known as Maggie Lee, had a song played on ""American Bandstand"" in the 1980s. ""He said my name so sweetly: he was thoughtful, and concerned with the kids saying it was okay."" Unfortunately, the record got a lukewarm response, but ""Dick Clark looked right into the camera, and told me he liked it and for me to keep plugging. A very generous, kind man.""","Iconic television host remembered by iReporters .

"(CNN) -- When someone asks when the Republican Party abandoned its longstanding position as the party of family values, we will all be able to say it was shortly after 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on January 19, 2012, in Charleston, South Carolina. When the invited audience of 2,300 Republicans stood up and applauded Newt Gingrich's angry and defiant response to the opening question from CNN's John King about allegations leveled by the ex-wife of the former speaker of the House, it was clear that the GOP, always judgmental about marital fidelity with Democrats, threw that out of the window. The GOP's desire to beat President Barack Obama at any cost, and its unwillingness to coalesce around Mitt Romney, clearly outweighs its view on rampant adultery by one of its leading presidential candidates. Those willing to make excuses for Gingrich's cheating on his second wife, Marianne, with his current wife, Callista (he also cheated on wife No. 1 with Marianne, who later became wife No. 2) are quick to say that the Christian faith requires forgiveness. And that is absolutely right. But when has Gingrich apologized to President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore for his routine missives declaring both of them morally corrupt? When has Gingrich ever said publicly that while he was ripping others to shreds, he was doing the same to his marriage vows to forsake all others? The nation clearly was made aware of Clinton's extramarital affairs while serving in the White House with the impeachment trial. But nothing of the sort was said about Gore. Yet that didn't prevent the bombastic Gingrich from lobbing his morally bankrupt grenades towards the Clinton-Gore White House. Now we know that while he was doing that, he was deeply involved in a torrid affair with Callista, then a Capitol Hill staffer. What was amazing Thursday night is that we were in South Carolina, the Bible Belt, where evangelicals hold significant sway. Just last year, Republicans were aghast when the governor, Mark Sanford, was busted for engaging in an international extramarital affair, hiding away in Argentina and lying about his whereabouts. Details of his sordid affair made national headlines and embarrassed the state and the national party. South Carolinians were disgusted with his behavior, and the potential presidential candidate who was a darling of Bible-thumpin' social conservatives ended his tenure in shame, losing his wife in the process. So why was the GOP so quick to leap to their feet as Gingrich castigated King for even asking the question? No doubt they will say it was his denunciation of the media for asking such a tawdry question. Others will say that Newt's multiple affairs were common knowledge and since he was a declared changed man, we all should move on. But how can someone like Gingrich stand up in debates and forcefully talk about the sanctity of marriage when he has no history of believing what he is saying? How can any social conservative talk about the moral fiber needed in a presidential candidate when the man many of them love has none? It's highly likely that when the group of influential social conservatives met in Texas last weekend to coalesce around a candidate, Gingrich's rampant cheating was too much for them to overlook and that's why they settled on Rick Santorum. The GOP loves to scream from the mountaintop about family values, but when a Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana continues to sit in the U.S. Senate after it was revealed he often used an escort service, then their protestations ring hollow. And there are many other Republicans who have had to come forward, some unwillingly, to own up to their transgressions. See, when Republicans are busted for cheating on their spouses, they will quickly play the forgiveness card. Yet isn't a failure to have character and integrity at home a sign of how someone will act in the workplace? And it must gall the GOP to watch Obama often dote on his wife, and make clear that even while in the White House, his family is a top priority. Gingrich is correct in stating that many of the folks in the audience understand personal pain. But when Newt himself, and his party, has shown little concern in the past about such pain when it has affected someone in the other party, their pleas for understanding looks like shameful pandering. So to the Republican Party, your high-minded and sanctimonious positions about others not having morals and values should end. If you are willing to accept Newt Gingrich with all of his failings, then you had better open your arms for a whole lot of other sinners who have also sought God's redemption. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.","Gingrich's defiance to question about his ex-wife's remarks met with cheers .
Response ended GOP's standing as party of family values, Roland Martin says .
Martin: Right's lukewarmness to Romney, loathing of Obama has come to this .
If mercy is the standard, Gingrich should apologize to the Clintons, Martin says ."
"Alpharetta, Georgia (CNN) -- At 39 years old, Christopher John Nitkowski really has no business trying to pitch in the major leagues. In the harsh reality of professional sports, he's a has-been. Just don't tell him that. The former first-round draft pick last pitched for the Washington Nationals in 2005 after a 10-season career spent mostly as a left-handed reliever. ""You go as long as you can,"" he told CNN. ""I had a good friend tell me, 'Man, just make them tear the uniform off of you. You can do whatever you're gonna do for the rest of your life. You can't play baseball forever.'"" In the middle of the 2011 baseball season Nitkowski announced in a first-person article for Sports Illustrated that he would try a comeback. After his brief major league appearance in 2005, he pitched subsequent years for one team in Japan and three in South Korea. This time, he wrote, he would agree to a risky medical experiment that would involve injecting his own stem cells into his injured pitching shoulder, which he hurt in an initial comeback attempt last spring. Nitkowski was following the path of 37-year-old Bartolo Colon, who in late 2010 went through the same procedure. Colon wound up restored to health and pitched credibly for the New York Yankees in 2011. Nitkowski telephoned the doctor who treated Colon and agreed to pay about $3,000 for the procedure. Nitkowski and the physician, Dr. Joseph Purita, agreed to CNN's request to follow the procedure and report on the outcome, no matter what that turned out to be. In late August, Nitkowski went to Purita's Florida office and watched as some of his own stem cells were extracted from fatty tissue around his waist. The stem cells were then spun in a centrifuge and emerged as something called platelet rich plasma (PRP), which athletes have been using in recent years to restore their health. Nitkowski returned several weeks later for a follow-up PRP injection. No human growth hormones, which are a banned substance in major league baseball, were used. Both Nitkowski and Purita told CNN they were well aware of the risks. ""We really don't have a good uniform idea of what constitutes platelet rich plasma,"" Purita told CNN. ""I mean, what is it? You could ask 10 doctors and they're going to give you 10 different answers. We really need to get together and form an idea as to what it is."" One doctor contacted by CNN says the whole process is essentially worthless. ""There are many, many misstatements, direct inaccuracies and errors in the way that growth factors and stem cells are portrayed,"" Dr. George Daley, president of the International Society for Stem Cell Research, said after reading an informational packet written by Purita, available to patients on his website. ""If it were subjected to a critical analysis by experts in the field, it would be dismissed as unfortunately superficial and inaccurate."" None of that seemed to matter to Nitkowski, who said all he wanted was a chance to pitch one last season in the major leagues. CNN followed him after his injections through a grueling series of workouts. First, he had to regain his arm strength by hitting tennis balls hurled at him by a machine. Then, he had to throw a football at a moderate pace. Finally, in October, he began to throw a baseball again. Nitkowski felt that his arm strength was back to normal and his fastball was back to its usual velocity. Nitkowski has converted himself into a sidearm pitcher, abandoning the customary over-the-top delivery. His specialty, he said, would be to come in briefly in the late innings of a game to get one or two left-handed batters out and the unusual pitching motion would make him more effective against lefties. But finding a spot on a major league roster would be difficult, even if he were healthy and even though left-handed relief pitchers are a valuable commodity. CNN Correspondent Drew Griffin talked to Nitkowski at his home in suburban Atlanta. ""Do you ever lay in bed and think, 'Am I delusional?'"" Griffin asked. ""There's times where you question yourself,"" Nitkowski said. ""Anything you want to do, if you have a passion about it, you're gonna do whatever it takes to do it. And so that's where I'm at. There's times doubt definitely creeps in."" On New Year's Day, Nitkowski found himself at a baseball stadium in Santo Domingo, capital of the Dominican Republic. He had paid his own way there to try out for a job as a reliever for one of the four teams playing in the Dominican Winter League round-robin playoffs. His agent had a friend who was also an agent in the Dominican Republic. After two days of waiting, Nitkowski finally had his tryout -- and he won a job. The pay for two weeks with the Dominican League Gigantes? $2,500, less that one-fifth of what a major-league rookie makes. Nitkowski pitched in five games during the Dominican postseason. He didn't allow a hit in his first four appearances but gave up four runs in final game there. When he returned to the United States, he couldn't find any big league teams interested. He changed agents. Finally, he managed to get a tryout with the New York Mets. Again, he thought he did well but there was no contract. No return to major league baseball. C.J. Nitkowski is still at home without a pitching job. He's helping coach several youth teams. He still works out and contemplates pitching in an independent league. He was able to get a temporary baseball-related job. He auditioned for a role in an upcoming movie biography of Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey, who signed Jackie Robinson to his first major league contract. Harrison Ford will play Branch Rickey. Nitkowski will have a speaking role as a pitcher on one of the Dodgers' opponents. He just hopes that it won't be his final time on the mound.","C.J.

"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- At QB9's bricked-walled workspace in Buenos Aires, about 50 employees stay busy day and night creating video games. The company is one of 65 Argentine firms who have been making a name for themselves in recent years in the highly-popular, billion-dollar video game universe. QB9 has found particular success with an online kids' game called ""Mundo Gaturro"" which has nearly one million registered users. ""The Argentine video game industry employs some 3,000 people, and we will generate $55 million in revenue this year. And we are growing fast,"" says Alfredo Cattan, president of both QB9 and the Argentina Game Developers Association. Until recently, video game developers have been concentrated in the United States, Europe and Asia, but over the past decade Latin American developers have blossomed, attracting millions in venture capital funding while developing games for blue-chip brands like Facebook and MTV. In October, Chilean game developer Atakama Labs was acquired by Japanese online services company DeNA. Last year, Argentina's Three Melons was bought by social games behemoth Playdom, now part of the Walt Disney Company. Initially, these big firms were attracted to Latin American game developers because of their low-cost creativity, but that is no longer the only reason. ""It has been proven that [the Latin American video game] industry is really up to the standards, and we can compete with good quality works coming from the most important markets abroad. It's not about costs as much as it used to be,"" says HernÃ¡n Rozenwasser, CEO of QB9. ""Another thing that sets us apart is our artistic traditions: Argentina has always produced high-quality movies, television and music, and that shows up in our work too."" For years, just getting access to expensive computers and consoles in Latin America was a challenge. Globalization brought cheaper hardware and software, and programming classes at local universities allowed ambitious developers to break into the industry. Still, many say that gamers in Latin America have had to work much harder than their counterparts elsewhere in the world, and that is what sets them apart. ""Growing up, many Latin Americans had to constantly adapt to economic and political uncertainty and a business bureaucracy that people in Silicon Valley couldn't even dream of confronting. This has forced entrepreneurs here to think outside-the-box from an early age, and develop a fiercely independent streak, which is crucial for tech innovation,"" says Vinod Sreeharsha, a Sao Paulo-based U.S. journalist who has written extensively about the Latin American tech industry. Those within Latin America's video game industry have recognized their own talent and potential, and are getting proactive about raising brand awareness. Industry leaders are continually organizing conferences around the region, as well as attending important trade shows around the globe. This month alone, video game gatherings took place in Salvador, Brazil, Montevideo, Uruguay and Buenos Aires, attracting thousands of developers and fans, as well as some of the industry's most recognized names. James Portnow, CEO of Seattle-based Rainmaker Games, who was a keynote speaker at the Argentina Video Games Exposition in Buenos Aires on November 11, said: ""Five years ago, when I first started looking at Latin America, there was no gaming industry here; you had some people really hoping, really passionate about games, but no actual businesses. Today, I see a burgeoning market. ""Latin America still has a relatively small gaming community. There is so much potential, so I would encourage developers here to concentrate on building up their internal market."" With the explosion of mobile gaming devices and social media applications, more and more proprietary work is being done by Latin American game developers, and they expect that trend to continue. ""Instead of just doing games as work-for-hire, you are now seeing Argentine products that are released for the world. For example, our game, ""Regnum Online,"" is a massively multi-player game played by thousands of people from all around the world. It has been translated into five languages,"" says Andres Chilkowski of Buenos Aires-based NGD Studios. And in any language, Latin American video game developers are saying the time has come for them to be considered amongst the world's best virtual creators.","South American video game companies say they are ready to compete with rest of world .

"London (CNN) -- The lawyer for Amir Hekmati, an American sentenced to death in Iran for espionage, has called for the ex-Marine's case to be judged on humanitarian, not political grounds. Pierre Prosper, who has been engaged by the 28-year-old's family to try to secure his release and return home, said Hekmati was at risk of falling victim to the animosity between the United States and Iran. ""What worries me most is that this case is entrapped in an intense political environment,"" the U.S.-based lawyer told CNN. ""We want to remove it from the political environment and establish a humanitarian corridor of communication and see if we can just talk about Amir as a human being."" Hekmati, who served in the U.S. Marines from 2001 to 2005, was arrested in August 2011 while visiting his grandmother and other relatives in Iran. His family has said he made the trip after obtaining permission from the Iranian Interests Section of the Pakistani Embassy in Washington. On Monday, Iran's semi-official Fars news agency reported that he had been convicted of espionage, ""working for an enemy country,"" being a member of the CIA and ""efforts to accuse Iran of involvement in terrorism."" He has 20 days in which to appeal against his death sentence. His family, who live in Michigan, claim that a ""confession"" aired on Iranian state television last month was coerced. ""We believe that there's a fundamental misunderstanding, and that the accusations against him are false,"" said Prosper. ""That said, we're prepared to open a line of communication with the government. We hope that they will accept it, because we believe that there is a workable way around this."" Switzerland, which represents U.S. interests in Iran, has officially confirmed the verdict and sentence, U.S. State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland said Tuesday. The United States has not had diplomatic relations with Iran since 1980, but ""strongly condemns"" the sentence and passed that condemnation to Iran through the Swiss, she said. ""We maintain, as we have from the beginning, that these charges against him are a fabrication and we call on the Iranian authorities to release him immediately,"" Nuland said. ""We've also called on them to allow him to have legal counsel. Defendants in Iran are allowed to appeal within 20 days."" Nuland said Washington has urged Iranian authorities to allow Swiss diplomats to visit Hekmati, a step they have so far denied. Prosper is a former ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues under the George W. Bush administration, and served as a war crimes prosecutor at the U.N. International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. In 2010, he negotiated the release of Reza Taghavi, an Iranian-American businessman detained in Iran for more than two years on suspicion of supporting an anti-regime group. The high-profile lawyer said he hoped his previous experiences in Iran would help in the case. ""I've established some relationships based on my prior negotiations with the Taghavi case. I'll try to revive those connections and see if they are willing to have a conversation. ""It will be difficult, but it's possible, and one of the ways to do it is to move the government out of this, and have it be a communication from the family to the [Iranian] government."" Prosper said he had been shocked at the speed of the proceedings against Hekmati, and was concerned at a lack of openness surrounding the trial. ""This was literally a half-day trial; he was in detention only for a few months, and the verdict came within weeks. We also are troubled by the fact there's been no transparency, so it is really hard to see what happened."" Hekmati's family is ""obviously shocked and troubled"" at news he has been handed a death sentence, Prosper told CNN, particularly since they have had no contact with him in recent months. ""The family in the United States has not spoken with him since his incarceration, his detention. From the videos we've seen he looks to have lost weight, he appears to be under duress, and we're concerned. ""It is very difficult. I hear from them easily five or six times a day -- as you can imagine, the stress level is very high,"" he said. ""The news is not positive, but we try to reassure them that it is not over: We will engage with the government and we hope that they will show compassion. ""Our hope is that they will talk to us. Our hope is that they will listen to the family and... make a humanitarian decision. ""The family's message [to Iran] is: Please show some compassion. You've made your decision, we obviously disagree with the decision, but we are where we are, please allow him to come home, back to the United States."" CNN's Elise Labott contributed to this report.","Pierre Prosper, lawyer for Amir Hekmati, is set to plead for the American's release in Iran .

"Damascus, Syria (CNN) -- At a funeral for a Syrian man allegedly killed by government forces, a grief-stricken sister wails uncontrollably. Mourners carried her brother's casket Monday before thousands of anti-regime protesters, whose passionate anger against a brutal government crackdown was palpable. ""The situation is very bad. We only want to be like you, like the Western people. We want to be free people,"" one mourner told CNN as the dead man's casket passed nearby. ""Look at him, 32 years (old). ... The government is responsible. (President) Bashar al-Assad is responsible. Bashar al-Assad is killing us only because we want to be like you."" CNN followed observers from the Arab League to this funeral and a demonstration a few miles outside of Damascus for a rare opportunity to meet some of the protesters wanting to overthrow al-Assad. Photos: Rare look inside Syria . One man partially covered his face before speaking on camera. ""I'm afraid when I'm talking to you right now. Why? Because I'm going to lift this scarf and go into my home, and I'm not 100% sure that I'm going to be safe,"" he said. ""Because if not today, if not tomorrow, they will arrest me."" He said the defiance here is possible because of the presence of two orange-jacketed Arab League monitors on a fact-finding mission in Syria. The league has called on al-Assad's regime to stop violence against civilians, free political detainees, remove tanks and weapons from cities and allow outsiders, including the international news media, to travel freely around Syria. Q&A: Syria's divisions deepen . Al-Assad has denied the notion his regime commanded forces to fire on protesters, saying there ""were no orders by any departments of the state to fire on people."" But many of the protesters here pushed forward to show injuries they say were inflicted by government forces. They say they can't go to government-run hospitals because they fear being arrested. As the Arab League monitors leave the anti-government protest, they are blocked on a road by a pro-government activists. A banner emblazoned with al-Assad's image stretches across the street, and demonstrators wave Syrian flags and pictures of the president. And it's not the only pro-government rally in town. Elsewhere, festive crowds clapped and danced to amplified music -- sometimes dancing along with government troops. Demonstrators here say they trust the president. And they believe the government line that the opposition is fabricated. ""This opposition is not legal or real,"" one woman said. ""I think large masses of it are fake."" Few here will talk about the danger of Syria imploding into sectarian chaos. But one American woman and her Syrian husband are exceptions. If al-Assad is forced to go, ""it will be chaos,"" the husband said. ""It will be big, big chaos. He is the security."" ""He is a peaceful president,"" his wife chimed in. ""He likes to see all religions get along. He's a peaceful man."" For now, al-Assad remains in control -- for the most part. But it's hard to imagine his supporters and opponents can be kept apart much longer.","Opposition protester: ""Al-Assad is killing us"" because ""we want to be free""

"Incheon, South Korea (CNN) -- A small army of elite, highly trained clones are sent on a mission to root out drugs and ammunition from the city. Every few hours they report back to their masters, to whom they've been devoted since birth. But this isn't the set of a low-budget sci-fi flick; it's the departure lounge of South Korea's Incheon Airport, where seven ""super clone"" sniffer-dogs have been dispatched in the war against contraband luggage. The pack of golden Labrador Retrievers are all genetically identical to ""Chase,"" whose legendary snout kept him top of Incheon's drug-detection rankings right up until his retirement in 2007. But now after years of training, the new class is following in their genetic donor's paw-prints, consistently outperforming the rest of South Korea's naturally born sniffers in the hunt for heroin, cocaine and methamphetamines. Interactive: A day in the life of an airport city . They are the work of Professor Byeong-chun Lee, who established his reputation in 2005 as the driving force behind Snuppy (an amalgam of Seoul National University puppy), the world's first ever dog clone. ""The officers in Korean Custom Service read our dog-cloning article and they suggested the project to us,"" recalls Lee. Indeed, Korean customs had a problem on their hands. Only three out of every 10 selectively bred sniffer dogs that it trained --- at a cost of about $40,140 each -- had the nostrils and the discipline for the job. Although the seven Labrador clones cost upwards of $100,000 each, every single one of them made the grade. But Lee refuses to take all the credit: ""I think half of the ability comes from the genetic background and half comes from the training,"" he said. Lending weight, if it were needed, to the claim that aptitude is indeed a balance of nature and nurture, the dogs still display variations in performance despite their identical genes. And leader of the pack is Tutu. ""Last year, he won a medal for detecting the most drugs at the ICN (Incheon) airport,"" boasts his long-time handler Park Ji-yong. Like his septuplet brothers, Tutu began training for the job at the age one and now, as a mature four year-old, works five to six hourly shifts a day. ""He's very active and energetic...He's kind of tough...and he only likes me which makes me feel good,"" beams Ji-yong. But it's not just drug-mules and meth-addicts that need fear the arrival of this sniffing super-breed. Lee's next clone will be a high-performance ""quarantine dog"" -- gifted with an enhanced capacity for detecting the presence of disease in humans. Lee says that, due to the high number of travelers passing through Incheon, the airport has experienced problems with the spread of infectious diseases, ""so the Korean government have asked us to clone some quarantine sniffing dogs"" Beyond the airport barriers, Professor Lee spends his time cloning a variety of other canine breeds, each with a specific purpose in mind. ""Some clients want to replicate their own pets"" says Lee. In other cases, the scientist works in conservation, creating identical copies of endangered animals. ""Wolves are endangered species in Korea, especially grey wolves. We collected cells from the ear of wolves...and transported to surrogate dogs and finally we produced cloned wolves"" says Lee. So, now that he's cloned man's best friend, are there any plans for man himself? ""Scientifically all the animals, including humans, can be cloned, but I have never thought about (it). It's illegal and it's an ethical problem.""","A breed of 'super clone' sniffer dogs is in action at Incheon Airport .

"(CNN) -- A San Francisco man was arrested and charged with murder Sunday, two days after five people were found dead in a residence in that northern California city, police said. The victims were found around 7:45 a.m. Friday in a building near the City College of San Francisco in the city's Ingleside district, said Commander Michael Biel, head of the San Francisco Police Department's investigations division. There were ""four separate homicide scenes within the residence"" -- suggesting people had been killed in four different locales -- Police Chief Greg Suhr said. Suhr said the five died ""apparently from blunt trauma, (though) we really didn't know what happened."" He added later that there also was an ""edge-weapon involved,"" capable of cutting someone, but there was no evidence of gunshots. The names and ages of those killed have not been released, though Suhr did say ""we believe that the victims may be related."" The man accused of killing them, Binh Thai Luc, is a 35-year-old San Francisco resident with a criminal record. He was arrested and booked on five counts of murder early Sunday, according to Suhr, who added Luc ""did not surrender"" and ""was not arrested at home."" His brother, 32-year-old Brian Luc, was also arrested and charged with narcotics possession, a felon in possession of ammunition and for a probation violation, according to police. The two live together in the city. The police chief said there was ""a relationship"" between the suspect and the victims, though he did not specify what that was.","5 people were found dead in San Francisco, all having suffered ""blunt trauma""

"(CNN) -- The president of Sudan declared a state of emergency Sunday for cities along the hotly contested border with South Sudan, where Sudanese fighter jets launched at least one attack against their neighbor's ground forces. Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir said the state of emergency covers cities in the provinces of South Kordofan, White Nile, and Sinnar, which are on the eastern half of its border with South Sudan. A journalist in South Sudan's Unity state, just over the border from South Kordofan, reported coming under attack by Sudanese helicopter gunships and MiG fighter jets Sunday morning. Robyn Kriel said she was traveling to the front line with the Sudan People's Liberation Army of South Sudan when they came under heavy fire for 15 minutes. They all took cover in trenches dug by the army, she told CNN. The SPLA was poorly equipped for the fight, she reported. Soldiers used anti-aircraft missiles and even hand-held weapons that they fired in the air, she said. At least four SPLA soldiers were hurt in the attack, she said. The South Sudanese military reported another attack on Unity state Saturday, though a Sudanese military spokesman denied it was involved. South Sudan split from Sudan last year as part of a 2005 peace deal that ended decades of war in Africa's largest nation. The war left 2 million people dead and ended with the peace agreement that included an independence referendum for the south. Significant issues between the countries remain unresolved, however, including status of their citizens, division of national debt, disputed border areas and sharing of oil wealth. Tensions peaked this month when South Sudan seized the oil-producing region of Heglig, a resource that fuels the economies of both nations, from its northern neighbor. Heglig oil facilities account for about half of Sudan's production of 115,000 barrels a day. South Sudanese forces withdrew days later after Sudan lodged protests with the United Nations and African Union, but South Sudan said it continued to come under aerial and ground attack.","A journalist in South Sudan says Sudanese forces attacked them Sunday .

"(EW.com) -- It's been 26 years since ""Top Gun,"" but the dogfights in that absurdly entertaining Reagan-era classic have lost none of their speed-demon zap. That said, ""Top Gun"" lets you know that you're basically watching a videogame with actors. Not so with ""Red Tails,"" a lavishly square historical drama about the Tuskegee Airmen, the very first African-American military pilots, who served in segregated units during World War II. The movie has potent sequences of aerial combat that recall Tom Cruise and his flyboys bombarding evil out of the air. Here, though, the planes zoom close to the ground, with the tree-lined hills of Italy looming up behind them. The actors really appear to be flying, and that gives the Airmen's brushes with the enemy -- even when they're just providing ''escort'' cover for white pilots -- a heart-in-the-throat, you-are-there quality. Plus, they do get to bomb a few Nazi planes. As long as it stays in the air, ""Red Tails,"" a George Lucas production written by John Ridley (""U Turn"") and directed by Anthony Hemingway (a veteran of ""The Wire"" and ""CSI: NY""), is a compelling sky-war pageant of a movie. On the ground, it's a far shakier experience: dutiful and prosaic, with thinly scripted episodes that don't add up to a satisfying story. The scenes of racial conflict, like one set at a white officers' club, are vivid illustrations of what the Airmen were up against, and Terrence Howard, as the colonel who argues for the right of the 99th Fighter Squadron to see combat, is defiant in an enjoyably savvy high-command way. David Oyelowo, in the Cruise-ian role of Joe ''Lightning'' Little -- the daredevil who must learn to fly in support of his team -- makes cocky bravado desperate and human. But just about everyone else in the cast achieves one or two eager dimensions rather than three. B- . See full article at EW.com.

"(EW.com) -- Newsflash: '80s icon Molly Ringwald is still cool. Like, really cool. ""The Secret Life of the American Teenager"" star just did an ""Ask Me Anything"" interview on social news site/intense Internet community Reddit, and by all accounts, it was a smashing success. Over the course of a few hours, Ringwald shared anecdotes from her John Hughes-directed heyday, proved she knows a thing or two about the site's unique memes, and poked fun at Woody Harrelson, whose own AMA interview went disastrously wrong this past February. Ringwald doesn't have a project to promote; ""Secret Life"" is in the middle of its fourth season, and though she's working on a jazz album, it won't be released until next spring. Maybe that's why she was so loose and funny on Reddit. Here, for example, is how she responded when a user asked about her famous ""Breakfast Club"" lipstick trick: . ""Regarding lipstick, it's all movie magic. There is a story behind that: John Hughes wrote it but never actually thought about me having to do it. He kept putting it off until the end of filming that long scene. I kept bringing it up, like, 'Hey. We gotta figure this out. Are we going to have robotic breasts?' Finally we decided it was better to see less and let everyone assume that I was particularly skilled."" Robotic breasts! When someone asked for details about a proposed ""Sixteen Candles"" sequel: ""I don't remember much about it, but the script eventually became 'Avatar.'"" The best part of the interview, though, came when accioc asked, ""How did you manage to get hotter with age?"" Though I've already spoiled Ringwald's answer here, it's worth repeating anyway: ""I drink the blood of Kristen Stewart."" (Also worth noting is user cheryldad33â€²s response to Ringwald's response: ""I had assumed that blood would be stale and lifeless."") This, celebrities, is how you can convince the Internet's cynical denizens that you're more than an empty vessel: Do your research, don't be afraid to stray from talking points, and above all else, show off your personality. (Unless you're not funny in real life, I guess.)

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama met Monday with Japan's sixth prime minister in five years to try to strengthen ties with the Pacific economic power still struggling after last year's earthquake and tsunami that triggered a nuclear power plant meltdown. The president and visiting Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda started bilateral talks at the White House, to be followed by a working lunch and then a joint news conference. Japan's volatile domestic politics, amid economic sluggishness and the March 2011 tsunami-triggered nuclear crisis, have made continuity a challenge in relations between the World War II enemies turned industrial allies. Noda came to power in September, and last week, the two governments addressed a thorny issue of recent years with a plan for the United States to relocate about half of its 19,000 Marines based on Okinawa to other places in the Pacific region. While the relocation faces some opposition in Congress and Japan, the announcement of an agreement signaled a desire by the countries to work together on a way forward in bilateral relations. In addition, the two leaders will probably discuss North Korea's fledgling nuclear weapons program and political changes in Myanmar. Another topic expected to come up Monday is possible Japanese membership in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade alliance that is part of Obama's strategy to increase U.S. exports and influence in the Asia-Pacific region. Participants so far in negotiations on the partnership include Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam and the United States. Canada and Mexico also have expressed interest in joining. Last month, Noda issued a sobering and reflective assessment of his country's recovery a year after the 9.0-magnitude earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. The resulting release of radioactivity forced residents of several towns near the plant to flee their homes, and a 20-kilometer (12.4-mile) zone around the plant remains closed to the public. Only two of Japan's 53 nuclear reactors remain in operation, with others taken offline for routine maintenance and then idled. The strain on the grid with summer approaching is raising concern in corporate Japan, which fears it won't have enough power to run production lines in the country. ""In case there is a short-term supply and demand gap of energy, it could cause downward pressure on the economy. We must avoid that,"" Noda told CNN last month. The prime minister faces not just the nuclear cleanup and disaster reconstruction, but an economy facing intense pressure. Japan's currency, the yen, remains at historic highs versus the U.S. dollar. A high yen makes it more expensive for Japanese corporations to make a profit when the funds are repatriated, dragging down corporate profits, domestic investment and employment. Japan's debt-to-gross domestic product ratio is highest among developed nations, topping 200%. The country is also aging at an unprecedented rate. By the year 2050, the government projects, 40% of the population will be over the age of 65, straining public funds while relying on a dwindling tax base. ""We have no time to waste,"" Noda said about economic challenges, adding that economic growth and fiscal health ""must occur side by side."" The centerpiece of the prime minister's economic policy has been the doubling of the country's sales tax, from the current 5% to 10% by October 2015. The plan remains unpopular with voters, but the prime minister has repeatedly endorsed fiscal responsibility in the wake of the shrinking economy. CNN's Kyung Lah and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda is Japan's sixth head of government in five years .

"(CNN) -- On Tuesday, citing safety concerns, the National Transportation Safety Board called for a ban on all cell phone use by drivers. It's the most far-reaching recommendation of its kind to date, and it extends to wireless headsets. What will the fallout of the ban be? It's likely to cut down on sightings of drivers who appear to be having spirited conversations with their car's leather interior. But mightn't it also lead to other similar bans? So here's a speculative look at eight of the more questionable and dangerous activities that federal law might see fit to clamp down on. Skiing or snowboarding while listening to an iPod. In the same way that a preoccupied driver is a menace on the road, so, too, is a hearing-deprived skier or snowboarder a terror on the slopes. When an athlete cuts off a source of outside stimuli thusly, he deprives himself of a valuable auditory cue: bloodcurdling screams. When people near him scream out ""Runaway ski!"" he thinks they're simply singing along. A federal ban of iPods on the slopes would be easy to institute; its violators would be subject to lift-ticket revocation and reduced hot cocoa. Applying eyeliner while riding public transportation. Not only are the practitioners of this activity in danger of impairing their vision, but they are causing undue levels of stress to the people who can't stop watching them. These public users of beauty products prove yet again that the word ""wand,"" particularly in close proximity to the word ""mascara,"" can be as destructive as it is magic. A federal statute, perhaps called the Maybelline Clause, would bring relief to millions of commuters. Lighting an oven by means other than a pilot light. Though very difficult to enforce without surveillance cameras, a policing of kitchen stove-lighting mechanisms would save many lives, not to mention eyebrows. Who among us has not turned our stove's gas on, only to find that the pilot light has blown out, whereupon we wander off to find matches, thus allowing gas to seep into the kitchen? An overhaul of this fraught activity could result in far fewer instances of fire or explosion. And many more evenings where people send out for pizza. Peering over the balcony of a skyscraper. Ah, the view, the view. The view is ... dangerous. It's a human impulse to get closer to something you're looking at -- even if that something is the Chicago skyline. Modern man has been very creative when it comes to keeping pigeons off of balconies -- witness the shards of glass embedded in concrete, witness plastic owls -- so it's easy to imagine the government taking a similarly original tack when it comes to repelling humans from peering over precipices. Am I talking touch-activated sprinklers that gush lukewarm strawberry soda onto overly curious sightseers? Yes, I'm talking touch-activated sprinklers that gush lukewarm strawberry soda onto overly curious sightseers. Sticking your head out the roof of a fast-moving limo. Largely the province of prom-goers and bachelor-partiers, this dangerous activity is of no service to anyone. It is interesting only to its participants, much like televised fishing. The practice could be easily curbed through a sliding scale of fees, based on duration of head-out-of-window exposure and level of inebriation; but it might be easier for limo companies simply to buy some glue. Thanking the doctor who performed open-heart surgery on you by sending her an e-mail that reads, simply, ""thx."" This unseemly activity is, admittedly, not dangerous, except in the way it devalues human discourse and causes at least one member of a profession necessary to our survival on the planet to question his life's purpose. A ""thx"" ban could be enforced either through the creation of a Big Brother-like scanning system or a complaints bureau. Violators would be forced to type what they had previously neglected to type -- ""thank you very much"" -- 5,000 times a day for two weeks. Using a paper shredder or fax machine while wearing a necktie. The male equivalent to the eyeliner-on-a-moving-vehicle scenario, this imperiling activity is seen daily in offices nationwide. Yet no one talks about it. That we live in a country whose restaurants regularly bear informational posters about the Heimlich maneuver only underscores the casual disregard we have for potential necktie-related mayhem. Offenders of this ban might be forced to wear their tattered neckties to work, or to do volunteer work at a local Kinko's. Calling someone ""honey"" if you are not Southern or a waitress. Instant or feigned intimacy is too much for some people to bear, and may result in friction or even violence. The issuing of a DYHM (Don't you honey ME!) ticket might do much to cool the fires of sudden or false ardor. Repeat offenders would be sent to work at large, nameless corporations, or be required to move to Tupelo. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Henry Alford.","National Transportation Safety Board has called for a ban on all cell phone use by drivers .

How about skiing while listening to an iPod? Or peering over the balcony of a skyscraper?

"(CNN) -- A coroner has adjourned the fourth inquest into the death of a baby believed to have been killed by a dingo in central Australia more than 30 years ago. Azaria Chamberlain was just two months old when she was snatched from a tent during a family holiday to Uluru, also known as Ayers Rock, sparking one of the country's most sensational and enduring murder mysteries. Her mother, Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton, long maintained that a dingo, a wild dog native to Australia, took her baby, even as she was sentenced to life in jail for daughter's murder, a conviction that was later quashed. Her cries of a ""dingo's got my baby"" were immortalized in the 1988 film ""A Cry in the Dark,"" starring Meryl Streep who earned an Oscar nomination for the role. Outside Darwin Magistrates Court on Friday, Chamberlain-Creighton said she hoped the ruling would help educate the public about the dangers posed by dingoes. ""It gives me hope that Australia will finally realize dingoes are dangerous and hope that justice will finally be done for my daughter as well,"" she said. A ruling is expected next week. Chamberlain-Creighton is seeking to change the open verdict on her daughter's death certificate to indicate that she was taken by a dingo. ""There is a lot of new evidence. The last inquest was in 1995 and since then there have been a number of significant dingo attacks,"" said Stuart Tipple, the lawyer representing Chamberlain-Creighton and her former husband Michael. It is the fourth inquest into Azaria's death. The first inquest, in 1981, found that the baby died as a result of being taken by a dingo, but a second the following year committed her mother to trial for murder. The 35-day hearing created a media frenzy in Australia as commentators picked apart the intricacies of the case, while a fascinated public speculated wildly as to why and how Azaria had died. ""A lot of people just never believed a dingo was capable of doing it,"" Tipple said. The jury returned its verdict in 1982: Chamberlain-Creighton was found guilty of slitting her daughter's throat with a pair of scissors before hiding the body and concocting a story about a dingo to cover her crime. She was sentenced to life in jail. Her husband Michael was given a suspended sentence after being found guilty of being an accessory after the fact. The couple had two other children; two boys aged six and four at the time of Azaria's death. Chamberlain-Creighton served four years of her sentence before the Northern Territory government ordered her release in 1986 after the discovery of new evidence; a baby's jacket, believed to be Azaria's, found half-buried near a dingo lair at Uluru. In 1988, a Royal Commission set up to review the evidence formally quashed convictions for both husband and wife. Despite the finding that the couple was not to blame, a third inquest into their daughter's death returned an open verdict in 1995. It's that ruling that the Chamberlains now want changed. ""Certainly, like any parent, they want closure and they're not going to be able to get closure until the record's correct,"" Tipple said. ""At the moment an open finding is not a correct finding."" ""There's certainly a personal part in the journey but they want to warn people and make sure the tragedy doesn't occur again,"" he said. On Friday, he presented the coroner with evidence of at least 12 ""very significant"" dingo attacks in Australia since the last inquest in 1995. In one of the worst cases, a nine-year-old boy was killed, and his friend mauled, by two dingoes on Fraser Island, off the coast of Queensland, in 2001. Twenty-eight dingoes were culled in the public outcry that followed. The world's largest sand island, Fraser Island earned UNESCO World Heritage status for its ""exceptional beauty"" and its rare combination of tall rainforests and towering sand dunes. It's also home to the largest population of native Australian dingoes -- around 200 animals living in up to 30 packs -- and the site of most, if not all, dingo attacks. ""On Fraser Island the dingo has a particularly difficult role because tourists are as interested in the dingo as the dingo is interested in food,"" said Professor Gisela Kaplan, a dingo expert from the University of New England in New South Wales. ""Fear, very often, is the only thing that stands between a dangerous animal and a human. Once that fear is lost any predatory animal can become dangerous,"" she said. Dingo management strategies have been introduced in areas of the country where the mammals are prevalent. Fraser Island's includes approval to cull specific animals considered to pose a threat to humans. ""Once a dingo has lost its fear of people and starts to use aggressive tactics to gain dominance over, or food from, people the habit cannot be changed,"" according to the Queensland government's campaign ""Be dingo-safe!"" It adds: ""These dingoes display aggressive or dangerous behavior such as nipping and biting, and in some cases this escalates very quickly to attacks and serious mauling."" The Chamberlain's lawyer Stuart Tipple says that, if nothing else, the couple hopes a change in the official cause of Azaria's death makes ""public authorities more aware of their responsibilties. ""This will make them fine tune, hopefully, those plans and make them current and keep updating them,"" he said. Where once many people -- including the jury that convicted Lindy and Michael Chamberlain -- believed that it was unlikely that a dingo would kill a baby, evidence in recent years shows that is indeed possible. However, Kaplan said public opinion had swung too far the other way, and Australia's largest native predator had been unfairly ""demonized."" ""A dingo is a suitable animal to be demonized, isn't it? In one way you can know it, and in the other way it's mysterious,"" she said. Kaplan warned that if more wasn't done to protect the animals in their natural habitat, they would eventually die out. ""This is a very rare and endangered Australian native animal,"" she said. ""If that goes extinct, there will be outcry in future that we've allowed that to happen, because there are so many misconceptions about the animal.""","Inquest adjourned into death of baby believed to have been killed by dingo .

"(CNN) -- Less than two weeks after the Costa Concordia cruise disaster, customers are still booking cruises for 2012 -- even as they ask more questions about safety at sea. The cruise industry is in the middle of its ""wave season,"" the first three months of the year when the majority of customers book their cruises. ""While I'm engaging in lots of conversations with customers, I'm going to say -- knock on wood -- I haven't seen any negative effect on booking levels or trends as of yet,"" said Scott Kertes, owner of Hartford Holidays Travel in Garden City, New York, who focuses primarily on the luxury market. ""The real worry is the younger market, the first-time cruisers. It's still a little too early to see if there's going to be any fallout."" He expects budget cruise lines to start aggressively discounting their fares to lure the hesitant first-time cruisers aboard. Choosing ships subject to U.S. regulations . Cruises Etc. Travel owner Ruth Turpin says she hasn't had any cancellations of existing reservations. In fact, her bookings have increased over last year, and customers are booking Alaska and Scandinavian cruises. However, the Fort Worth, Texas, agency owner notes that her clients are experienced cruisers who primarily sail on the luxury lines. Turpin books her clients only on cruise lines where English is the ship's primary language and on ships subject to U.S. Coast Guard inspection. (Neither was true of the Concordia.) ""I think our customers have known through the years that these cruise lines have a really strong ethic with safety,"" she said. Safety drills are ""the first thing that happens the minute they get on the ship."" Cruise prices are actually up 1% since the beginning of the year, according to the UBS Cruise Tracker released Tuesday. Cruise prices in the Caribbean and Alaska are up moderately over the past few weeks, while Mediterranean pricing has been stable since November. The impact of the Concordia on pricing is still unclear, says Michael Driscoll, editor of Cruise Week, a trade industry publication. ""It's anyone's guess right now,"" Driscoll said. ""It's safe to say the lawyers in the cruise industry will be working overtime in the next few months. It's just hard to predict right now, because it really is unprecedented."" Cruise industry analyst Matthew Jacob said he suspects that bookings have dropped while pricing has held steady because travelers who are concerned about safety aren't likely to be swayed by lower prices. ""I think that if, in fact, bookings have slowed and they continue to be weak for another couple of weeks, I believe at that point, we may start to see prices come down,"" said Jacob, a director with ITG Investment Research. Other factors may decrease demand . Caribbean cruise lines, heavily dependent on cold weather to attract U.S. customers tired of the snow, have seen bookings decline as warmer weather has kept people at home, Kertes said. Mediterranean cruise lines were already facing lower demand because of high U.S. airfares to Europe and economic instability in Greece and Turkey, Kertes said. Turpin notes that there are a lot of ships sailing in the Mediterranean, which means bookings are being spread across many cruise lines. Customers are asking more questions about safety drills and safety records, travel agents say. The fact that the Costa Concordia didn't conduct a same-day safety drill for passengers boarding the ship was surprising to some agents, and Kertes says he expects more cruise lines to tighten their safety procedures and have drills before a ship sails. CNN's Marnie Hunter contributed to this report.","Luxury travelers are still booking cruises .
Some cruisers show a preference for U.S.-regulated ships .

"(CNN) -- My political friends on the right always talk about small government, being fiscally responsible, and not burdening our children with a massive debt. OK, no problem. So, I need a Republican in Missouri, or anywhere else, to explain to me why the state is holding a GOP primary Tuesday that will cost taxpayers more than $7 million and will have no effect whatsoever on the delegates chosen by the party in the GOP presidential race. When Republicans in Missouri head to the polls, they are voting in what is called a nonbinding primary. That means no matter who wins the popular vote, it will not determine who wins the state's 52 delegates -- three of whom are unpledged Republican National Committee delegates. On March 17, Missouri Republicans will caucus in counties to elect congressional district and state convention delegates. Then on April 21, they will select 24 of the state's 52 delegates and award them to presidential candidates. And then on June 2, the Missouri GOP will meet in a statewide convention to choose the remaining delegates. That means today's vote is a waste. Missouri state officials need to tell the state GOP that if they want a primary, they should pay for it themselves. Missouri is called the Show Me State.

"Washington (CNN) -- The military's top brass went into damage control mode Friday after a picture of an elite Marine unit posing with a flag symbol that is similar to a Nazi ""SS"" logo surfaced on the Internet a day earlier. First, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta asked the Marine Corps to look into the matter and take appropriate action, according to Pentagon spokesman George Little. ""Racist and anti-Semitic symbols have absolutely no place alongside the men and women of America's armed forces,"" Little said in a statement. Then the Marine Corps Commandant, Gen. James Amos, weighed in, apologizing to ""all offended by this regrettable incident."" ""I want to be clear that the Marine Corps unequivocally does not condone the use of any such symbols to represent our units or Marines,"" Amos said. Marine Corps Scout Snipers from the 1st Reconnaissance Battalion are seen in the photo standing and kneeling with their sniper rifles in front of a blue flag with white Nazi ""SS"" runes. The picture was taken in 2010 in Afghanistan and the photo's description says the ""SS"" flag had been ""adopted and used by the Marines in reference to Scout Sniper."" The Military Religious Freedom Foundation was alerted to the photo by Marines who expressed their concern, said group founder Mikey Weinstein. MRFF then distributed it to news organizations. The Marine Corps said it became aware of the photo last November and the local command investigated, but found it not to be racially motivated, according to a statement released by a Marine Corps spokesman, Lt. Col. Stewart Upton. The unit's commander decided not to proceed with disciplinary action, it said, but all Marines in the unit were reminded that such behavior will not be tolerated and any further display could result in punishment. ""They determined that the Marines in the photo were ignorant of the connection of this symbol to the Holocaust and monumental atrocities associated with Nazi Germany,"" Amos said in his statement Friday. The Marines involved were made to take a formal instructional class, however, so that they fully understood the historical use of the SS symbology, he said. In Nazi Germany, SS stood for ""Schutzstaffel,"" the elite paramilitary force of Adolf Hitler's party. SS units were frequently involved in war crimes, including the extermination of millions of Jews. Weinstein said the Marines who spoke out were infuriated by the photo but were worried about reprisal from their chain of command. In a letter to Amos, Weinstein's foundation asked that ""everyone associated with the matter, including anyone who condoned it, be the subject of immediate and public court-martial proceedings."" A Jewish human rights group, which also called on the U.S. government to open a new investigation into the matter, said it received a call from Panetta's chief of staff, Jeremy Bash, informing them that the secretary shares the groups concerns that this is a very serious matter. ""I feel reassured that Secretary Panetta himself has now taken charge of this matter,"" said founder and dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Rabbi Marvin Hier. While the insignia has been unofficially used by Scout Snipers in the past, the Marine Corps said it is absolutely prohibited, the statement from Upton said. ""Certainly, the use of the ""SS runes"" is not acceptable and Scout Snipers have been addressed concerning this issue,"" the statement said. ""'SS runes are prohibited from use as a symbol or any other use."" In Amos' statement Friday, the top Marine outlined the steps the service will take to make sure all Marines understand the Corps' position. Amos directed commanders to investigate the prevalence of the use of SS or other unauthorized symbols within the reconnaissance and sniper communities, and dispatched the Marine Corps' sergeant majors to meet personally with every senior staff noncommissioned officer. He asked that the commanding general in charge of training and education review the current sniper school curriculum to ensure it contains prohibitions on the use of SS and other inappropriate symbols.","NEW: Panetta orders investigation; Marine commandant apologizes .

"TBILISI, Georgia (CNN)  -- The leaders of a former Eastern Bloc nation and four former Soviet republics showed support for Georgia in its conflict with Russia at a massive rally in Georgia's capital Tuesday night. The leaders of five nations stand on stage with Georgia's president during a rally in Tbilisi. The presidents' appearances came shortly before France's leader announced that Georgia had accepted a Russian-French plan to end the conflict. Thousands cheered as the presidents of Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia stood with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili at a rally in Tbilisi, Georgia, late Tuesday. Like the latter four, Georgia is a former Soviet republic. At the rally, Saakashvili said the countries represented ""the new Europe,"" and said Russia was trying to occupy ""a real European country"" when fighting started last week. The European Union and the United States have accused Russia of infringing on Georgia's sovereignty. At the rally, Estonia's president, Toomas Ilves, said that ""if you do not believe in freedom and democracy, you don't belong in Europe."" ""It's only you people who believe in democracy and freedom that belong in Europe,"" Ilves said. Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, dismissed the presidents' appearance at the rally as ""rhetoric."" Churkin offered harsh words for Saakashvili, calling him an ""inadequate"" leader. ""I think Georgian authorities must put an end to the rhetoric and get back to serious business,"" Churkin told CNN, referring to a six-point plan announced by the Russian and French presidents earlier in the day that aims to settle the conflict over Georgia's separatist territories. Later, French President Nikolas Sarkozy said Saakashvili had agreed to the plan, in which Russia would agree to conclude military operations, return its armed forces to the line preceding last week's start of the conflict and not use force again in Georgia. The plan stops short of specifically addressing the issue of Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Asked on CNN's ""Situation Room"" whether Moscow wants Saakashvili removed from Georgia, Churkin replied, ""It is our recommendation."" ""He has performed some horrific acts toward the people of South Ossetia, some major crimes against humanity have been committed which have been qualified as genocide and ethnic cleansing. It would be good for everybody -- him, his country and the international community -- for him to go."" But, Churkin added, ""We are not going to deal with him directly."" Violence has raged since Thursday, when Georgia launched a crackdown on separatist fighters in autonomous South Ossetia, where most people have long supported independence. Russia, which supports the separatists, responded Friday, sending tanks across its border into South Ossetia. The conflict quickly spread to parts of Georgia and to Abkhazia, another separatist region. Saakashvili accused Russia of provoking the war to justify a full-scale invasion of the former Soviet state. The Russians said Saakashvili attacked first in an attempt to gain control of South Ossetia. Hours before appearing with the five presidents Tuesday, Saakashvili made a separate address to the tens of thousands of people rallying in front of the parliament building in Tbilisi. Waving above the crowd during the rally were dozens of flags: red-and-white Georgian ones; a few red, blue and-orange striped banners of Armenia; and at least two American flags. Banners reading ""Stop Russia!"" were seen in the crowd as well as others showing a picture of a tank with a red X through it that said, ""Free us from Russian war.""

"(CNN) -- The breaking of plates may be a popular tradition practiced in his homeland, but Cypriot tennis player Marcos Baghdatis has just taken the pastime to a whole new level. Playing against Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka at the Australian Open in Melbourne on Wednesday night, Baghdatis was down two sets and looking shaky in the third when he let loose with a spectacular outburst. Sitting in his chair at a changeover, Baghdatis destroys his racket by smashing it into the blue Margaret Court Arena surface seven times, before calmly handing it to the ball boy. He follows through by giving another racket the same treatment. But it doesn't end there -- he repeats the process by demolishing two more rackets, not even bothering to unwrap them from their plastic first. The colorful tantrum seemed to briefly help; he went on to take the third set, but finally lost to Wawrinka 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 5-7 6-1. On Thursday Baghdatis was penalized with an $800 fine, a figure much smaller than the hundreds of thousands of hits his performance has attracted on YouTube.

"(CNN) -- Country music legend Dolly Parton on Thursday announced her company is in a partnership to open a new theme park in Nashville. The new 50/50 joint venture between Gaylord Entertainment Co. and Dollywood will be developed on a 114-acre site for a family entertainment zone across from the Gaylord Opryland Resort and Convention Convention Center. Phase I of the $50 million project will be a water and snow park. Groundbreaking is anticipated late this year or in early 2013, with the park's opening slated for summer of 2014. Parton, who turned 66 on Thursday, told CNN's Brooke Baldwin that ""we are going to be bringing more family entertainment into Nashville."" The Dollywood company will serve as the project's operating partner and will employ 450 full- and part-time employees, Parton said. The park will provide a mix of high-energy water activities for the summer season and designated snow activities for winter play. The first-year attendance is projected to be a half-million. The park will be similar to the Snow Mountain attraction at Stone Mountain Park near Atlanta, according to CNN affiliate WKRN. ""Tourism is the second-largest industry in Tennessee, generating more than a billion dollars in tax revenue annually and employing more than 170,000 Tennesseans,"" Gov. Bill Haslam said in a statement. ""This project will be a welcome addition to the wide variety of attractions and destinations across our great state, and I applaud the collaboration and spirit that has led to this announcement."" ""We are thrilled by the prospect of bringing to Nashville a family focused entertainment center with one of the pre-eminent theme park owners and operators in the country,"" said Colin V. Reed, chairman and chief executive officer, for Gaylord Entertainment. An additional 35 acres will be reserved for future developments.","Dollywood, Gaylord Entertainment launching new theme park in Nashville .

"(CNN) -- Arsenal recovered from two goals down at halftime to beat Aston Villa 3-2 in their English FA Cup fourth round tie at the Emirates Sunday. Arsenal looked headed out of this year's competition after goals from Richard Dunne and England striker Darren Bent left them trailing. But Arsene Wenger's men grabbed three goals in eight second half minutes to spare their blushes in the all-Premier League clash. Two Robin van Persie penalties to take his tally for the season to 25 were separated by a Theo Walcott goal. ""We wanted to stay in the Cup,"" Wenger told ESPN as he explained their recovery. ""Two-nil was very harsh for us at half-time. It was just a question of keeping our structure and then we got an early (goal to make it) 2-1."" In an earlier clash Sunday, Sunderland salvaged a 1-1 home draw against second flight north-east neighbors Middlesbrough. Barry Robson gave Middlesbrough a deserved first half lead, but it was his mistake that allowed Frazier Campbell to score the equalizer on his return after a long-term injury. The winners of their replay will take on Arsenal in the last 16, while Liverpool's reward for knocking bitter rivals Manchester United out of the FA Cup Saturday was a home tie against second-tier Brighton. Tottenham, third in the Premier League, must travel to Stevenage, who play in the third flight, while favorites Chelsea are at home to Birmingham, who won last season's League Cup but were also relegated.","Robin van Persie scores twice as Arsenal beat Aston Villa 3-2 .

"(CNN) -- President Obama used the State of the Union address to outline an agenda for the coming year and, more importantly, to define what his goals would be should he be re-elected in November. As Republican presidential candidates engage in a bitter civil war for the nomination to oppose him, Obama has stepped up at this moment to offer a blueprint to strengthen the middle class, diminish inequality and revitalize the economy. Obama has attempted to turn his source of weakness, the laggard condition of the economy, into his strength by going on the offensive about how to make things better. Whereas Mitt Romney and other Republicans have defined Obama's policies as a form of European socialism, Obama has argued that protecting the middle class is the only way to reclaim American values. The final State of the Union address for a first-term president is always a mix of policy and politics. Tuesday night, the president brought together a number of themes that have been shaping his speeches since September. The speech blended some of President Jimmy Carter's harsh realism with President Ronald Reagan's endless optimism. Obama warned of the growing economic divide between the wealthy and the rest of the nation. He spoke about the challenges that middle-class Americans, the backbone of our economy, face every day. Whereas he started his presidency focused on the stability of financial institutions, now he has turned his attention to the stability of American families. He is no longer just talking about economic recovery. The remainder of his time in office, we know now, will be about economic revitalization. ""Think about the America within our reach,"" the president proclaimed, ""A country that leads the world in educating its people. An America that attracts a new generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs. A future where we're in control of our own energy, and our security and prosperity aren't so tied to unstable parts of the world. An economy built to last, where hard work pays off, and responsibility is rewarded."" Rather than running away from Washington, President Obama embraced the historical value of government. He said: ""During the Great Depression, America built the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge. After World War II, we connected our states with a system of highways. Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the workers who built them to the businesses that still use them today."" The speech is certainly a good start to his re-election effort. It comes at a time when Newt Gingrich's attacks on Mitt Romney have ironically fueled a critical discussion that emerged from Occupy Wall Street about the damaging consequences certain kinds of economic behavior can have and about the inequity of the tax system enabling some Americans to enjoy growing riches when so many others are struggling to get by. Tuesday night Obama put himself squarely on the side of the middle class and economic fairness. But the speech is not a game changer. The truth is that the State of the Union address is not what it used to be. The reality is that fewer Americans are tuned in given the endless menu of cable stations and websites that offer voters something else to see. Moreover, economic conditions are still poor. Even with some signs of progress, unemployment remains extremely high and household security is fragile. If voters are going to make their decision based on the health of the economy, many might very well decide to move toward the GOP. Given how difficult it has been for Congress to handle the most routine decision, voters will be skeptical about President Obama's ability to handle the kinds of issues he discussed in his speech. How can a president and Congress transform the infrastructure of the economy if they can't even pass regular appropriations bills without a high-stakes showdown? A speech about economy and promises of policy are not the same as improved economic conditions. Finally, in our short-attention-span political culture, speeches this far away from the election only have limited effect. What matters will be what the president is saying, what events are taking place, and how the Republicans are doing in September and October. Notwithstanding these limits, the speech is a good start in terms of outlining the issues that President Obama needs to emphasize if he is to excite Democrats and attract independents. Rather than entering in a defensive posture, focusing just on crisis and conflict, President Obama has instead chosen to define the terms of the debate and to offer a positive vision for the future. He has argued that the values of his administration are as American as apple pie. When the Republicans are done squabbling among themselves and select a nominee, they will face the burden of offering a vision of their own rather than simply being the anti-Obama alternative.

"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- At least 84 Nigerian children have died after ingesting teething medicine that contained a solvent typically found in antifreeze, the country's health minister said Friday. The My Pikin teething medicine has been reomved from shops in Nigeria. Some 111 babies and children have been sickened since November by the tainted batch of My Pikin, which was found to contain diethylene glycol, which is used in some antifreeze and brake fluid. Tests on the teething formula showed high concentrations of diethylene glycol, Health Minister Babtunde Osotimehin said in a statement released Friday. Exposure to the solvent can damage the kidney, heart and nervous system, Osotimehin said, and it can be fatal. The dead ranged from age 2 months to 7 years, he said. ""The death of any Nigerian child is a great loss to the nation,"" he said. Several officials with pharmaceutical company Barewa Pharmaceutical Ltd have been charged with negligence. And the Nigeria National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, which is investigating the issue with the Ministry of Health, has shut the drug maker down. Former officials of the company could not be reached for comment. The food and drugs agency has said it believes the company thought it was buying propylene glycol, a normal ingredient in the teething medicine. The government has asked that all My Pikin teething formula be returned; however, it was not immediately clear if that had been done. Symptoms of diethylene glycol exposure include: abdominal pain; nausea or vomiting; dizziness; drowsiness; confusion; and decreased or lack of production of urine.","Drug company taints My Pikin teething medicine with antifreeze ingredient .

But what exactly is that person watching next to you? And why are they getting so excited? And now why are they crying? Orgasms and tears are on the menu for some airplane movie watchers, it seems -- but they arrive with warnings. Qantas has taken in-flight entertainment to dizzying heights by including among its offerings a 50-minute French documentary ""The Female Orgasm Explained,"" which comes inclusive of naked scenes and reveals the mysteries of female sexual pleasure, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.

While Qantas is warning about sexually explicit material, Virgin Atlantic is giving warnings on a different topic: tears. The Australian reports that Richard Branson's airline surveyed travelers and found that 55 percent had heightened emotions during flight --- funny, that. What's more, 40 percent of men hid under their blankets to hide their tears. (What are Qantas travelers doing under that blanket?)

"(CNN) -- Lady Gaga is already the reigning queen of Twitter, with her nearly 19 million followers topping those of anyone else on the site. Now, she's launching a site of her own. Little Monsters, now in invite-only beta testing, is the pop princess's effort at creating a network built around her fan base -- which she's dubbed the aforementioned ""monsters."" An early look at the site suggests it will be designed a lot like Pinterest, the fast-emerging mobile app that lets users ""pin"" locations and items that they like. Gaga's site also will emphasize sharing and creating photos and videos, as well as letting other users promote content from others that they like (something similar to sites like Reddit and Digg). The site is the first project by Backplane, the startup where Lady Gaga's manager, Troy Carter, is one of four founders. The company will focus on online community-building. ""Backplane is about bringing together communities and Gaga's community just so happens to be the community we're using to learn about proper functionality,"" CEO Matt Michelsen said to Mashable, a CNN content partner. ""We think we can really change the world."" When other sites are launched, Backplane allows user to switch back and forth among as many as they want. Even with Gaga's massive social-media presence (she was the first artist to hit 1 billion YouTube video views), it remains an open question whether a social site devoted almost exclusively to her fans will have a big enough user base to fly.

"Paris (CNN) -- The brother of a gunman killed in a siege in southwestern France has been charged with complicity in seven murders and two attempted murders and taken into custody, the Paris prosecutor's office said Sunday. Abdelkader Merah is also being charged with conspiracy to prepare acts of terrorism and group theft, the prosecutor's office told CNN. He was arrested Tuesday night as police closed in on his brother Mohammed and faced a anti-terror judge on Sunday. Mohammed Merah, 23, was killed Thursday at the end of a 32-hour siege of the apartment in the city of Toulouse where he was holed up. He was wanted in the killings of three French paratroopers, a rabbi and three children ages 4, 5, and 7. Two other people were seriously wounded in shootings blamed on him. A spokeswoman for Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said Saturday an autopsy showed Mohammed Merah had been struck more than 20 times by bullets. Most of the impacts were on the arms and legs, Elisabeth Allannic said. There were two deadly wounds on the front left temple and crossing his abdomen, she said. Police also questioned Mohammed Merah's mother and his brother Abdelkader's girlfriend, but have released them without charge, the Paris prosecutor said. Police union leader Christophe Crepin told French TV news channel i-tele Saturday that Abdelkader Merah and his girlfriend were moved early Saturday from Toulouse to the headquarters of the DCRI, the French counter intelligence agency, in Levallois-Perret, near Paris. The brothers' mother, Zoulika Aziri, was released Friday night, police in Toulouse confirmed. She lives in the Toulouse suburb of Mirail, CNN affiliate BFM-TV reported previously. Police tracked Mohammed Merah down via his mother's computer IP address, which was apparently used to respond to an ad posted by the first shooting victim, officials said. The interior ministry said Saturday it had lifted the scarlet state of alert, the country's highest security alert level, which was put in place in the Toulouse region following the third shooting on Monday targeting a school. France's prime minister defended the police and intelligence services Friday over their handling of the case, saying they had done well to find Mohammed Merah so quickly. Questions have been raised as to why Mohammed Merah -- a petty criminal who was placed under surveillance by French authorities after visiting Pakistan and Afghanistan -- was not being more closely watched. He claimed to have attended an al Qaeda training camp, according to Paris prosecutor Francois Molins, and was on the U.S. no-fly list for that reason, a U.S. intelligence official said. Fillon told French radio station RTL that ""there was no single element"" that would have allowed the police to arrest Mohammed Merahbefore the killings began. Toulouse lawyer Eric Mouton, acting for a woman named only as Aicha, to protect her identity, told CNN she filed a complaint against Mohammed Merah in June 2010 over alarming behavior Merah displayed toward her children and herself. Aicha claimed that Mohammed Merah had beaten up her daughter, 19 at the time, and had threatened her. He also held her son, 15, against his will in a room for several hours, forcing him to watch extremely violent videos, Mouton said. Mohammed Merah denied that claim, the lawyer added. At the time of his death, the case was still open and had not yet gone to trial because of a backlog of cases at the Toulouse public prosecutor's office, Mouton said. Investigators say Mohammed Merah filmed the attacks in which he killed seven people. He was tracked down by police 10 days after the first shooting on March 11. In that attack, Imad Ibn Ziaten, a paratrooper of North African origin, arranged to meet a man in Toulouse who wanted to buy a scooter Ziaten had advertised online, the interior minister said. The victim said in the ad that he was in the military. Four days later, two other soldiers were shot dead and another injured by a black-clad man wearing a motorcycle helmet in a shopping center in the city of Montauban, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Toulouse. In the attack at the private Jewish school Ozar Hatorah on Monday, a man wearing a motorcycle helmet and driving a motor scooter pulled up and shot a teacher and three children -- two of them the teacher's young sons -- in the head. The other victim, the daughter of the school's director, was killed in front of her father. Police said the same guns were used in all three attacks. CNN's Louis Fraysse, Anna Prichard and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","Merah's brother has been charged with complicity in murder and attempted murder .

"(CNN) -- After noticing smoke seeping inside, a North Carolina bus driver rushed six elementary school children off her vehicle moments before it burst into flames. The incident occurred Wednesday afternoon as Lindora Richardson was driving the children home from Chantilly Montessori Elementary School, a public school in Charlotte, school district spokeswoman Tahira Stalberte said. ""We are very proud of her and for her following proper procedures,"" said Stalberte, speaking on behalf of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, on Thursday. ""It could have taken a very different turn had she not done her job correctly."" Richardson told Vinnie Politan of HLN, CNN's sister network, that she was driving on her route through a Charlotte neighborhood when she detected a ""burning smell"" and pulled over to investigate. ""As that was going on, smoke started to come from under the dash of the bus,"" she recalled. At that point, Richardson guided the young students on board to the back of the bus. Describing the children as ""calm,"" she said that they exited ""one-by-one"" through the rear emergency exit. The bus driver said she and the students, ages 5 to 10, then ""walked so far up the street"" where they witnessed the smoke and flames engulf the vehicle. Video, posted on YouTube and apparently taken after the students had moved to a safe place, shows black smoke seeping out of open windows on the bus, as it sits along a residential street. Flames are then clearly visible creeping backwards from the front of the bus. Within just over a minute, fire had consumed about half the vehicle -- and shot up through the roof. There are no injuries related to the incident, Stalberte said. While describing Richardson as modest, the school district spokeswoman said that she deserves praise -- and she'll get some next week, when she is honored by the Charlotte Fire Department. ""I do have two kids, and I do love children, (and) I love my job,"" Richardson said of the satisfaction she gets working as a bus driver. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","A Charlotte bus driver notices smoke and evacuates 6 kids .

"(CNN) -- The widow of a man who set free 56 exotic animals he owned before apparently committing suicide will get back the five animals that survived, Ohio agriculture officials said Monday. A state review board concluded Monday that the animals, which have been kept at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, are free of ""dangerously infectious or contagious diseases."" The finding required them to lift a quarantine imposed in a move last October to delay their return. State officials said they were concerned that Marian Thompson has said she would put the two spotted leopards, two macaque monkeys and a large brown bear back into the same cages they previously inhabited on her Zanesville, Ohio, farm. ""This raises concerns, as she has indicated the cages have not been repaired, and has repeatedly refused to allow animal welfare experts to evaluate if conditions are safe for the animals and sufficient to prevent them from escaping and endangering the community,"" said Erica Pitchford, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Agriculture. Last fall in Ohio: Wild animals on the loose . State officials have no legal power to inspect the cages before the animals are returned, but they are hoping the local sheriff will seek a court order to inspect the farm ""to ensure the safety of the animals and the public,"" Pitchford said. Thompson has not allowed local law enforcement onto the farm to check the pens, Muskingum County Sheriff Matthew Lutz told CNN Monday. Thompson's lawyer did not immediately respond to a CNN call for comment. Deputies are ready to deal with any problems with the returned animals, Lutz said. ""We have the zoo on speed dial,"" Lutz said. ""If we are pushed to do what we had to do the last time, we would take care of it."" Terry Thompson died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on October 18 shortly after he pried open cages and opened the farm's fences that held his private menagerie of lions, tigers, bears, wolves and monkeys. Authorities, who did not have access to tranquilizer guns, killed two wolves, six black bears, two grizzly bears, nine male lions, eight female lions, one baboon, three mountain lions and 18 Bengal tigers. One monkey that was unaccounted for might have been eaten by one of the big cats, they speculated. Thompson's property is about two miles outside Zanesville, which is east of Columbus along Interstate 70. The 62-year-old had been released from a federal prison three weeks earlier after pleading guilty earlier to possessing illegal firearms, including five fully automatic firearms. CNN's John Fricke contributed to this report.","Board concludes animals are free of ""dangerously infectious or contagious diseases""

"(CNN) -- Vahram Muratyan's personal tale of two cities began with a serious case of the travel bug. Born in Paris, he started flying to New York with his family as a child -- the frequent trans-Atlantic trips made possible in part by his mother's job at the now-defunct airline TWA. ""I think I grew up with an obsession with the city,"" Muratyan said, vowing to one day move to the Big Apple. The graphic designer finally came to live in New York for three months in fall 2010 and found himself doing lots of people watching, sketching and thinking of home. ""The idea of comparing the differences between the two cities came because I was starting to miss Paris,"" Muratyan said. ""I was trying to understand why and what actually was missing from each city that was in the other city."" The result is ""Paris versus New York: A Tally of Two Cities,"" a whimsical little book of illustrations that first gained a following on Muratyan's blog and that pair everything from a croque-monsieur and a hot dog to cancan and Lady Gaga. The artist, who now spends time in both cities and calls the illustrations a friendly visual match between the two, recently spoke with CNN from his home in Paris. The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: What was your first impression of New York? Muratyan: The first thing I remember from the United States and New York is the amount of snow, because I was there during wintertime. We don't have that here -- we don't have 1 meter of snow in the city, we have 1 meter in the Alps when you go skiing. It always melts right away in Paris. I came back alone when I was 17 to celebrate the end of high school; I got the trip as a gift to go in the summertime. What struck me was New York's perspective: You are on the street and you can't see the end and it's just striking when you see the amount of buildings. Another strong memory: I used to have my own way of orienting myself in the city because I couldn't understand how it worked -- the avenues and the streets. I always got my bearings from the World Trade Center and when I came back in 2003 after 9/11, it wasn't there anymore, of course, and I was really lost. CNN: A lot of people are overwhelmed by New York. Did you ever feel that way? Muratyan: No, I feel really like I'm at home. I'm not overwhelmed by the urban jungle. CNN: What do you miss about each city when you're in the other metropolis? Muratyan: In New York, I used to miss my bike. But now I can even have a bike there, so it's becoming more European than ever. I used to miss baguette bread and now it's OK. I can find something much closer to Paris baguettes. And there's a big variety of bread there, so I don't care. In Paris, I miss the way people can talk to each other just for even five minutes in the street like in New York. People are more easygoing. It's something that is missing in Paris, in a way. Five lessons learned from living in Paris . CNN: Both cities have a reputation, deserved or not, that its residents are rude. What's your take on that? Muratyan: It's a superficial way of looking at the cities when you are there for four or five days. When you get to know the people better, you find they are absolutely exquisite. But you have to be patient -- more patient in Paris. Many people have that first reaction in the tourist places. I think it's because they're overcrowded and the waiters aren't patient any more. The best way is to move away a bit and to have a distance from that. CNN: Both cities are known for fashion. What are your observations on that? Muratyan: In Paris, it's much more minimal and when you are wearing something (unusual) people are like, who do you think you are? In New York, people give you compliments about it. I see ladies who keep looking at each other and they're not looking (to spot something) wrong, they're complimenting each other -- oh, I love your dress. It's something that's not often the case in Paris. The joys of slowly savoring Paris . CNN: What's your favorite illustration in the book? Muratyan: CDG-JFK. (Image No. 6 in the gallery.) I love airports because you are not gone, you are not home, you are in between. That illustration is all about traveling and not knowing where a plane is going when you're looking at its trail in the sky. CNN: What's your favorite meal in Paris? Muratyan: I love everything from a brasserie. Good brasserie food would include steak tartare, boeuf bourguignonne, bouillabaisse. CNN: What's your favorite meal in New York? Muratyan: Burgers. It's really very clichÃ©, but I can't help it.","Graphic designer Vahram Muratyan pays tribute to the two cities through illustrations .

Venus also admitted it was difficult to deal with the restrictions her illness had placed on her attempts to return to the court. She has not played a competitive match since the U.S. Open first round in August, but faced her younger sister in an exhibition match in November. ""The difference is acceptance,"" said Venus, who was part of the U.S. team which lifted the Fed Cup in 1999. ""Trying to accept how you feel and limitations. Listening to your body and taking care of yourself. ""Instead of trying to run through a wall, just really kind of take a step back and be smart. I think that's kind of what I've learned. ""I still have to be reminded to slow down, but hopefully there will be a day when I don't have to be reminded of that."" The U.S. team are in the second tier of the tournament for the first time after being relegated from World Group I last year. Serena, a 13-time grand slam winner, is looking forward to teaming up with her sister ahead of their possible pairing at the London 2012 Olympics. ""We played on the same team a few times,"" said Serena, who was also part of the team which defeated Russia in 1999. ""We always have a blast and always make the best of everything. ""We really enjoy every moment together because we don't sometimes get to spend a lot of time together. It's something that we really enjoy."" The main World Group matches see the Czech Republic begin the defense of their title away to Germany, while Australian Open finalist Maria Sharapova leads last season's runners-up Russia against Spain in Moscow. Belgium, who reached the last four in 2011, will be without Melbourne semifinalist Kim Clijsters for the home clash with Serbia, headed by world No. 13 Jelena Jankovic. Italy, beaten by Russia in last year's semis, take on Ukraine on clay in Biella.","World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka will return to the tennis court this weekend .
