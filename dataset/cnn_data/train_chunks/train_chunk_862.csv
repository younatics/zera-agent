"By . Stephen Wright . A review of the Madeleine McCann case has been launched by police in Portugal. Four years after the official inquiry into her disappearance was shelved, another squad of detectives has been told to examine the case files. The McCann family’s Portuguese lawyer said the move could have been prompted by fresh information that warrants a further hunt for clues. Fresh look: Portuguese police have set up a new team of detectives to review the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, pictured, it emerged today . The team, from the northern city of Oporto, has been instructed to go over the thousands of pages of case files to search for new leads. The development will provide fresh hope for Maddie’s parents Gerry and Kate McCann, who have never given up hope of finding their daughter alive. Mr and Mrs McCann have repeatedly called on the Portuguese authorities to resume the search for Maddie, who vanished just days before her fourth birthday in 2007. The case review is being carried out by Policia Judiciaria’s Regional Section of Criminal Investigation and Prevention in Oporto, led by Helena Monteiro. Optimistic: Kate and Gerry McCann hope that the new development will lead to the case into the disappearance of their daughter being reopened . Officers from the PJ are working with . the Scotland Yard team set up in May last year to review the . investigation into Madeleine’s disappearance. That multimillion-pound review is not expected to conclude until the end of the year. McCann family spokesman Clarence Mitchell said: ‘Kate and Gerry obviously welcome the work being done by the PJ in Oporto alongside that of the Met investigative team. ‘They clearly hope that it will lead to the case being reopened in due course. There is good co-operation between the Met and the PJ, and Kate and Gerry remain grateful  for the time and resources  that have been put into the search for Madeleine. ‘They will not be discussing any details whilst both the Met investigative review and the PJ work is continuing, but clearly it is a positive development.’ The McCanns’ Portuguese lawyer, Rogerio Alves, described the police case review as a ‘very positive sign’. He said: ‘More than anything Kate and Gerry want to discover what happened to their daughter, whilst of course harbouring the hope of finding her alive. ‘For that to happen, the police need to carry on looking for her and carry on following the leads at their disposal.’ Disappearance: The Ocean Club in Praia da Luz, Portugal, from where Madeleine McCann went missing in May 2007 . He also told a Portuguese TV station: ‘It’s not absolutely certain but what’s happening at the moment is that some of the information passed to the authorities could lead to a reopening of the case. Good news: McCann family spokesman Clarence Mitchell, pictured, said Kate and Gerry welcome the work being done by the Policia Judiciaria in Oporto alongside that of the Met investigative team . 'I can’t go into any sort of detail . and I hope people will understand me, but at this moment in time there . is something that aroused enough interest from the Portuguese and . British police to warrant this review in search of new clues. ‘This is all I can say but obviously . the most plausible explanation for what’s happening is this one, that . information passed to or acquired by the Judicial Police in Oporto has . put them on the trail of something specific.’ Detectives from Oporto are understood to . have travelled to the Algarve, where Maddie vanished on May 3, 2007, as . part of the review. She disappeared from a rented holiday apartment while her parents dined with friends a few yards away. Attorney general Jose Pinto Monteiro archived the case in July 2008. The Scotland Yard review, called Operation Grange, involves 30 murder squad detectives, some of whom have made at least four trips to Portugal and Spain. Last December, it was reported that they were examining eight ‘important’ new leads.","A new team of detectives will go over thousands of pages of case files and search for new clues .

"By . Associated Press . A four-day search for an Arkansas man and his ten-month-old son came to a grim end on Tuesday as authorities discovered their bodies in a remote area of the Ouachita Mountains, authorities said Tuesday. Brooke Floyd, 21, who was the wife of Brian Floyd, 33, and mother of Harper Floyd, remained in jail on Tuesday on a preliminary charge of endangering the welfare of a minor. She was seen with her husband and son on Friday morning, hours before she was found wandering alone on a remote dirt track in the area, which is about 80 miles west of Little Rock. Scroll down for video . Brian Floyd and his ten-month-old son Harper Floyd were found dead in the remote Ouachita Mountains on Tuesday . At the time, she looked 'cut up and scarred as if she had been in a wooded area,' Yell County Sheriff Bill Gilkey told the Southwest Times Record. He said Brooke Floyd 'spoke of a separation Friday night' and listed her marital status as 'single' on the police report. 'Investigators are still trying to get to the bottom of what caused the separation,' Gilkey added. Brooke Floyd didn't initially cooperate with the search effort and was arrested over the weekend on the child endangerment complaint, but she later led authorities to the family's truck, which was towed from the area on Tuesday. Gilkey said searchers found Harper's body . in the mountainous terrain at around 1.30pm and found his father's . about an hour later. The bodies were taken to the state crime lab for . autopsies. A backpack was alongside the bodies and an unidentified material, according to News 5. Investigators did not find a weapon at the scene. 'It's . not the outcome we certainly had hoped for and our prayers and thoughts . go out to the families involved,' Gilkey said at a news conference at . the remote site. Brooke Floyd, pictured with her son Harper, was arrested over the weekend for child endangerment. She initially didn't cooperate with search efforts but finally led investigators to the family's truck . Gilkey said investigators don't know yet whether they consider Brooke Floyd a suspect or a victim. The officer would not speculate on whether she will face additional charges. Nobody responded to a message seeking comment left on Tuesday at a number listed as hers. The sheriff said late on Tuesday that investigators were meeting with county prosecutors to go over the case, and said the review could take several days. Gilkey did not say whether the deaths were the result of homicide or accident. 'Right now, it's still the same; we're still in meetings, going back over everything that's happened since 1:30 p.m. last Friday,' Gilkey told the AP by phone. The Floyds, who lived in Greenwood, were seen together in a green pickup truck in Mansfield on Thursday evening and again the next morning in Yell County, between Moore's Chapel Cemetery and Lick Creek Recreation Area. According to an arrest report, Brian Floyd was previously questioned by police on July 20 after he falsely reported a burglary at his home. The report, seen by 5 News, reported that the 911 dispatcher told responding officers that the caller had a history of mental illness. Officers found Brian Floyd driving around his home in a 'manic state' and hallucinating, claiming that a woman had broken in and there was a police officer on the roof with a dog. Police reported no disturbances at the property. A family member told police he was having problems with his medication. The family's pick-up truck is towed away to be examined from where it was found in the Ouachita Mountains on Tuesday .","Brian .

"By . Emma Glanfield . The former bandmates of Lostprophets’ frontman Ian Watkins have told how they would have ‘killed him’ had they known he was a serial paedophile and child sex abuser. Watkins, 36, was sent to prison for 35 years last December after being convicted of a string of child sex offences - including the attempted rape of a fan's baby. His ex-bandmates, who have now formed a new group called No Devotion due to Lostprophets’ name being tarnished beyond repair, have spoken out about their shock and despair at learning of the rocker’s despicable crimes. Scroll down for video . The former bandmates of disgraced Lostprophets vocalist Ian Watkins have told how they would have 'killed him' had they known about his paedophile ways. Pictured together at the Kerrang! Awards in 2010: (from left) Lee Gaze, Stuart Richardson, Mike Lewis, Ian Watkins and Luke Johnson . Lee Gaze, Mike Lewis, Stuart Richardson, Jamie Oliver and Luke Johnson, who are all from Pontypridd, south Wales, said they had no idea about the vocalist's paedophile ways. Guitarist Gaze said: ‘How could you know? ‘Who would disclose such a thing to five people, who between them have eight children? You just wouldn't because they would be killed on the spot.’ Speaking to Radio 1's newsbeat, he said the band members were hit by two waves of shock – firstly when Watkins was arrested in December 2012 and a year later when he finally pleaded guilty. He said: ‘There was two sets of shock because there were the accusations - which was one thing. And then there was the actual, “Yeah I did do it” which was a year later. Ian Watkins was jailed for 35 years at Cardiff Crown Court in December last year for 13 sexual offences . ‘He dragged that out for a year, so we got hit by it twice."" Bassist Stuart Richardson added: ‘Even though I was completely done with him (by this stage), I hoped it was all a mistake, he was innocent, he had to be. ‘The first time, we knew the band was done. You can't go back from that.’ Towards the end of Lostprophets, Gaze said that Watkins had become increasingly distant from the band. ‘He was doing his own thing,’ he said. ‘That just grew worse over the years, the more he was using drugs. ‘He could be in the same city as me and I wouldn't hang out with him, even if we weren't playing shows.’ Watkins was handed a 29-year prison term - with an extended licence of six years - after pleading guilty to 13 sexual offences at Cardiff Crown Court. The offences included the attempted rape of an 11-month old child as well as encouraging a fan to abuse her baby via webcam. Police also found a stash of child porn videos - some of which he had made himself. Earlier this month, he was refused application to appeal his sentence after he tried to argue his sex crimes were 'not the worst'. His former bandmates are now trying to move forward with their new band No Devotion, with the help of singer Geoff Rickly who they have enlisted as their vocalist. Disgraced rocker Watkins, 36, was refused an application to appeal his sentence earlier this month after he tried to argue his crimes were 'not the worst'. His offences include the attempted rape of an 11-month old baby . They are currently in the middle of recording their debut album and said they have been overwhelmed by the support they have been getting. Rhythm guitarist Lewis said: ‘It was vindication almost that we were there and we are doing this and we do have an incredible support from people. ‘It's been incredibly cathartic. ‘It's time to move on and we just want to focus on that from here on in.’ Watkins' has been described as a 'sexual predator' Watkins was sentenced at Cardiff Crown Court in December last year and told he would have to serve at least 35 years before being considered for release. The court heard that after sexually touching a fan's 11-month-old baby, Watkins tried to have penetrative sex with the child. He also encouraged a second fan to abuse her child during a webcam chat and secretly stashed child porn videos, some of which he had made himself. Sentencing judge Mr Justice Royce told Watkins: 'Those who have appeared in these courts over many years see a large number of horrific cases. This case, however, breaks new ground. 'I am satisfied that you are a deeply corrupting influence, you are highly manipulative, you are a sexual predator, you are dangerous.' After pleading guilty to the charges, Watkins, 36, sent a message to a fan joking about the offences. 'I am going to put a statement out just to say it was mega lolz,' he said. 'I don't know what everyone is getting so freaked out about.'","Former bandmates of disgraced rocker still coming to terms with his crimes .

"By . Peter Rugg . Justin Bieber had YouTube to launch his platinum-selling career, and now a new teen Canadian heartthrob is using a fresh online tactic to dominate the charts. This Sunday, Toronto's Shawn Mendes took the No. 1 spot on iTunes with his debut album, capitalizing on the success of his massive following on Vine, where the 15-year-old old has spent years cultivating a base with of 2.9 million followers with short clips of his falsetto. The Daily Dot reports it only took 37 minutes for The Shawn Mendes EP to top the charts, as his 1.47 million Twitter followers tweeted #shawntonumber1. Scroll down for video . 15-year-old Toronto singer Shawn Mendes has taken the top spot on iTunes sales charts with the help of his massive online following . Mendes has built a loyal audience over the last few years, posting regular clips of his falsetto to Vine and cultivating a Twitter following of millions . His debut single, 'Life of the Party,' has already been viewed more than 2.5 milion times on YouTube. 'I posted a six-second clip of me singing 'As Long As You Love Me' by . Justin Bieber in August and it was an overnight sort of explosion,' he told Mashable. 'When I woke . up and I had 10,000 likes on that video, I was like, ‘What is going on?’ Social media is taking off. It’s an entire new world out there.' Like any teen idol or online sensation, he's drawing his share of think pieces and criticism. At The New York Times, Jon Caramanica called Mendes an 'emotional do-gooder' with a debut single that is 'depressing and dull.' 'Taken together, these videos reveal him as the teenager he is, a . not-quite-formed talent who thinks vibrato makes him sound serious and . falsetto makes him sound irresistible,' Caramanica writes. 'But earnestness is just about the . worst thing you can carry with you into a pop music career — earnest . attitude is one thing, earnest presentation and production something . else entirely. That misunderstanding hovers over “The Shawn Mendes EP” (Island), Mr. Mendes’s first release on a major label, and his . highest-profile attempt at putting his tender voice to work on . originals, not covers.' Another Canadian teen pop idol, Justin Bieber, got his start with clips on YouTube . But whether any of that actually matters is debatable, as Jezebel writer Dodai Stewart argues in a post titled 'Teen Vine Star Is Number 1 on iTunes Thanks to Teen Girls.' 'Neither Mashable, the Times nor Business Insider note . that Shawn's audience is mainly young women,' Stewart writes. 'A group that keeps on . proving itself a force to be reckoned with, whether it's Twilight/Divergent/Hunger Games . movie tickets, the One Direction juggernaut, or the fact that the album . from 5 Seconds of Summer debuted at number 2 on the Billboard charts. Don't underestimate the power of a passionate pack of teenage girls.'","Toronto's Shawn Mendes earned a record deal after cultivating a massive online audience for his singing clips .

"By . David Williams . and Louise Eccles . Prince William, has joined the royal photobomb phenomenon after smiling over cyclist Chris Hoy’s shoulder while he posed for a picture. The 32-year-old was following in the footsteps of his brother Prince Harry, who photobombed New Zealand Commonwealth Games officials in Glasgow - and they were so chuffed one of them made it their profile picture on Facebook. The Prince gave a cheeky thumbs up in the background of a selfie taken by New Zealand rugby sevens coach Sir Gordon Tietjens, Sport Manawatu chief executive Trevor Shailer and Massey University Professor Emeritus Gary Hermansson.

The three men in the their black and white New Zealand team kits leaned in with their arms around each other as the Royal popped up in the background in a white shirt. They were watching the 800m women's swimming freestyle in Glasgow on Monday night, which saw Welsh swimmer Jazz Carlin win gold. The Duchess of Cambridge was particularly keen to jump in when she found herself taking part in a rather unusual game involving three cans during a tour of the athletes’ village yesterday. The rules, explained to her by a group of local children, were simple enough – you knock down the three tins with a ball before running into the middle of a square, rebuilding them and jumping over them three times. Less simple, of course, was doing it in her Stuart Weitzman wedge heels and fitted Stella McCartney dress – but Kate, 32, managed it with panache and a big smile on her face. Look before you leap!

"By . Dan Bloom . and Joshua Gardner . The mother of an alleged carjacker charged with killing three children in an SUV crash has turned down a $110,000 reward for making him turn himself in, it is claimed. Jonathan Rosa, 19, was interviewed by police after his phone was found in the back seat of the car which hit the children on Friday at a fruit stand in North Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. But they let him go after he claimed it had been stolen, and it was only on Sunday - after speaking to his mother - that he handed himself to police. Scroll down for video . Charged: The mother of Jonathan Rosa (left) has reportedly turned down a $110,000 reward for making him turn himself in to police in the Philly carjacking case. He and Cornelius Crawford (right) have been charged . Gone too soon: The SUV crash in North Philadelphia on Friday killed seven-year-old Terrence Moore (left) and his brother Thomas Reed, 10 (right), along with their sister, who were selling fruit for their church . Third victim: Keiearra Williams, 15 (left and right) was standing with her two brothers at the time of the crash . They charged him and 22-year-old Cornelius Crawford with murder, carjacking, kidnapping and sexually assaulting the carjacking victim. Now Rosa's mother is said to have turned down the city's $110,000 reward for the carjacker's capture - saying she did not want to have anything to do with the money. As her teenage son was held in prison on suicide watch, Philadelphia Police's Homicide Capt James Clark and Rosa's attorney confirmed her decision to NBC10. A member of the Philadelphia Police press team told MailOnline: 'They're not in a position yet to give the reward to anyone - this case is only a week old. 'But I've heard the rumours that that was the case, that the mother was offered the money and turned it down.' The decision over who should earn the reward now rests with the Mayor's office. The crash on Friday, which also left the victims' mother Keisha Williams, 34, in a critical condition, has shocked the city of Philadelphia. Memorial: Heartsick neighbors pay their respects on Monday at a makeshift memorial for the three children in the spot where they were mowed down by carjackers while selling fruit at a church fundraiser . Senseless: The memorial for the children continued to grow through the weekend and into Monday . Earlier this week Philadelphia 76ers basketball legend Charles Barkley confirmed he would cover funeral costs for the three siblings. The trio were selling fruit at a church fundraiser when Crawford and Rosa allegedly lost control of the car they had stolen. Police said Rosa and Crawford forced a woman into her sport utility vehicle on Friday. Defense lawyer Christopher Warren, though, said Rosa got in the vehicle after Crawford carjacked it. He said Rosa will regret that decision the rest of his life but is now cooperating with police. Rosa and Crawford had been hanging out together for a few days when Crawford noticed a woman coming down the street and decided to carjack her, Warren said. Police said the woman was then forced at gunpoint into the back seat. The pair allegedy drove for about a mile before a tyre burst on the car, making them lose control at high speed with devastating consequences. NBA legend Charles Barkley (left) said he would pay for the funerals of Keisha William's (right) children . Anger: Neighbors jeered as one of the suspects was taken into custody by U.S. Marshals on Sunday . Witnesses reported seeing a car speeding through an intersection, then children lying motionless on the ground. 'We . now have three children who are gone, and their mother is fighting for . her life,' Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Everett Gillison told a news . conference. 'This is a tragedy for our city'. Rosa's attorney said he 'can't get the image of the girl flying over the hood of the SUV out of his mind.' Mr Warren said that after talking with his mother and pastor, Rosa turned himself in. 'He . and his mother sat down and decided the best thing they can do is try . and cooperate to atone for what happened,' he told TV stations. He said Rosa had never been arrested before and had planned to join the Marines in two months. The carjacked woman, who was sexually assaulted, and a friend helping the family sell fruit were also injured in the accident.

"By . Alasdair Glennie . For years she’s been seen as the main barrier to an Abba reunion. Now Agnetha Faltskog has revealed that the Swedish group are considering reforming more than 30 years after their acrimonious split. The 63-year-old said they are thinking about marking the 40th anniversary of their first big hit Waterloo next year with a concert. ‘Of course it’s something we’re thinking about,’ she told German newspaper Welt am Sonntag. Reunion? Agnetha Faltskog, left, was considered to be the main barrier to Abba getting back together. She formed the band with guitarist and songwriter Bjorn Ulvaeus, right, whom she later married .

"By . Richard Spillett . News of the World former deputy editor Neil Wallis and former features editor Jules Stenson have been charged with conspiracy to hack phones. They were both charged as part of Operation Pinetree, a Scotland Yard investigation into allegations that News of the World features staff had obtained information in this way. Wallis, nicknamed 'the wolf man', and Stenson are both accused of conspiring to illegally listen to voicemails between January 2003 and January 2007. Former News of the World deputy editor Neil Wallis (left) and former features editor Jules Stenson (right) have been charged over phone hacking, the Crown Prosecution Service announced today . Wallis was previously arrested under the main phone hacking investigation, Operation Weeting, in a dawn raid in July 2011, and was told in February last year that he would face no further action due to lack of evidence. Today, he said he is 'devastated' to face a 'swingeing, indiscriminate charge' of conspiring to hack phones, more than a year after he was told he would face no further action. In a statement, he said: 'I am devastated that, more than three years after my initial arrest, this has been brought against me. My family and I have already paid a huge price from the police’s very public attention. 'Perhaps it is inevitable that after being such an outspoken critic of the collateral damage and pain caused by this endlessly vindictive and enormously costly investigation the ire has been turned on me for something that occurred at News International which I was not party to and have always said was wrong. 'Sadly, legal reporting restrictions prevent me commenting further on this sad day.' Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson was jailed for 18 months for conspiracy to hack phones earlier this month. Today’s charge is under Operation Pinetree, a strand of the investigation specifically looking at the newspaper’s features department. Gregor McGill, from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said: 'The CPS has authorised the Metropolitan Police to charge Jules Stenson, former features editor of the News of the World, and to summons Neil Wallis, former deputy editor of the News of the World, with an offence of conspiracy to intercept communications in the course of their transmission, commonly known as phone hacking. 'We have decided there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that a prosecution is in the public interest.' Stenson and Wallis will both appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on August 21. Six other journalists who were also held as part of the inquiry have already been told they will face no further action. In February last year, Wallis’s solicitor said the journalist had suffered 'a terrible ordeal' by being left in limbo for nearly two years. He was employed by then-Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson as a PR consultant before his arrest in 2011, and Sir Paul was pushed to resign after the journalist was questioned by police. The former News of the World deputy editor also had close contact with then assistant commissioner John Yates, who also resigned after criticism of his links to the newspaper and the decision not to reopen the inquiry into phone hacking. Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson was jailed for 18 months for conspiracy to hack phones earlier this month.

"By . Tamara Cohen, Political Correspondent . Quiz presenter Sandi Toksvig, pictured, has come under fire for her joke about Ed Miliband . BBC presenter Sandi Toksvig was attacked by senior Labour politicians last night for comparing Ed Miliband to a ‘terminally ill child’. The host of the satirical Radio 4 programme The News Quiz was referring to the Labour leader’s eagerness to visit Barack Obama at the White House. Comedienne Miss Toksvig explained that the meeting this month had been organised by his election strategist and former Obama adviser David Axelrod. She then added that Mr Axelrod may have tricked the President into meeting Mr Miliband by claiming he was a dying youngster. Labour’s childcare spokesman Lucy Powell – who used to be Mr Miliband’s deputy chief of staff – said: ‘It’s in incredibly poor taste. I don’t know what she even means by that. 'I don’t want to be the sort of person who tells comedians what they can and can’t make jokes about, and listeners know the show is fairly close to the wire, but jokes about terminally ill children could cause great offence.’ Mr Miliband gave a speech on Friday – the same day that The News quiz was broadcast – railing against image-driven politics. In it, he joked about criticism of his appearance, including comparisons with Wallace – the toothy, animated character from the Wallace And Gromit films, and comical photographs in the Press of him eating a bacon sandwich. Miss Powell added: ‘There’s lots of stuff they could have joked about which would have been fair game – Ed Miliband mentioned some of it himself in his speech on Friday – but I don’t think it warranted going to quite such a dark place.’ On the radio programme Miss Toksvig said: ‘Labour leader Ed Miliband had an informal meeting with US President Barack Obama in the White House this week. ‘The meeting was arranged thanks to David Axelrod, the Labour campaign strategist who used to be Obama’s adviser, who may or may not have wangled the meeting by tricking his former boss into believing Miliband to be a terminally ill child.’ Brief meeting: Barack Obama, left, drops by to speak to Ed Miliband, right, in the US . Labour MP Steve Rotheram, who sits on the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, said: ‘I think it was in poor taste. But it’s for other people to judge whether they’ve gone too far.’ The Labour leader had a ‘brush-by’ with the President – when Mr Obama popped briefly into a meeting being held between Mr Miliband and a White House official. They spoke for 25 minutes about Ukraine, Syria and Gaza, climate change and the cost of living. A BBC spokesman said: ‘The News Quiz is aimed at an adult audience used to robust humour and edgy satire from the team.’ The News Quiz and its panellists are regularly criticised for going too far. Last year, a comedian on the show called former Education Secretary Michael Gove a ‘foetus in a jar’. Miss Toksvig also said that the Duchess of Cambridge ‘is not enough for me’, adding: ‘We used to admire women who got their place in life through marriage and having children, but I like to think we’ve grown up a bit.’ In 2011, the BBC defended her when she joked on the radio show that the Tories had ‘put the “n” into cuts’ during a piece on child benefit cutbacks.","BBC presenter under fire from Labour politicians following News Quiz joke .

"By . Laura Clark . Perfection: Girls' schools are campaigning to stop their pupils becoming obsessed with being perfect, a trait that can lead to eating disorders. Stock image . Top girls’ schools are on a quest to stop female pupils becoming obsessed with being perfect. Oxford High School for Girls has launched an initiative dubbed ‘The Death of Little Miss Perfect’, which aims to teach girls it is ‘fine not to get everything right’. The scheme includes online tests which become progressively harder within a time limit so pupils are unable to answer them. Headmistress Judith Carlisle said: ‘Real life is not about perfection. Even the most successful of lives has its share of setbacks, disappointments and failures.’ Meanwhile girls’ boarding school Heathfield, in Ascot, only allows pupils to carry mobile phones without internet access until they are 13 to keep them away from social media. Details emerged in the latest edition of high society magazine Tatler, out tomorrow. Dr Adrienne Key, lead clinician for eating disorders at the Priory, told the magazine that perfectionists were more likely to suffer from eating disorders – and social networking sites were driving an increase in the incidence of illnesses such as anorexia. ‘Perfectionism wrecks self-esteem unless it’s checked. It can be a brilliant trait to get you places, but unfortunately it involves a lot of self-criticism and unless you can moderate that, you become more susceptible to doing drastic things,’ she said. Dr Key said she had seen a ‘massive uptake’ in the number of patients citing social media as playing a role in their illness. ‘It’s exploded in the past five years. What social media is doing is making us more dissatisfied with our bodies, as well as pushing a message that they are modifiable,’ she said. Social media was encouraging eating disorders in people who might not previously have developed problems, she warned. ‘It’s like sitting someone who’s a bit run-down next to someone with a cold. They’re going to catch that cold. If you were more robust, with better immunity, you could withstand it. But social media is so powerful that it’s catching those who only have slight tendencies.’ At Oxford High, headmistress Judith Carlisle introduced ‘The Death of Little Miss Perfect’ last year to encourage pupils to ‘get real’, while still aiming high. ‘Real life is not about perfection,’ she said. ‘Even the most successful of lives has its share of setbacks, disappointments and failures. It’s as much my job to prepare students for this uncompromising and often unfair real world as it is to ensure that they have the A-level grades to get them to university. That’s why Little Miss Perfect, I’m afraid, just has to go.’ At Heathfield, headmistress Jo Heywood told Tatler of the subtle pressure to be perfect promoted by, among others, parents. ‘I’ve had parents in my study who’ve said “I want my daughter to go to Cambridge to study architecture”,’ she said. ‘And I’ve turned to them and said “lovely, but what does your daughter want?” Managing expectations:  ‘Real life is not about perfection. Even the most successful of lives has its share of setbacks, disappointments and failures,’ said Oxford High School headmistress Judith Carlisle . She also told of the difficulties in blocking websites which promote anorexia, known as ‘pro-ana’ sites. ‘Social media is a great thing, but also very dangerous. Pro-ana websites are so hard to block because new ones are constantly appearing,’ she said. Her pupils at Heathfield are only allowed ‘brick’ mobile phones without internet access until they are 13. The school has also introduced talks for parents on Instagram and Snapchat. ‘We teach the parents how to use Twitter, because it’s a different world. Some of them were quite shocked,’ added Mrs Heywood. Latest figures show that hospital admissions for eating disorders rose eight per cent in the 12 months to October 2013, to 2,560. Two schoolgirls, Sophia Parvizi-Wayne and Amber Van Dam, are now campaigning for mental health awareness to be put on the national curriculum. Ms Parvizi-Wayne suffered from anorexia and Ms van Dam helped her through it. ‘We want it on the manifesto of every political party. There has to be more education. It’s about constantly raising awareness,’ said Ms van Dam.","Oxford High School's initiative aims to tell girls it's okay to fail sometimes .

"By . James Chapman . David Cameron and George Osborne decided Theresa May ‘must not be promoted’ to the Foreign Office to stifle her leadership ambitions, it has been claimed. An official close to the Prime Minister was quoted as saying that a ‘central principle’ of the recent ministerial shake-up was that the Home Secretary must not advance further. Mr Cameron is said to want the Chancellor to succeed him when he stands down, probably halfway through the next Parliament if he wins the next election. Scroll down for video . Claims: Prime Minister David Cameron (left) and Chancellor George Osborne decided Home Secretary Theresa May (right) 'must not be promoted' to the Foreign Office to stifle her leadership ambitions, it has been claimed . But there is growing support for Mrs May, whose stock has risen even though she largely shuns the media and avoids the Westminster power games loved by many of her male colleagues. The Home Secretary recently overtook London Mayor Boris Johnson as the activists’ favourite to become the next Conservative leader. A poll also showed the Home Secretary is now the most popular member of the current Government. Mrs May, who has been hailed as ‘Britain’s Angela Merkel’ by her allies, would not countenance any sort of leadership challenge to the Prime Minister, and has repeatedly stressed her loyalty to him. Replacement? Mr Cameron is alleged to want Mr Osborne (pictured) to succeed him when he stands down . However, she is understood to regard Mr Johnson as ‘faintly ridiculous’ and is determined to prevent him becoming leader if the Tories lose the next election. Mrs May’s stock rose further following her extraordinary confrontation with police leaders earlier this year, which was hailed as one of the bravest political speeches of recent decades. Tory MPs expressed admiration for the Home Secretary’s declaration at the Police Federation conference that a string of scandals has left the very legitimacy of British policing under threat. Communities Secretary: There were also claims that Eric Pickles came 'within a whisker' of being sacked . Britain’s former ambassador to the US, Sir Christopher Meyer, said Mrs May had ‘echoes of Margaret Thatcher’ and had delivered ‘one of the most powerful, courageous and candid speeches by a Cabinet minister I have ever seen’. Mrs May’s ‘untouchable’ position in the Cabinet was bolstered when former Education Secretary Michael Gove came off worst in a public clash between the two over extremism. But although Mrs May – Britain’s longest-serving Home Secretary in more than 50 years – is said to have ambitions to become Foreign Secretary, the job was handed to former Defence Secretary Philip Hammond when William Hague decided to step aside to become leader of the Commons. ‘One of the central principles of the reshuffle was that Theresa must not be promoted,’ one official close to Mr Cameron told the Financial Times. A minister close to Mr Hammond said he was worried he had been deployed as a ‘block’ on Mrs May. But a senior Downing Street source said the suggestion the Prime Minister had snubbed Mrs May by giving the Foreign Office to another minister was ‘bizarre’, adding: ‘This claim is simply untrue. She is doing a brilliant job in one of the toughest and most important areas of Government. The idea she should have been moved is ridiculous.’ There were also claims that Communities Secretary Eric Pickles came ‘within a whisker’ of being sacked but Mr Cameron decided it would be ‘too much’ after demoting Mr Gove and sacking Environment Secretary Owen Paterson. Mr Pickles’ plight was helped by the fact he took the blame for a public row with Environment Agency boss Lord Smith during the winter floods, even though allies said Number Ten had suggested the minister attack him.","David Cameron decided Theresa May 'must not be promoted', says official .

The former boss of Lloyds who ran the bank while it defrauded taxpayers and racked up a £10billion bill for mis-selling PPI last night faced calls to give up his £192,000 a year pension. Nicknamed the ‘quiet American’, Eric Daniels was at the helm of Lloyds when it received a £20billion bail out from taxpayers in 2008. But the 62-year-old, from Montana, has managed to maintain a low profile. While the disgraced former boss of Royal Bank of Scotland Fred Goodwin was stripped of his knighthood and part of his bumper pension, Mr Daniels’ £4million nest egg – worth £192,000 a year - remains intact. And as the bank he ran for almost a decade was fined £218million for an extraordinary scam to rip off taxpayers, Mr Daniels was spotted at lunch at the exclusive White’s Club in Mayfair. This is conveniently close to the offices of consultancy firm StormHarbour, where Mr Daniels is employed as a senior adviser. Lloyds is the first lender to be fined for an extraordinary scam which enabled it to gain tens of billions of pounds in emergency funds from a Bank of England lifeboat scheme during the financial crisis, while fiddling the system to cut the fees it paid to use the scheme. Between April 2008 and September 2009 traders cut £7.8million off the fees Lloyds paid to the Treasury by manipulating the ‘repo’ rate which set the level of the fee. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said staff involved in the scam could be guilty of ‘criminal conduct’. Staff at Lloyds could also yet face a criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office which has been handed the evidence by City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority.The latest scandal has led to renewed calls to jail rogue bankers. Although there is no suggestion that Mr Daniels was aware of the wrongdoing, it occurred under his watch. So too did the manipulation of Libor interest rates which occurred between 2006 and 2009 and for which Lloyds has also been fined. Last night, Mr Daniels faced pressure to ‘show contrition’ and forfeit some his pension. John Mann, a Labour MP and member of the Treasury Select Committee, said: ‘The buck stops at the top. Eric Daniels should show contrition and hand back his pension. There should be no rewards for failure and wrongdoing.’ John O’Connell, from campaign group the TaxPayer’s Alliance said: 'The Libor scandal and PPI mis-selling have rightly angered millions of customers, and given that taxpayers were on the hook for Lloyds during some of this reprehensible behaviour, many would feel better if Mr Daniels were to hand back part of his pension pot.’ The pressure on Mr Daniels could increase tomorrow (Thurs) when Lloyds is expected to announce it has set aside another £500million compensation for customers mis-sold payment protection insurance scandal. Labour MP John Mann says Eric Daniels should 'show contrition and hand back his pension' This will take its total bill for the scandal to more than £10billion. The state-backed lender has already punished Mr Daniels for the scandal by using its powers to recover a £1.4million deferred shares bonus awarded to Mr Daniels in 2010 which he had not yet pocketed. But it is understood to be powerless to dock some of Mr Daniel’s pension as he is already receiving it. The only chance of this happening is if Mr Daniels follows the example set by James Crosby, the disgraced former chief executive of HBOS. Crosby last year forfeited his knighthood and £175,000 of his £580,000 annual pension. He said he was ‘deeply sorry’ for the disaster that unfolded at the banking giant after he left in 2006. HBOS was rescued by Lloyds in September 2008 after years of reckless lending forced it to the brink. Lloyds was crippled by the toxic loans and had to be rescued by taxpayers the following month. The latest row comes as the Bank of England is expected to today unveil new powers forcing staff at British banks to hand back bonuses up to seven years after they have received the money - even if they have spent it. Under the current regime, banks can only typically recover bonuses which have been awarded but not yet paid out. The new rules will be implemented on January 1 but will not apply to bonuses awarded before then. Yesterday there were also calls for bankers to swear an oath to raise standards after a string of scandals. An extract from the oath, suggested by thinktank ResPublica, says: ‘I will do my utmost to behave in a manner that prioritises the needs of customers.’ Another part says: ‘I will confront profligacy and impropriety whenever I encounter it, for the conduct of bankers can have dramatic consequence for society.’","Eric Daniels was at helm of Lloyds when it received £20bn taxpayer bail out .

"By . John Drayton . The 2014 Commonwealth Games have been the first to see boxers fighting without protective headgear in a controversial move by the International Boxing Association. The IBA last year ruled to stop the use of headgear in male bouts, citing medical experts who said it would help reduce concussions. The organisation said medical studies showed wearing headgear diffused blows to the head and allowed boxers to sustain more head shots - and potential brain damage - for longer periods of time.

But its critics include British pro George Groves, who said last year: 'They need the protection headguards give at this stage of their careers. I get paid to get hit in the head. These kids don't.' Today, . south London super-heavyweight Joe Joyce guaranteed at least a bronze . medal for England after pummelling Scotland's Ross Henderson to defeat . in Glasgow.

Joyce said: ‘That's one more down and two more to go. I've fought him twice before and I knew he'd come forward having a go so I knew what I needed to do. ‘Obviously I want to go in and finish him off, but I don't want to go in and catch a shot on the way in so had to stay switched on and watch out for the big hook to the jaw.’ Motherwell's flyweight firebrand Reece McFadden also guaranteed a medal after beating Botswana's Oteng Oteng via a unanimous decision.

McFadden said: ‘That was the toughest fight I've had so far and I knew I just had to hold it in and especially when I got the cut. ‘I'd like to think I can cope with the pressure, I definitely feel like I'm getting closer and there's no reason that gold shouldn't be mine.’ Northern Ireland's Ruari Dalton failed to book a semi-final meeting with McFadden when he was outpointed by Australia's Andrew Moloney in the quarter-finals.

"By . Marcus Townend . Kingman remained on course to take on 2013 winner Toronado in Wednesday's Qipco Group One Sussex Stakes as Glorious Goodwood turned on the taps. Clerk of the course Seamus Buckley was due to irrigate ‘about 75 per cent of the course’ which had turned good to firm under the baking sun on day one of the meeting. The Sussex Stakes is already down to four runners after War Command, one of Aidan O’Brien’s two entries, was pulled out lame. Foregone conclusion? Royal Ascot winner Kingman will take some beating in the Qipco Sussex Stakes . With John Gosden-trained Kingman having had a chip from an ankle joint removed last year, there were fears that owner Khaled Abdullah might pull out his Irish 2,000 Guineas and St James’s Palace Stakes winner. Those concerns were heightened when Ed Dunlop’s White Nile slipped and fractured a knee in the Bet365 Summer Handicap, won by Andrew Balding’s Van Percy. But Abdullah’s racing manager Lord Grimthorpe said: ‘The intention remains to run as long as it is not rock hard. Then there would have to be a discussion but hopefully they will be watering the course.’ Whether Paul Hanagan, White Nile’s jockey, will play any further part at the meeting is dependent on X-rays he was due to have on his left arm last night. After inconclusive assessment at the track, he flew back to Newmarket with his arm in a sling. Gone with the wind: Trainer Richard Hannon is hoping Tornado can change his fortunes at Goodwood . The fall has already cost the rider, who won Saturday’s King George at Ascot on Taghrooda, a winner with Tom Queally deputising on Inxile in the Casino at Bet365 Handicap. Hanagan is due to ride Taghrooda in next month’s Yorkshire Oaks. Meanwhile, Toronado’s trainer Richard Hannon will hope for better fortune on day two after having two odds-on favourites beaten. Beacon was twice hampered when third to Charlie Hills’s Cotai Glory in the Molecomb Stakes but Toormore travelled well before being beaten fair and square in the Lennox Stakes by Clive Cox’s Es Que Love. The latter’s jockey Adam Kirby is facing a lengthy ban over his use of the whip.","Kingman will race at Sussex Stakes in Goodwood after course was watered .

"By . Associated Press . and Lizzie Parry . Fears over the ability to contain the spread of the deadly Ebola virus were today heightened as it emerged the body of a teen stowaway was found aboard a U.S. military plane that landed in Germany. The Pentagon said the boy, believed to be from Mali, was found in a compartment above the rear landing gear of a cargo plane after it touched down at a military base. Air Force personnel found the boy's body Sunday night after spotting an orange cloth in a small opening by the landing gear during a detailed inspection of the C-130J aircraft when it landed at Ramstein Air Base. When they tugged on the wet cloth, they discovered it was attached to a boy in the compartment, officials said. Scroll down for video . Mysterious: The Pentagon's press secretary, Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby (seen in a July 18 file photo), said the stowaway was a black male who may have been of African origin . Concern: . Ebola (above) has already killed 672 people in Guinea, Liberia and . Sierra Leone and infected more than 1,200 since it was first diagnosed . in February. Symptoms include sudden fever, vomiting and headaches . There is no vaccine or cure for Ebola, which is spread by contact with infected blood or bodily fluids . The Pentagon's press secretary, Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, said the stowaway was a black male who may have been of African origin. The plane was on a routine mission in Africa and had made stops in Senegal, Mali, Chad, Tunisia and Naval Air Station Sigonella in Sicily before arriving at Ramstein. A senior U.S. official said that initial indications suggest that the boy likely climbed aboard in Mali. The official was not authorized to speak publicly about an incident under investigation and requested anonymity. Mali borders Guinea, the site of the first confirmed case of Ebola during the current outbreak, which has so far killed 672 people, infecting more than 1,200. Kirby said the body had been turned over to German authorities for autopsy, and the matter is under investigation. He said the cause of death has not yet been determined, but lab results from samples taken from the body were negative for communicable diseases. A stowaway aboard a military plane is a significant security breach. No Africa Command senior leaders were on the flight. 'Security is going to be looked at here. Obviously it would be,' Kirby said. 'We try to provide as much security as we can for our aircraft when they're operating in remote locations, and this will all be part of the investigation.' He added, however, that some of the airfields where the planes land are very remote and the security isn't always up to the standards that are followed in the U.S. and other nations. Kirby said the C-130J cargo aircraft stopped in several African countries before it arrived Sunday at Germany's Ramstein air base (file photo) Spreading: . The outbreak has hit Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and has now killed a . man in far more densely populated Nigeria. The outbreak is the . deadliest ever of the terrifying disease as the death toll crept past . 670 . US citizen Patrick Sawyer (pictured with his wife Decontee) died after contracting Ebola in West Africa . Symptoms of Ebola include high fever, bleeding, damage to the nervous system and vomiting . Kirby had no details about how . well-guarded the plane was during the Africa stops and said it was . unclear how the boy managed to get into the compartment. 'We'll learn what happened here, and if there's corrective action that needs to be taken, we'll take it,' he said. The . body was not detected in routine pre-flight and post-flight checks . during the trip, but was found during a more detailed maintenance . inspection of the cargo plane, said Kirby. The . current Ebola outbreak rampaging through West Africa is the largest in . history, spreading from Guinea to neighbouring Sierra Leone and Liberia. On Friday the first confirmed case of Ebola was recorded in the Nigerian capital of Lagos. Patrick . Sawyer, a U.S. citizen who had attended his sister's funeral in Liberia . after she died from the disease, died after travelling into Africa's . most populous country by air. Kirby said it is not known when or where the stowaway entered the compartment. The . two-day delay in making the incident public was due to the process of . having to remove the body, do the lab tests and provide official . notifications to the German government, he said. The Air Force is doing its own investigation, which will include a review of any potential security lapses. In . April, a Somali immigrant survived a flight from San Jose International . Airport in California to Hawaii stowed away in the wheel well of a . Boeing 767 commercial airliner. What is Ebola virus disease? Ebola is a severe, often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90 per cent.The illness affects humans as well as primates, including monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees. How do people become infected with the virus? Ebola is transmitted through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals. In Africa infection in humans has happened as a result of contact with chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead in the rainforest. Once a person becomes infected, the virus can spread through contact with a sufferer's blood, urine, saliva, stools and semen. A person can also become infected if broken skin comes into contact with a victim's soiled clothing, bed linen or used needles. Men who have recovered from the disease, can still spread the virus to their partner through their semen for seven weeks after recovery. The Ebola virus is fatal in 90 per cent of cases and there is no vaccine and no known cure. Ebola is a severe, often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90 per cent . Who is most at risk? Those at risk during an outbreak include: . What are the typical signs and symptoms? Sudden onset of fever, intense weakness,  muscle pain, headache and sore throat. That is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function and internal and external bleeding. The incubation period is between two and 21 days. A person will become contagious once they start to show symptoms. When should you seek medical care? If a person is in an area affected by the outbreak, or has been in contact with a person known or suspected to have Ebola, they should seek medical help immediately. What is the treatment? Severely ill patients require intensive supportive care. They need intravenous fluids to rehydrate them. But there is currently no specific treatment for the disease. Some patients will recover with the appropriate care. Can Ebola be prevented? Currently there is no licensed vaccine for Ebola. Several are being tested but are not available for clinical use. Is it safe to travel to affected areas? The World Health Organisation reviews the public health situation regularly, and recommends travel or trade restrictions if necessary. The risk of infection for travellers is very low since person-to-person transmission results from direct contact with bodily fluids of victims.Source: World Health Organisation .","The body of a teen stowaway was found and .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Ireland is the ‘goodest’ country in the world, according to a new survey which measures what 125 nations contribute to the planet and humanity. The UK made it to the seventh place in the overall index but was crowned as the best country in the world for its contribution in terms of technology and science. The Good Country Index, conceived by policy adviser Simon Anholt, analyses 35 different types of data from the UN, the World Bank and other international organisations and NGOs. Global contribution: Europe is the 'goodest' part of the world as nine of the top 10 countries are in Western Europe, according to the Index . This includes information such as freedom of the press, the number of refugees hosted, the amount of weapons exported and the number of Nobel Prize winners. This it the first time the Index is published. Countries are then ranked according to their contribution to science and technology, culture, international peace and security, world order, the planet and climate, prosperity and equality, and the health and well-being of humanity. Maybe unsurprisingly, Iraq, Libya and Vietnam were the countries which contributed least to the global good. Bottom of the list: War-torn Iraq (pictured) along with Libya and Vietnam are the countries which contributed least to the global good . Mr Anholt said the survey was not meant to name and shame nations or to give moral judgements, but to engage in a discourse about what is the role of countries in a global context. He said: ‘The idea of the Good Country Index is pretty simple; to measure what each country on earth contributes to the common good of humanity, and what it takes away.’ The Nordic Region, as might be expected, makes a collective contribution to humanity and the planet which is well in advance of any other region, while the US ranked 21st due to a poor record in terms of International Peace and Security. Mr Anholt said he hopes the Index will transform the way countries do business by encouraging them to think about the global impact of their actions. He hopes it will spark debate about what the purpose of a country is. He said: ‘Do they exist purely to serve the interests of their own politicians, businesses and citizens, or are they actively working for all of humanity and the whole planet? ‘The debate is a critical one, because if the first answer is the correct one, we're all in deep trouble.’ 'Goodest' African country: Kenya, at 26th place, is the only country on the continent to break into the top 30 . Outside of western Europe and the English-speaking world, the highest ranked country is Costa Rica, which comes in at 22nd place, while Chile was ranked in 24th place. The African nation which contributes most to the planet is Kenya, which, at 26th place, is the only country on the continent to break into the top 30. Researchers said Kenya was an ‘inspiring example’ which showed that making a meaningful contribution to society is ‘by no means the exclusive province of rich ""first-world"" nations’. Nevertheless, nine of the top 10 countries are in Western Europe, making it by far the ‘goodest’ part of the world. Belgium was the first country in the world for its contribution in terms of culture, while Spain came top in the health and well-being category. Russia ranked 95th, with its contributions to the global good close to those of Honduras and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, while India made it to the 81st place, well ahead of China at 107th place. Booming: India ranked 81st, well ahead of China at 107th place (Pictured: Chandni Chowk in New Dehli) Mr Anholt called for countries to stop behaving ‘as if they are islands’. He said: ‘The whole world is connected as never before, yet we still treat countries as if each one was located on its own private planet. ‘It's time countries started thinking much harder about the international consequences of their actions; if they don't, the global challenges like climate change, poverty, economic crises, terrorism, drugs and pandemics will only get worse.’","The UK is the best country for its contribution to science and technology .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . We always knew the Americans were big tippers, but it seems they are being given a run for their money by the Germans. A new survey has found that 60 per cent of US tourists say they always leave a tip on holiday, with nearly half of Germans saying the same. But when it comes to leaving a gratuity, it seems the British aren't quite so generous, coming nearly bottom in research conducted in eight key countries. Top tippers: Americans came top of a new poll by travel website TripAdvisor . Americans – 60 per centGermans – 49 per cent Brazilians – 33 per centSpanish – 30 per centRussians – 28 per centBrits – 26 per centFrench – 15 per centItalians – 11 per cent . TripAdvisor asked more than 25,000 people from eight . countries: Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Spain, the United . Kingdom and the United States, whether they tipped when on holiday. And while the US led the way with almost two thirds of people polled leaving money . for staff, just a quarter of Britons said they did the same. Of the 40 percent of US respondents who don’t always leave a tip on vacation, the main reasons for not tipping include: service didn’t meet their expectations (55 per cent), while 20 per cent think the tip is included in the bill. Of the eight countries quizzed the Italians came bottom with just 11 per cent, and France doesn't do much better, with just 15 per cent of people saying they tip. Paying the bill: 60 per cent of Americans polled always left a tip on holiday compared to an average of 27 per cent in the seven other countries surveyed . Surprisingly the Brazilians and Spanish came out as generous tippers, with even the Russians beating Britain. The poll . found 56 percent of Americans think tipping is ‘expected,’ but a quarter . say they are often unsure what is appropriate across the globe. A huge 97 per cent of Americans tip for . restaurant service, with 79 per cent saying they also tip bellmen. A further 73 per cent add a tip to room . service, and 69 per cent leave a gratuity for housekeeping. Brooke Ferencsik, director of communications for TripAdvisor, said: 'The TripAdvisor survey shows the majority of US travellers tip on vacation, regardless of the quality of service. 'While friendliness and helpfulness are the most important qualities that influence tipping behavior, cultural norms are also a significant factor.' It is often American celebrities who usually hit the headlines for their generous tips too. Barack Obama, Charlie Sheen, Johnny Depp, Dan Ackroyd and Drew Barrymore have all be praised for the generous gratuities they have left for staff.","TripAdvisor asked more than 25,000 people in eight countries .

"By . Catherine Eade . Britain may have been basking in glorious sunshine and balmy temperatures, but of course, as soon as Glastonbury Festival arrives, the weather is set to turn. And it seems festivalgoers aren't quite as die-hard as first thought, with hotel searches booming since forecaster warned of thundery showers and heavy downpours. As thousands descend upon Worthy Farm in Pilton for this weekend's festivities, one hotel website is reporting a huge surge in bookings for the Glastonbury area, following the grim weather forecast. Lapping up the sun, but could things be about to get a whole lot muddier? Get ready for the rain! The sunshine today is expected to give way to heavy showers . Searches for hotels in the Glastonbury . area are up by 92 per cent, according to research from Hotels.com, which . also revealed that over a quarter of us (27 per cent) would prefer to . stay in a hotel than go through the traditional camping experience. Interestingly, the research also reveals that a cheeky two per cent of festival goers even admit to lying to their friends and family about staying in a hotel when they said they were camping. Thousands of festival-goers arrived at the Somerset site yesterday, with even more expected today. But late arrivals were advised to get their tents up as quickly as possible before heavy rain dampens proceedings by the afternoon. Idyllic: A balmy summer's evening in the Stone Circle are of Worthy Farm, but conditions could change later today . In rainier times: Glastonbury 2011 had more than its share of downpours . Or would madam prefer breakfast in bed? Some festiival goers are seeking out plush hotels in Glastonbury . Forecasters predict rain will last throughout the weekend and the Met Office put out a yellow weather warning, warning that 'severe' storms could disrupt transport and events. 'This is not just a bit of rain,' Nicky Maxey of the Met Office told Mail Online. 'The weather has been very dry in the Somerset area which is likely to exacerbate the problems. 'It is ok today but from 4am on Friday until at least 9pm on Saturday, there will be a band of rain across the Glastonbury area. 'Sunday will be clearer, with some sunny spells, but there is still potential for showers. Today: A dry start with sunny spells but a band of rain will sweep across from Cornwall. Heavy bursts possible, showers following later.Tonight: Thundery showers. Clear spells and it will stay mild. Patchy hill fog possible.Friday: Heavy downpours will be interspersed with bright spells. Temperatures 15C-17C.Saturday: Thundery. Temperatures will peak at 16C, with heavy rain from 10am.Sunday: Less rain but it will remain overcast . 'Glastonbury have put a lot into dealing with floods so they may be prepared but we are looking at short, very sharp showers that will come too fast for normal drains to handle, causing localised flooding,' a Met spokesman said. 'There hasn't been a drop of rain in Somerset for the past four weeks so it's not going to get really muddy,' said long time festival veteran Paul Ward. But it's not a view shared by the Met Office, which said that the lack of rain in recent weeks 'is likely to exacerbate the problems.' Glastonbury has long been recognised as the festival which attracts the worst weather, but despite the mud it continues to attract more festival goers every year. 'It's great to see that rain or shine we . will enjoy Glastonbury... even if there is a cunning minority who lie . about where they stay just to keep up appearances,' said Alison Couper . of Hotels.com. As Dolly Parton, Metallica and Blondie strut their stuff it seems the trend in 'glamping' isn't going away any time soon.","Met office has released 'severe weather' warnings for Somerset .

"By . Beci Wood . Flight fares are set to rise as airlines look to recover costs on payouts to passengers for delays in the wake of the Thomson court ruling. One senior industry figure suggested fares could rise by as much as £5, with charter prices likely to increase by more than scheduled services. Last week a passenger seeking compensation for a delay on a flight six years ago was celebrating after The Court of Appeal ruled in favour of a claim against Thomson Airways. Rising costs: Air fares are set to increase as more passenger's claim money for delayed flights . James Dawson was awarded £975 by a county court but Thomson has appealed, arguing the Montreal Convention, which says there is a two-year limit on claims. It was the second ruling on passenger rights and EC Regulation 261 this month. In a case against Jet2.com, The Court of Appeal had ruled that a technical fault that caused a delay could not be classed as an ‘extraordinary circumstance’. Now airlines say they are being forced to recover the costs of handling the claims by increasing fares. Lawyer Joanna Kolatsis of Hill Dickinson told Travel Weekly: 'It is inevitable air fares will rise as the costs of handling these claims increase. 'There is simply no other way for airlines to recover the costs. Ryanair implemented a Regulation 261 levy on tickets and, while unpopular at first, it has gathered growing sympathy among airlines.' Delays of more than three hours affect almost 1 per cent of UK flights which falls within Regulation 261. A senior industry source said: 'Charter delays of more than three hours are more than double the rate of scheduled carriers’ and a significant proportion are technical. If everybody made a claim it would add £5-plus per passenger.' Time limit: Thomson believe passengers should only be able to claim within a two-year period . A CAA spokesman told MailOnline Travel: ‘It’s difficult to estimate what this might cost passengers. It’s up to each airline.' ‘As the UK's most on-time holiday airline, at Thomson Airways our focus continues to be ensuring that our customers reach their destination safely and promptly. ‘We believe that it is reasonable to expect that those who perceive they have suffered a real loss as a result of an unfortunate delay should be able to make their claim within two years. 'We also continue to believe that the law stipulates this and we are therefore surprised by today’s judgment. ‘If unchallenged, this judgment could have a significant impact on the entire airline industry and specifically upon the price that all air travellers would need to pay for their flights. 'We therefore confirm that it is our intention to seek an appeal to the Supreme Court.’","Senior industry figure suggested fares could rise by as much as £5 .

Spain and Portugal have been linked by a zip wire, meaning thrillseekers can cross from one country to another by flying through the air at speeds of up to 50mph.

Flying visit: Travellers cross from Sanlucar de Guadiana, in Spain, landing across the Guadiana River in Alcoutim, Portugal . And thanks to time zone differences between the two nations, the 60 second journey will see the zipliners travel back in time one hour. Englishman, David Jarman, who set up and created the 2,365ft zipline, said: 'I love a challenge. 'Two villages in two countries, separated by a river 150 metres wide - a zipline just seemed obvious to me. 'It also seemed like a great way to unite both places, since a bridge had been talked about for many years, but was never realised.' Travelling back in time: Thanks to the time difference between the two countries, you arrive in Portugal an hour before you set off from Spain . Don't look down: The zipline, which costs £12 per person, reaches speeds of up to 50mph . On a busy day, the Limitzero line - called 'la tirolina' in Spain - can accommodate 24-30 people an hour, with each journey costing 15 euros (about £12). But your stay in Portugal won't last too long. There is a boat on hand in the picturesque village of Alcoutim to ferry zipliners back to Spain after their ride is complete.","Zipline connects Sanlucar de Guadiana in Spain, with Alcoutim in Portugal .

"By . Marcus Berkmann . Hallelujah! Another Leonard Cohen biography! A remarkable number of books have been written about the old groaner, once lovingly known to British music critics as ‘Laughing Len’. But there are two good reasons for this. One is the lyrics: opaque, complex, redemptive, capable of endless interpretation and reinterpretation. Critics love all that. The other is the wonderful shape of his late-flowering career. Hats off to Laughing Len: Musician Leonard Cohen is loved for his ability to talk off the cuff . Inducted into the Canadian Hall of Fame in 1991, he said: ‘If I had been given this attention when I was 26, it would have turned my head. At 36 it might have confirmed my flight on a rather morbid spiritual path. At 46 it would have rubbed my nose in my failing powers and have prompted a plotting of a getaway and an alibi. But at 56 — hell, I’m just hitting my stride and it doesn’t hurt at all.’ A third reason might be this: who couldn’t love a man who can talk like that off the cuff? Cohen (pictured) will be 80 in September and has never been more popular. His recent live performances, which only began because his former manager had hopped off with all his money, have been a revelation and a delight. And Hallelujah, a song from an album his record company originally turned down, has become one of the most covered songs of the past decade, although as Liel Leibovitz points out, most of the singers who attempt it misinterpret it. ‘The song tends to inspire the sort of cascade of crescendos that causes inexperienced and dramatic singers to shut their eyes tightly and clench their fists as they belt out verse after verse. Overcome by emotion, they take the song to be about the hallelujah of the orgasm.’ Cohen, says Leibovitz, has none of that. He always sings it simply (as he sings everything) because the words are what count, not the performance. When an interviewer told him that Hallelujah conveyed  a sense of holiness, Cohen wanted to talk about ritual instead. ‘I understand that they forgot how to build the arch for several hundred years,’ he said. ‘Masons forgot how to build certain kinds of arches, it was lost. So it is in our time that certain spiritual mechanisms that were very useful have been abandoned and forgot. Redemption, repentance, resurrection. ‘All those ideas are thrown out with the bathwater. People become suspicious of religion plus all these redemptive mechanisms that are very useful.’ One wonders what Alexandra Burke, who won  The X Factor with an atrocious, grandstanding version of the song, would make of that. Not a lot, I would imagine. Flawed hero: Cohen is best known for his song 'Hallelujah' which has become one of the most covered songs of the decade . Liel Leibovitz is a youngish American academic, and his book is rather more intellectually rigorous than most rock biographies. Cohen’s love life is famously ragged, but Leibovitz isn’t interested in gossip. What he’s after are the philosophical and theological bases of Cohen’s art. He is fascinated by the young man’s struggle, for Cohen was in his mid-30s before he even recorded a note. Canadian, Jewish and not very tall, he never ceased to feel like an outsider. Whatever was going on in popular culture never seemed to have much to do with him. In the late 1960s, for instance, psychedelia was mutating  into blues rock, and thence into progressive and glam rock. Only Leonard Cohen was sitting alone with his guitar, singing long, slow, highly literary laments to lost love and the meaningless horror of modern existence. He emerges from the book as something of a hero, flawed as we all are, complex as very few of us are, and not just looking for answers but actually finding some. He’s Laughing Len now, for real.","Leonard Cohen's lyrics are capable of endless interpretation .

"By . Catherine Eade . If you've ever wanted a tour of Liberty Island and its neighbour, Ellis Island, without actually having to go to New York, you'll soon be able to do just that. Google Maps has finally been given permission to map Ellis and Liberty Islands so that tourists can take virtual tours of both historic landmarks. Google's Street View 360-degree maps have been available for most of New York City since 2007, but Liberty and Ellis Island have never been mapped until now, mainly because getting access to Liberty Island, which is run by the National Park Service, has been complicated. Google contractor Alberto Elias takes time to pose with tourists wearing the Google Trekker . Google Maps has finally been given permission to map Ellis and Liberty Islands for tourists to view . A lengthy approvals process had to be waded through before filming could commence, a Google Maps spokesman explained. But now the company has finally begun its mapping project of the islands with Google Maps image collector Alberto Elias wearing a Trekker backpack, accompanied by Google technologist, Daniel Sieberg, visiting the islands last week. The Trekker is a Google Street View device used to collect data and imagery which enables Google to create a street view map of hard-to-access locations around the world. In addition to 15 cameras, the apparatus has a GPS device and a laser system used to measure the distance to objects. Slowly does it: Strapped into the Google Trekker device, Elias captures images for Google Street View . An image collector for Google Maps, Alberto Elias, filmed on both islands wearing a Trekker backpack . 'For the first time, Liberty Island will be available for people to explore through Street View in Google Maps,' Sieberg told the New York Times. 'So whether you’re a tourist or a New Yorker or someone who just wants to see it up close, in the coming months everyone will be able to take a tour of the island and appreciate the statue’s history and beauty in 360-degree imagery.' But don't hold your breath: Google needs to process the images before they go live online. The footage is filed and processed, and during this procedure, faces and private information are blurred - a process which usually takes months. The search giant has been using cars, bikes and people to carry camera systems though all sorts of landmarks so they can be toured virtually, and the Statue of Liberty is sure to be a popular 'destination' for virtual tourists. Google Street View includes images from 57 countries and has covered more than five million miles across seven continents, and the Trekker has also been used to map the Eiffel Tower, the Grand Canyon and Mount Fuji.","New York's iconic islands currently being mapped for Street View .

Amy Kroening has said she warned a Kenton Family Court about her ex-husband Zuriel Turk's threatening behaviour before the shooting last month. Her new husband Mark Kroening had taken her four children, aged ten to 15, to see their father last month when police say Turk fired a gun into the car before shooting himself. Amy Kroening has hit out at a family court after her husband Mark Kroening was shot by her ex-husband Zuriel Turk . In a call from an emergency phone given to her children, Amy Kroening heard one of them cry:  'Mommy, Daddy shot Mark.' Mark Kroening and Turk were both killed in the incident at the Dairy Queen, in Latonia, which Amy Kroening believes could have been avoided. None of the children in the car were injured. She has criticised a family court judge who was asked by the children's guardian ad litem to temporarily suspend Turk's parental visits, after an audio recording emerged of Turk telling his children he would commit suicide if he did not get custody, the Cincinnati Enquirer has reported. The judge however ordered supervised visits, with Turk able to nominate his own supervisor. Speaking to Local 12 WKRC Cincinnati, Kroening said she had warned the courts her ex-husband had written threatening letters to her family. She said there are 'two folders of court documents stating how afraid I was of this man.' Police say Zuriel Turk (pictured) shot Mark Kroening as he took the children to see their father, before shooting himself . She said: 'I think after all the warnings . I gave them and all the warnings he gave them, they completely failed . my husband, Mark Kroening. They failed all of us.' In 2006, police charged Turk with sexual abuse, but he was later found not guilty by a jury. Earlier this year, Turk filed a lawsuit against a number of people, including the judge and his ex-wife and new husband. He also filed a motion of domestic violence against Mark Kroening. Mark Kroening was killed in the incident at the Dairy Queen, in Latonia , which Amy Kroening believes could have been avoided. None of the children in the car were injured .

Investigation: Deborah Hersman, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board, said the NTSB will interview the pilot at the controls of the doomed Asiana Airlines flight on Tuesday . NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman added that flight attendants . will also be interviewed on Tuesday to determine how successful the . evacuation process was; there have been reports one of the escape slides . was faulty. She said that the . process has so far been slowed by language barriers. 'I am looking forward to having the crew . interviews done,' Hersman said on Monday. 'It's going . very slowly. We want to make sure the crew members aren't confused, that . the information that's being exchanged is clear, that we’re getting out . of it all the information that we need.' Although the NTSB has revealed that the plane was landing too slow and attempted to accelerate too late - tipping the plane upwards and smashing the tail to the ground - Hersman told CNN that it was too early to determine the cause. Terror: An image taken immediately after the crash shows the Boeing 777 engulfed in smoke and flames on the tarmac at San Francisco Airport on Saturday . Lucky escape: Passengers walk away from the Asiana aircraft just moments after the crash landing in a photo taken by a passenger. Investigations into the cause are now underway . 'I think it really is too early to conclude pilot error because there's so much that we don't know,' she said. 'We have to understand what these pilots knew. We also need to look at how they were flying the airplane.' She added that it was helpful to have the pilots to interview so that investigators could understand what they were thinking and to determine when they realized there was a problem. Questions include whether all four . pilots were in the cockpit, as expected, or just the trainee and his . trainer, who were both experienced pilots on other aircrafts. But the airline acknowledged on Monday . that the pilot at the controls had little experience flying that type of . plane and was landing one for the first time at that airport. Officials emphasized that there will not be an interrogation of the pilots. Data: A graph charting the altitude of flights landing at the airport shows the Asiana flight dipped below others . 'The NTSB will ask them to tell us in . your own words what was going on,' former NTSB managing director Peter Goelz said. 'The investigators will have some . advantage, they'll have some information from voice recorder. But it's . not a cross examination, it's an effort to understand what the pilot . remembers and what he remembers saying and doing.' He added that there is a possibility a license could be revoked, or fines or penalties issued. Asiana Airlines Flight 214 was 500 feet above ground and about half a minute from San Francisco International Airport when its speed dropped below the threshold for a safe landing speed. It continued slowing until just about eight seconds before touch down when pilots recognized the need for more speed and throttled up, NTSB investigations show. Fallout: Asiana Airlines President and CEO Yoon Young-doo, center right, leaves for San Francisco from the Incheon International Airport in Incheon on Tuesday as the interviews with his pilots continue . By the time the engines started adding speed, the plane was barely above San Francisco Bay and the plane clipped the seawall at the end of the runway, slammed down and then caught fire. Miraculously, only two of the 307 people on board died, and most of the survivors suffered little or no injuries. More than 120 people walked away without any injuries. The Air Line Pilots Association has criticized the NTSB for releasing so much information at such an early stage in the probe. 'The . release of individual data points from the flight data recorder and the . cockpit voice recorder - without the context of the entire body of . factual investigative data - represents a potential detriment to flight . safety,' the group said in a statement. 'It . encourages wild speculation, as we have already seen in the media, . about causes of the accident before all the facts are known, before . investigators have the ability to determine why the events occurred, and . in this case before the flight crew had even been interviewed.' Victims: 16-year-old schoolgirls Ye Mengyuan, left, and Wang Linjia, right, pose for photos with other classmates in the classroom in Jiangshan city. They were killed in the crash . Destruction: More than 180 people were injured in the crash but miraculously, 120 were not . Authorities will also reviewing the initial rescue efforts after fire officials acknowledged that one of their trucks may have run over one of the two Chinese teenagers killed in the crash. The students, Wang Linjia and Ye Mengyuan, were part of a larger group headed for a Christian summer camp with dozens of classmates. The NTSB said they are reviewing airport surveillance video to determine whether an emergency vehicle ran over one of students, killing her, but they have not reached any firm conclusions.","The pilot who was at the controls when the Boeing 777 smashed into the tarmac is being interviewed on Tuesday .

"By . Associated Press . President Barack Obama is practically weepy at the thought of his daughter Malia going off to college, a milestone many months away that is already on his mind. Malia barely reached up to her father's shoulders when they moved to the White House nearly six years ago with her mother, little sister and grandmother. At 16, she stands nearly as tall as her 6-foot-1 dad and is visiting college campuses in preparation for that bittersweet day in the fall of 2016 when she trades her White House bedroom for a dorm. She has been seen touring the University of California at Berkeley and the Palo Alto, California, campus of Stanford, where another president's daughter, Chelsea Clinton, attended college. All grown up: At 16, Malia stands nearly as tall as her 6-foot-1 dad and is visiting college campuses in preparation for that bittersweet day in the fall of 2016 when she trades her White House bedroom for a dorm . In a commencement address to high school graduates in Worcester, Massachusetts, Obama said he's practicing for what's coming in two years. 'So I'm trying to get used to not choking up and crying and embarrassing her. So this is sort of my trial run here.' Obama said during a . question-and-answer session with the chief executive of Tumblr, a social . media site, that his daughter, like young people in general, should . shop around for a college. Warm reminder: In a commencement address to high school graduates in Worcester, Massachusetts, Obama said he's practicing for what's coming in two years as he hugged and congratulated school leavers . 'We tell her, ""Don't assume that there . are 10 schools that you have to go to, and if you didn't go to those . 10, that somehow things are going to be terrible,'' he said. 'There are a . lot of schools out there.' Malia . goes into the 11th grade this fall at the private Sidwell Friends . School in Washington. The Sidwell parent's guide to college counseling . suggests that juniors take the PSAT test in October, visit colleges as . time allows, take the SAT exam in March and set up a family meeting with . a college counselor in late spring, among other steps. Michelle . Obama is also thinking about her daughter's departure. In a . commencement-eve address to Topeka, Kansas, high school seniors, the . first lady said: 'Days like this make me think of my own daughters, so . forgive me if I get a little teary.' Chelsea . Clinton and her mother, Hillary Rodham Clinton, toured some colleges . together, at times attracting a horde and at other times going . unnoticed. Then-President Bill Clinton never joined them, mainly because . of the disruption that would have been caused by the large entourage . that follows a president in public. The prevalence of social media and . cellphone cameras practically guarantees that Malia's college search . will be even more documented than Chelsea Clinton's 17 years ago. In . September 1997, more than 200 journalists showed up to cover her first . day at Stanford. Bill Clinton and his wife, who was Obama's first secretary of state, were shocked when their only child chose to attend college some 3,000 miles away. Her parents were educated at East Coast universities - Georgetown for him and Wellesley for her - before they met at Yale Law School. And they thought Chelsea would follow their path. In her syndicated newspaper column, Hillary Clinton wrote about her dread at having to say goodbye to Chelsea. Trial run: In his speech, he said he was 'trying to get used to not choking up and crying and embarrassing her', adding, 'So this is sort of my trial run here' Memories: Of course, Malia (in red) barely reached up to her father's shoulders when they moved to the White House nearly six years ago with her mother, little sister and grandmother . Malia's journey into the next phase of her life will be a similarly emotional time for Obama, who grew up without his dad. He talks about his desire to be a 'present' father for Malia and Sasha, 13, and how living in the White House enabled the family to spend more time together than ever before. Close: Obama talks about his desire to be a 'present' father for Malia and Sasha, 13, and how living in the White House enabled the family to spend more time together than ever before . The Obamas lived in Chicago when the girls were born, but he was often away in Springfield, Illinois, when he was a state senator, or in Washington representing Illinois as a U.S. senator. Children already seem to grow up too fast, but it 'happens more suddenly for a president and a president can feel cheated,' said Doug Wead, who interviewed 19 children of presidents for his book, 'All the Presidents' Children.' 'The president is feeling some angst over this, and rightly so.' Already this summer, Malia has worked in Los Angeles as a production assistant on the set of 'Extant,' a new CBS sci-fi thriller starring Halle Berry and produced by Democratic Party donor Steven Spielberg. She's also learning how to drive. Perhaps compounding emotions for the Obamas is that they, too, will follow Malia out of the White House shortly after she starts college. It comes amid reports Obama has reportedly already ‘checked out’ of his job even though there are more than two years left until he leaves office in January 2017, a few months after Malia departs. The US President is said to have played 81 rounds of golf since re-election – as many as he played in his entire first term – and has holed himself up in Washington where he attends fundraisers and dinners with celebrities rather than tackling the day-to-day business of congressional politics. He is already all but a lame duck due to deadlock on Capitol Hill and has been forced to use executive powers to enact reforms. But come the mid-term elections in November, he could lose power entirely if the Republicans take the Senate. In the meantime, commentators claim he believes that his time in office is effectively over – and has begun enjoying himself. US reports say he has been house hunting and has looked at a £2.5million mansion in Rancho Mirage, California – dubbed the ‘playground of the presidents’.","He made remarks at high-school graduation ceremony in Worcester, MA .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Space-age slap: The new Fusion Foundation by Yves Saint Laurent, which already has a waiting list of 12,000 women who are keen to get their hands on it . Thousands of women are clamouring to sign up for a designer foundation that claims to use space-age technology to keep it working for 24 hours. Nearly 12,000 women are already on the waiting list for Yves Saint Laurent’s Fusion Foundation – three weeks before it is released nationwide. The hi-tech make-up contains a material called lipophilic acid, which is used to capture space dust. This interstellar ingredient makes the product the most technologically advanced make-up in the world, say YSL. The microscopic substance absorbs grease from the face, leaving an even, matte surface for up to 24 hours. This is because the lipophilic acid has a honeycomb-shaped texture, allowing it to absorb up to four times its own weight in moisture, it is claimed. The formula also contains a ‘hydrophilic agent’ – a clay-like mix of minerals which acts like ‘an invisible sponge’, soaking up moisture from the face, as well as a ‘beautyleaf extract’ designed to mimic the fatty acids found on the surface of the skin. Caroline Negre, YSL's scientific communications director, said: 'Fusion Foundation is a ground-breaking response to modern demands for trustworthy, perfect coverage that lasts for up to 24 hours without compromising on texture. 'This combination of active agents is a first for Yves Saint Laurent Beauté. Fusion Foundation contains a new blend of hydrophilic and lipophilic agents and tamanu oil. 'This hybrid technology means the volatile oils in the foundation evaporate quickly after application - leaving just the pigments and actives behind on the skin.' Created by Yves Saint Laurent Beauté skincare laboratory in Paris, the formula contains 'pure, milled pigments each with a micro-coating that merges perfectly with the surface of the skin, thus ensuring it remains uniform, weightless and long-wearing,' YSL said. Model Cara Delevingne, the face of the new YSL product: The hi-tech make-up contains a material called lipophilic acid, which is apparently more commonly used to capture space dust . Creative director of make-up at YSL, Lloyd Simmonds, said: 'Other formulas tend to be quite thick in texture, a little heavy and form a barrier on the skin. This has a lightness of texture which is completely new. 'As a make-up artist, my criteria for foundation are that I don't want to see it on the skin, it has to be invisible and weightless. 'So the aim was to create a weightless formula with an invisible, long-lasting coverage and that's what we have. It has a natural-looking, mattifying effect on the skin - without appearing dry or caked on. And it lasts the entire day.' YSL claimed that unlike other foundations, this product is not too heavy and will not form an impenetrable barrier over the skin. The dispenser for the foundation was inspired by the way a calligrapher would dip his quill in a pot of ink, which YSL said was designed to eliminate the fashion faux-pas of applying too much make-up. It said the dispenser's plume is fanned at the base and tapered at the tip, which it says allows the optimum amount of foundation onto the skin without any surplus. The foundation will be available exclusively from Debenhams from August 10th and then nationwide from August 20th.","YSL's Fusion Foundation contains a substance called lipophilic acid .

"An alarming shortfall of specialist troops are leaving Britain’s Armed Forces ‘vulnerable’, a damning report reveal today. MPs on the Commons Defence Select Committee expressed ‘major concerns’ at the number of service personnel missing from crucial posts. Even as the military continues to fight insurgents in Afghanistan, key trades including bomb disposal experts, interrogators and electronic warfare operators are having to cope with vacancies. MPs on the Commons Defence Select Committee expressed ¿major concerns¿ at the number of service personnel missing from crucial posts . Shocking new figures show the Army has a shortfall of some 700 intelligence officers - vital to tackling global terrorism. And more than four out of ten posts in some medical specialisms - including emergency nurses, anaesthetists and radiologists - are unfilled, leading to fears that lives are being put at risk. The report, into the Ministry of Defence’s annual report and accounts for 2012-13, shows under-staffed ‘operational pinch points’ have increased from 11 to 15 in the Royal Navy and 19 to 26 in the Army. The extent of the shortages - amounting to around 1,600 troops - comes as ministers prepare to axe up to 2,000 soldiers in its latest round of cost-cutting redundancies. Shocking new figures show the Army has a shortfall of some 700 intelligence officers . The MoD has reduced the size of the Armed Forces by 30,000 since 2010 to save £4.7billion and eliminate a £38billion equipment overspend. MPs on the cross-party committee share military officers’ concerns that experienced personnel are leaving, fed up with the demands of continuous operations and often taking up highly-paid jobs in private security. They recommend personnel with crucial skills should be given ‘golden handcuff’ payments to remain in the Armed Forces. The committee said the shortfalls were occurring at a time when the rate of personnel volunteering to leave the forces was above average. In a hard-hitting report, the committee said: ‘Our major concern is shortage of key personnel. ‘The Ministry of Defence should support the services in addressing shortages in pinch point trades - key shortages which leave the armed forces vulnerable now and in the future. ‘The MoD and the armed forces should explore ways of filling these gaps by offering financial or other incentives to service personnel to encourage those in pinch point trades to continue in service and to encourage others to undertake training in these trades or by using reservists and private sector contractors.’ The committee said the shortfalls were occurring at a time when the rate of personnel volunteering to leave the forces was above average . Statistics revealed a 50 shortage in the number of radiologists, a 40 per cent shortfall in electronic warfare system operators and a 35 per cent gap in advanced explosive ordnance disposal operators. The Ministry of Defence is hoping a plan to increase the double the size of the Territorial Army will help to fill vacancies. But commanders have warned it is not possible to force volunteer soldiers to take up certain posts - meaning capability gaps could remain. Shadow Defence Secretary Vernon Coaker said: ‘There is a worrying shortfall in the required levels of trained personnel to fulfil critical operational requirements. ‘These pinch points include some of the most specialist jobs in areas of engineering, technical and medical expertise. ‘They are vital roles needed to support our Armed Forces and keep Britain safe and secure.’ The MoD said measures to manage pinch-points already included financial incentives, specialist pay and recruitment bonuses. Those made redundant could also apply to transfer into specialist trades. An MoD spokesman said: ‘The Armed Forces are going through significant restructuring resulting in a small number of temporary shortages in some roles. ‘However, there are safeguards in place to ensure frontline operational capability is not affected. ‘We are confident that we have, and will continue to have, the right personnel with the right skill sets to satisfy all strategic defence priorities.’","MPs expressed ‘major concerns’ at the number of service personnel missing from crucial posts .

"By . James Slack . Theresa May was accused of presiding over a ‘shambles’ as the head of the Government’s child abuse inquiry resigned six days after being appointed. Baroness Butler-Sloss, 80, had faced pressure from MPs, lawyers and child protection experts over her brother’s involvement in an alleged cover-up of an Establishment paedophile ring. The former judge said that, when accepting the inquiry role, she had not ‘sufficiently considered’ the  difficulties posed by allegations about her brother, the former attorney general Sir Michael Havers, might cause. Baroness Butler-Sloss has resigned from the child abuse inquiry less than a week after her appointment . Theresa May's judgement was called into question today, after Lady Butler-Sloss resigned from the child abuse inquiry . Sir Michael is accused of trying to silence whistleblower Geoffrey Dickens before he outed a senior civil  servant and suspected MI6 officer as a paedophile in the Eighties. Details of the attempted ‘cover-up’ was revealed in the Daily Mail on July 5 – a week before Lady Butler-Sloss’s appointment. However, under hostile questioning from MPs, Home Secretary Mrs May said she had not personally been aware of them until the last few days. The admission raised serious questions about the vetting procedure undertaken in Whitehall before such a crucial appointment. MPs said ministers must now find someone with ‘the integrity of Mother Teresa’ to take over the inquiry. ‘I was honoured to be invited by the Home Secretary to chair the wide-ranging inquiry about child sexual abuse and hoped I could make a useful contribution. ‘It has become apparent over the last few days, however, that there is a widespread perception, particularly among victim and survivor groups, that I am not the right person to chair the inquiry. ‘It has also become clear to me that I did not sufficiently consider whether my background and the fact my brother had been attorney general would cause difficulties. ‘This is a victim-orientated inquiry and those who wish to be heard must have confidence that the members of the panel will pay proper regard to their concerns and give appropriate advice to government. ‘Nor should attention be allowed to be diverted from the extremely important issues at stake, namely whether enough has been done to protect children from sexual abuse and hold to account those who commit these appalling crimes. ‘Having listened to the concerns of victim and survivor groups and the criticisms of MPs and the media, I have come to the conclusion that I should not chair this inquiry and have so informed the Home Secretary. ‘I should like to add that I have dedicated my life to public service, to the pursuit of justice and to protecting the rights of children and families and I wish the inquiry success in its important work.’ Yesterday Keith Vaz insisted that Lady Butler-Sloss’s replacement must not be an MP, peer, judge or member of the Church – because all these groups have been linked to the cover-up of child sex abuse. Mr Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, warned it would be an almost ‘impossible task’ to find someone suitable. He told Mrs May: ‘The last couple of weeks have been somewhat shambolic.’ He added: ‘We all acknowledge that being Home Secretary is not like a walk in the park, but the last few weeks have been quite a surprise for a government department that we thought was extremely well run under your stewardship. ‘What has gone wrong? Why is it all unravelling?’ The episode marks the latest in a series of headaches for Mrs May. Her special adviser resigned following an extraordinary row with Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, and she has since been criticised over the ongoing crisis at the Passport Office, as well as the admission that 114 files relating to allegations of child sex abuse were lost by her department. Officials had hoped the appointment of Lady Butler-Sloss would reassure the public and MPs that the issue of an alleged Westminster paedophile ring was being taken seriously. But, within hours of being put in charge, MPs and lawyers for victims of sexual abuse began to question whether – as an ex-judge and sister of Sir Michael – she had a conflict of interest. This was followed by what Mrs May called ‘suggestion and innuendo’ about Lady Butler-Sloss’s role in past inquiries into paedophilia. Claims were also made about the late Sir Michael attending parties in the 1980s at which young boys were abused. It is believed that, over the weekend, Lady Butler-Sloss began to question whether she should resign, and then told ministers she intended to quit. Mrs May told MPs: ‘I reject entirely the suggestion that she wasn’t the right person to do this job, but she has taken the decision [to quit] herself. I am disappointed.’ Mr Vaz said that, in standing down, Lady Butler-Sloss had shown better judgment than the Government had in giving her the role in the first place. He accused ministers of failing to carry out proper ‘due diligence’, telling Channel 4 News: ‘Poor old Elizabeth Butler-Sloss. She’s the victim in all this.’ Allegations: Sir Michael Havers, Baroness Butler-Sloss's brother, is accused of tryign to silence a whistle blower who was attempting to uncover a senior MI6 officer as a paedophile in the 1980s . Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, who organised a letter signed by 140 MPs calling for the inquiry, said that once it decided to hold one, the Home Office rushed Lady Butler-Sloss’s appointment ‘without doing its homework’. The peer’s brother, Sir Michael was accused of the ‘cover-up of the century’ by MP Geoffrey Dickens over his refusal to prosecute Foreign Office diplomat Sir Peter Hayman, a member of the infamous Paedophile Information Exchange. The then attorney general is said to have rowed outside the Commons chamber with Mr Dickens as he tried in vain to stop him using parliamentary privilege to name Sir Peter as a paedophile. Deputy Labour Leader Harriet Harman has conceded that the paedophile ring was 'trying to infiltrate every part of the system' and 'probably' succeeded . Harriet Harman yesterday conceded that the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange probably infiltrated the Home Office in the 1970s. PIE was an affiliated member of the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL) while she was NCCL’s legal officer from 1978 to 1982. Labour’s deputy leader said in a radio phone-in last night that the group had ‘probably’ also found its way into the Home Office. She told LBC Radio: ‘I don’t know categorically but they were trying to infiltrate every part of the system’. Miss Harman has already said that the child abuse inquiry, called by the Government last week, would have to investigate links between PIE and the civil liberties group she used to work for – now called Liberty. Last night she added that Baroness Butler-Sloss was right to step down as head of the inquiry, due to her brother having served as attorney general during the period being investigated. This is despite Miss Harman saying last week that the Baroness was ‘exactly the right person to lead the inquiry’. Miss Harman said that while she is ‘clearly a good and well respected person’, she had failed to gain the confidence of victims. ‘Obviously they should have thought this through a bit more’, she said. ‘People feel there have been so many cover-ups and so much not listening to the victims ... if people think there is still going to be a cover-up, there is going to be defensiveness on behalf of the establishment, then this inquiry won’t achieve what [it] really needs to achieve.’ Miss Harman added last night that child sex abuse was ‘not a party political issue’. She also reiterated that she had ‘never had anything to do’ with PIE while at the NCCL.","Former High Court judge resigns from panel inquiry into abuse allegations .

"By . Jason Groves . Home Secretary Theresa May faces questions from MPs over accusations that politicians, the police and even her own officials have suppressed allegations against powerful individuals for decades . Extraordinary new claims pointing to an Establishment cover-up of child sex abuse by senior politicians emerged last night. Home Secretary Theresa May faces questions from MPs over accusations that politicians, the police and even her own officials have suppressed allegations against powerful individuals for decades. Some 114 files ‘potentially relevant’ to child abuse are now known to have been lost or destroyed by the Home Office. And, incredibly, at least four specific allegations relating to child abuse in Home Office files were not passed to police for up to 35 years, officials have now admitted. The claims have only been handed over in the past 12 months. In an explosive intervention, former Tory Cabinet Minister Norman Tebbit said the evidence suggested there ‘may well have been’ an Establishment cover-up, beginning in the 1970s and 1980s and continuing to this day. ‘At that time I think most people would have thought that the Establishment, the system, was to be protected, and if a few things had gone wrong here and there, that it was more important to protect the system than to delve too far into it,’ Lord Tebbit said. The peer, who served in the Cabinet in the early 1980s, added: ‘That view, I think, was wrong then and it has been spectacularly shown to be wrong now because the abuses have grown.’ His intervention fuelled growing demands for a full Hillsborough-style public inquiry into a series of toxic allegations, including claims of abuse by the late Liberal MP Sir Cyril Smith and allegations of paedophile activity at parties attended by politicians and other prominent figures at the Elm Guest House in Barnes, south west London. Mrs May – who yesterday remained silent on the scandal engulfing her department – will face a storm of criticism from MPs as she gives a statement in the Commons today. In other developments it emerged that former Tory home secretary Lord Brittan has been questioned by police over an historical allegation of raping a woman and a Labour peer is under investigation after 12 men made allegations of ‘horrific’ child abuse dating back decades. Police have also traced a child at the centre of the alleged Westminster paedophile ring. The unnamed businessman, in his 40s and based in the US, claims he was abused by a politician when he was eight. Mrs May will announce details of a . fresh review of her department’s handling of the affair by a leading QC, . but pressure for a public inquiry continued to grow, with 141 MPs from . all parties backing the call. In an explosive intervention, former Tory Cabinet Minister Norman Tebbit said the evidence suggested there 'may well have been' an Establishment cover-up, beginning in the 1970s and 1980s and continuing to this day . Labour . MP Tom Watson has launched a petition calling on the Prime Minister to . ‘make amends for historic failures’ by establishing a national inquiry . into allegations of organised child sex abuse. He said that ‘many survivors of child abuse believe they have been let down by the system of child protection in the UK’. The petition has already been signed by thousands of members of the public. Mr Watson said: ‘Thousands had nowhere to turn. Nobody listened and nobody helped.’ The Home Office launched a review last year to discover what had happened to a dossier of alleged paedophile activity handed to Lord Brittan by the late Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983. In a statement last week, Lord Brittan insisted that it had been handled appropriately and that he had asked officials to investigate the claims fully. But a public letter written by the Home Office’s top civil servant Mark Sedwill at the weekend revealed that the review found dozens of files were missing. Of the 573 files recovered, 13 contained . ‘information about alleged child abuse’, including four involving Home . Office officials. Incredibly, only nine of the files – dated between . 1979 and 1999 – were ever handed to police. In other developments it emerged that former Tory Home Secretary Lord Brittan has been questioned by police over an historic allegation of raping a woman . Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said he was shocked by the loss of files, which he said was on ‘an industrial scale’. Mr Vaz, who had opposed a public inquiry into the scandal, said he had changed his mind on the basis of the revelations. His committee will question Mr Sedwill tomorrow over the missing files. Tory MP Zac Goldsmith said the case for a public inquiry was now irresistible. He said: ‘The Home Secretary is going to have to think again. It is inconceivable that those files were all lost by accident – no one is ever going to believe that, whatever the latest review comes up with. We need a proper inquiry. It is possible that some of the revelations will be very ugly for the political class. But we may need that cathartic experience to clear the air.’ Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who last week called on Lord Brittan to reveal what he knew, said it was a scandal that the Home Office had not passed files containing potentially serious allegations to the police immediately. And he warned that senior figures in all three main political parties were still trying to prevent questions about past misdeeds by a small number of MPs and peers. He said Parliament may be on the verge of a ‘Savile-like scandal’. The Home Office declined to comment yesterday but Downing Street insisted the case for an ‘over-arching’ public inquiry had not yet been made. Alison Millar of the law firm Leigh Day, which is representing some of the alleged victims, said another internal Home Office review would not quell the growing public disquiet. ‘This cannot be another internal review held by those who may well be at fault,’ she said. ‘It will only fuel a growing suspicion amongst the electorate that there is a conspiracy over the abuse of children by those with great power.’ Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper warned the ‘review of a review’ announced by the Government was insufficient. In a letter to Mrs May she said: ‘Any stones left unturned will leave concerns of institutional malaise, or worse a cover-up, unaddressed.’ ‘To be relevant, and effective, any independent inquiry needs to create a safe environment for survivors of abuse to come forward so their voices can be heard. At the moment the allegations are so serious and go so far up in the Government, to make many survivors fear for their safety.’ Campaigners are calling for a ‘Hillsborough-style’ inquiry into historic allegations of child sex abuse. This would involve an independent board of experts similar to the panel that investigated the 1989 football disaster. Public inquiries have traditionally been led by one or more senior judges, as with the Saville Inquiry into the Bloody Sunday killings of 1972 and the Leveson Inquiry into press standards. More rarely they have been conducted by a panel of veteran Whitehall mandarins – for example the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq War. But the Hillsborough Independent Panel, set up in 2010 to ensure the release of all documents related to the tragedy in which 96 Liverpool fans died, was praised for being different. It was chaired by the Bishop of Liverpool, the Right Reverend James Jones, and the nine members included former BBC journalist Peter Sissons, a retired deputy chief constable, an ex-deputy chief medical officer and archive experts. Each brought specialist knowledge to the task of scrutinising more than 450,000 pages to uncover the truth about attempts to cover up police failings.

"By . John Stevens, Political Reporter . and Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Nick Clegg was yesterday forced to defend himself after he admitted a vulnerable woman wrote to him to complain about inappropriate advances by MP Mike  Hancock more than three years ago. The Liberal Democrat leader acknowledged his office received a letter from the woman in March 2011 begging for help, but denied that he had ‘turned a blind eye’ to the problem, claiming that it was never brought to his attention. As part of a court settlement on Wednesday, Mr Hancock, 68, admitted he had ‘crossed the line’ and had an ‘inappropriate and unprofessional’ relationship with the woman after she sought his help as her local MP. Portsmouth South MP, Mike Hancock admitted he had 'crossed the line' in his friendship with a vulnerable constituent with mental health problems who had come to him for help . Mr . Clegg yesterday called on Mr Hancock, who has already had the Lib Dem . whip withdrawn in Parliament and his party membership suspended, to . leave the party altogether. ‘He should resign from the party. Of . course he should. Absolutely,’ Mr Clegg told LBC radio. ‘He has made an . apology that makes it clear that the way he behaved was totally and . utterly out of order. He has caused huge, huge distress. Frankly, that . has no role in the Liberal Democrats – the party I lead.’ The woman, . known as ‘Annie’, first wrote to the Deputy Prime Minister on March 9, . 2011 to complain about Mr Hancock. In a letter sent by recorded delivery . to the Liberal Democrat headquarters, she wrote: ‘I am deeply upset . that as the Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Democrats . you have done nothing to oust this man from politics. The former Lib Dem MP - who is now sitting as an independent - caused 'huge, huge distress', Nick Clegg claimed today . ‘He cannot be . trusted and he is a liability to women, the public and also your party. His conduct should be a matter for you as leader of the party. Please . reply to this as it is very important to me that I get an answer from . you.’ The woman, . who also believes she was 'bullied' during her battle, first went to the . Portsmouth South MP with concerns about noisy neighbours in 2009. That . issue remains unresolved. Her . teenage son, who has stood by her during the campaign for justice, . welcomed the apology and said his mother had 'been very strong'. The . teenager said: 'I think justice has been served and it's enough for me. But the apology doesn't account for the last four years. 'My . mum has been very strong, and we have gone through ups and downs . together. I think Mike Hancock should stand down from the Liberal . Democrat party permanently and as an MP.' A full statement from the woman said: 'I'm pleased there's been a resolution to what's been a long and hurtful ordeal for me. 'Since . the incidents about which I complained happened back in 2010, my . physical and mental health have suffered and i'm grateful that I may now . have some closure to this traumatic episode in the lives of both me and . my son. 'I'm pleased the defendant now recognises that i did not bring the case for financial gain. 'I only ever sought justice and an apology from Mr Hancock. and that is what my legal team fought to obtain throughout. 'Some . Liberal Democrat councillors serving on Portsmouth City Council have . sought publicly to discredit myself and my motives for bringing an . action against Mr Hancock, ignoring and even trying to undermine the . independent investigation report commissioned by their own QC Nigel . Pascoe. 'Finally, . I'd urge anyone else who has suffered from unwarranted approaches where . someone particularly in public office, has abused their trust to come . forward.' ■ In 2011, a Russian woman accused of being a spy admitted having a four-year affair with Hancock while she worked as his researcher. Ekaterina Zatuliveter (right) revealed the relationship in court in 2011 as she successfully fought deportation after it was claimed she  targeted the MP as part of a ‘honeytrap’ operation. During her time working with Hancock, she even moved into his London flat. ■ Earlier that year, Hancock admitted having a ‘close and affectionate relationship’ with a 17-year-old girl. The pair met at his office when she inquired about undertaking work experience. ‘It was a very affectionate relationship – it was strong but not sexual,’ he said. ‘There was contact between us – a kiss and cuddle but no more than that.’ ■ In 2010 it was claimed that Hancock had helped another Russian woman, 25-year-old Ekaterina Paderina, to stay in Britain after she ran into visa problems in the Nineties. Miss Paderina’s ex-husband said the MP went out of his way to help the blonde after she paid several visits to his office. ■ Hancock was also accused of having two affairs with colleagues during the Eighties and Nineties. The marriage of Liz McCann (right), a Lib Dem councillor and a mother of three, broke up as a result of their relationship. ‘I had heard about his reputation for women which goes before him in the party,’ she said. Hancock was also said to have had a six-year affair with Daphne Sparshatt, his constituency secretary. She told a newspaper: ‘He’s no great looker, he’s not God’s gift to women, but he charms his way in.’ ■ There have also been allegations that Hancock had a relationship with Daniela Aura Dobre, 20, whom he met during an aid trip to a village near Bucharest in October 1990. She claimed: ‘We were very close. I miss him very much. He’s a kind and charming man. He came on many trips, first in October 1990, then Christmas that year, then in January, March and April or May. I saw him each time.’ Mr Clegg yesterday said the party had taken no action at that . time as Hampshire Police and the Crown Prosecution Service, which had . both looked into the matter, had decided there was no basis on which to . proceed. He claimed: ‘She is quite right to say back in 2011 . something was sent to my office. It didn’t reach me. When I was given . specific allegations early in 2013, I responded as promptly as I . reasonably could and Mike Hancock was suspended as an MP for the party.’ Yesterday it emerged that the Portsmouth South MP has taken £275,077 in . salary from the public purse and a further £72,004 in expenses since . the woman complained to Mr Clegg. Politicians in Portsmouth have . called on Mr Hancock to quit and trigger a by-election. Labour . Councillor John Ferrett said: ‘His position is completely untenable. There is no way people in Portsmouth can trust him as their MP.’ However . Mr Hancock will not face an investigation by the parliamentary sleaze . watchdog. This means that he could cling on until next year’s election – . putting pressure on the Government to introduce reforms allowing . constituents to recall rogue MPs. Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith said: . ‘This clearly shows we need recall. It’s absurd that unless he chooses . to step down, his constituents are stuck with him.’","Lib Dem leader admits his office received complaints about Mike Hancock .

"Former Man City striker Carlos Tevez was on his way to Argentina last night after his father was kidnapped. Delivery driver Secundo Tevez was snatched early this morning on the outskirts of Buenos Aires. Three men in a van are reported to have abducted him in a street in the suburb of Moron after blocking his way and taking him hostage in his Volkswagon Vento. Tevez posted a photograph on him and his father on Twitter in March . Tevez, now with Italian side Juventus, was informed after another relative received a ransom demand. He was freed last night after an eight-hour kidnap ordeal. Family lawyer Gustavo Galasso confirmed: 'He’s okay' after his kidnappers let him go. The Tevez family is reported to have paid a ransom demand. Family lawyer Gustavo Galazzo confirmed the kidnap to TV channel America 24. Tevez, 30, is understood to have spoken with his father by phone as well as his dad's kidnappers. Tevez formerly played for Manchester City but is now at Italian team Juventus . Argentine daily Clarin reported: 'The kidnappers let Secundo speak briefly on the phone to his family as proof he was alive.' It is not yet clear whether the kidnap was planned or the gang realised their victim was Tevez's dad only after they had taken him. Reports suggest they  only targeted him because he was in an expensive car. An elite anti-kidnap police squad was drafted in to help resolve the crisis. Express kidnapping, where abductees are taken for a short duration and for a low ransom, occurs occasionally in Argentina, according to the U.S. State Department. Extortion kidnapping for ransom is relatively rare and has mostly affected well-off Argentines. The true rate of kidnapping is unknown but believed to be considerably lower than elsewhere in South America.","The player is reportedly flying to country after Secundo Tevez was taken .

John Clarkson, 54, who runs the shop with his wife Corinne, 39, concentrates on . mince pies in December, but also offers battered Tunnock’s Teacakes and . deep fried cheesecake through the year. The mince pies sell for 80p each - or £1.30 with cream or ice cream - and, along with the Ferrero Rochers, are very popular over the Christmas period. ‘I do ask people if they want salt and vinegar on their mince pies and Christmas pud as a joke, and they just look at me,’ said Mr Clarkson. ‘They don’t know what to say – is it wrong or is it right?’ While Ferrero Rochers are a new invention for the shop, Mr Clarkson has perfected the frying of mince pies over a decade.

Asked how they taste, he said: ‘Fantastic – and I’m not just saying that.’ Mr Clarkson, who has run the shop over 25 years, said mince pies along with Ferrero Rochers are the shop’s most popular deep fried products because Christmas puddings ‘aren’t for everyone’. Asked why the shop started selling deep fried mince pies, he said: 'You have to be different to be noticed - and they do sell as well.' He also predicted the sweet battered treats could catch on in the rest of the country in the future. On the new Ferrero Rocher invention, Mrs Clarkson said:  ‘Both myself and John have tried both and so have all the staff. We all firmly agree that they are a great taste sensation. So wrong - yet so right. 'The very idea of them puts a smile on your face, imagine what the taste will do. ‘It’s winter, it’s cold, it’s dark, we’re in a double dip recession, all things Christmas should be celebrated, food with a sense of humour?

Mr Clarkson, 54, made the giant 11lbs version of the hazelnut sweet made famous in the 'ambassador's party' TV advert - but gave it an extra twist using his own recipe. It is ten times the usual size of a Ferrero Rocher and even comes complete with a giant paper Ferrero Rocher tray. Chip shop boss John Clarkson has paid an 'up-North' homage to his favourite chocolate by creating the world's largest Ferrero Rocher caked in batter . It will go on display at his Mister Eater's Eating Emporium in Preston, Lancashire. Mr Clarkson came up with the idea after an initial batch of normal-sized Ferrero Rochers dipped in batter proved to be a surprise hit with customers. Corinne Clarkson, 39, who co-owns the chip shop with Mr Clarkson said: 'They love it - it draws a bit of a chuckle but some people have tried scraps of the mixture and they have said it's delicious. 'I don't even want to know how many calories are in it but it's something I wouldn't recommend eating alone.' Mr Clarkson made the giant 11lbs version which will go on display at his Mister Eater's Eating Emporium . Wacky: Mr Clarkson began battering normal Ferrero Rochers before he decided to make the world's biggest . Mr Clarkson added: 'We have to keep . thinking of new things all the time to keep new people coming in. Now . with the things we have done in the past new customers expect it.

Mr Clarkson is known for his wacky creations after also making the world's longest battered sausage and raising money for the charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer by encouraging women to bring their bras to his shop to be filled with chips. He joked that cup sizes A-B warrant a small chip portion, B-C are medium and D upwards are a large.Mr Clarkson, who has ran the takeaway for 25 years, started to come up with quirky ideas after the shop was visited by celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal in 2012 as part of his eccentric Channel 4 cooking series Fantastical Food. Ferrero Rocher was first introduced in 1982 and consists of a whole roasted hazelnut encased in a thin wafer shell filled with hazelnut cream including vegetable oil and covered in milk chocolate and chopped hazelnuts. They became popular in the 1990s for their often-imitated 'ambassador's party' TV adverts where a mountain of Ferrero Rochers became synonymous with wealthy gatherings.

"By . Harriet Hernando . London student Nawaal Msaad, 27, pictured arriving at the Old Bailey today, is accused of trying to smuggle cash to Syrian jihadists for 1,000 euros . A student accused of trying to smuggle cash in her underwear to give to a British terrorist allegedly fighting in Syria exclaimed ‘whaaay’ when told she would be paid 1,000 euros, the Old Bailey heard today. Human resources undergraduate Nawal Msaad, 27, was allegedly recruited by her friend Amal El-Wahabi to take the money to her Muslim convert husband Aine Davis. But she was arrested by counter terrorism officers on January 16 this year as she tried to board a flight from Heathrow to Istanbul in Turkey. The court was told that Msaad, from Barnsbury, North London, then pulled out a large wad of notes, which had been tightly wrapped in cling film, from her underwear. Jurors heard Msaad was only asked if she would be a cash mule three days beforehand. Messages exchanged by the friends on mobile phone service WhatsApp were read out in court. On January 13, mother-of-two El-Wahabi wrote to Msaad to arrange the alleged deal: 'Hay (sic) babes r u about this week do u want to do a job.' The Met University student Msaad replied: 'Hey honey, I’m up to my neck in Uni work. What’s it for?' El-Wahabi continued: 'I will call u l8r to explain, u have to go away for 2 days n get paid a grand bt in euros n everything is covered for u.' To which Msaad replied: 'Whaaay.' In further messages El-Wahabi tells her: 'I can’t do it as I have da kids and I’m looking after my brother. So u will do it. It has 2 b done dis week asap. I ask u cuz I trust u.' She then sent a message to her husband, who is believed to have fled the country to pursue the jihadist cause, saying: 'Think I have sum 1.' Msaad then asked: 'What’s this about?' and El-Wahabi replies: 'Can’t explain on dis.' Phone records show the pair exchanged a number of phone calls, the content of which is unknown. Amal El-Wahabi, 27, pictured arriving at the Old Bailey today, allegedly offered student Msaad 1,000 euros to smuggle money to Turkey . But prosecutors claim they were making arrangements to smuggle the cash to Syria. While exchanging messages with Msaad, El-Wahabi messaged her sister Hana El-Wahabi about getting her hair done and eating burgers and chips. At one point she hinted she was going to ask her sister to do it saying: 'Had a job for u to get a grand n 3 holiday bt u cant ur wrking.' She also wrote to her husband Davis, who now goes by the name Hamza, asking if she can send him ‘explicit pics’ of herself. She wrote: 'Can I send u some photos (explicit) up 2 u miss dressing up for u can c my new hair cut n colour.' Internet records show Msaad googled ‘cheap flights to Istanbul,’ ‘cheap flights to Istanbul Ryanair’ and ‘easyjet Istanbul.’ On January 16, Msaad set off to Heathrow but was met at the departure gates by officers and asked why she was travelling to Turkey. She said she was going on a 'short break' and was going to buy some gold for her mother. El-Wahabi, 27, was arrested later the same day at an address in north west London. The women, who are both British, are on trial accused of fundind terrorism. They deny the charge. The trial, which is expected to last five weeks, continues.

"By . Leon Watson . Jailed: Thomas Old, 23, subjected his girlfriend to a sadistic four-hour attack while her young daughter was in the next room . A jealous thug has been jailed after subjecting  his girlfriend to a sadistic four-hour attack while her young daughter was in the next room. Thomas Old, 23, flew into a violent rage when he wrongly thought Rachel McGoldrick had been seeing another man. Armed with gaffer tape and rope, he let himself into her flat using a stolen key, stripped her and tied her up. Having bound and gagged her, Old strangled Miss McGoldrick into unconsciousness, attempted to gouge out her eye and repeatedly beat her. Miss McGoldrick’s horrific injuries included bleeding on the brain, two breaks in her back, a broken eye socket, a broken nose, a broken finger and significant cuts and bruising. Afterwards Old took Miss McGoldrick, a midwifery student, to hospital but forced her to wash off the blood in the shower first. He then made her lie to police, claiming she had been attacked by strangers in the street. Officers did not believe the story and discovered blood-spattered walls in the bedroom and bathroom of her flat in Bournemouth, Dorset. Old pleaded guilty to one count of grievous bodily harm at Bournemouth Crown Court and was jailed by a judge who told him he had shown no mercy to his victim. The court heard that Old suffered from bouts from paranoia brought on by prolonged cannabis abuse and he had got it into his mind Miss McGoldrick had been cheating on him with her former partner. He bombarded Miss McGoldrick with vile text messages and hacked her Facebook account to post pornographic pictures of her. On November 27 last year he went to her flat in Bournemouth and carried out the attack while her two-year-old daughter was there. Rufus Taylor, prosecuting, described the crime as ‘a horrific and sustained attack over a number of hours driven by a perverse sense of jealousy’. Judge Peter Johnson said it is ‘inevitable’ that Miss McGoldrick will suffer ‘long-term, if not permanent, psychological damage.’ He said: 'You thought she had been seeing her ex-partner in a non-platonic way. Bournemouth Crown Court heard Old strangled Miss McGoldrick into unconsciousness, attempted to gauge out her eye and repeatedly beat her . 'Rachel was subjected to a sadistic, sustained and brutal attack, there are no adequate adjectives to describe what you did to her. 'She thought you were going to rape her. 'All the time this happened her young child was in the next room. 'You were striking her while she was bound and bleeding, you showed her no mercy whatsoever.' David Richards, defending, said Old had ADHD as a child and was unpopular at school, eventually being sent to a residential school in Kendall. He said prolonged use of cannabis and more recent use of steroids had made his paranoia worse and he feared rejection. Mr Richards said Old had started his own business and ‘bitterly regrets what he did and hates himself for it.’","Thomas Old flew into a violent rage at Rachel McGoldrick .

"By . James Chapman . Former Commons Speaker Betty Boothroyd last night mounted a ferocious attack on David Cameron for breaking ‘the mould of British history’ by downgrading the status of the new Leader of the House of Lords. Baroness Boothroyd, a respected and much-loved figure on all sides at Westminster, accused the Prime Minister of a ‘careless disregard for the way our constitution works’. She even suggested that the position of International Development Secretary Justine Greening should be downgraded to allow the new Lords leader Baroness Stowell to enjoy the same rank as all of her predecessors. Furious: The much-loved Baroness Boothroyd accused the Prime Minister of a ‘careless disregard for the way our constitution works’ The row has been caused by the Prime Minister’s decision not to grant Lady Stowell full Cabinet status after his reshuffle earlier this month. He decided to downgrade Lady Stowell because of a legal limit on the number of full Cabinet posts and salaries. Awkward: William Hague (left) has kept his place in the Cabinet despite being demoted by David Cameron (right) and he has also kept his salary . The problem with numbers arose because William Hague, in being demoted to Leader of the Commons, has been given Cabinet status – despite the fact that the post did not attract the full Cabinet rank or salary when held by Andrew Lansley. As a consequence, Lady Stowell can attend Cabinet but is not allowed to vote, and is being paid the Lords’ minister of state salary of £78,891 a year, compared with the £101,038 that her predecessor, Lord Hill, received. The unprecedented move has prompted angry protests from senior figures from all three main parties in the House of Lords. Betty Boothroyd has suggested that the position of International Development Secretary Justine Greening (left) be downgraded to allow the new Lords leader Baroness Stowell (right( to enjoy the same rank and priviieges as all of her predecessors . Lady Boothroyd, speaking in an emergency debate in the upper house last night, warned peers they lived in ‘dangerous times’ thanks to Mr Cameron’s decision. ‘The Prime Minister’s demotion of this House in his Cabinet reshuffle challenges its rights, its authority and its long-established role and status in the constitution,’ she said. ‘It breaks the mould of British history. It strikes at the very roots of our bicameral parliament. The place of this House in the Cabinet of every prime minister has never been challenged – until now. ‘I never thought I would witness such careless disregard for the way our constitution works.’ Lady Boothroyd said it was a ‘dead certainty’ that Lady Stowell’s downgraded status would be used as an excuse to ignore the views of the Lords. And, although international development secretaries have been Cabinet ministers since Labour’s Clare Short in 1997, Lady Boothroyd challenged Mr Cameron over the post’s elevated status. She said Mr Cameron’s claim that his hands were tied by the restrictions on the numbers of full Cabinet ministers in the Ministerial Salaries Act 1975 was ‘a pretence’. ‘Which section of that Act dictated that he promoted the Minister for Overseas Development [Miss Greening] to the Cabinet and demoted the Leader of the Lords?’ she demanded. ‘Why is the minister for overseas aid made a secretary of state, with full Cabinet rank and pay, while the salary of the leader of this House and her status is downgraded?’ In an attempt to contain the row, Number 10 said Mr Cameron regarded Lady Stowell’s position as ‘a purely temporary one’ which he aimed to rectify ‘at the earliest opportunity’.

Lady Stowell can attend Cabinet but is not allowed to vote, and is paid a Lords’ minister of state salary of £78,891 a year, compared with the £101,038 that her predecessor, Lord Hill, received ."
"By . James Chapman . Gender pay gap: There was controversy when it emerged Lady Stowell is being paid less than her male predecessor as leader of the House of Lords . The new leader of the House of Lords last night rejected David Cameron’s offer to top up her salary using Conservative Party cash amid a growing row over her downgraded status in Cabinet. Baroness Stowell was among several women appointed to senior roles in last week’s Government reshuffle. Although the overhaul was supposed to promote female MPs, it emerged she was due to be paid significantly less than her male predecessor Lord Hill. The discrepancy, which arose because of a legal limit on the number of full Cabinet posts, meant her salary will be £78,891 a year, compared with Lord Hill’s £101,038. This was seized on by Labour peers, who said it showed ‘contempt’ for her role. Following the row, Conservative sources said it had been decided to supplement Lady Stowell’s salary using party funds, so she is paid the full Cabinet rate. But last night, in a further embarrassment, the Tory peer rejected the extra cash, saying she believes her salary should come only from public funds in order to avoid any appearance of potential conflicts of interest. In a letter to peers, Lady Stowell said: ‘I have decided not to accept this addition to my ministerial salary. ‘Even though additional pay from Conservative Party funds would not break the House of Lords code of conduct for members or the ministerial code, I am a firm believer that when it comes to potential conflicts of interest and especially where money is involved, it is essential that all interested parties feel the right thing is not only done but is also seen to be done. ‘I am all too aware that my responsibilities as Leader of the House of Lords extend beyond the Conservative benches to all parts of the Chamber and to the House as a whole. I feel it only right therefore that my salary comes from a single source and that source should be the public purse consistent with my role as a public servant.’ She also insisted that the Prime Minister had promised to restore the Leader of the Lords to full Cabinet membership ‘at the earliest opportunity’. Lady Stowell’s status was originally downgraded so that outgoing Foreign Secretary William Hague can keep full cabinet status as he remains Mr Cameron’s de facto deputy as Tory leader. There was embarrassment as Downing . Street confirmed that this would mean Lady Stowell was to be paid less . than her predecessor and, for the first time for hundreds of years, the . leader of the Lords would not be a full member of the Cabinet. Power politics: Lady Stowell’s status was originally downgraded so that outgoing Foreign Secretary William Hague, right, can keep full cabinet status as he remains de facto deputy to Tory leader David Cameron, left . UKIP has begun to erode Labour support in key marginal seats that will determine the outcome of next year’s election. The anti-European party would triumph in at least two parliamentary constituencies if voting took place now, according to a poll. Nigel Farage’s party is in first place in Thurrock in Essex and Thanet South in Kent, and second in Great Yarmouth, Suffolk, according to the results of a survey of 14,000 people in 14 constituencies. The research, carried out for former Conservative treasurer Lord Ashcroft, suggests that after doing serious damage to the Tories, Ukip is a threat to Labour. In May, an Ashcroft poll said Labour was set to win 82 Tory seats – but that has been cut to 53. The findings will fuel speculation that Mr Farage will stand in Thanet South, where Tory MP Laura Sandys is leaving her seat. There . is now growing pressure on Mr Hague, who is quitting as an MP at the . next election, to accept a downgrade in his status and a pay cut in . order to make way for Lady Stowell’s position to be enhanced. Peers from all parties are threatening . to back a motion to be tabled by former Commons Speaker Baroness . Boothroyd condemning the decision to undermine the Leader of the Lords’s . status, which has been seen as an ill-thought-through insult to the . second chamber. In a letter to leaders of the Association of Conservative Peers, Mr Cameron said the Lords should be ‘properly represented in the Government at the highest level’ and its leader ‘as a general rule always be a full member of the Cabinet’. He regarded Lady Stowell’s position as ‘a purely temporary one, which I want to rectify at the earliest opportunity’. He promised: ‘I will certainly do so immediately after the general election if I am returned as Prime Minister, if no opportunity has arisen to do so over the coming nine months’. The Prime Minister insisted Lady Stowell ‘will sit at the same place around the Cabinet table, and will have the same full right to speak and contribute to the Cabinet’s business’.","Lady Stowell refused top up from Tory coffers to avoid 'conflict of interest'

Ford yesterday announced the record with news that the number of Fiesta’s registered in the UK topped 4,115,000, compared to the Escort’s total sales figure of 4,105,961 over 32 years. Since its launch, the Fiesta has led the small car segment in the UK for 27 of the 37 years and has been Britain’s best-selling car since 2009 when it overtook the Ford Focus. Mark Ovenden, head of Ford Britain, said: 'The Ford Fiesta has gone from strength to strength and today’s car combines style, value, driving dynamics and remarkable technologies such as the multi-award-winning 1.0-litre EcoBoost engine. 'It continues to outsell its nearest retail competitor by more than two to one - and that really tells the story of this extraordinary car.' Ford Fiesta MK1 in 1976: Since its launch, the Fiesta has led the small car segment in the UK . Ford said the technical progress since the original Fiesta was introduced has been staggering. For example, it would now take more than 80 modern-day Fiestas to generate the same nitrus oxide emissions of a single 1976 Mk1 model. This first-generation Fiesta, with the 46bhp four-cylinder 950cc petrol engine, weighed around 800kg and achieved 37.7mpg. Today a 1.0 litre Fiesta is more than a third heavier, but achieves nearly 66mpg.

Booth's view of day two of the third Test between England and India at . the Ageas Bowl, which saw Ian Bell score 167 to move into the top 10 England run scorers. Ian Bell moved into the top 10 on England’s all-time run-scoring list with his sublime 167, easing out Andrew Strauss along the way. Bell now has 7,068 runs. His 21st Test ton drew him level with Strauss, and pulled him clear of Graham Gooch and Ken Barrington. Big hitter: Ian Bell's 167 against India took him past 7,000 Test runs . ENGLAND FINALLY CLEAR THE ROPE . Bell passed 7,000 with a straight six off Ravindra Jadeja. It was the first of six sixes England hit during the afternoon — with Bell and debutant Jos Buttler launching three each — and the first six they had managed all series. India, by contrast, managed seven sixes in the first two Tests. ALI KNOCKED OUT BY ANOTHER BOUNCER .

Moeen Ali has fallen to a fast bowler for the third time in this series against India . It’s the third time in the series Moeen has been undone by the bouncer, after turning his back at both Trent Bridge and Lord’s, and spooning catches off his glove. LADY LUCK HAS SMILED ON BATSMEN . Gary Ballance was unlucky to have been given out caught behind off his hip after being beaten by an off-break from Rohit Sharma, but England have enjoyed good fortune in this Test. Alastair Cook was dropped on 15, Bell could have been out lbw for a duck, Ballance was possibly caught behind on 10, while Buttler survived an appeal for a slip catch before he had scored. Great escape: Gary Ballance (C) was one of several England batsmen to have decisions go their way . Ballance's innings of 156 means he has now scored 364 runs in the series at an average of 91. That is more than anyone on either side, with Indian opener Murali Vijay in second place, way behind on 328. England’s Joe Root, in third, is even further behind — on 236. ANDERSON HOLDS INDIAN SIGN OVER DHAWANIndian opener Shikhar Dhawan was the star of the show when his team won the Champions Trophy in England last summer. But his dismissal last night for six at the Ageas Bowl, caught at first slip by Cook off Jimmy Anderson, took his series tally to 85 runs in five knocks — and Anderson has now removed him cheaply in three first innings out of three.

Eleven Secret Service employees have so far been put on administrative leave following the incident in Colombia that involved at least some agency personnel bringing prostitutes to their hotel room. The scandal, which involves as many as 20 Colombian women, broke last week after a fight over payment between a prostitute and a Secret Service agent spilled into the hotel hallway.

The 39-year-old, who retired two years ago after playing for Tottenham, Arsenal, Portsmouth, Notts County and Newcastle, claimed in March he could have been England captain for 10 years had he been white. Campbell admits he has been disappointed by the reaction of several black ex-professionals, accusing them of being 'too scared to own up' to the fact they have been victims of - or witnessed - racial abuse.

"By . Mike Dawes . The Malaysian cyclist who competed in gloves bearing the motif 'Save Gaza' at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome has announced he has avoided expulsion from the Commonwealth Games. The Commonwealth Games Federation was looking into Azizulhasni Awang's apparent political protest, which saw him hold his gloves up to a camera on Thursday to show 'Save' written across the right one and 'Gaza' on the left. The CGF seeks to avoid its competitions being used for political means, and Glasgow 2014 officials might have imposed a heavy punishment on the 26-year-old, who was set to compete in the individual sprint quarter-finals on Friday. Hot water: Malaysian cyclist Azizulhasni Awang dipslays a message saying 'Save Gaza' However it appears a warning and instruction not to wear the gloves again will be the limit of his punishment. Awang insisted his message was 'humanitarian' rather than politically charged. He wrote on Facebook: 'I feel sorry to the people who misinterpret my message. There's no such thing with political protest. Defence: Awang said the message on his gloves was not a political statement . All clear: The Malaysian will be allowed to continue his men's sprint campaign in Glasgow . 'It's from the bottom of my heart to express humanitarian.

"By . Steven Donn . Follow @@esdonn . The Scots had come and gone in the pool on Saturday night without truly igniting the Tollcross crowd. That was about to change. With swimming gold having been won on each of the first two days, there was a sense of expectation as the men walked out for the final of the 100 metres breaststroke. This time, they would have to settle for less. Haul: Ross Murdoch adds 100m Breaststroke bronze to his medal haul . Podium: Murdoch stands with gold medallist Adam Peaty of England and the winner of silver Cameron van der Burgh from South Africa . This time, Ross Murdoch would have to settle for bronze. In truth, after turning in fifth position, Murdoch did well to make up the ground on Englishman Adam Peaty and Olympic champion Cameron van der Burgh from South Africa. In the end, despite the deafening roars, it was just not to be Peaty set a Commonwealth Gamesrecord in finishing in 58.94 for gold, with van der Burgh taking silver in a time of 59.28. Murdoch touched the wall in 59.47, with team-mate Craig Benson fourth in 1:00.44. While Murdoch’s bronze couldn’t quite replicate the gold from opening night, it was still aremarkable effort. Yet, while some might have been stunned by the boy from Balfron’s emergence at these Games, it was no surprise that he was involved at the business end of the 100m. In the 200m final on Thursday, Murdoch’s performance against fellow Scot Michael Jamieson, thefavourite, was dominant. He has been producing such efforts in the shorter distance over the last 12 months. That he went faster than his illustrious team-mate has ever gone in 200m was almost lost in the aftermath, as the Olympic silver medallist’s performance was put under the microscope. In action: Murdoch competing in the Men's 100m Breaststroke Final . Jamieson bowed out of the 100m at the semi-final stage on Friday night, bringing an end to his Games. To his credit, he maintained that he would remain a ‘cheerleader’ for the rest of the squad. Last night, however, it was all about the lad who learned to swim in the unassuming environment of theVale of Leven pool in Alexandria. His swimming career had been almost over before it began, with Murdoch making for a rather over-excitable child and thought unsuited to the discipline demanded by the sport. Standing before the blocks, as he waited for the race to begin last night, it wasn’t difficult to imagine him as a hyperactive four-year-old. He was buzzing. Murdoch had qualified second fastest in qualifying, England’s Peaty looking dangerous with aleading time of 59.16. Van der Burgh, the world record holder, was always likely to contend, with the South African alongsidePeaty in lane three. Murdoch’s Scottish team-mate Benson — an Olympic semi-finalist in this event two years ago — was also determined to make an impression, having failed to qualify in either the 50m or 200m. Disappointed: Poster boy Michael Jamieson had to settle for silver in the 200m Final . It was a world-class field — and it would require an inspired performance to emerge victoriousfrom it. Peaty did just that. For Murdoch, he still has the 50m breaststroke to come, as well as an appearance in the 4x100m medley relay. You wouldn’t discount him adding to his tally. He was magnanimous afterwards, paying tribute to the Englishman for being the first Briton to break the 59-second barrier in the event. ‘That was an outstanding swim from Adam,’ admitted Murdoch. ‘I’m delighted for him.’ Elsewhere, there was to be home disappointment in the men’s 50m backstroke semi-finals, as all three Scots fell short — with Jack Ness (10th), Andrew McGovern (11th) and Rory Lamont (13th).","Murdoch takes bronze in Men's 100m Breaststroke Final .

"By . John Greechan . Age need be no barrier to success. At either end of the spectrum. Scotland’s women – well, one woman, one girl – demonstrated the inadequacy of a birth certificate as a judge of anyone’s athletic ability on another rousing night at Tollcross. First para sport swimmer Erraid Davies, already the youngest competitor in Team Scotland history, became the youngest ever competitor – from any nation – to win a Commonwealth Games medal when she produced a storming comeback to take bronze in her 100m breaststroke race. Then Hannah Miley, already a gold medallist from the 400m individual medley and all but on her knees after swimming in a gruelling 800m freestyle heat earlier in the day, proved all of the ageist doubters wrong to claim a shock bronze in the 200m individual medley. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Commonwealth Games: 13 year old Erraid Davies wins bronze . What a star: Scotland's Erraid Davies, 13, holds her bronze medal on the podium after the 100m breaststroke SB9 final. Already the youngest athlete ever to represent Scotland, Erraid became the youngest competitor from any nation to win a Commonwealth Games medal . Glorious moment: Davies smiles as she realised she's won the bronze medal at the end of the 100m race at the Tollcross Swimming Centre . One-two-three: Davies (right) shows off her bronze medal along with winner Sophie Pascoe of New Zealand (centre) and silver medallist Madeleine Scott of Australia (left) Haul: Hannah Miley poses with her Bronze medal in the Women's 200m Individual Medley . Miley, at the grand old age of 24 written off by some as too old and too slow to even hang on to the 400 IM title she’d won in Delhi, spent the build-up to her race cheering on 13-year-old – yes, that’s right, 13 – Davies to a medal. Then the Team Scotland medal machine turned in a powerhouse performance of her own, making a mockery of the theory that swimmers cannot possibly peak beyond a certain age. ‘At 24 years of age, I’m still swimming PBs,’ said the diminutive Miley. ‘A lot of people thought I was too old, I wouldn’t do it, I should be dropped and forgotten about. ‘I might be small but I definitely don’t want to be forgotten about. That’s been a big motivating factor. Age is just a number. It’s about the heart and determination in the athlete. Well done: Gold medallist Sophie Pascoe hugs Davies on the podium after the medals are handed out . All smiles: Davies beams as her medal is presented . ‘For me, I want to prove people wrong – and show a way that you don’t have to stop by 21, 22. Look at some of the world-class swimmers out there showing you can get past the age of 24 and still swim personal bests. Now I’m one of them. ‘Who knows how long I will go on for? Until I stop loving swimming. I’ve got the Olympics in Rio on my horizon and I try taking each block by two years. After that I will have to try and organise a bit of a life. ‘It’s just a matter of how much you want it. Some of us in British swimming think we get told we are past it and our time at the top is finished. ‘To be honest it is up to the athlete themselves to try and change that. For me, being told my time at the top is over doesn’t mean anything. It is only over when I say it.’ It was a first medal for the teenager and she made history by becoming the youngest ever medallist at a Commonwealth Games . That attitude propelled Miley to a fine performance in an event that is far from her favourite, coming back from seventh at the end of the butterfly length to pinch third at the finish. She told Sportsmail: ‘To be honest, I thought the 400 IM was my only shot and that was it. I am very surprised to get a bronze. As you can tell from the grin on my face, I’m happy with that. ‘I’m almost as happy with that as I was with the gold in the 400. And the fourth place in the 200 breast stroke. It’s just been an amazing meet. ‘It’s all about the race and getting stuck in. I thought I would maybe get fourth or fifth place so to go better than that and come away with some hardware is pretty special. ‘Consider that, in Delhi, I only came away with one medal – and I was super proud of that. To come away with two is an added bonus. Home favourite: Miley reacts with delight after discovering she has won the bronze medal in the 200m Individual medley . ‘The 800 free earlier, I died! I was in so much pain! Now I’ve got to do it all over again tomorrow night . ‘I’m just taking every race as an opportunity to swim fast, get into finals and get PBs. That was my goal after day one. ‘I’m in the best shape of my life, so I’m trying to take advantage of that. That shows with the times I’m getting. How will I top this? I’ve no idea.’ If Miley was pleased for her own sake, watching Davies come back to get a medal of her own proved another highlight, the ‘veteran’ saying:  ‘That really inspired me. ‘I was just wanting her to get into a medal position and I am so chuffed for her. ‘I went into my own race with a big grin on my face knowing she had done that. She is such a wee cutie - and it is nice for her to come to her first Commonwealth Games and get a medal.’ A stunned and smiling Davies, roared on to the podium and cheered every inch of the way as she joined her fellow medallists on a lap of honour, said: ‘I feel really, really happy. I didn’t think there was any chance of the medal, although I knew there was a slight chance. I started getting excited during the race. Power: Miley had competed in an 800m freestyle heat earlier in the day but fought off the fatigue to claim bronze in the 200m individual medley . ‘My mum and dad are here and I gave my mum a hug. It’s different being a youngster. I am inspired by my team mates. ‘I’ve looked up to Hannah for a while and it’s being good being here and being able to talk to all the more experienced athletes. ‘I will take my medal to school and show my friends. It has been a bit weird but I feel really happy. ‘The medal ceremony was really good. I didn’t know I was the youngest ever medal winner in the Commonwealth Games . That is amazing. ‘It was strange when the rest of the team made the guard of honour for me but a great feeling.’","Para sport swimmer Davies made history by becoming youngest ever competitor to win a Commonwealth Games medal .

"By . John Drayton . What better way in the modern day for two football legends to reminisce over their great careers than an open conversation on Twitter? Ryan Giggs and Javier Zanetti - who both retired this year - took over the Manchester United and Inter Milan Twitter accounts on Friday to discuss some of their finest moments. Here's how the conversation between the two 40-year-olds went... VIDEO Scroll down to watch Giggs, Scholes, Neville and Butt talking tactics at United . Twitter takeover: Ryan Giggs took over the Manchester United account for a chat with Javier Zanetti . Giggs: Hi Javier. Enjoyed the World Cup? As Argentina's most-capped player, you must be proud to see your team in the final. Zanetti: Amazing, especially for #ARG.Best of luck to our players Rodrigo, @ricky11alvarez & Hugo on Sunday! And how are you, Ryan? Which teams and players have impressed you most? Giggs: I'm good thanks! You have to respect the likes of #CRC and #COL – they’ve held their own on the biggest stage in football. So Javier, is part of you happy not to be doing pre-season training or are you missing it? Zanetti: I have more time with my family now and this is good, but as soon as I have the chance I'm on the pitch playing football . Logged on: Inter Milan legend Zanetti on his laptop as he chats to Giggs over Twitter on Friday . Giggs: Not sure I'll miss the training! Although, I admit I always loved the buzz around getting back into the swing of things. Not playing will be strange but I’m excited for my new role. You’re vice-president at @Inter now. That’s a big challenge… . Zanetti: It's very strange, but what awaits is a great challenge.The most important thing was remaining in this great Inter family . You have a new challenge too, as assistant coach to Louis van Gaal. He's had a great World Cup… . Giggs: I can't wait to get started. I'm still in the early stages of my coaching so to work with Louis is a great opportunity. As you know, we both retired this summer. How difficult was your decision? I thought long and hard about it… . Legends: Zanetti (right) makes a challenge on Giggs during the Champions League quarter-final in 1999 . Zanetti: I knew it would happen sooner or later. I was lucky to play until I was 40, so I have no regrets . I was wondering... if you hadn't been a footballer, what would you have done in all these years? Giggs: I get asked this question a lot. Definitely something sporty! Possibly golf. The reaction I’ve had from fans since I retired has been incredible. You must have had the same at Inter… . Zanetti: The Inter fans showed me love throughout my career. I can't thank them enough for the support . Do any fan moments stand out for you? Giggs: Well... there have been so many at Old Trafford. When we were going for the Treble in '99, we went 1-0 down against Spurs... but our fans were just amazing. You could feel the push from the crowd and we went on to win 2-1. I'll never forget it. Zanetti: People always ask me for my best moment but it’s so hard to pick one. Have you got a favourite? Giggs: So many! But it has to be lifting the Champions League trophy in Barcelona, back in 1999. You? Euro glory: Giggs (left) looks on as Paul Scholes holds the European Cup aloft at the Nou Camp in 1999 . Zanetti: It's hard for me to choose but, like you, it was when we won the Champions League in Madrid . Giggs: If there’s one game you could relive what would it be? Zanetti: The cup final vs Lazio in Paris in 1998, just to be able to feel all those emotions one more time . If I ask you the same, I bet you'll say that final against Bayern Munich in 1999... Stalwart: Zanetti (centre), pictured here scoring against Spurs in 2010, retired in May . Giggs: Definitely… although I only want to relive the last five minutes! Winning that Treble in 1999 was just incredible. How did you feel winning it with Inter in 2010? Zanetti: It was an unforgettable year for Inter fans. We won the Treble but we added two more trophies to make it a total of five . So, Ryan... You played with so many players down the years. Which ones did you get on best with? Giggs: You'll get me in trouble here, Javier! I'd have to say Nicky Butt, Gary & Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and David Beckham. Going back to 1999, we played against you guys in the quarter-finals. They were tough games, remember? Stalwart: Zanetti (centre), pictured here scoring against Spurs in 2010, retired in May . Zanetti: Of course! I remember our own personal duel. You are one of the toughest opponents I have ever played against . I'm looking forward to seeing you again this summer, in the USA. It's a pity we won't be playing against each other! Giggs: I know! But I think I would have to wear a face guard... I still remember your elbow! Haha, see you soon. Zanetti: Haha! Sorry about that.I'm looking forward to it as well.See this commemorative shirt? It's for you . Gift: Zanetti will present this commemorative Inter shirt to Giggs in America later this month . Giggs: Wow! Thanks so much. I have a shirt for you as well.

"By . Gavin Mccafferty, Press Association . Perth teenager Stephen Milne is looking to bring the curtain down on a stunning Commonwealth Games by doing 'something special' in the 1500 metres freestyle final. But the 19-year-old will have to pull out something remarkable to surpass his Glasgow 2014 achievements so far. Milne was part of the Scotland relay team that pushed hot favourites Australia all the way on Sunday night in the 4x200m freestyle relay before eventually claiming a silver medal. Aim: Stephen Milne is hoping to do 'something special' in the 1500m freestyle final on Tuesday . And he followed that up on Monday lunchtime by challenging reigning champion and Olympic silver medallist Ryan Cochrane to the very end in his 1500m heat, knocking more than 12 seconds off his personal best in the process. Milne posted a time of 15:03.38 minutes, finishing just nine-hundredths of a second behind the Canadian after 30 lengths of the Tollcross pool. Milne, who also made the 400m final, said: 'I was very happy with how the swim went. I just focus on the wee bits on how to improve for (Tuesday's) final and hopefully I do well then. 'Me and my coach had worked pretty well throughout the season and taper seems to be going quite well, but I know that the job's not done yet. 'I still need to refocus for the final and hopefully do something special then.' Making waves: Milne reacts after winning the men's 1500m Freestyle - Heat 3 . Milne and team-mates Daniel Wallace, Duncan Scott and Robbie Renwick almost brought the house down on Sunday night in the relay, which was neck and neck until the final length. The Scots finished less than two seconds behind Australia and inside the champions' previous Games record. Milne said: 'The 1500 is the event I have looked forward to the most. I'm glad it's come but I was really, really happy to do the 4x2. It was a huge privilege to be with those guys swimming in that final. 'I will never forget that night. The team did so well, including the guys in the heats to help us rest up for the evening. It was a good effort. Home: The Tollcross crowd have been getting behind the Scottish swimmers . 'We knew from last time the boys did silver and this time we wanted to do as well if no better. We all swam really well.' The Tollcross crowd have responded to all the competitors but especially the Scottish swimmers and Milne is determined to repay their support. 'It's absolutely amazing, the crowd has been wonderful and it's really good to have all that cheering for us,' he said. 'It's inspiring for us and we like to put on a good show for them.'","Stephen Milne hoping to end his stunning Games campaign with 1500m win .

"By . Mike Dawes . Surrey captain Graeme Smith will not be returning to the Oval next season due to his continued battle with injury. The former South Africa skipper played just three first-class games for the county last season due to an ankle injury and was ruled out for the rest of this campaign after fracturing his knee in May, subsequently undergoing surgery to resolve the problem. And now doctors have advised that Smith will not be able to 'fulfil the . day-to-day duties of a full county season', with both parties agreeing . to end his three-year stay a year early. On his way out: Graeme Smith will no longer be plying his trade at the Oval . In action: Smith strikes the ball during a match between Surrey and Sussex in April 2013 . 'I thoroughly enjoyed the privilege of captaining Surrey but due to my injuries in 2013 and 2014 I have been unable to fulfil my role in achieving the goals that both Surrey and I set out to accomplish when I first arrived,' Smith told www.kiaoval.com. 'I would like to thank Surrey for the way they have looked after me. They have made me feel very welcome and it is very apparent that the current cricket management and personnel in the dressing room are already well on their way to achieving these goals. 'I will continue to follow the club's progress over the coming years.' No return: Smith will leave the Oval after spending three years at the club . Smith played eight championship games in total for Surrey, scoring 383 runs including an innings of 103 against Gloucestershire at the Oval this year. Surrey director of cricket Alec Stewart said: 'On behalf of the club, and particularly the dressing room, I would like to thank Graeme for the impact he has had in the time that he was with us over the last two years.

"By . John Greechan . Heir to Hoy. It’s a mantle that Callum Skinner naturally ducks, insisting that there will only ever be one Sir Chris; for starters, it would be hard to imagine Scotland building another velodrome in order to honour yet another god of the boards. Still, Skinner is Scotland’s No. 1 male track rider. That’s an honour to be prized in itself. A status that the 21-year-old seems to carry with some sense of authority. He’s competing in three events at Glasgow 2014 – the sprint, team sprint and kerin, the latter complete with moped-riding Dr Death figure leading the riders around at ever-increasing speed before a manic finish. Young star: Callum Skinner is competing in three events at Glasgow 2014 . On track: Callum Skinner, pictured when he was 16, is expected to impress in Glasgow . Plans to ride in the lung-bursting, eyeball-popping, strength-sapping kilo were only scratched at the last minute. Because riding in *four* all-or-nothing events would be just silly, right? After a fortnight together, Skinner and his two wing men go in the team sprint on Wednesday, each aware that they’re following in some pretty impressive traditions. ‘We’re lucky to have come through at a time when Chris Hoy, Craig MacLean and others have already blazed a trail for Scottish and British track cycling,’ Skinner, a key member of the Team GB set-up built in part on the strength of Hoy, tells Sportsmail. ‘It’s a real honour to know that we’re benefiting from the things they did, learning in a system that they helped to develop. But that doesn’t mean we can ever be compared to someone like Chris. ‘Personally, I’m trying to make a name for myself. There is no shortcut in cycling, you simply have to work your way to the top. Just because you’re Scottish or British, doesn’t mean you have some right to win a race. ‘I feel ready. With the Scotland team doing their holding camp in Manchester, where I’m based with British Cylcling all the time, it’s been ideal for me. ‘We’ll have had just over two weeks together before the Games. That should be enough to get us reacquainted with each other, pick the best team – and get ready to compete. ‘It’s been a bit tricky catching up with Team Scotland riders. They’ve all been run off their feet, especially the coaches. But I know them all really well. ‘The team sprint is going to be exciting, I think. We’ve had some real internal competition for places – which is something that has been missing from the Scotland squad for four or five years. ‘It’s nothing but a positive to have guys fighting for places because it pushes everybody on. Personally, my team sprint form is pretty good going into the Games.’ Skinner was actually inspired to take up track cycling by watching Hoy win gold in the kilo at the Athens Olympics back in 2004 – and, within four years, he’d won the inaugural Chris Hoy trophy as reward for an explosive start in the sport. Legend: Sir Chris Hoy is idolised across Britain for his service to cycling . Role model: Young star Skinner looks up to fellow Scotsman Hoy . The Edinburgh rider has rarely dropped pace since, despite suffering breathing problems that threatened to prevent him reaching his potential. ‘The asthma thing is something I’ve had problems with recently,’ he says, adding: ‘But I’ve been working with specialists who have managed to come up with a solution. ‘There have been times in the past when I’ve had coughs that drag on and on, two or three weeks at least. I’ve had it from childhood – and, when I was a junior, I took almost a month off because I couldn’t shift this cold. ‘You get athletes who are always injured, some who always get ill. If you get both, you won’t make much progress! ‘British Cycling have been very helpful, sending me to a specialist with more qualifications and awards than I could ever remember. 'He’s a real respiratory specialist and he’s been great at solving the problem, to the extent that less than a week after having a chest infection I’m back to full fitness – that’s a world away from where I used to be.’ Training in Manchester, Skinner has been winding up his Team GB mates now representing their own home nations, the intra-squad banter building as the Games have approached. Anything to gain an edge? ‘I am into my sports psychology and, funnily enough, my sports psychologist will be competing at the Games,’ revealed Skinner. ‘He’s going to be a tandem pilot for Northern Ireland – Dave Readle. It’ll be quite funny to see him there. I wish him the best and glad he’s not competing in my event, because he’ll know all my weaknesses. ‘For me, once I get to the start, I am quite content. But I concern myself with all the little things you have to do just to get to the start line. ‘My warm-up will start an hour or an hour-and-a-half before then, everything is quite carefully done. ‘When I’m on the track, it’s simple. You ride your bike as fast you can, hope it’s good enough to win. ‘As for the rest of the competition, it’s been a bit more tricky than normal because normally the Aussies and Kiwis come to the races we – British Cycling – were at in Germany recently .They’re considered the Mecca for sprint cycling. ‘You tend to get 60-odd world class sprinters battling hard all day, until someone finishes on top. But the Kiwis and Aussies both went elsewhere this year. ‘You can get quite drawn into worrying about how fast someone else is, what they’ve been doing here and there – I prefer to focus on my own preparation. If a Kiwi did a world-record time, what would I do about it? It wouldn’t affect me. ‘I go back to the World Junior Championships, when all the riders were staying in the hotel, all making the classic mistake. We’d see a German posting on Twitter that he’d done an incredible time – and the only basis for it is what he’s written in those 140 characters. ‘There could be nothing behind it at all. But he’s posted it, managed to rattle you a bit – and that was the intention. It’s best to keep your head out of that.’ Like most Team Scotland competitors, Skinner has only reached this point thanks to the backing of family – particularly dad Scott and mum, Judith Crichton. As long as neither of them emulate the on-screen antics of Bert le Clos, the dad of South African swimmer Chad becoming a TV smash with his ‘unbelievable’ outburst, Callum will be more than happy to give them their due. ‘My mum and dad have been through the whole process since day one and, although they’ll play it down, it’s massively important for them to be involved in this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,’ said Callum. ‘They probably remember getting me my first bike. My mum is the sporty one, she’ s always been a real help through difficult times. ‘She is probably training harder than me at the moment – she works three days a week and does triathlon training the rest of the time. She’s massively into it, really working hard . ‘She keeps giving me updates and it’s a role reversal from what I used to do: “I did this time today, it’s second best in my age category …” I’m sending her messages back saying: “Well done.” ‘I remember even when she was working full time, she did a few marathons. I got the sporting gene from here, definitely. ‘She’s even been away at a warm-weather training camp, which is the kind of stuff we do. It’s amazing. She’s really diving in head first with it. ‘My dad is at the opposite end of the spectrum. The less activity, the better. It’s quite good to have that contrast, because I can speak to each of them about different aspects of life. ‘It’s great for the parents of. My favourite one was the South African dad at the swimming at London 2012. My mum could be on TV, no problem – although she would probably want to talk about her triathlon time! ‘She might also have some baby photos of me, which could be interesting if she started showing them ….’","Commonwealth Games hopeful Skinner is Scotland's No 1 male track rider .

"By . Paul Hirst, Press Association . Ander Herrera is sure Louis van Gaal will do his utmost to keep his Manchester United players grounded after their 7-0 destruction of the Los Angeles Galaxy. Van Gaal began life as United coach in the best way possible on Wednesday night. Wayne Rooney, Ashley Young and debutant Reece James all scored twice, and Danny Welbeck also found the net as United crushed the Galaxy in the Pasadena Rose Bowl. Missing link: Ander Herrera made an impressive Manchester United debut on their pre-season tour . Shining star: Herrera worked tirelessly, breaking up attacks and creating openings with incisive passes . More to come: The Spaniard also won Man of the Match for his performance but he is not getting carried away . Although he did not get on the score sheet, Herrera was United's best player on the night. The 24-year-old, who moved to Old Trafford in a £28million transfer earlier this summer, worked tirelessly from box to box, breaking up attacks and creating openings with incisive passes. Herrera has only been working with his new manager for a week, but he knows Van Gaal well enough to realise he will not let the drubbing get to his players' heads. 'We are happy with the result but let's not forget this is a friendly and we still have many things to improve on,' said Herrera, who was voted man of the match for his performance in California. 'Our coach is a very demanding coach, he always looks for only perfection and for that reason he is ideal for a club that always looks to achieve the greatest things, he won't let us sit back and relax or sit back, we still have a lot to prove.' VIDEO Van Gaal delighted with new-look United . The right man: Louis van Gaal has all the attributes and experience to put United back at the top . United tried to sign Herrera last summer, but the transfer fell through. Now the Spaniard is happy to be playing for a club he has watched and admired since he was young. Herrera, speaking in an MUTV interview before kick-off, revealed United icon Eric Cantona was one of his own childhood heroes. 'I liked his character, he was a winner and always worked hard, he never lost one ball and was always thinking about the victory,' the midfielder said of the Frenchman, who won four titles in five years at Old Trafford. 'This group of players (at United) has those same characteristics. We always want to win, we want to play well for the Man United supporters and Eric Cantona had those characteristics. Of course, he had personality too.' Inspiration: Multi-title winning United legend Eric Cantona was an idol of Herrera's growing up . Herrera's performance drew praise from compatriot Juan Mata, who also excelled in the 3-5-2 formation deployed by Van Gaal. United's club-record signing expects big things from Herrera, who he knows well from their time together with the Spain Under-21 squad. 'He is a great player and he showed that in the match,' the former Chelsea midfielder said. 'I have known about him for a while from our days with the Spanish national youth teams and he was very good against the Galaxy. 'I am very happy for him. We have a good connection on and off the pitch. 'He can bring great things for us this year.' Belief: Juan Mata has praised his countryman Herrera and backed him to thrive at United . Mata's January move from Chelsea failed to stop United slipping to a seventh-place finish last year under David Moyes. The Spaniard is aiming for a much higher position this term. 'Since I was a kid this club was trying to win the Premier league and so we will try to do that this year,' Mata said. United flew to Denver on Thursday afternoon to begin preparations for their first game in the International Champions Cup against Roma. After playing the Italian giants, who have Ashley Cole in their squad, United will travel to Washington DC and Michigan to face Inter Milan and Real Madrid respectively. If they top their group, United will contest the final in Miami on August 4.

"By . John Mcgreechan . Michael Jamieson was backed on Tuesday to lead Team Scotland to glory as senior management set their sights on a day-one gold rush at Glasgow 2014. Commonwealth Games Scotland chairman Michael Cavanagh fully expects the host nation to have bagged at least one gold medal by the end of Thursday's opening programme. Home hopes are pinned on Olympic hero Jamieson and former world champion Hannah Miley - both in action at Tollcross Pool - while cycling and judo are among the other sports expected to deliver. ‘Our expectation is that, at the end of the night, Scotland will have gold on the medal board – absolutely,’ said Cavanagh. ‘But it’s sport. Michael Jamieson will do everything he can to win a gold medal, as will Hannah Miley, as will Aileen McGlynn and the other athletes going on that day. They’ll be giving it everything. ‘Form right now and home advantage points to success. Michael is a really strong prospect – but even Ross Murdoch, his own team-mate, is pushing him hard. ‘Michael is always confident, he knows what shape he’s in, he’s talking confidently. Of all the athletes in the team, if you’re looking for someone to step up when the pressure on, Michael is your man. ‘We haven’t stuck Michael up there to lead us – but he’s that kind of athlete. He is confident and he seems to thrive on this pressure. That’s the kind of athlete you want to lead from the front. ‘He’s the kind of guy who recognises the impact it can have. So, while he wants to win gold for himself, he’s well aware of what a boost he can deliver to the team. ‘Obviously we’ve got the velodrome, where some para sport athletes have a great chance – and then the one thing everyone has been talking about is the first night in the swimming pool, where two of our most experienced athletes are going in their best events. ‘I don’t think anybody should pin a gold medal on an athlete before they’ve actually won. While Michael Jamieson is a fantastic swimmer, and we know from London that he thrives on a big stage, he’s got a big job to do.’ Campaign: The 25-year-old begins his gold medal quest on Thursday in the 200m breaststroke final . Pedigree: Jamieson won a silver medal in the 200m Breaststroke at London 2012 . Meanwhile, star attraction Usain Bolt yesterday insisted he is determined to leave Glasgow with a gold medal. The world’s fastest man, who has a staggering 14 Olympic and World Championship gold medals to his name, is desperate to capture the one prize that has so far eluded him. ‘I really wanted to run at the Commonwealth Games over the years,’ he said. ‘I’m going there for my fans and I’m going there to show I’m getting back into shape - and that they can look for great things now and for the years to come.’ Bolt has promised to rock Hampden with an electrifying display of sprinting power - to prove he has left his injury troubles behind him. The Jamaican is only running in the 4x100 relay, having missed his national trials while recovering from minor foot surgery and a hamstring problem. He said: ‘It’s been rough but I’ve been through it a couple of times so I know what it takes to get back. So I’m just pushing on and working towards what’s necessary for this season.’","Jamieson backed to lead Team Scotland to gold in Glasgow .

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association Sport . Lewis Hamilton feels he has proven after two of the toughest weeks of his Formula One career he is not a driver to crack under pressure. It was after a poor error of judgement in qualifying for the British Grand Prix that gave Mercedes team-mate and title rival Nico Rosberg pole position Sir Jackie Stewart suggested Hamilton's head 'had gone a bit'. But in the wake of shocking bad luck in qualifying for the last two races in Germany and Hungary that placed Hamilton's back against the wall, the 29-year-old came out fighting and conjured two astonishing drives. I'll drink to that: Lewis Hamilton finished third in Sunday's race despite starting from the pit lane . Challenger: He is up against Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg for the 2014 title . In Hockenheim, following a brake disc failure that pitched him into a 30g impact into a tyre barrier, Hamilton powered his way to third from 20th on the grid. At the Hungaroring, a fuel leak caused a fire that wrecked his car, and given the damage and subsequent re-build he was forced to start from the pit lane. A spin on lap one in wet conditions only compounded Hamilton's woes, yet in the face of adversity he again rose to third. There was also controversy as he was asked to move aside for Rosberg at one stage, with the duo on different strategies. Hamilton refused, which proved crucial as he managed to keep Rosberg behind him in the dying moments of the 70-lap race when the German was on a charge on fresh tyres. Given Hamilton's gross misfortune so far this season, as he has also suffered two retirements to Rosberg's one, it is no wonder he cannot wait to recharge his batteries. 'It's been a very trying, challenging and testing last two weeks, and to be able to still keep myself together...,' said Hamilton. 'I saw one story that I would crack under the pressure, well these last two weeks have shown that's not the case, that I'm still in the fight and raring to go. 'This break will be good for me now to re-energise, get fit, and with the car lighter (in the absence of the FRIC suspension system) I can maybe put some weight on and come back stronger, both physically and mentally.' Back to the wall: Hamilton came from the back of the grid to finish third in Hungary . Overtake: Hamilton on the shoulder of Sebastian Vettel . Before then, however, there are clear-the-air talks to be held with Rosberg, Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff and executive technical director Paddy Lowe, whose suggestion it was for Hamilton to yield. Hamilton knows to have done so, when both he and Rosberg were still in with a chance of the win on lap 51 when the call was made, would almost certainly have damaged his championship chances. Going into the break with eight races remaining, Hamilton now trails Rosberg by just 11 points. A far from happy Rosberg has made it clear he feels Hamilton was in the wrong as he said: 'Lewis didn't let me by, although he was ordered to so, so that's obviously not good and we need to discuss that internally. 'That's the best way forward for us as a team. It's pretty obvious what happened, it was all on the radio. 'So we need to discuss it, we will discuss it, and we will see how we move forward.' Blow: Rosberg was leading Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix until the deployment of the safety car . Holding station: Lewis Hamilton ignored a direct team order from the pit wall to let Nico Rosberg through . Asked as to whether he felt he would have won the race, Rosberg said: 'That's so theoretical. I don't know....ah, no, no, no, let's go by what Toto said (that Rosberg could have). 'He's looked at all the data and things like that, so let's go by his opinion. He's the best person to know that.' Rosberg, however, bristled when he was questioned on whether if roles had been reversed he would have done the same for Hamilton. 'I'm sorry that's not something that's relevant now to discuss,' snapped Rosberg. 'It's hypothetical, theoretical, it's not relevant.'","Hamilton feels he is not going to crack under pressure of F1 title battle .

Either way, it's hilarious to listen to and it would be incredibly disappointing not to hear any of them maintain the regional touch to any interviews over the next season.

"By . Damian Spellman . Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet is desperate for a transfer breakthrough after growing frustrated with a recent lack of new arrivals. Sporting director Lee Congerton is working hard behind the scenes to add to the early summer captures of Costel Pantilimon, Billy Jones and Jordi Gomez - but his efforts to land Fabio Borini, Marcos Alonso and a series of other targets since are yet to bear fruit. Poyet is hopeful of having another signing on board before he and his players head for their pre-season training camp in Portugal on Friday, but he admits the wait is causing him a headache. Frustrated: Sunderland boss Gus Poyet needs a breakthrough in this summer's transfer window . He told the Sunderland Echo: 'I'm waiting and waiting, which is not nice. You're expecting to do a couple of deals, but they're not happening. 'People say ""don't be anxious or nervous"". I think there will be at least one in by tomorrow, and I hope at the weekend we can have three in. 'But the word I'm saying is 'hope'. It's a matter of time, but as the days go past, that becomes difficult. 'We are waiting, we are desperate to do something in the next few days because we are going to Portugal and we need to have as many players as possible in place by the time we get there.'

"By . Associated Press . The mother of a Mexican teen who was shot to death by a U.S. Border Patrol agent nearly two years ago sued the agency today. Araceli Rodriguez said her son was playing basketball with his girlfriend and friends minutes before he was hit in the back by at least eight bullets . Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez, 16, was in Nogales, Sonora, near the tall, steel fence that divides the United States and Mexico when a U.S. Border Patrol agent shot him from Nogales, Arizona, on Oct. 10, 2012. Scroll down for video . Araceli Rodriguez sits in her home in Nogales, Mexico, next to a small shrine she's made to honor her son Jose Antonio, a 16-year-old who was gunned down by U.S. Border Patrol . Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez was shot by U.S. Border Control on October 10, 2012 . The Border Patrol has said Elena Rodriguez was among a group of people throwing rocks at agents across the border, endangering their lives. The ACLU, which filed the lawsuit in federal court in Tucson on behalf of Araceli Rodriguez, says the shooting was another example of border agents using excessive force without consequences. Araceli Rodriguez says her son never had a rock or any other weapon. The Border Patrol does not comment on pending litigation, spokesman Andy Adame said. Agency officials in the past have defended agents' use of force. Chief Michael Fisher said at a border expo in March that there's been a mischaracterization that agents 'indiscriminately' open fire. 'If you are like me, there's nothing more terrifying than fighting for your life when you're alone with no communication, and the thought for a split second that you may never get home at the end of that shift to see your wife and son again,' Fisher said. 'The only thing that is equal to the ripple of fear is thinking of having to use deadly force against another human being.' Immigrant rights groups have long claimed that agents are trigger-happy. In the lawsuit, the ACLU alleges that the border patrol has a 'systematic' problem with use of force. 'Jose Antonio's killing by U.S. Border Patrol agents is unfortunately not a unique event, but part of a larger problem of abuse by border patrol agents in Nogales and elsewhere,' the lawsuit states. The lawsuit filed is seeking civil damages against the agents through a jury trial.

"By . Marcus Townend . A week Sir Michael Stoute will probably want to forget might just end with a reminder why the 10-time champion Newmarket trainer is held in such high esteem. Becoming embroiled in the spate of positive tests for Morphine which have hit the sport is hardly the way Stoute would have chosen to prepare for Ascot’s £1million Qipco King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes, the midsummer highlight of the Flat season. Especially when one of your two horses involved is the headline-grabbing Queen’ s 2013 Ascot Gold Cup winner and 2014 runner-up Estimate. The fact that the blame for the positives appears to lie with a feed manufacturer will hardly have lessened the embarrassment. Bad week: Estimate, trained by Sir Michael Stoute and owned by the Queen, tested positive for morphine . But the reason the Queen turned to Stoute to train her horses was because of his reputation for patiently and successfully producing champions. Five winners in the King George, starting with Shergar 1981, have been sent out from his Freemason Lodge Stables and one more will make Stoute the most successful trainer in the race’s history. In Telescope, the 2-1 favourite, Stoute saddles a Ryan Moore-ridden colt which has been typically given time to find its feet after injury disrupted its 2013 season and prevented a Derby tilt. Defeat on his first two runs in 2014 did not derail the Stoute master-plan and when Telescope streaked seven lengths clear in Royal Ascot’s Hardwicke Stakes his place in this afternoon’s race was sealed. That performance inevitably drew comparisons with Stoute’s latest King George winner, Harbinger, owned like Telescope by Highclere Throughbred Racing, who completed the Hardwicke-King George double in 2010. Favourite: Sir Michael Stoute's horse Telescope is strong favourite for the King George VI . Gold Cup: The Queen and her daughter Princess Anne greet the horse, Estimate . Harry Herbert, racing manager for Highclere, said: ‘Sir Michael has trained him brilliantly to come in his own time. ‘We have had late-maturing horses with Sir Michael. At this time of year, they find their strength and maturity and start improving in leaps and bounds. You just never know how far. ‘Telescope had a very high profile for a long time. It was incredibly public when he didn’t make the Derby and there have been a couple of other issues. Suddenly he got the reputation of being  a talking horse. ‘But he has never been out of the first two in his life, was impressive when he won last season’s Great Voltigeur Stakes and would run in the Champion Stakes but got a tiny bone chip in a fetlock joint. ‘He developed mentally and really relaxed and switched off through the winter so Michael  said it was going to take a race or two to get him fit and after he was beaten by Noble Mission at Chester in May, Sir Michael said to make sure I told the owners not to lose faith. Feed: Estimate's positive drug test was a result of horse feed contaminated with morphine . ‘At Royal Ascot we saw the blossoming Telescope. In right conditions he is a talented horse.’ One of those owners is ex-Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who might make it to Ascot after a bug prevented him leaving with his former team on their US tour earlier this week. Ferguson is shrewd enough to know Telescope and Stoute’s reputation are built into his odds with strong opponents lining up. They include William Haggas-trained Eclipse Stakes winner Mukhadram and Aidan O’ Brien’s 2013 Breeders’ Cup Turf hero Magician, who looks  a big danger. A high temperature has ruled out Andre Fabre’s French hope Flintshire but the heavy showers that fell on the track yesterday turning the going Good have ensured the participation of John Gosden’s King Edward VII Stakes winner Eagle Top. Gosden saddles two other three-year-olds making this the clash of the generations the King George is meant to be. They are Derby third Romsdal and Oaks winner Taghrooda, who receives a significant 15lb from Telescope. A win for any of his trio would be a significant blow in Gosden’s attempts to win a second trainers’ championship.","Sir Michael Stoute trains the Queen's horse, Estimate .

"By . Ian Laybourn, Press Association . Leeds and England captain Kevin Sinfield was sensationally sent off for the first time in his career as the Rhinos were held to a dramatic draw by Castleford in a pulsating derby at Headingley. Sinfield was shown a red card for an uncharacteristic headbutt on Castleford full-back Luke Dorn eight minutes from the end of a tense and keenly-fought match, with his side leading 24-18. Castleford took advantage of the extra man to score an equalising try through loose forward Grant Millington two minutes later and, although both sides failed with late drop-goal attempts to break the deadlock, that is the way it stayed. Seeing red: Kevin Sinfield walks after being sent off at Headingley . The point was enough to take Leeds back to the top of the First Utility Super League but the talking point was the dismissal of Sinfield, who was awarded the MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours for services to rugby league. Two opportunist tries from second rower Carl Ablett were the highlight of a high-tempo game that flowed from the first whistle and was marred only by referee Ben Thaler's insistence on over-use of his video assistant. Castleford drew first blood through skipper Michael Shenton, touching down after his winger Justin Carney had palmed the ball back from Marc Sneyd's high kick, but a knock-on from the re-start by winger Kirk Dixon put his side under pressure. Rhinos scrum-half Danny McGuire had a try ruled out by video referee Phil Bentham before the home side struck with two tries in quick succession. Right winger Tom Briscoe outjumped his opposite number Carney to touch down McGuire's towering kick before substitute forward Ryan Bailey scored with his first touch after left-wing pair Ryan Hall and Joel Moon had both kept the ball alive superbly from Sinfield's kick. Dixon made amends for his earlier error by creating the space for former Leeds second rower Weller Hauraki to go over for an equalising try and the visitors would have been back in front but for some heroics by Zak Hardaker, back from a five-match ban. First the full-back pulled off a trysaving tackle on Dorn and then forced a handling error from Sneyd over the line. It seemed which ever side had the ball were destined to score and Ablett was the next to do so, forcing his way past a trio of defenders on a solo run to the line and juggling with the ball before grounding it. Sinfield kicked his third conversion to make it 18-12 but the scores were tied once more seven minutes before the break when Castleford substitute Nathan Massey proved unstoppable from 10 metres out to score his first try of the season with his first touch. There was no let-up to the action in the second half as play continued to swing from end to end. Leeds were indebted once more to Hardaker after he halted a break by Castleford's livewire hooker Daryl Clark and they were relieved to see Carney's try disallowed by Bentham for obstruction in the build-up by Shenton. When it was the Rhinos' turn to attack, the ever-dangerous Moon was twice bundled into touch by Webster at the corner and prop Kylie Leuluai was held up over the line., . Leeds had another escape when Millington could only get his finger tips to the ball from Shenton's kick and they were in luck when Ablett scored his second try to regain the lead on 58 minutes. Moon's grubber kick on the last tackle rebounded off Webster and Ablett twice hacked the ball forward before diving on it just centimetres from the dead-ball line. Sinfield's fourth goal restored his side's six-point lead and his drop-goal attempt that would have made the game safe was charged down. It was to be Sinfield's last contribution as he was dismissed for his rush of blood, but there was no end to action. Two consecutive penalties enabled Castleford to pile on the pressure and it paid off when Millington took Lee Jewitt's pass to charge through a gaping hole in the Leeds defence. Sneyd kicked his fourth goal to tie the scores and Jamie Peacock and Sneyd both failed with one-point attempts to win it.","England skipper shown red card for a headbutt .

"By . Darren Boyle . This is the terrible moment a horse was seriously injured during a bullfight after it was gored by the rampaging animal. As the bull charged, the matador tried to stab it in the back with a spear but the bull continued its run, dropped its head and hit it in the barrel. The matador tried to hang on to his horse as the animal fell onto its side. The horse reared up, and was struck a second and a third time by the bull which had to be lured away from the scene. The shocking incident happened at the Corrida de Toros in Valencia, Spain. However, on this occasion, the picador was too slow allowing the bull a side-on attack. Fans paid between €12 and €120 to attend the show. Luckily, the horse was saved from serious injury and limped from the stadium after its ordeal. Bullfighting has been banned around Barcelona and has reduced in popularity in recent years. A recent opinion poll found that almost three quarters of Spanish people dislike the sport.

The horse is twisted around 90 degrees by the force of the bull as the picador attempts to hold onto the reins as his blindfolded ride rears up . The bull continues his attack, aiming his large horns under the horse's two front legs, tearing at the special padding designed to prevent serious injury .

"By . Naomi Greenaway . If you're on the well-endowed side of the underwear alphabet, wearing a bra that doesn't feel like it's reinforced with iron rods may seem like a mere fantasy - not anymore. Those trusty underwear scientists at M&S have come up with an invention that made our ears prick up, and is said to be guaranteed to make some other body parts perk up too. Fresh from the M&S lingerie laboratory comes a new non-wired bra for those blessed with DD+ cups and larger. Scroll down for video . M&S's new non wired bra (left and right) promises all the support of an underwired bra without the stiff infrastructure . Instead of providing underwired support, the new gravity-defying piece of engineering uses 'compressed cup technology'. So what does that actually mean? The foam cups are specially moulded and shaped to give support and compression in key areas of the cup in order to simulate the shape and support a wire gives. It took over a year for the experts to find exactly the right balance of compression to create a sexy, plunging, yet comfortable and supported shape. It also includes a supportive cradle and smoothing wing shape and help keep the bra in place and give a flattering smoothing back feature and prevent any unsightly back bulges or VBL (visible bra line!). The straps are also made of densely woven fabric for improved support. The . clothing giant's head of lingerie innovation, Paschal Little, said: . 'Compressed cup technology is the hidden secret behind our innovative . new DD+ bra. 'Fitted . and developed on real women, this innovative bra has been developed . using decades of M&S technical know-how, together with highly . skilled, specialist lingerie manufacturers.' The non wired invention is available in two colours and is priced at £22.50 . Soozie Jenkinson, head of lingerie . design for M&S, added: 'We are excited to launch this state-of-the-art . non wired DD+ bra/ Designed with a beautiful plunge neckline this bra is developed for women who are . looking for a non-wired DD+ bra that still delivers on great shape . definition and support,' she says. COOL COMFORT: A special formulation finish, used in bras, nightdresses and slips, which wicks away moisture from the body to keep the wearer feeling fresh and cool. It's also used in no VPL shaping knickers. Cool comfort slips start from £19.50 . MARVELACE: Created using the very latest knitting technology, Marvelace, creates firm control. It sculpts and shapes while still feeling beautifully soft and lightweight - flattening tummies, smoothing backs and defining curves for a gorgeous, glamorous silhouette. It’s also incredibly comfortable to wear. Bodies and slips from £39.50 . PERFECT POISE: This range, designed in association with the British Chiropractic Association, encourages and improves your posture through the use of panels and cleverly hidden padding supporting your back and bust. The bra and body use specially designed back panels which fall across the centre of the shoulders to add support encouraging the wearer to keep their shoulders back making them less likely to slouch. Bras from £26.50 . Find the perfect fit . M&S lingerie expert Julia Mercer says: .","The new bra design uses 'compressed cup technology'

"By . David Kent . Chijindu Ujah was unable to strengthen his claims for a 100 metres spot at the European Championships as he could only manage 10.20 seconds for sixth place on his Diamond League debut in Paris on Saturday night. The 20-year-old tops the British rankings after running 9.96s in Hengelo last month, but is battling it out with the fit-again James Dasaolu for the third and final spot on the team for August's Europeans in Zurich. After missing out on automatic selection for the event by coming third at the British Championships last weekend - Dwain Chambers and Harry Aikines-Aryeetey booked their places by finishing first and second - Ujah had been hoping to respond to Dasaolu's 10.03s run in Lausanne on Thursday. Disappointing: Ujah only managed to finish sixth on his Diamond League debut . But, after a long delay while the man a lane inside him, Jamaica's Nickel Ashmeade, complained in vain over his disqualification for a false start, Ujah, running in lane eight, never got into the race. American Mike Rodgers took the victory in 10.00. Dasaolu may now hold the edge in the fight for the third 100m spot in Zurich, given his outing in Lausanne was his first race of the season following a hamstring injury and his young rival has struggled to back up his Hengelo performance. There was reason for British cheer at the Meeting Areva, though, as Laura Muir and Laura Weightman both ran personal bests in the 1500m. Muir set a new Scottish record and became the fifth fastest Briton ever over the distance as she clocked 4.00.07 to finish sixth in a race won by Holland's Sifan Hassan in a world-leading 3:57.00. Weightman was eighth in 4:00.17 to go sixth on the British all-time list. Tough: Ujah might have given his rivals the edge when it comes to European Championships qualifying . Hansle Parchment clocked a Jamaican record and world-leading 12.94 in winning the 110m hurdles. There were two more world leads from Kenyan athletes, with Asbel Kiprop winning the 800m in 1:43.34 and Edwin Soi the 5,000m in 12:59.82. Shara Proctor was fourth in the long jump with 6.70m and Tiffany Porter fifth in the 100m hurdles in 12.72. Niall Flannery, the European number one, could only manage seventh in the 400m hurdles in 49.73, while Eilish McColgan was 13th in the 3,000m steeplechase. Meanwhile, in Mannheim at the Bauhaus Junior Gala, there was further evidence of Britain's exciting sprint talent. Adam Gemili, who wants to focus on the 200m at the Europeans, set a new 100m personal best of 10.04, timely less than three weeks out from the Commonwealth Games, while 18-year-old Dina Asher-Smith clocked a marginally windy 11.03 in the women's 100m.

"By . Associated Press . Davonta Bynes expected 19-year-old Renisha McBride to stop by his west side Detroit home late November 1, 2013, for a small get-together. The two traded text messages and a phone call, but as the hours passed it became clear to Bynes that he wouldn't see her that night. 'I think ... she might have been drinking. She was slurring' her speech, he testified Monday during the trial of Theodore Wafer, the man charged with shooting McBride to death outside his Dearborn Heights home. Memories of a fateful night: Davonta Bynes, a friend of Renisha McBride, give his testimony ton day three of Theodore Wafer trial, the Dearborn Heights homeowner charged in the shooting death of Renisha McBride, Monday, July 28 . On trial: Theodore Wafer pauses at the end of Day three of his trial, Monday, July 28 in Detroit . Evidence: Sam Brue, a special agent with the federal bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives, gives expert testimony during day three of Theodore Wafer trial . About 1 a.m. on November 2, a drunken McBride crashed her car into a parked car in Detroit, about a half-mile from Wafer's home and less than two miles from Bynes' home. It's not known why she appeared three-and-a-half hours later at Wafer's front door, but Wafer, 55, has said he shot McBride in self-defense. Prosecutors have said there was no reason to use deadly force instead of calling police. They charged Wafer with second-degree murder. On Monday, prosecutors called a number of police experts to testify on evidence from her phone, the crash and the shooting. No calls were answered on McBride's cellphone after she crashed her car, testified Sam Brue, a special agent with the federal bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives who analyzed calls and texts to and from the phone. Horrific death: In this undated file photo is the cover of a funeral program showing 19-year-old Renisha McBride from a service in Detroit . Distraught family: Walter Ray Simmons reacts to photos of his deceased daughter during the Theodore Wafer trial before Judge Dana Hathaway at Frank Murphy Hall of Justice in Detroit on Thursday . McBride's father had been trying to reach her that night and appeared frustrated in a text message that she hadn't returned his calls, Brue said. Brue found that a call was made from McBride's phone to her father shortly before 10 p.m. on November 1. The call lasted four minutes and 44 seconds. After the crash, calls to her phone went to voicemail, Brue said. Defense attorney Cheryl Carpenter told jurors last week that Wafer was awakened by pounding at a door and believed two or more people were outside. As the pounding continued, Wafer loaded his shotgun, opened the front door and fired, hitting McBride in the face, Carpenter said. An autopsy found McBride's blood-alcohol level was about 0.22, nearly three times Michigan's legal limit for driving. Other witnesses called to the stand Monday by prosecutors included crime lab officers and a state police forensic scientist. Testimony will continue Tuesday.","Davonta Bynes gave testimony at the trial of Theodore Wafer Monday .

"A pet frog had to be taken to the vets after he swallowed an engagement ring belonging to his owner's fiancée. The amphibious pet, called Croak, snapped the ring up after his owner's girlfriend accidentally dropped it while the frog was out of his aquarium. Unable to retrieve the ring, owner Roman Livane, 27, was forced to take his pet frog to the vet who, despite initial reservations, managed to return it to its rightful owner. Croak the pet frog had to be taken to the vets after he swallowed an engagement ring belonging to his owner's fiancée . Owner Roman Livane, 27, was cleaning out the glass aquarium where the frog is kept when it snapped up the ring . Mr Livane was cleaning out the glass aquarium where he keeps the frog when the incident took place. He said: 'I have had him for almost 10 years - he's like part of the family. 'My girlfriend Kristina is the only girlfriend I have ever had that also likes frogs, so we are a perfect partnership. 'But I admit things got a bit strained when I asked her to look after him, and he was sitting on the table while she was playing with her engagement ring. 'She dropped it and it fell towards the table where my frog was sitting, and as quick as a flash it snapped the ring out of the air and swallowed it.' The couple tried to retrieve the ring, but before they had the chance the frog had already swallowed it. Veterinarian Julia Malyshev at first thought the couple were playing a practical joke, but X-rays revealed the frog had indeed swallowed the ring . Ms Malyshev said the ring was too big for the frog to pass and so she was forced to carry out a 'difficult operation' They then took it to the vets near their home in the city of Yekaterinburg. Veterinarian Julia Malyshev, 38, said: 'I must admit I was sceptical about whether or not it was some sort of a practical joke but when I X-rayed it, sure enough there was the engagement ring complete with stone in the frog's stomach. 'It was clear that it was too big to ever pass out in the natural way, and as they didn't want to kill the frog I had to use a special hook to pull the ring out which was a difficult operation. 'Although it did not involve any surgery the frog has had to go on a diet now for three days to make sure there is no lasting damage from the tricky procedure.' After being washed the ring was returned to Kristina, 26, who said they are now continuing with their plans for the wedding, which is due to take place at the start of August.","Frog taken to the vets after swallowing engagement ring of owner's fiancée .

"By . Katy Winter . A football fan who was shocked into slimming after being involved in a road accident has won a national award for losing more than 22st. At 37st, Stuart Eggleshaw regularly felt embarrassment when he couldn’t fit through turnstiles as he followed his beloved Mansfield Town around the country, but it was a minor car crash that finally forced him to face up to his size. It motivated him to lose 22st 9lbs and now he has been named Slimming World Greatest Loser 2014. Stuart Eggleshaw used to struggle even to enter the stadium of his beloved football team due to his 37st frame . The 43-year-old, from Kirkby-in-Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, says: 'Luckily the incident wasn’t serious but the paramedics had to be called. 'It was then I realised that if the accident had been more serious and I’d been injured they probably would have found me very difficult to treat. 'I started asking myself, ""would they have been able to get me out of the car?"", ""would they have been able to lift me into the ambulance?"", ""would they have needed specialist equipment?"" and lots of other questions like that. 'I realised that any or all of those things could have prevented them from getting me to hospital in time and, ultimately, from saving my life. That was really my wake-up call and I joined Slimming World soon afterwards.' Stuart, who is single, struggled with . his weight from a young age but remembers his size increasing rapidly . around eight years ago. He . says: 'I was always described as ""big-boned"", but when I hit 35 it seems . like I was always having to buy bigger and bigger clothes. Stuart dropped from 37st to 14st 5lb in 16 months to be crowned Slimming World's Greatest Loser . Breakfast: Three rashers of fried bacon, three fried sausages, two fried eggs, two slices of toast or a large cob (bread roll) Lunch: Two large cobs or bread rolls with coronation chicken, a large bag of crisps and various chocolate bars . Dinner: Two chicken tikka slices (pasty filled with chicken tikka), two or three packets of ready-made sandwiches, a share bag of crisps . Snacks: Various chocolate bars throughout the day . Breakfast: 35g cereal with berries . Mid-morning: Two bananas . Lunch: Jacket potato and baked beans with lots of fresh salad . Mid-afternoon: Tubs of prepared fresh fruit, such as mango, melon and pineapple . Dinner: Grilled chicken breast, boiled rice, carrots, green beans, broccoli and cauliflower . Snacks: A small chocolate bar, three Babybel light cheese, pickled onions . 'I tried going to the gym to lose . weight but it never seemed to shift because I wasn’t changing my eating . habits, and in the end I stopped going.' After . his accident in August 2012, Stuart’s sister and stepmother recommended . Slimming World and – with some trepidation – he joined a nearby group . in Sutton-in-Ashfield the following month. He . says: 'I was very apprehensive about walking into the group on that . first night as I knew there’d probably be lots of women and not very . many men, but everyone was friendly and I got a warm welcome. Football fan: Stuart lost 22 stone after he was too big to fit in through the turnstiles to watch Mansfield Town play . 'I can’t speak highly enough of the . whole experience and I’ve had so much support from my consultant Annette . and the rest of the group. I’m always encouraging other men to join now and one of my male colleagues has even lost 3st.' Civil servant Stuart, who works for HM Revenue & Customs, started following the club’s Food Optimising healthy eating plan. Instead of tucking into convenience foods, he began planning his meals and making time to cook from scratch. He says he has rediscovered his love of cooking: 'I was pleasantly surprised when Annette explained the plan. 'I . was amazed at the variety of foods that I could eat without having to . restrict my portions and was delighted that I could still enjoy all my . favourite meals just by making changes to the way I prepared and cooked . them. Currently my favourite meal is a Malaysian chicken curry.' As the weight came off Stuart decided to start being more active and now loves running, cycling and playing football. He says: 'Before I joined Slimming . World I would park the car as close to wherever I was going as humanly . possible because I found walking just short distances very difficult. 'Now . I cycle around 40 miles a week, run around 15 miles a week and play . five-a-side football twice a week – and I love it. I’m hoping to do a . half marathon next year and would like to enter a triathlon too. 'I’ve . got two nephews who I’m much closer to now because I can run around . with them and do more adventurous things like visit theme parks and take . them on holiday.' This January, just 16 months after joining Slimming World, Stuart hit his target weight of 14st 5lbs. He’s dropped 34in  from his waist, going from 70in to 36in, and lost 14in from his collar measurement too. Height: 6’/1.83m . Weight loss: 22st 9lbs/ 317lbs . Starting weight: 37st/ 518lbs . Current weight: 14st 5lbs/ 201lbs . Starting waist measurement: 70in /177.8cm . Current waist measurement: 36in/91.5cm . Date joined Slimming World: 12/09/2012 . Today he’s been recognised for his incredible achievement by being named Slimming World Greatest Loser 2014, an award which is given to the Slimming World member from across the UK and Ireland who loses the most weight. Stuart, who works the scoreboard at Mansfield Town’s One Call Stadium, says: 'I used to struggle to fit through the turnstiles but now I go through them with ease – and a big smile on my face. 'In fact there are so many things I can do that I couldn’t have even attempted when I was bigger – playing football with my nephews, buying clothes on the high street, flying on a plane without having to ask for a seatbelt extension and much more. 'Life is immeasurably better and I enjoy every moment. Now I’m ready for the next chapter of my life which will hopefully involve meeting someone to share all this with and starting a family.'","Dropped from 37st to 14st 5lb in 16 months and lost 34in from his waist .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . On a typical day, in the height of summer, around 30,000 flights travel through European airspace. To showcase the complex and detailed routes these flights take, and how they manage to fly across the continent without crashing into each other, NATS (formerly known as the National Air Traffic Services) has created a beautiful timelapse video. This video tracks the movement of flights over the course of 24 hours last summer and has been condensed to just two minutes. The visualisation, pictured, was created by the UK air traffic controller NATS (formerly known as the National Air Traffic Services). It used UK radar data from June last year, combined with European flight plan information from July, to showcase a day's worth of air travel in just two minutes . The data visualisation is an amalgamation of UK radar data, taken on 21 June 2013, combined with European flight plan information from 28 July last year. Paul Beauchamp, a NATS spokesman, told MailOnline: 'Airspace is an incredibly valuable asset - just as important as the rail, road and utility networks that everyone relies on everyday. However, most people aren’t aware of the work that goes into managing and safely guiding aircraft through our skies. 'That’s why we created this visualisation to highlight the complexity of that work, the skill of our air traffic controllers and the UK’s strategic importance as the aviation gateway to Europe and North America.' To create the video, viualisation experts from a company called 422 South combined 24 hours worth of flight radar data from all UK flights on one of the busiest days of last year, and blended it with flight schedules and routing information for the rest of Europe - reaching out into the North Atlantic. On 21 June 2013, 5,675 aircraft departed or arrived from UK airports, this included 847 from Gatwick and 1,041 from Heathrow. The rest travelled to and from other UK airports. A total of 1,532 were classed as overflights, which travelled over the country. This still from the video shows the level of traffic around Heathrow and Gatwick during a single morning . Computer artists then used specially . developed programmes to convert the longitude, latitude and height data . into luminous dots, which were accurately positioned over satellite . images of Britain and mainland Europe, by day and by night. Beauchamp . continued: 'European airspace is some of the busiest and most complex . anywhere in the world. Every day thousands of air traffic controllers . guide millions of passengers safely to their destinations. 'Yet . to most people, the choreography going on above them is entirely . unnoticed - it quite literally goes over their heads. Some might say . that is how it should be. But, that ignores one very important point. Getting it right matters and we all have a stake in it.' According to NATS, of the 30,000 flights that travel across European airspace on a typical July day, approximately a quarter fly within UK controlled airspace.

'A few highlights include the North Atlantic tracks that connect Europe with North America, the airways that run up the spine of the UK, the holding stacks at London's capacity stretched airports and the military manoeuvres off Anglesey in Wales,' said NATS in a blog post. NATS is the main air navigation service provider for the UK that provides air traffic control services to flights within the UK Flight Information Regions as well as the Shanwick Oceanic Control Area. It also provides traffic control to fifteen airports in the UK airports, plus Gibraltar Airport.","The visualisation was created by the UK air traffic controller NATS (formerly known as National Air Traffic Services)

"By . James Daniel . When James Garcia recently learned that his dog Elmo had just a few months left to live, he decided not to waste one minute left his his best friend. The New York man got the news earlier this month that the 16-year-old dog he co-parents with his ex was dying of liver cancer, bladder disease and renal failure. Since then, he's been toting Elmo across New York City, showing the little dog his favorite sites and restaurants in a grand farewell to his longtime companion.

Goodbye: To bid farewell to the 16-year-old dog, Mr Garcia has started taking him to all of his favorite sites in New York City including Times Square . 'The vet has given him a couple of months,' Mr Garcia told Buzzfeed. 'So I decided not to sit and cry but to make the moments together matter and decided to take him to every one of my favorite NYC spots.' Since Elmo's legs no longer work, Mr Garcia went out and bought a stroller to take the dog to eat at Shake Shack, through the Museum of Modern Art and across the Brooklyn Bridge. Elmo even got to meet his namesake Sesame Street character in Times Square and witness Manhattanhenge - a spectacular sunset through the city's buildings. Though Elmo will soon pass, he now has a mark on this city thanks to Mr Garcia who had grafitti artist Greg Siff paint a picture of his pooch. Mr Garcia says he hopes to write a book someday on how to say goodbye to a dying pet by 'sharing experiences together'. He told People magazine that his New York outings with Elmo have helped him 'cope with his fate' and 'create memories that will last a lifetime'.

"By . Sebastian Shakespeare . Prince Michael of Kent still carries out a busy schedule of engagements at the age of 72, but the Queen’s beloved cousin has been fighting a secret health battle. The grandson of George V underwent surgery for prostate cancer and has been successfully receiving treatment. Members of the Royal Family are usually reluctant to discuss their health issues, but the Prince has bravely decided to confirm details, in support of the thousands of other sufferers of the disease. Scroll down for video . Health battle: Prince Michael of Kent, pictured at this year's Royal Ascot with his wife,  underwent surgery for prostate cancer and has been successfully receiving treatment . ‘Prince Michael regards all medical issues as personal and private,’ his spokesman, Simon Astaire, tells me. ‘However, he has authorised me to tell you that this particular problem was, happily, diagnosed very early and treated successfully last year by a surgical team who have his admiration and gratitude. There will be no further comment.’ A neighbour of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at Kensington Palace, the Prince is one of the 40,000 men in Britain each year who are affected by prostate cancer, which is the most common form of the disease in males. One in eight will develop the illness, with most cases occurring after the age of 65. Recovery: The Prince, pictured arriving at Wimbledon earlier this month, was diagnosed early and treated successfully by surgeons, according to his spokesman . Family: The Prince's 78-year-old brother, the Duke of Kent, pictured with him and their wives at Westminster Abbey last year, spent a week in hospital last year after suffering what was described as a 'mild' stroke . The Queen's cousin: Prince Michael of Kent . Born July 4, 1942, Prince Michael of Kent is is a grandson of King George V and Queen Mary, and a cousin of the Queen. At the time of his birth Prince Michael was seventh in the line of succession to his uncle, King George VI. He is also the first cousin once removed of the Duke of Edinburgh, and a great-great grandson of Tsar Alexander II of Russia. The Prince speaks Russian fluently and has a strong interest in the country. When the bodies of Tsar Nicholas II and some of his family were discovered in 1979, the remains were identified by DNA, with the Prince's blood sample used, among others, for recognition. After attending Eton College, the Prince went to the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst in 1961, and commissioned into the 11th Hussars (Prince Albert's Own), beginning a 20 year career in the Armed Forces in which he served in Germany, Hong Kong, and Cyprus. The Prince, who manages his own consultancy business, occasionally represents the Queen in carrying out royal duties abroad and has also presented television documentaries on European royal families. He has never received a parliamentary annuity or an allowance from the British Privy Purse, unlike both his elder brother, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, and his sister, Princess Alexandra, who carry out official royal duties in the United Kingdom. However, he was given a grace and favour apartment at Kensington Palace upon his marriage to Marie-Christine von Reibnitz  in 1978. Under the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701, Prince . Michael forfeited his place in the succession through marriage to Marie-Christine, who is known as Princess Michael of Kent, as she was a . Roman Catholic. The couple have two children, Lord Frederick Windsor and Lady . Gabriella Windsor, and a granddaughter, Frederick's daughter Maud, who turns one next month. The majority are ‘slow growing’ and medical guidance often advises keeping it under surveillance. Many men with the cancer will suffer no harm from it, while treatment options, including surgery and radiotherapy, can have serious side effects. At the time of his birth, the Prince was seventh in the line of succession. His 78-year-old brother, the Duke of Kent, who carries out engagements on behalf of the Queen, spent a week in hospital last year after suffering what was described as a ‘mild’ stroke. Prince Michael’s 69-year-old wife, Marie-Christine, was treated for skin cancer in 1999. The Bohemia-born Princess Michael, who had a tumour removed from her foot by laser surgery, said she felt ‘rather put out’ instead of frightened when the disease was first diagnosed. ‘People tend to panic at the mention of the word cancer, but I wasn’t upset or frightened when the doctor told me,’ said the Princess, who previously had successful surgery on her face, leg and arm. Home: A neighbour of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at Kensington Palace (pictured), the Prince is one of the 40,000 men in Britain each year who are affected by prostate cancer . Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in men in the UK, although the numbers of those with the disease is on the rise. Every year in the UK more than 40,000 men are struck with prostate cancer, around one in eight . Around 250,000 are currently living with the disease, with symptoms including frequent trips to the toilet, pain during sex and reduced flow of urine. Prostate cancer does not normally cause symptoms until the cancer has grown large enough to put pressure on the urethra, and not all men diagnosed with prostate cancer have symptoms, meaning it is important to speak regularly with doctors. The chances of developing prostate cancer increase as people get older, with the majority of cases developing in men aged 50 or older. Some cases of prostate cancer can be cured if treated in the early stages, with treatments including surgically removing the prostate, radiotherapy and hormone therapy. Other cases are only diagnosed at a later stage when the cancer has spread. If the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, typically the bones, it cannot be cured and treatment is focused on prolonging life and relieving symptoms. As prostate cancer usually progresses very slowly, those with the disease can live for decades without symptoms or needing treatment.","Grandson of George V, 72, underwent surgery for prostate cancer .

"By . James Salmon . Follow @@JamesSalmon79 . Chief executive Ross McEwan used his opening address at RBS annual meeting to signal a retreat from the high street . More RBS branches will shut because some of them ‘hardly see a customer’, the bank’s chief executive warned yesterday. Ross McEwan and chairman Sir Philip Hampton both used their opening addresses at the bank’s annual meeting yesterday to signal a retreat from the high street. Mr McEwan said: ‘The truth is some branches hardly see a customer, which is why we are taking tough decisions about closing some, and sometimes making staff redundant – although that is always a last resort.’ RBS, which includes NatWest, has 1,900 UK branches – 310 of which will be spun off in 2016 to form part of the resurrected Williams & Glyn brand. It has already earmarked 100 branches for . closure so far this year, including in rural communities such as East . Linton in Scotland and Kirkbymoorside, a small market town in North . Yorkshire. The bank would not say how many more outlets it plans to axe beyond this year’s 100 but Sir Philip said there was ‘no floor’. RBS is desperate to cut costs after slumping to a £8.2 billion last year. But its latest warning about branches was greeted with dismay by campaigners last night. Derek French, spokesman for the Campaign for Community Banking Services, said: ‘The bank has absolutely no excuse for doing this to communities most of whom do not fall in the one customer a day category.’ RBS is increasingly serving customers in more remote communities with its fleet of mobile vans, which provide basic banking services. Sir Philip stressed there would still be 'a major role for branches’ and said RBS still has more branches than Asda and Sainsbury’s , which have just over 1500 stores between them. RBS said more of its customers are doing their banking electronically, via internet banking or mobile ‘apps’ on smartphones. Online and mobile transactions have grown by 232pc since 2011, while branch transactions have declined by around 30pc. A succession of banks, including Barclays, HSBC and Santander have also warned they will shrink their branch network on the same basis. RBS bosses were more tight lipped . yesterday about the implications of Scottish independence and insisted . they would not take sides over September’s referendum. Mr McEwan said some branches hardly see a customer, which had led to some . 'tough decisions' about closing some branches and making staff redundant . Sir Philip Hampton stressed ‘we are not taking one side or the other’ and we will continue to maintain that neutral position.’ But he warned  a ‘yes’ vote  creates a  ‘great deal of uncertainty’ over areas such as ‘our credit rating, tax and regulation.’ The issue is particularly sensitive for RBS whose headquarters have been in Edinburgh since it was founded in 1727.  The bank also has 12,000 staff and 290 branches in Scotland. Shareholders -  including the Government-backed UK Financial Investments which owns an 81 stake in RBS – yesterday approved lavish bonuses for last year. Controversial six and seven figure fixed allowances designed to dodge the EU bonus cap were also approved. Despite making a loss £8.2billion loss last year,  RBS paid out £576million in bonuses and handed staff people received packages worth more than £1million. The huge loss last year was driven by a spiralling bill for mis-selling and is the biggest since it notched up the worst loss in UK corporate history of £24billion in 2008.

"By . Nasser Hussain . When Alastair Cook made his comments about Shane Warne’s criticisms of him, he spoke from the heart. It may not have been the wisest thing to do: you can never beat the media. And for the first time in his reign, even more so than in Australia, he looks and sounds like a man who’s feeling the heat. But he spoke from the heart. Captains are under so much scrutiny from so many critics that it’s tempting to shout: ‘Look, I’m trying my hardest!’ But it’s still not advisable to respond to Warne in that way. Salute: Nasser Hussain gestures towards the media centre after his ton against India at Lord's in 2002 . No 3: Hussain points to the number on his back . I’m not saying any captain can get it right all the time. I remember giving a three-fingered salute to Ian Botham, Bob Willis and Jonathan Agnew in the Lord’s media centre after I made a one-day hundred batting at No 3 against India. I had no personal animosity towards any of them, but I had used what they said to fire me up. And my reaction obviously told everyone I was pretty fired up. These things happen. We’re all human. Some people will have listened to Warne over the last couple of years and wondered whether he’s gone too far in his criticism of Cook. But I can assure you that Warne has no issues with Cook the man — just with Cook the captain. He’s paid to give his views. It’s true Warne can be repetitive. But he has a fantastic cricket brain and Cook should try to ignore the repetitiveness and focus on the content. It’s always worth bearing in mind how your  reaction to criticism is going to be greeted. When Cook wakes up this morning, the headlines will be all about him and Warne. But his main battle has to be with Sri Lanka’s bowlers. It has to be about finding a way to deal with the pitched-up delivery that attacks all round the world now know is the way to get him. Anything else is just going to cloud his mind. Feud: Alastair Cook said that he believes some of Shane Warne's attacks on his captaincy are personal . Outspoken: Warne has been critical of Cook on Sky Sports, and called his 294 against India in 2011 'boring' Conservative: England delayed their declaration at Lord's and Sri Lanka survived at nine wickets down . It’s not good taking on the media. You’ll never win. Scoring runs and winning Test matches is the only currency that matters right now. Besides, I actually thought there were signs of progress in the way he led England at Lord’s. Alastair and I spoke very briefly on the field during his benefit game at Chelmsford recently, but it lasted a few minutes and wasn’t about leadership. My phone is always on. Yes, captaincy can be a lonely job. But he’ll find it becomes easier if he focuses on the things that matter: adding to his tally of over 8,000 Test runs and 25 hundreds and helping England rediscover winning ways.","Alastair Cook hits back at criticism from Shane Warne .

"By . Lawrence Booth . Follow @@the_topspin . The events of January 5, when England subsided in the equivalent of a session at the SCG, feel like another world now. And yet, when the first Test against Sri Lanka starts on Thursday, it will not take much to return to that indecently hasty afternoon. At Lord’s on Monday evening, where England’s players and administrators and backroom staff had gathered for their annual pre-Tests shindig, it felt like the first day of term, as nerves jostled for supremacy with natively cautious optimism. Such dinners are always the perfect occasion for sportsmen: nothing has gone wrong yet (save a limited-overs series defeat or two by Sri Lanka), and the positive thinking of the athlete’s mental make-up can be politely asserted without too much fear of contradiction. Humiliated: England's players react after their 5-0 whitewash by Australia is confirmed in Sydney . Gearing up: Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews trains at Lord's on Tuesday . When I raised the subject of Kevin Pietersen’s first column in that morning’s Daily Telegraph with a senior member of the England outfit, it was pointed out to me that we had not even finished our starter. Throw in the idea that England are now entering a new era (despite the fact that there are set to be as many debutants at Lord’s as there were at Sydney), and the only reasonable script is this: Sri Lanka will not prove too indigestible before the five-course banquet against India. If only it were that simple. Sri Lanka, as their victories in the one-off Twenty20 match and the five-game one-day series demonstrated, are a serious team. Their bowling attack looks less of a threat at Test level, but their batting is only ever a 250-run stand between Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene away from taking the initiative in a two-Test series. Lord’s tends to be pretty flat these days, especially when the sun is out – and Sri Lanka are thrilled not to be here in chilly May. While the Sri Lankans have been warming up with a four-day game at Northampton, several of the England players will arrive at Lord’s without any serious cricket under their belts since June 3. And, on their last three visits to St John’s Wood, Sri Lanka have amassed totals of 555 for 8 (in 2002), 537 for 9 (2006) and 479 (2011). Sangakkara would love to join Tillekeratne Dilshan and Jayawardene (as well as coach Marvan Atapattu) on the honours board. Just as there is business as yet unstarted for England, so there is unfinished business for Sri Lanka. One former England player in the Long . Room last night was bullish about his old team’s prospects. ‘We’ll just . bounce ’em out,’ he said, blithely taking refuge in an old stereotype. A . current member of the team confided that the Mankading of Jos Buttler . by Sachithra Senanayake had leant the Test series ‘a real edge’ – though . he was less decisive when it came to explaining how many warnings a . bowler needs to give the non-striker before whipping off the bails. Mankad: Buttler (right) is given out after Senanayake's controversial appeal . But none of this could obscure the real question – namely, the extent to which Alastair Cook and Peter Moores have it in them to lead England back to the promised land. It feels impolite to question this pair before they have really started, but it is reasonable to point out that both men have a point to prove. Cook will be watched closely for evidence of tactical acumen – for while there is little chance of him being exposed on that score later in the summer by the frighteningly conservative MS Dhoni, there is every chance he will be out-manoeuvred by the Sri Lankans. Moores, too, must back up his claims that he has learned from the errors he made first time round. He must prove, above all, that he is more than a well-intentioned Mr Motivator. At this stage, he deserves the benefit of the doubt. England have lost only two Tests out of 13 at home to Sri Lanka, and one of those was on a dustbowl at The Oval in 1998 that felt more like Kandy than Kennington; Muttiah Muralitharan duly put in the performance of his life to take 16 wickets. Equally, England have never lost the appetite-whetter ever since the Test summer was divided in 2000. Moment in time: Murali gets mobbed on his way to picking up 16 wickets at the Oval in 1998 . For more cricket-related snippets, feel free to go to twitter.com/the_topspin . But the one-dayers precede the Tests now, which means tourists are less likely to be caught cold – literally or metaphorically. And Sri Lanka are experts at exploiting a sense of persecution (the querying of Senanayake’s action has done the job this time) for their own advantage. Forget Mankad. This series was looks tasty enough already. THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS . Kevin Pietersen thinks he knows why England didn’t give the coaching job to Ashley Giles. It had nothing, apparently, to do with the World Twenty20 defeat by the Netherlands – before which, it was generally agreed, Giles stood a decent chance of replacing Andy Flower on a permanent basis. No, Kevin Pietersen’s interpretation centres around… Kevin Pietersen! ‘Sadly I think he was just too close to me for the England and Wales Cricket Board’s liking,’ he wrote in the Telegraph. ‘That is the problem. He had spoken too positively about me in Australia for the ECB to give him the job. It is a shame for both sides.’ It’s a wonder, then, that the ECB even bothered to allow Giles his dress rehearsals in the West Indies and Bangladesh before turning him down. Both took place after Australia, which is when Pietersen imagines Giles sealed his own fate. Old acquaintances: Pietersen and Giles (right) first played together for England in 2004 . Lord’s last night offered the chance to watch a brief video summing up England’s year. There was plenty to see of the 3-0 win over Australia, as well as the women’s team back-to-back Ashes wins – fine achievements one and all. But the treatment of the 5-0 whitewash would have done Stalin proud. All we saw was footage of Stuart Broad’s five-for in the first innings of the series at Brisbane, and a pull shot by Ben Stokes during his century at Perth. Of Mitchell Johnson there was not a peep. Tormentor-in-chief: But Johnson's  performances have been scrubbed from England's record books . BCCI secretary Sanjay Patel almost seemed to speak with pride when he told the Sports Journalists’ Federation of India last week that his board threatened to form ‘a second ICC of its own’ if their demands for a greater slice of the pie were not meant. It’s good to have it confirmed that the BCCI continues to take its position as the leaders of the world game seriously. According to the ICC’s cricket committee, ‘there are a number of bowlers currently employing suspect actions in international cricket, and the ICC’s reporting and testing procedures are not adequately scrutinising these bowlers’. Until now, the response of some bowlers . to the accusation that their action simply looks wrong has been to say . that they have been tested and passed by the ICC. That logic may no . longer cut the mustard.","England take on Sri Lanka in two-Test series starting this Thursday .

"By . John Drayton . Lionel Messi had no right to win FIFA's Golden Ball and was only handed the award because of a 'marketing plan' according to Diego Maradona. Argentina's talisman was voted the World Cup's most impressive individual, despite failing to score in any of their knockout games and cut a peripheral figure in the final. The decision has caused uproar across the globe, with conspiracy theories as to why Messi won rife immediately after the announcement. Scant consolation: Messi stood a winner in a losing team alongside Golden Gloves winner Manuel Neuer . Didn't deserve it! Diego Maradona says Messi's award was a marketing plan instead of a genuine prize . And Maradona is no different. ‘I would give him heaven if possible,’ he said during his show on Telesur. ‘But it's not right when someone wins something that he shouldn't have won just because of some marketing plan.’ Argentina's wait for the biggest prize in football will now extend until at least a 32nd year after Mario Gotze's extra time winner broke South American hearts. ‘I feel sorry for my country,' Maradona added. 'Mario Gotze's goal really hurt. There's a huge sadness in my heart that we lost the final,’ he said. ‘All things put together, I think Argentina deserved at least penalties.

"By . SIMON JONES . Victor Wanyama wants to follow Mauricio Pochettino from Southampton to Tottenham. The Kenyan midfielder made it clear his week that he felt Saints should have done more to keep the Argentinian boss. Wanyama has benefited under Pochettino's coaching where he has been used as a defensive screen in midfield and has notably reduced the number of goals Southampton concede when in the side. Earning his Spurs? Victor Wanyama (left) may follow his former boss Mauricio Pochettino to Tottenham . And could use Suso as part of deal with Sevilla . He joined for £12million last summer and has struggled to settle though Pochettino has become a key figure in his career. Tottenham have question marks over the future of Chelsea target Paulinho, Sandro and Etienne Capoue who are both being considered by Napoli . Wanyama said: 'I learnt a lot from him, he taught me more and that's why I have grown as a player and there is a big difference compared to when I was at Celtic. Talking to Capital Sport, he added: 'He played a big role in my career development. 'I wanted him to remain because he had the passion for the club and I think the owners should not have let him go because the team can do better next season. It's a big blow because he had good connection with the players.' Gone: Mauricio Pochettino left Southampton to take charge at St Mary's this week . Southampton already have offers for Luke . Shaw and Adam Lallana while Jay Rodriguez, Dejan Lovren, Morgan . Schneiderlin, Calum Chambers and Rickie Lambert are all attracting . attention from other clubs too. Southampton's board cannot afford to let . all of them go despite the temptation and that could affect Wanyama's . hopes. The 22-year-old had also been the subject of interest from Manchester City earlier in the season but they have been looking at other targets and a move to White Hart Lane would be his ideal. Southampton chairman Ralph Krueger said: 'We are in control of all the player transfers. All the top players are under long term contracts. Any transfers that take place will be under our terms. We will decide the terms to potential transfers in and out of the club. 'We will involve the manager. That is important for everybody to know. That's why we have been able to not agree to any transfers to date, because we have control of the situation, and anybody who is saying anything else doesn't understand that we are in a strong position with the Saints.' Erik Lamela will not be allowed to leave Tottenham on loan but the club are willing to sell for around £25million. That's the information being . circulated around Italian clubs at the moment and was reported on Sky . Italia on Thursday. Lamela's fortunes may change though under the tutelage of . Mauricio Pochettino, who knows the player well. Spurs misfit . Roberto Soldado remains keen to go with Atletico Madrid very much in the . frame. They have an interest in Romelu Lukaku but the Chelsea striker . is understood to be reluctant to go to Spain. Franco Baldini's role at Tottenham remains under question. Ending their White Hart pain: Erik Lamela can leave Spurs for £25m, while Atletico want Roberto Soldado . Manchester City have taken encouragement in developments with Mehdi Benatia at Roma. Sportsmail reported City's interest in Benatia earlier this month as an alternative to Eiaquim Mangala of Porto who has declared a desire to join Chelsea. Benatia, 27, is facing a fine from his club after an outburst in the Italian papers regarding the club's contract offer. The France-born Morocco defender said: 'I never said I want to leave. But Roma have not kept their promises. They had told me that they would make me a new contract offer if I had a great season. 'My agent is doing his job, I could go away but I could also stay and finish my career in Roma. But I was disappointed (with the new wage offer), I deserved more respect. 'I have received an unacceptable proposal, less than €3million per season. I replied that I would not sign it. Developments: Manchester City target Mehdi Benatia is unhappy with Roma's contract offer . 'I'm in love with Roma, I'm very fine here but my mistake was to be too correct with the club and too honest.' Regarding speculation about him leaving, he added: 'I only said that anyone dreams of teams like Real, Bayern and City. 'My agent is doing his job, I could leave but I could also stay and finish my career in Roma. But I was disappointed (with the new wage offer), I deserved more respect.' City remain interested in Malaga goalkeeper Willy Caballero also as competition for Joe Hart with Costel Pantilimon ready to look at a new club with Arsenal among those to have shown interest - although they have a few names on their list. City are also understood to be exploring the possibility of . signing David Villa for their New York City franchise. Villa, 32, has . just won the Spanish league title and is looking at his next challenge. City's franchise will be ready next year and they are recruiting big . names now. Carles Puyol and Xavi have also been mooted with . both players keen on the MLS project. Sportsmail revealed that David . Beckham was keen to get Xavi involved in his Miami franchise but that . may be too far ahead for the 34-year-old. Xavi is due to hold . talks over his future with new coach Luis Enrique prior to making his . decision.

Saville had a . successful loan spell at Brentford last season and Uwe Rosler has kept . him mind ahead of his plans for the Championship next season. The German is keen to stay at the DW Stadium and build for promotion again after going so close this year. Saville . is also attracting interest from Wolves and Chelsea would be looking . for around £750,000 with the price eventually rising to £1million. Road to Wigan: Chelsea's George Saville, here on loan at Brentford, is wanted by Uwe Rosler at the DW . Former Liverpool and Oldham . goalkeeper Dean Bouzanis will return to Australia after signing a . two-year A-League deal with the Western Sydney Wanderers. The 23-year-old has spent the past seven years playing in Europe and joins the fledgling club from Carlisle. Bouzanis . moved abroad in 2007 to link up with Liverpool and will join up with . former Crystal Palace defender-turned-coach Tony Popovic. He said: 'I've seen how good a coach Popa is with the results that he's got, and it all just went from there.' Going Down Under: Goalkeeper Dean Bouzanis, here playing for Oldham, is heading back to Australia . Premier League and Championship clubs are keeping a check on St Patrick's Athletic winger Christopher Forrester. Scouts are expected at Friday night's game in Dublin with Derry City and the 21-year-old is understood to be the main attraction. Everton and Sunderland have a long-held interest but West Ham and Leeds have also checked on his progress. He has chipped in with some spectacular goals notably a 35-yard lob against Drogheda last month and St Patrick's rate him at around £200,000.","Wanyama wants to follow his ex-Southampton boss Pochettino to Spurs .

"By . John Preston . Nathan Penlington  is an obsessive. What he likes doing more than anything else is collecting things — things that you or I might not necessarily think are worth collecting. One of his most treasured collections consists of Uri Geller merchandise. So impressed was the teenage Penlington with Geller’s spoon-bending prowess that he hunted down every product that Geller has ever endorsed — from a limited-edition range of porcelain plates, to a collection of psychically energised teddy bears. Obsessive: Nathan Penlington made it his mission to find the boy in the book . When he sees that 506 different Choose Your Own Adventure books are being  auctioned on eBay, Penlington does  not hesitate. As far as he’s concerned, Choose Your Own Adventure, a series of books produced in the Eighties in which  the reader has the power to determine the plot, are every bit as collectible as Uri Geller teddies. He puts in what turns out to be a winning bid of £41.01, and a few days later a large parcel arrives at his home. At this point something strange happens. Inside one of the books, Penlington finds several sheets of paper. They are a diary, or a section of diary, written 20 years earlier by the original owner, a 15-year-old boy called Terence Prendergast. What strikes Penlington most of all is  how sad the entries are. The boy who had written them plainly had no friends and no self-confidence. Bullied at school, he had sought refuge in the fantasy of becoming a hero. The most disturbing entry reads simply: ‘Left school with intention to kill myself.’ Penlington becomes determined to track down Terence Prendergast and find out what had happened to him. His girlfriend warns him that this is not necessarily a good idea — after all, Prendergast may no longer be alive — but he’s having none of it. He has found a new obsession. Mind-reading teddy? One of Nathan's obsessions was collecting Uri Geller's psychically energised teddy bears (stock photo) His early efforts are not promising. Although Penlington finds plenty of Terence Prendergasts, none of them is the author of the diary — although one does turn out to be the Archbishop of Ottawa. But the more he digs, the more he comes to realise that he is also exploring his own past. He, too, was a lonely, self-conscious adolescent and his quest becomes in part a quest for the boy that he used to be. By dint of some dogged detective work, Penlington finally runs Prendergast to ground, alive and well and living with his parents in a suburb of Birmingham. ‘The door is pulled open by a boyish-looking man, wearing a tee-shirt and jeans . . . This is him. This is the boy in the book.’ While the two men chat away and end up forging a kind of friendship, Prendergast himself proves to be a bit of a letdown. Far from being mired in gloom, he seems disappointingly well-adjusted. While he was clearly an unhappy  adolescent, his suicidal urges were never that strong, he insists — although he  did once put a loaded air pistol in his mouth and pull the trigger. ‘The pellet must have hit my tongue or something, because it bounced straight out and landed in the bath.’ And that, you might think, would be  the end of it. After all, Penlington has found Prendergast — where else is there for him to go? Quite a lot of places, it turns out. He goes to see an expert on diaries, a child psychologist and even a graphologist to get Prendergast’s handwriting analysed. Real-live theatre: Nathan's experiences provide material for his comedy routines . By now a little worm of suspicion had begun to flex itself in my mind — the suspicion that what was driving Penlington wasn’t just an obsession, but something else. He is, after all, a stand-up comic who has performed with Ricky Gervais among others, and he clearly thinks there’s some professional mileage to be got out of his quest. Indeed, as he reveals at the end, he’s turned the whole thing into a ‘live, interactive, real-life theatre show called Choose Your Own Documentary’. Nothing wrong with that, of course, except it does make you feel that Penlington might be a bit more hard-nosed, maybe even a bit more ruthless, than he likes to make out. You get a sense of this in the chapter where he goes back to his childhood home in Rhyl, North Wales and looks up a girl called Nancy who he had a crush on when he was a teenager. They go to a park where Penlington has arranged for a guitarist friend of his to play Love Is All Around. And then he shoots off back to his girlfriend in London, presumably leaving a shell-shocked Nancy to resume her life as a lonely divorcee. One of the problems with being an obsessive collector is that you can’t stop accumulating stuff. It’s the same with this book. Somewhere in here is a fascinating and touching story, but it’s been all but buried beneath a mountain of clutter.","Obsessive stand-up comic Nathan Penlington's collections include Uri Geller psychically energised teddy bears .

"By . John Preston . Back in March 1898, a group of scientists set sail from London for the Torres Straits between Australia and New Guinea. They were going to study islanders in the hope that they would learn important lessons about the way the brain works. With them they took various colour photos and some ‘footer shirts’, which they were confident would prove irresistible to natives. Over the next 14 months, they conducted a series of tests — one scientist would measure people’s sight, another hearing, another skin sensitivity and so on. When they came back, they presented their findings to the British Association For The Advancement Of Science. Pioneer: Jonathan Pryce as Dr William Rivers in the film Regeneration, based on his work . It was a total disaster. Far from showing any big differences between the way in which a Bornean tribesman perceived the world and, say, a Cambridge academic did, their tests revealed almost no variations at all. Only one conclusion could be drawn, the Association believed: the tests had been hopelessly botched. The scientists’ efforts were pooh-poohed, their reputations were blackened and that was apparently that. But over the next few years, doubts began to creep in. Maybe the fact that there were no key differences between people’s senses wasn’t actually a blunder, but a discovery of huge significance. Far from there being — as was generally accepted — a human evolutionary ladder in which the British stood at the top with everyone else on the lower rungs, maybe we were all essentially the same. And this is just the arm.... As part of their experiment the scientists would stick needle's into parts of Henry Head's body - including his penis (posed by model) With their reputations restored, the scientists set out once again, trying to find out how the human brain developed in the way that it did. Originally, smell was by far the dominant sense, but as mammals began to live in trees, sight, sound and taste surged to the fore. The tricky part, as far as the scientists were concerned, was trying to measure things that seemed to defy analysis — like pain or the way people react to stress. One of the members of the original expedition, a psychologist called William Rivers, conducted a series of experiments with a fledgling neurologist called Henry Head. The two men would sit in Head’s rooms in Cambridge, with Rivers pulling out Head’s hairs and sticking needles into various parts of his body — including his penis — and recording the results. Not surprisingly, Head found that he could work for only an hour at a time before he started to feel a bit queasy. In between sessions, the two men would engage in bursts of vigorous exercise such as running or horseriding. The results were encouraging, but what they really wanted was a kind of mass experiment in which large numbers of people could be subjected to the same trauma to see how they reacted. They didn’t have to wait long. In August 1914, World War I was declared. Within months, Rivers, Head and their fellow scientists were confronted with what amounted to the biggest laboratory on Earth. What interested them most of all were the effects of prolonged exposure to gunfire. Although it was another of the original expedition members, Charles Myers, who coined the phrase ‘shell shock’, it was Rivers’s work at Craiglockhart Hospital near Edinburgh (where poets Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen were among his patients) that proved the most significant. At first, Army doctors would label traumatised soldiers ‘Mental’, ‘Insane’ or even ‘GOK’ (‘God Only Knows’). But as the war went on and it became obvious that soldiers were not faking their symptoms, attitudes started to change and treatments to improve. Shell shocked: The scientists were particularity interested in studying the effects of prolonged exposure to gunfire on soldiers . Yet the psychologists were still feeling their way in the dark. William McDougall, who had also been on the original expedition, treated a soldier called Percy Meek, who had been a basket-weaver in Norfolk before the war. As well as having severe shell shock, Meek was suffering from amnesia. Under hypnosis, he revealed that he was visited every night by the ghost of a German soldier whom he had killed on the Marne in 1914. After a while Meek stopped seeing the ghost, but his condition became even worse — his twitching grew more pronounced, he lost the power of speech and spent all day playing with dolls. There is astonishing archive film of him cowering in a wheelchair with a teddy bear on his kneeMcDougall was inclined to write him off as a helpless case, but then, in 1917, something extraordinary happened: Meek made a spontaneous recovery. His memory and his speech came back, and within another year he was teaching basket-weaving to fellow patients — proof perhaps that the brain is even more mysterious than McDougall and his colleagues had ever anticipated. A war of nerves: Shell shocked soldiers receiving treatment in hospital . As he proved with the critically acclaimed A War Of Nerves: Soldiers And Psychiatrists 1914-1994, Shephard writes exceptionally well about how the mind functions under duress. His account of how a small group of scientists defied ridicule in their quest to learn how the brain works is as stirring as it is dramatic. While Shephard clearly possesses a sharp eye for absurdity, there’s a broad streak of sympathy throughout. In the early Thirties, the Prince of Wales visited the newly founded National Institute For Industrial Psychology in London. By accident, he was taken in through the wrong door and ended up in the office block next door, chatting with bemused office workers under the impression they were psychologists, before someone put him right. It’s tempting to see this story as an illustration of how psychology developed in this country — there may have been a lot of wrong turns, but eventually its pioneers steered a path through a fog of confusion to reach a greater understanding of who we are and how we got to be that way.","A group of pioneering scientists studying the senses decided to examine the effects of stress .

"By . David Mccormack . and Associated  Press Reporter . Authorities say a man found dead outside his dilapidated rural New York state home was a recluse who died leaving $3 million in the bank. Ramapo police identified the 79-year-old on Tuesday as George Konnight. They say he lived alone since his sister's recent death. Despite living ‘off the grid’ in the house in White Plains that appeared abandoned, Konnight had $3 million from the sale last fall of about 31 acres of his family's property in northern Ramapo. George Konnight, 79, was found dead outside the dilapidated rural New York state home where the recluse had lived alone since his sister's recent death . His skeletal remains were found on Friday in the woods on his property, reports The Journal News. Konnigh would cut his own fire wood for heat. Ramapo Detective Lt. Mark Emma said he lived a very simple ‘hermit-like’ life in a house without indoor plumbing or heat. The medical examiner's office will determine the cause of death. Police believe he died of a medical condition. A distant cousin said even as kids, they ‘didn't have many friends or even a telephone.’ Konnight's skeletal remains were found on Friday in the woods on his remote property in White Plains, New York . A neighbor told the paper that the two lived like recluses and never had real jobs. They had no expenses other than taxes, and would sell land passed down in the family to pay them. 'Nobody knew them. They lived by themselves. I'd say hello to George and maybe got a wave. You never got much in return as far as answers from him,' said Eugene Erickson, a neighbor. It may take months for the medical examiner to confirm that the remains are Konnight. He never visited a dentist, making it difficult for officials to identify the remains based on dental records. Konnight's lawyer Thomas O'Connell had known his client for about 15 years ago and said he had been making strides in living a normal life after the death of his 'domineering' sister. He had recently visited a doctor for the first time in decades and had talked about moving into a new home. The money will now be donated to charity.

Former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis will forever have a presence at Grand Central Terminal in New York City following the opening of an entrance named in her honor on Monday. The entrance at Park Avenue and East 42nd Street is a tribute to Kennedy’s important role in fighting to save the station in the 1970s when plans were at an advanced stage to build a 53-story tower built atop the iconic structure. The newly renovated entrance has being named the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Foyer and features a large plaque bronze relief of Onassis and a description of her role in saving the terminal. Jackie Onassis, pictured in 1977, stands beside a huge photo of Grand Central Station during a news conference by the Committee To Save Grand Central, to plead that the terminal be spared demolition . People walk past a plaque of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis after a ceremony on Monday to dedicate Grand Central Terminal's renovated main entry vestibule in memory of the former first lady . Her efforts led to the U.S. Supreme Court upholding the city's Landmark Law in 1978 and saving the station from having its facade and Man Waiting Room destroyed. The Beaux-Arts train terminal first opened in 1913 and by 1947, over 65 million people - the equivalent of 40 percent of the population of the United States - were traveling through it each year. Soon after the railroads fell into a major decline with competition from government subsidized highways and intercity airline traffic. In 1954, a plan was floated - then quickly abandoned - to replace the station with an 80-story structure taller than the Empire State Building. Kennedy's efforts led to the U.S. Supreme Court upholding the city's Landmark Law in 1978 and saving the station from having its facade and Man Waiting Room destroyed . 'Is it not cruel to let our city die by . degrees, stripped of all her proud monuments, until there will be . nothing left of all her history and beauty to inspire our children?'- Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, 1975 . The New York Central Railroad continued to dramatically decline and in 1968, plans were unveiled for a Marcel Breuer-designed tower to be built over Grand Central. The terminal had originally been designed to support a tower above it and Breuer’s design would have utilized the existing tower support structure but wouldn’t have preserved the facade or the Main Waiting Room. The plans drew huge opposition, particularly as the orate Pennsylvania Station had been demolished in 1964 despite pleas to preserve it. One of the most prominent supporters of the campaign to save Grand Central was Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Her efforts included a handwritten letter in 1975 urging then Mayor Abe Beame not to give up in a court battle to defeat the development plan.

If they are not inspired by the past of our city, where will they find the strength to fight for her future?,’ she wrote. ‘Americans care about their past, but for short term gain they ignore it and tear down everything that matters. Maybe… this is the time to take a stand, to reverse the tide, so that we won't all end up in a uniform world of steel and glass boxes.’ Beame announced that the city would fight to save Grand Central and six months prior to the unveiling of the . Breuer plans, the New York City Landmarks Preservation . Commission designated the station a 'landmark.' In 1978, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the city Landmarks Law, which had been challenged by developers. Former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis will forever have a presence at Grand Central Terminal in New York City following the opening of an entrance named in her honor on Monday . In 2011, travel magazine Travel + Leisure rated Grand Central the sixth-most-visited tourist attraction for its roughly 21.6 million annual visitors . The landmark case was the first time that the Supreme Court ruled on a matter of historic preservation. 'Mrs. Onassis is one of America's most cherished historical figures and she is considered by many a renowned savior of Grand Central,' Metro-North Railroad President Joseph Giulietti said.

"By . David Mccormack . and Associated  Press Reporter . Chris Christie’s recent weight loss was on display for all to see when he played in a celebrity softball game at Yankee Stadium on Monday. The New Jersey Gov. remains a relatively roly poly figure, but has undoubtedly lost a substantial amount of weight since secretly undergoing Lap-Band surgery in February of last year. The governor's Team Boomer, headed by WFAN radio co-hosts ‘Boomer’ Esiason and Craig Carton, eked out a 7-6 win against players from the Wounded Warrior Amputee Softball Team and New York Yankees alumni at the fourth annual Bombers Boomer Broadway Softball Classic. Scroll down for video . In the running: Chris Christie's recent weight loss was on display for all to see when he played in a celebrity softball game at Yankee Stadium on Monday . Christie, who was a star catcher in high school and continues to be a baseball fan, appeared enthusiastic throughout the game, particularly when playing third base in the mostly empty ballpark. After several fumbles early on, Christie wound up making a crucial catch to end the 7th inning, helping his team to victory. ‘We had the game on the line. Ground ball to third, man on first and second. He bobbled it a little bit but made the play and got the out,’ said Carton, a longtime friend of the governor, who assured reporters Christie had ‘held his own.’ As he warmed up before the game, Christie, who was inducted last year into the Little League Hall of Excellence, said he was happy to have a break from Trenton and that he hoped he wouldn't get injured on the field. Political big hitter: Experts estimate the presumed 2016 presidential candidate has lost more than 85 pounds since undergoing weight loss surgery last year . Afterward, he seemed pleased with his performance. ‘We won, so it went just fine,’ said Christie, who wore No. 55 because he is the state's 55th governor. Esiason gave Christie an A-plus for efforts, but he joked the governor's execution ‘probably should be a little bit better. But at the end of the day, he's here for the right reason, and that's all I care about,’ he said. He also heaped praise on the governor for participating in the game, which he estimated had raised between $30,000 and $40,000 for cystic fibrosis research. ‘Not many politicians would go out there on third base and put himself in the line of fire like that,’ Esiason said. The New Jersey Gov. remains a relatively roly poly figure, but wound up making a crucial catch to end the 7th inning, helping his team to victory . Christie, 51, acknowledged that he has lost weight at a town hall event late last month. He told a constituent he was 'much smaller now than he used to be', but didn't give a clear indication of how much weight he had lost. Fitness experts quizzed by . Politico speculated that the presumed 2016 Republican presidential candidate could have lost as much as 85 pounds and that his weight had dropped to roughly 236 pounds. Christie had the Lap-Band surgery in February 2013, and managed to keep it out of the press for nearly two months. He said he had the surgery to restrict his food intake because he wanted to get healthy for his family's sake. The governor's Team Boomer, headed by WFAN radio co-hosts ¿Boomer¿ Esiason and Craig Carton, eked out a 7-6 win against players from the Wounded Warrior Amputee Softball Team and New York Yankees alumni at the fourth annual Bombers Boomer Broadway Softball Classic . 'It has nothing to do the performance of my job,' he told People magazine afterward. He denied that his potential presidential plans had something to do with the decision. 'My decisions about anything to do with my career are based upon what I think is best for me and best for my family,' he said when his surgery finally became public. 'Whatever size I happen to be when I have to make a decision about what to do next in my career, I doubt that'll play any role or effect in what I decide to do.' Regardless of the motivation for his surgery, Christie's frame has noticeably shrunk throughout the last year and a half - something a constituent pointed out last month at one of the Governor's town halls. This photo of Christie, left, with President Barack Obama, right, was taken on September 4, 2011 at Newark Liberty Airport after the president's visit to Paterson and the surrounding areas to look at the aftermath of Hurricane Irene . 'By the way, you do look fantastic,' a female constituent told him. 'God bless you,' Christie told her. The Republican Governor noted that he's lost so much weight, his wife thinks he should buy new suits. 'But I’m on a budget. I gotta be careful, you know?' Christie told the woman.","Chris Christie's recent weight loss was .

"By . David Mccormack . and Associated  Press Reporter . Fried chicken chain KFC has said it intends to honor its commitment to donate $30,000 towards Victoria Wilcher’s medical bills despite no evidence that it's employees did anything wrong. Two different investigations have failed to find any evidence that an employee asked the 3-year-old girl and her grandmother to leave because injuries she suffered in a pit bull mauling disturbed customers. KFC spokesman Rick Maynard said on Tuesday the company considered the matter closed after an internal investigation by the franchise restaurant in Jackson, Mississippi, and an independent probe. Scroll down for video . Hoax victim? A source involved in the . investigation said all the evidence in the case points towards . the matter being a hoax and that Victoria Wilcher, three, wasn't asked . to leave a KFC in Mississippi . ‘Like the rest of America, the KFC family has been moved by the story of Victoria's injuries and recovery,’ Maynard said. ‘We hope everyone keeps Victoria in their thoughts and prayers. She will certainly be in ours.’ Allegations that Victoria was asked to leave the restaurant were made earlier this month on the Facebook site Victoria's Victories, which has followed her recovery from the April attack. According to a statement issued on Tuesday by the family’s attorney Bill Kellum, Victoria's grandmother, Kelly Mullins, stands by her claim of what happened at the restaurant. 'Victoria's family appreciates the actions of KFC in their investigation of this matter. They look forward to assisting KFC in what we hope will be an ongoing investigation,' he said. Victoria's grandmother, Kelly Mullins, left, continues to stand by her story, despite an independent inquiry finding no evidence to back up her claims . 'It is deeply disappointing that other parties have taken opportunity to attack Victoria through social and news media outlets. Victoria is an innocent child with very real physical and emotional scars. 'The focus of her family has always been, and will always be on Victoria and making her whole again,' Kellum said. He said the child's family is grateful for outpouring of concern for her. The family-maintained Facebook page called Victoria's Victories also issued a statement on Tuesday denying that the whole thing was hoax, although just hours later the page was taken down. 'I promise its not a hoax, I never thought any of this would blow up the way it has. ... Please do not believe untrue media. I have personally watched this family go without to provide for Victoria. They have not and would not do anything to hurt Victoria in any way,' read the statement. After the family's story became public, donations poured into the family's fund-raising effort at www.gofundme.com. Before . the story hit the headlines, the page for Victoria had . raised only $600, but since then more than $135,000 has been raised. No . shows: After reviewing surveillance tape from the . branch the investigators have found that the girl and her grandmother, . who claimed they had been asked to leave, didn't even visit the . restaurant that day . The CEO of the fund-raising webpage GoFundMe, Brad Damphousse, issued a statement on Tuesday suspending the campaign and offering to refund donations, reports CNN. 'In lieu of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the ""Victoria's Victories"" online fundraising effort, GoFundMe has temporarily suspended the campaign until the full truth is made clear,' the statement said. Hannon Food Services, which operates the KFC restaurant, also issued a statement in which said it said it was deeply troubled by the allegation. As part of its investigation, Hannon said it spent hundreds of hours reviewing surveillance video, interviewing employees and hired the outside investigator. The company said it would reach out to the child's family for additional discussions. Victoria Wilcher, who lost an eye in a dog attack, made headlines earlier this month after her family posted a photo entitled 'Does this face look scary to you?' on a Facebook page, Victoria's Victories. Denial: In a statement posted on Facebook on Tuesday, the family denied they had made up the story and said the investigation was ongoing . The allegations against KFC drew widespread condemnation and prompted the chain to donate $30,000 towards Victoria’s charity, as an independent review was launched into the incident. An unnamed source involved in the investigation told the Laurel Leader-Call that all the evidence in the case suggests the story told by Victoria's grandmother, Kelly Mullins, on May 15 was a hoax. After reviewing surveillance tape from the Woodrow Wilson Drive branch – and another in Jackson - investigators found that the woman and the little girl didn't even visit the restaurant that day. The grandmother had also previously told WAPT that she ‘ordered a sweet tea and mashed potatoes and gravy’ at the restaurant before they were asked to leave. But . a review of transactions on May 15 at both Jackson locations found . those items weren’t included in the same order at any point. And no one . matching the description of Mullins or Victoria visited either . restaurant, the Leader-Call reported. 'It just didn’t happen,' the . source told the newspaper. Apology: The family shared the alleged story on Victoria's Facebook page and KFC was quick to apologize . Victoria had been injured in April when three of her grandfather's pit . bull dogs ran into his home in Simpson County by ripping through the back door of the home before jumping on her. They dragged the little girl outside into the backyard, where they . continued to maul her before her grandfather, Donald Mullins, and his . girlfriend, Rita Tompkins, attempted to stop the carnage. The dogs then . attacked their owners, causing Mullins to shoot them. Two of the dogs . were killed. Victoria was rushed to the emergency room. She suffered a shattered top and . bottom jaw, broken cheekbones and eyesockets, a broken nose, lost her . right eye, and lost the ability to move the right side of her face. Mullins and Tompkins were arrested on charges of child endangerment and their eight surviving pit bulls were seized by Animal . Control officers. Victoria was in the hospital for a month after the attack and upon her return home, she . continued with physical therapy and wore a feeding tube. Attack: Victoria is pictured left before the attack in April. Right, she is pictured the hospital six hours after her grandfather's dogs attacked her - claiming her right eye in the incident and causing facial paralysis . Getting better: She is expected to undergo several more surgeries in the future as she heals from the attack . On . Saturday, Las Vegas plastic surgeon Frank Stile flew out to Jackson . after hearing the story and pledged to donate the costs of covering the . expensive reconstructive procedures, likely in the tens of thousands of . dollars. Dick West, who owns . the local Jackson KFC franchises, posted on Facebook about the incident . on Saturday. 'When . the allegation was first made, KFC pledged $30,000 to go to medical . expenses and started an investigation to find the truth,' he wrote. 'They have pledged the money even if it is proven that the incident . never happened. At this point their story is full of holes. Any thinking . person who follows their timeline can see it. The event at KFC never . happened.' It is unclear if Kelly Mullins will face criminal charges if found to have made up the incident.","KFC intends to honor its commitment to donate $30,000 towards Victoria Wilcher's medical bills .

Jett . said Martinez told investigators about killing people for pay all . across the southern half of the United States, the West Coast and some . Midwestern states. ‘It . was 15 or 16 states he provided details on when he was cooperating,’ said Jett. It's unclear how much he is still cooperating now that . multiple murder charges have been filed, he said. While . Martinez is charged in nine contract slayings in California, Jett and . Turner said he will likely be prosecuted next in Florida because . prosecutors there placed a judicial hold on him first. ‘He . was a debt collector and enforcer. The Florida cases stem from two men . there who owed a huge drug debt, and he's alleged to have been sent to . Florida to collect the money that was owed,’ Turner said. The . Marion County Sheriff's Office in Florida last year charged Martinez . with murder in the deaths of 20-year-old Javier Huerta and 28-year-old . Gustavo Olivares-Rivas, who were found shot dead inside a pickup truck . along a road in the Ocala National Forest in Nov. 8, 2006, according to . local media reports. Authorities . were able to break the case when lab results found Martinez's DNA on a . cigarette butt found in a soda can in the truck that hadn't previously . been processed. Martinez . told authorities he lured the men to a Volusia County construction site . because Huerta had stolen 10 kilograms of cocaine worth $210,000. Martinez told investigators he had Huerta call his wife for the money on Nov. 6, 2006. The . wife told authorities her husband called her and told her to remove . $150,000 from a safe buried in their backyard. She said her husband . showed up and took an additional $40,000 from inside the home and left. Martinez told authorities he killed the men so they couldn't identify him to authorities. Investigators . say that once Martinez was arrested in Arizona shortly after crossing . the border from Mexico and sent to Alabama to stand trial he claimed to . be a contract killer for drug cartels who has killed dozens of people in . several states. He . told authorities he worked for multiple drug cartels but said he would . never disclose the names or affiliations of his criminal associates. After . Martinez began confessing to multiple killings, investigators from . other law enforcement agencies across the country came to question him. It . became clear through interviews that the slayings he spoke of had . happened and he had information about them that no one else would know, . authorities said. Authorities . in California say he killed six people in Tulare County, two in Kern . County and one Santa Barbara County between 1980 and 2011. The victims . ranged in age from 22 to 56, investigators said. One . man was shot dead in 1980 driving to work in the morning, while two men . were shot in 1982 working on a ranch, one surviving. Life of crime? Martinez claims to have been in a Mexican drug cartel. Such organisations are renowned for their violence, with this picture showing an arsenal of 204 weapons seized from the cartel 'Los Zetas' The . same year, another man went missing before being found two days later . by ranchers shot and stabbed to death. Yet another was found in 2000 . shot to death in bed with his four children at home. In . addition to the nine murder counts, Martinez was charged in California . with one count of attempted murder and the special circumstances of . committing multiple murders, lying in wait and kidnapping. Four murder charges include the allegation he committed the crime for financial gain, the criminal complaint says. The California charges would make Martinez eligible for a death sentence, if he is convicted. Tulare . County Assistant District Attorney Anthony Fultz welcomed news of the . guilty plea and said his office will immediately contact officials in . Alabama.

His mother has the disease, as does his 15-year-old daughter, Lydia. ‘When I graduated it didn't feel like I graduated. I felt like I was in a dream,’ Alderson told KOAT-TV. Damian Orchard, of All Makes Automotive, says, for the most part, he could just tell Alderson what needed to be done on a car and Alderson takes care of the rest. ‘A good majority of (the repairs) I could turn Cliff loose, once I told him what we needed to do,’ Orchard said. Cliff Alderson feels for the wetness of the oil to check the proper level on the dip stick during an oil change on a car . Orchard said among the repairs Alderson can tackle are brake jobs, shocks, water and power steering pumps, alternators, and changing hoses. Joe Retana, a professor at the auto mechanics program, said Alderson is an enthusiastic person who never let any disability get in the way. ‘He's very exciting and he's a go-getter,’ Retana said. ‘Nothing seems to stop him.’ Alderson said he hopes he has inspired his daughter by graduating, she has the same genetic disease that made him go blind.

"By . David Mccormack . and Associated  Press Reporter . The campaign to force the Washington Redskins to change their name gained a significant victory on Wednesday when the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office canceled the team's federal trademarks because their nickname is ‘disparaging of Native Americans’. The 2:1 decision by a Patent Office administrative tribunal follows years of criticism of the Washington club by Native Americans and others who say the name is derogatory. The ruling doesn’t mean the Redskins have to change their name, but the team – and the NFL - now lose their ability to protect the trademark and the decision opens the door for others to legally use the logos and the name. Scroll down for video . The campaign to force the Washington Redskins to change their name has gained a significant victory after the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office canceled the team's federal trademarks because the nickname is 'disparaging of Native Americans' In ruling against the team, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board wrote, ‘We decide, based on the evidence properly before us, that these registrations must be cancelled because they were disparaging to Native Americans at the respective times they were registered.’ The case - filed on behalf of five Native Americans - was brought against the team by Navajo activist Amanda Blackhorse. ‘I am extremely happy that the [board] ruled in our favor,’ she said. ‘It is a great victory for Native Americans and for all Americans. We filed our petition eight years ago and it has been a tough battle ever since. ‘I hope this ruling brings us a step . closer to that inevitable day when the name of the Washington football . team will be changed.’ Redskins owner Daniel Snyder has steadfastly refused to change the team's name - citing tradition . The team will however be allowed to retain trademark protection during an appeal, which can be reviewed by a federal court. U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) has lauded Wednesday's result as a ‘landmark decision.’ 'This is not the end of this case, but this is a landmark decision by the Patent Office that says that the NFL team here in Washington D.C. does not have patentable name, and that this is an offensive term not patentable by the patent office,’ said Senator Cantwell, speaking on the U.S. Senate floor on Wednesday. 'I hope that all the business decisions at the team will be made with the understanding that this is no longer a business case and we will get off of this slur of a name that we need to change.' Redskins owner Daniel Snyder has steadfastly refused to change the team's name, citing tradition, but there has been growing pressure in recent months including statements from President Barack Obama, lawmakers of both parties and civil rights groups. As of last month, 50 U.S. senators had written ‘scathing’ letters to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. In October, President Obama spoke out against the team’s name: ‘If I were the owner of the team and I knew that there was a name of my team - even if it had a storied history - that was offending a sizable group of people, I’d think about changing it.’ The decision opens the door for others to legally use the Washington Redskins' logos and the name . The decision by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board is similar to one it issued in 1999. That ruling was overturned in 2003 in large part on a technicality after the courts decided that the plaintiffs were too old and should have filed their complaint soon after the Redskins registered their nickname in 1967. The new case was launched in 2006 by a younger group of Native Americans, and was heard by the board in March of last year. The group argued that the Redskins should lose their federal trademark protection based on a law that prohibits registered names that are disparaging, scandalous, contemptuous or disreputable. One of driving force behind the case is a 69-year-old grandmother and longtime Native American activist named Suzan Harjo. U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) has lauded the result against the Redskins as a 'landmark decision' In high school, she was inspired to fight against what she describes as ‘racist stereotypes in American sports’ because of an Oklahoma Native American activist named Clyde Warrior. ‘He made a personal cause of getting rid of the mascot 'Little Red' at the University of Oklahoma,’ Harjo told Business Insider. ‘Most of the Indians in Oklahoma couldn't stand 'Little Red' and we called him the dancing idiot. He was always portrayed by a white guy in Indian costume.’ Little Red was eventually banished by University of Oklahoma President J. Herbert Hollomon in 1970. According to Harjo, activists involved in the effort to eliminate Native American mascots always viewed the Washington Redskins football team as ‘the worst’ offender.","The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office voted 2:1 on Wednesday to cancel the Washington Redskin's federal trademarks .

A Long Island mansion featured in the 1986 Tom Hanks comedy, The Money Pit - about a couple who buy a property on the cheap which turns into a fixer-upper nightmare - is back on the market for $12.5 million. Built in 1898, the three-story white clapboard home has eight-bedrooms and is located in Lattingtown, New York. It has undergone a major renovation in recent years and the current asking price is more than four times what the owners paid just over ten years ago. Scroll down for video . The Long Island mansion featured in the 1986 Tom Hanks comedy, The Money Pit is back on the market with a $12.5 million asking price . ‘It’s now the anti-Money Pit,’ listing broker Shawn Elliott of Shawn Elliott Luxury Homes & Estates told the New York Times. ‘The home was restored at the highest quality.’ The 1986 Steven Spielberg comedy featured Hanks and co-star Shelly Long as Walter and Anna, a young couple who foolishly buy a beautiful mansion from a con artist at a ridiculously low price. Unfortunately the house starts falling apart the moment they move in, with the front door crashing down after Walter carries Anna over the threshold. A bathtub falls through the floor, then the main stairway collapses and the couple are forced to plough more and more money into the project which Walter dubs ‘the money pit’. In the 1986 Steven Spielberg comedy The Money Pit, Tom Hanks and Shelly Long play Walter and Anna, a young couple who foolishly buy a beautiful mansion from a con artist at a ridiculously low price . Built in 1898, the three-story white clapboard home is surrounded by a 5.4-acre estate, it has eight-bedrooms and is located in Lattingtown, New York . When the film was shot, the home belonged to Eric Ridder, a publisher and a member of the American yachting team that won the gold medal at the 1952 Olympics. The front and back of the home were used in the movie, while the inside shots were staged in a studio. The property last went on the market in 2001 when the asking price was $2.95 million. The following year, Rich and Christina Makowsky purchased the 5.4-acre estate and found their lives were imitating art. ‘We didn't realize how bad it was. The house was falling apart when you went from room to room. We definitely could have done the sequel,’ Makowsky told the Times. Money Pit: When the main stairway collapses Walter and Anna are forced to plough more and more money into the project which Walter dubs 'the money pit' Unfortunately the house starts falling apart the moment they move in, with the front door crashing down after Walter carries Anna over the threshold . A crew of 30 spent a year and a half gutting the house, taking down ceilings, ripping out the cast-iron radiators, redoing the plumbing, heating and electrical systems and restoring the home to the splendor of Long Island’s Gilded Age. The Makowskys makeover has been described 'meticulously designed and decorated with a Versace-esque flair' says the Times. Each of the seven full and two half-baths was renovated. The pool, pool house, driveway and landscaping, including an outdoor sound system and a six-car garage, were also overhauled. Three rooms were combined to create a chef’s kitchen, with marble countertops and a mahogany center island. A nine-foot-long, four-foot-high oval window in the breakfast area overlooks an English rose garden. The front and back of the home were used in the movie, while the inside shots were staged in a studio . The master suite wing includes a sitting room with a fireplace, a dressing room with mirrored French doors on the closets and a master bathroom with a free-standing oval tub. The four family bedrooms on the second floor have en-suite baths and walk-in closets. The third floor has four additional bedrooms. The finished lower level has a recreation room, a large gym, a laundry room, a guest or staff suite, a powder room, a pantry and a patio.

Doug Symiczek, . 49, Kyle Parton, 29, and Jacob Griffiths, 32, . died when the single engine of Symiczek's small plane apparently failed . as they flew in Lake Elsinore, California on July 6. In unimaginable tragedy for the family, Parton's wife Breanna was due to give birth to their second child on the day of the crash. The little girl, Trulee Ann Skyler Parton, was born on July 13 - a week after her father's death, according to the family's GoFundMe page. Griffiths' wife, Amanda, was also three months pregnant at the time of the fatal crash. The couple had posed for photographs to announce their happy news just one day before the tragedy. Devastating: Doug Symiczek, center, died in a plane crash with his son-in-laws, Kyle Parton (left) and Jacob Griffiths (right), leaving their wives, (from left) Breanna, Kim and Amanda, without husbands . The women's mother, Kim, and father were also preparing to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary, perhaps on a trip in Hawaii, the Press Enterprise reported. The tragedy means all three women lost their husbands, while the two sisters also lost their dad. On July 6, the three men were planning on taking a quick trip from French Valley to Corona Airport and then back again for breakfast before they hoped to enjoy a day boating on Lake Elsinore. But on their journey, Symiczek's 1967 Piper PA28 suddenly made a sharp turn, clipped some trees and crashed into the mountains . above Lake Elsinore shortly after 9am, witnesses said. The family said initial reports suggest the plane’s single engine may have failed. '(Doug) knew what was going on, and that . he needed to land right away,' his sister-in-law Beckie Dennison said. 'If he hadn’t hit the tree, they would have landed safely. It’s such a . freak accident.' Together: Doug and Kim were planning to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary this month .

Kyle Parton also leaves behind a three-year-old son, Ryder. The baby was to be Griffiths' first child. Just days before the crash, he had sent his father, Scott, a photo of himself shortly after he was born. 'He was so excited about their baby,' his mother Susan Griffiths told the Orange County Register.

"By . Lydia Warren . and Daily Mail Reporters . A convicted drug trafficker has been charged with murdering a Canadian couple and their grandson who vanished two weeks ago. The bodies of Alvin and Kathryn Liknes and five-year-old Nathan O'Brien have not been found but Calgary investigators say evidence has led them to believe that the trio were killed. On Monday morning, 54-year-old Douglas Garland was arrested and charged with two counts of first degree murder in relation to the couple and one count of second degree murder for little Nathan. Previous reports suggested that Garland, whose sister is in a relationship with a member of the Liknes family, had had a dispute with Mr Liknes over a sour business deal. Arrest: Douglas Garland, pictured Monday as . he was escorted into a Calgary police station, has been charged with . murder in the disappearance of  Nathan O'Brien and his . grandparents, who vanished 2 weeks ago . Authorities said the claim, reported in the National Post, was just one line of investigation. Garland had been named a person of interest in the case and was arrested last week, but was released after being charged in an unrelated case. But on Monday, he was re-arrested in a field close to a property owned by his parents, where police have been searching for clues. Garland had been staying at a hotel as part of his bail conditions but had been asked to leave, CTV reported. He is due to appear in court on Wednesday. Investigators are still searching for . the bodies of the victims, and are asking local residents to come . forward with any information they may have. 'Rural . property and business owners are asked to please search their . properties for anything suspicious,' police said in a release. Missed: Nathan is pictured with his grandmother Kathy Liknes. Police believe they were murdered . Mystery: The bodies of Kathryn and Alvin Liknes have not been found and police are continuing the search . Calgary Police Chief Rick Hanson told CTV that he believes a property owner or a hiker will see something to help the case. 'We will be relentless on this,' he said. 'We know how important it is not only for the family but the community to have closure to this by identifying and locating the bodies.' Nathan and his grandparents vanished two weeks ago. The boy was staying with the couple for a sleepover and when his mother arrived to collect him the next day, they were gone. They were reported missing by the boy's parents, Rod and Jennifer O'Brien, on June 30. At . an earlier press conference, police confirmed that a 'violent crime happened' in their home. Authorities added they hoped that at least one of them was being kept alive. Loss: Nathan (left with his brothers) was staying with his grandparents for a sleepover when he vanished . Distraught: His parents Rod and Jennifer O'Brien had said they believed he was still alive as they attended a candlelight vigil for him and his grandparents on Thursday evening, pictured . 'Even as the days went by, there’s always a hope, there’s always a glimmer of hope,' Hanson said at a news conference on Monday. 'Unfortunately with the laying of the charges, we’ve taken that hope away from the family. So they are devastated.' Garland was remanded in custody for two days last week for possessing the identification of Matthew Hartley, a teenager who had died in a car crash in 1980. He had previously assumed the identity to avoid authorities and gain employment. Garland's criminal history dates back to 1992 when police raided his parent's farm on suspicion he was producing drugs. They found ingredients to make crystal meth, but no final product. Drug charges were filed but Garland skipped town and lived on the run for seven years. He was discovered in 1999 living in British Columbia under the name of the dead teenager, and later served 39 months jail after being convicted of drugs charges. The truck in question: Canadian authorities said this green late 1980s - early 1990s Ford F-150 pickup was circling the house where the missing trio was before they went missing . No stone unturned: Officers are walking every inch of every field on the farm after tips led them to the property . Garland had used the fake identity to gain employment as a chemical mixer, but that ended in 1997 after a promotion led to him suffering a nervous breakdown. He then filed for unemployment benefits under the assumed name, but that was denied after his true identity was revealed. Garland, who also dropped out of medical following a nervous breakdown, then sued in the federal tax court and won. His last encounter with the law was a traffic offence in 2009. It was believed that he was driving a green Ford F-150 pickup seen near the Liknes family home on the night they disappeared.","The bodies of Alvin and Kathryn Liknes and grandson Nathan O'Brien have not been found but police say evidence shows they were killed .

"By . Lydia Warren . A woman who claimed the singer of indie rock band Bright Eyes had raped her after a concert when she was 16 has admitted to making the story up. Joanie Faircloth, who had accused Conor Oberst of rape in a series of online posts in December 2013, issued a statement retracting her story on Monday. 'The statements I made and repeated online and elsewhere over the past six months accusing Conor Oberst of raping me are 100% false,' the statement said. She admitted making up the stories 'to get attention while I was going through a difficult period in my life and trying to cope with my son’s illness'. 'Liar': Joanie Faircloth, pictured, has admitted that her claims about being raped by singer Conor Oberst in 2003 were '100% false'. She said she made them when she was trying to cope with her son's illness (right) In the statement, shared by Pitchfork, she added: 'I publicly retract my statements about Conor Oberst, and sincerely apologize to him, his family, and his fans for writing such awful things about him. 'I realize that my actions were wrong and could undermine the claims of actual sexual assault victims and for that I also apologize. I'm truly sorry for all the pain that I caused.' Faircloth, a married mother living in North Carolina, did not expand on her son's ill health in the statement, but her Facebook posts show he is autistic and suffers from a kidney disease. He is awaiting a kidney transplant and remains in hospital. Her comments accusing Oberst, now 33, of rape had been written beneath an article about domestic violence for XOJane's 'It Happened to Me' series in December, and were later shared on other blogs. The posts were initially posted under Facebook name, before they were switched to 'anonymous'. They were eventually deleted. In them, Faircloth claimed that the singer-songwriter . raped her in 2003 in North Carolina after his brother, who was her . English teacher at school, introduced the two at one of the singer's . concerts. Angered: Oberst, pictured in 2012, had sued her for libel after she made the claims online last December . Caught out: She had initially linked her comments to her Facebook page - leading other web users to see that some of her claims didn't match up. Instead, her online presence showed she was a big fan of Oberst . Among her false claims, she had written: 'Conor definitely took advantage of my teenage crush on him... Conor took a lot from me including my virginity, my dignity, and my self-esteem.' She wrote that she never reported . the assault because of the way her own family and friends reacted to the . accusations - but that her husband had encouraged her to name him to help others. After she had posted the claims on XOJane.com last December, her story started to unravel and Oberst sued her for $1 million for libel in February. The civil lawsuit, which was filed in a Manhattan federal court, branded her a liar who made 'despicable, false, outrageous, and defamatory statements' about Oberst. Oberst, who sought monetary damages, attorney fees and other costs, said . that the media coverage damaged his career. Last week, there were reports that he had been dropped from his record label, Nonesuch, but his publicist told Radio.com that this was not true. In the lawsuit, he explained that he had been in the company of his brother, bandmates or . then-girlfriend at the time he was accused of attacking Faircloth. '[Her] . statements… are not only malicious lies, but they are an insult to the . millions of actual rape victims around the world,' his complaint said. 'Faircloth should be ashamed of herself.' A decade ago: Oberst is seen right in 2003, the year Faircloth had claimed he had raped her at a show . Claims: Joanie Faircloth made her claims in the comment section of XOJane's 'It Happened To Me' In his complaint, Oberst said that he had demanded on two occasions that she recant her story - but she had failed to do so, forcing him to file the suit. Around the time of the lawsuit, other doubts were thrown on her claims. The comments were made under her Facebook page, which showed her date of birth, and web users were able to figure out that Bright Eyes had not played a show when she would have turned 16. She later switched her story to say it had been a concert for his other band, Desaparecidos . Older social media posts showed her posting positively about Oberst and his music. 'The last time I saw Desaparecidos perform at the Cat's Cradle, it was my 16th birthday and Conor pulled me up on stage and sang happy birthday,' read a post made under the name 'Joanie Faircloth' in January. 'Best memory ever.' She had also listed Bright Eyes as her favorite band in December 2011, which Oberst's team noted in their lawsuit. The court documents also claimed she had a history of 'catfishing', such as posing online as a boy named 'Zac' and even claiming to be a cancer patient. Oberst, who lives in Omaha, Nebraska, is best known for his work with Bright Eyes, including song First Day Of My Life.","Joanie Faircloth had previously accused Conor Oberst of raping her in 2003 - but on Monday, she called the claims '100% false'

"By . Lydia Warren . A New York grandfather whose high school class ring was stolen from his wedding reception 40 years ago has been reunited with the memento - after it turned up in Greece. Stan Ostapiak, a retired police officer from Staten Island, was stunned when he received a call saying the ring had been found by a Greek student among his late father's belongings in Naxos. The man, Vasilis Polykretis, tracked down Ostapiak with some internet sleuthing and sent the ring 5,000 miles back to its owner earlier this month. 'It doesn't fit me anymore,' Ostapiak said. 'But my wife will put it back on her key chain, so we can go steady again.' Scroll down for video . Joy: Stan and Elaine Ostapiak grin as they show off Stan's high school class ring, which was recently found by a man in Naxos, Greece. It had been stolen from their wedding reception more than 40 years ago . Returned: The ring, which Ostapiak gave to Elaine when she was still his girlfriend, doesn't fit him anymore . Ostapiak, 69, graduated from a Manhattan high school in 1962 and presented the ring to his wife, Elaine, when she was still his girlfriend. The ring was important to them, he said, because the students couldn't afford to have a prom so it was his only memento from his high school years. Elaine put the ring on her keychain but at the couple's wedding reception in Queens on October 29, 1972, her purse was stolen - along with the keys and ring, as well as a few dollars. The couple assumed that was the last they would see of it - until Polykretis came across the ring while looking through his late father's belongings. Journey: It is not known how the ring ended up in Greece after it was stolen, but it was found by a man on a beach. After the man passed away, his son found the ring among his belongings . His father had found the ring on a beach in Greece in 1980, although it is not known how it got there. Polykretis noticed that it had the name of Seward Park High School in New York engraved inside, as well as the initials 'S.J.O'. He began searching on the internet for clues to its owner. While the school closed in 2006, it still has an active alumni association, so Polykretis emailed its president, Martin Kane, the Staten Island Advance reported. Kane fetched a yearbook from 1962 and scoured the names for anyone with the initials 'S.J.O' - and only Ostapiak matched. He called the couple and left a message on his voicemail. Elaine, who picked up the message, said: ""I said, 'How could this be?' But it was . just too specific - it had to be true. I said, ""Stan you have to listen to this message!"" And when he did he was so . excited.' Clues: The Greek man who found the ring saw that it had the initials 'S.J.O' inside, which allowed the president of the school's alumni association to identify Ostapiak as the owner . Kindness of strangers: The man, Vasilis Polykretis, offered to host the couple if they should ever visit Greece. 'It's really unbelievable that strangers went through the trouble of doing this,' Ostapiak said . Polykretis sent the ring by registered mail, polished and gleaming in a new box, along with a postcard. 'I hope this ring brings you joy and happiness, and maybe some old memories,' he wrote. 'If you're ever again in Greece, we'd be more than happy to host you.' The couple, who spend their time looking after their seven grandchildren, said they'll 'maybe' visit the island if they can. 'It's really unbelievable that two strangers went through the trouble of doing this,' Ostapiak told the Staten Island Advance. 'That's what really got to me - what really impressed me. I'm so appreciative.' See below for video .","Stan Ostapiak graduated high school in New York in 1962 and gave his class ring to his wife, Elaine, when she was just his girlfriend .

"By . Lydia Warren . A teacher is in critical condition after four Pennsylvania teenagers deliberately threw a rock from a highway overpass onto the windshield of her family's car, police said. The 8lb rock smashed Sharon Budd, a 52-year-old mother and breast cancer survivor from Ohio, in the head, causing her to lose an eye and inflicting life-threatening swelling on her brain. She was injured as she drove on Interstate 80 with her husband Randy and their daughter Kaylee, 19, to New York at around 11.45pm on Thursday. The boulder smashed through the windshield as they passed Milton and Mrs Budd, who was a front seat passenger, was struck in the head. Her daughter, who was driving, pulled over the car. Injured: Sharon Budd, left, was struck by a rock thrown from an overpass as her family drove on I-80. Moments before, she spoke with her son Lucas, right, who is about to be deployed to Afghanistan . 'It was the most gruesome thing that . you could ever imagine,' Randy told The Repository newspaper. The mother of four was rushed to hospital in Danville, Pennsylvania where she needed emergency surgery on her brain to reduce the pressure from swelling. She has been heavily sedated since. Randy Budd said his wife had just finished speaking with their eldest son, Lucas, before the vehicle was struck by the rock. The 28-year-old was scheduled to leave for Afghanistan with the Ohio National Guard this week for a one-year deployment but his departure has been delayed as his mother fights for her life. After hanging up the phone, she asked him to send her a photo from his station in Fort Bliss, Texas, which he did. 'He wrote back, ""I really miss you mom"",' Randy Budd said. Loved: Mrs Budd, a teacher, is pictured with her husband Randy and 19-year-old daughter Kaylee, who were in the car but who did not suffer any injuries, and her three sons . Fears: Randy said when he saw her injuries, 'it was the most gruesome thing that you could ever imagine' Four teens, including 18-year-old Brett Lahr and 17-year-old Dylan Lahr, have been charged in the incident. Two other juveniles identified only by their initials - KLN and TGP - were also arrested. They face felony charges of aggravated assault and criminal conspiracy to commit aggravated assault, and counts of propulsion of missiles into an occupied vehicle or onto roadway, possessing of instruments of crime and recklessly endangering another person, the Daily Item reported. KLM told state police that they had been driving in his Mitsubishi Eclipse when they stopped on the overpass to Interstate 80, according to the criminal complaint, the Daily Item reported. Dylan Lahr and TGP got out and threw rocks at and struck passing vehicles, KLM told troopers. He said he saw a vehicle slow down but that they fled to the Lahrs' house. They then got into the Lahr family's gold Honda Accord and drove past the scene to see what was happening and when they saw a police car, they returned to the home. Scene: A group of teenagers threw rocks from this overpass in Milton, Pennsylvania last week and one landed on the Budds' car. Four teens were arrested and now face charges in the incident . KLM and Brett Lahr headed back to the scene again and saw several more police cruisers before returning to the Lahrs' house. Police checked the license plate of the Honda, which was registered to the Lahr family, and went to their home in New Columbia. When questioned by police, TGP said he threw one rock onto I-80 but did not strike a vehicle whereas Dylan Lahr threw at least two rocks and one of them struck a car. Brett Lahr, the older brother, remained in Union County Prison in lieu of $50,000 bail, while Dylan Lahr was released on supervised bail. Sharon Budd's family has set up a GoFundMe page to help with her medical costs.","Sharon Budd was driving from Ohio to New York with her husband and daughter when their car was struck with an 8lb rock in Pennsylvania .

The report, viewed by the Herald Sun, includes accounts of group sex and rape between vulnerable children under the age of 10 as well as incidents involving older residents. According to the Herald Sun, the report recorded a nine-year-old boy telling his visiting mother that he had been raped by a 12-year-old boy while on a hammock. Leaked government documents, viewed by the Herald Sun, include accounts of group sex and rape between vulnerable children under the age of 10 as well as incidents involving older residents . The 12-year-old was found to have been involved in a previous police investigation involving another rape accusation. However the Herald Sun revealed that the Department of Human Services staff who allocate children to homes were not made aware of the investigation. In a separate occurrence at a state home in Melbourne's west, the article reported that four children under 13 participated in group sex acts in which a 12-year-old girl was sexually penetrated. The girl was moved from the facility after medical investigations. Three children under 11-years-old were also recorded admitting to similar behaviour. The Herald Sun is now pushing the Department of Human Services to provide answers as to why children were placed in the same residential care units despite having histories of sexualized behaviours. Staff told the publication that it was not uncommon for allegations against children regarding sexualized behaviour to be kept from them. A lack of staff, supervision and staff training on sexualised behaviour has so far been attributed to the incidents.

Two AK-47 magazines were allowed through security by the TSA, tucked into a checked bag of a Yemeni national traveling on a one-way ticket home along with thousands of dollars, it was revealed today. Bassam Alkhanshli, 32, was found in possession of the empty clips as he prepared to travel to Yemen on a one-way ticket from JFK along with 28-year-old Methaq Mohammed Ali. A TSA spokesman told MailOnline today that the empty magazines were in checked luggage and although the clips are illegal, the agency's role is not to find such items. The TSA is focused on finding any item which would cause 'catastrophic damage' to a plane. Bassam Alkhanshli allegedly had two empty AK-47 assault-rifle magazines stowed in his luggage as he traveled from JFK to his native Yemen on a one-way ticket . The men were initially stopped by the TSA . because they were flying one-way to Yemen on Sunday at 11pm - alerting . counter-terrorism officials. Alkhanshli was carrying $12,000 and Ali had $14,000 - above the $10,000 limit for cash being taken out of the U.S. An ammunition clip similar to the one found empty in the luggage of a Yemeni man at JFK on Sunday (stock image) The men were then questioned by U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel leading to them missing the flight. After explaining the money, they were cleared to take another flight. Before departure, ten pieces of their luggage was re-examined by customs officers. Despite the luggage having been screened and cleared by the TSA, Customers Officer Richard Sanicola later found two 30-round AK-47 magazine clips in Alkhanshli’s bag. No ammunition was found. 'I did not know I was not supposed to have this,' Alkhanshli said, according to the New York Post.

"By . Louise Boyle . Steven Powell's home in Washington was sold to his voyeurism victims' parents. They have agreed to have it searched by cadaver dogs after Powell's daughter-in-law Susan went missing in 2009 . Cadaver dogs are to search the home of Steven Powell, the father-in-law of Susan Cox Powell who vanished in 2009. The Washington home of convicted 'Peeping Tom' Steven Powell was recently sold as part of restitution to the parents of the girls he took naked pictures of while they were in their bathroom next door. Steven Powell was released from prison in March after serving two years for taking . photographs of two girls, aged eight and ten in 2011. During Powell's voyeurism trial, the girls' parents became friends with the parents of missing Susan, Chuck and Judy Cox. The victims' parents agreed to allow a private search of the home with dogs in the next few weeks as it still has Steven Powell's belongings inside. Anne Bremner, the neighbors' lawyer, told MailOnline today: 'Chuck is never giving up hope.' She added that the family do not know whether Mrs Cox Powell is alive or dead. Law . enforcement found the sordid photographs of the little girls' next door . at Powell's home in 2012 while looking for evidence of his missing . daughter-in-law. It appears that cadaver dogs were not used to search the home at the time because they were not covered by warrants obtained by West Valley Police and Pierce County Sheriff's Department to go into Powell's property, Ms Bremner said. Calls to the Pierce County Sheriff and West Valley Police Department went unanswered today. The attorney said on Wednesday: 'They didn't have the access we have now, they only had narrowly tailored warrants.' The home also will be searched for other documents and records that might give clues as to the whereabouts of Mrs Cox Powell. Utah mother-of-two Susan Powell, 28, disappeared from her home in West Valley City in December 2009. She has never been found. The Cox family claims that Steven Powell has information about his missing daughter-in-law. It was suspected that she was killed by her husband Josh Powell but he never faced charges in the case. In 2012, he attempted to murder . his sons, Charles, seven, and five-year-old Braden with a hatchet . before setting his home alight, killing them and himself. Last week, cadaver dogs were used in a privately-funded and volunteer-based search of a rural home close to Salem, Oregon for signs of Susan Cox Powell. Her husband's aunt and uncle had been renting the property at the time of her disappearance in 2009. No signs of Susan's remains were found. Josh and Susan Powell, pictured in September 2009, with their two sons Charles and Braden. Mrs Powell has been missing since 2009 while Josh killed himself and his two sons in a house explosion months later . Powell is on probation for 30 months, required to wear a GPS locator and attend a sex-offender treatment program. He lives in Tacoma, according to the corrections facility. The two girls victimized by Powell were awarded a $1.8million settlement as part of a civil suit. Powell, 63, had argued against the sale of his home, saying that it would leave him and his two adult children without a home. His early release date in May 2013 was rejected because, in part, he wanted to move back into the home. He was going to be released in November but that plan also fell apart because a landlord withdrew an offer to rent to him. Steven Powell had a sexual obsession with Susan Powell that was thoroughly documented in journals seized by police. In passages from 17 spiral notebooks written over more than ten years, he wrote of his sexual fantasies about Susan, how he believed she loved him too and hopes they would be together. He wrote: 'She is an amazing woman. I hope I am right, that she is in love with me, but of course there is the problem of her being married to my son. The fact is, I can hardly control myself when it comes to her.' He admitted 'looking at her naked body under the bathroom door (using a mirror)' though recognized this was a 'sick' thing to do. But there is no hint that he or his son Josh had anything to do with her disappearance and he made mention of the possibility she ran off with another man - which is what Josh Powell told police. Following her disappearance, authorities found blood in the family home and a hand-written note in which Susan Powell expressed fear about her husband hurting her.","Steven Powell, 63, was convicted of voyeurism in 2012 after taking naked pictures of the girls living next door to his Puyallup, Washington home .

However the executors' lawyer John Morken said his . clients simply want to show that the elderly lady was 'incapacitated', . according to the Post. According to court papers, . Mr Morken claimed that when Clark moved into the hospital in 1991, she . was an 'eccentric recluse' living in a dirty bathrobe and weighed just . 75lb. A judge has yet to make the decision on the insanity claim. Clark was the daughter of copper magnate Senator William A Clark. After losing her father, then her 16-year-old sister to meningitis and a failed marriage, she withdrew from public life. She spent decades out of the public eye, designing doll houses and painting exquisite works of art. It was announced in March that Eat Pray Love director Ryan Murphy had bought the film rights to  Clark's bizarre life, following the book 'Empty Mansions: The Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American Fortune' by Pullitzer prize-winning journalist Bill Dedman. Miss Clark owned apartments at 907 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, pictured, which took up an entire floor. Despite this home, she lived in hospitals for 20 years . Despite . owning properties on Fifth Avenue and in California and Connecticut, . Clark elected to live in Beth Israel hospital for her last two decades. She met only with close . friends, advisers and a nurse. Beautiful: Huguette Clark retreated from public life when she was still a young woman. When she passed away, she was estimated to have a $300 million fortune . Just . before Clark's death, distant relatives began questioning how her . lawyer and accountant were handling her affairs - particularly after a . will cut them out - and a criminal investigation was launched. The . relatives also argued that she had given hefty gifts to her advisers, . doctors and carers, suggesting that they had manipulated her - but they . argued that she was simply giving generously to the people in her life. The . argument was settled in September and the relatives - many of whom had . never even met Clark - walked away with the largest payout, while her . devoted nurse was left with nothing. More . recently, prosecutors failed to find evidence of criminal conduct . towards her, instead discovering that Clark's extravagant gifts were . made in her own steady handwriting or with her written authorization. No criminal charges were filed against Attorney Wallace Bock and accountant Irving H. Kamsler, who all along denied any wrongdoing, and the investigation closed earlier this year. The investigation, carried out by two . detectives and a forensic accountant, found that Clark's extravagant . gifts were made in her own steady handwriting or with her written . authorization. Documents and testimony also showed that . Clark was not kept from her relatives, NBC reported, but instead made her own . decisions about whom to speak with in person or by phone. A neurologist who testified . in the investigation visited Clark in 2005, six months after she signed . the second will. She said that the then-99-year-old seemed alert. 'She seemed cute as pie,' Dr. Louise Klebanoff testified. 'Perfectly content.' Attorneys . for Bock and Kamsler told NBC that their clients were satisfied because . they had always worked within Clark's interests. But a settlement last . year ruled that they were not to receive the huge sums of money left to . them by Clark. Heiress: Huguette Clark, pictured, inherited her fortune from her industrialist father, William A. Clark, right . The settlement combined elements from the two contradictory wills. The . family - many of whom Clark never even met - came out as the winners, . receiving $34 million while her private nurse of 20 years, Hadassah . Peri, was left with nothing. Peri, an immigrant from the Philippines who worked 12 hours a day, seven days a week for Clark as she lived in New York hospitals, had originally been given $30 million in Clark's final will. Peri had also been given $30 million in gifts throughout Clark's life. A separate deal ordered her to pay $5 million of these back to the estate after the attorney general's office deemed them excessive. However, the settlement stopped Clark's relatives trying to get any more of these gifts. While the Bock and Kamsler missed out on their payouts, the settlement also disposed of all potential legal claims against the pair, in relation to mistakes they allegedly made - such as failing to video her signing the will, and failing to claim gift tax returns for seven years.","Huguette Clark died in 2011 after two decades living in a New York hospital .

The father said that his 'bonehead decision' cost him his job and he and wife Emily (right) are now moving their family from their Florida home and starting over . Mr Crossland said: 'It was a bonehead decision. It was an effort to help him but it didn't come across that way... I'm sorry I used that tactic as opposed to another.' The 27-year-old explained the decision to push his son off the steep ramp as 'my poor attempt at trying to help him overcome his fear'. He added: 'Because of a decision I made, my wife and my children and everybody has got to deal with it.' His wife Emily said the video, which was originally uploaded to Instagram by a teenage skater, has turned the family's lives upside down and now they plan to start over. She said that what has happened has been extremely confusing for her little boy. 'It's something I tried to shield him from,' she said. 'He knows he's been on the news. But he is doing wonderful, he's happy and he's healthy.' The mother said that her husband's actions were 'not acceptable' in their household but that what happened on April 27 was an isolated incident. She said: 'Nothing like that has ever happened before, there is nothing behind closed doors. He's a really great dad, he loves his family, he's a good person.' Police and the State Attorney’s said last week that an investigation is ongoing, according to jacksonville.com. The Department of Children and Families declined to discuss a specific case.

Ramos, the skate park's operator, told First Coast News that the father and son are . regulars at the park but that he hadn't seen Mr Crossland act that way . before. 'He said he was just caught up in the . moment. He seemed very remorseful. He certainly understands the gravity . of the situation and it seems like he is going to be answering to this . thing for quite some time to come,' Mr Ramos said. He added: 'Unfortunately parents get so enthusiastic about their kids and their abilities in skateboarding, or baseball, or football or whatever and sometimes they take it a little too far.' Mr Ramos reportedly asked Crossland to stay away from Kona State Park for a little while. The family welfare department in Jacksonville along with the sheriff's office are investigating the incident. Mr Crossland's son, nicknamed Dino the Dinosaur, is well-known in the area. There are multiple videos of Dino skating and performing tricks to YouTube. Dino was not hurt in the fall, Mr Ramos told ActionNews, and continued to skate after he was kicked by his father. The teenager who posted the video online told FirstCoastNews that he asked Mr Crossland why Dino was kicked so hard. 'He said ""because he needs to learn"". I was like ""pushing him down is not teaching him how to drop in"". And then he said ""Do you think you can raise him better than me?"" and I said yes,' the 13-year-old said. Online commenters heavily criticized Crossland for his parenting skills. 'How about someone push this a****** off a bridge. #sorryimnotsorry,' one user said. 'he needs to be reported if this is what he did in public view what you thing [sic] he does at home god be with this little boy,' another wrote.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Patricia Shipp . Rosie O'Donnell's return to The View has today been confirmed. ABC made the announcement on its Twitter page, with the message: 'It's official! ABC confirms Rosie O'Donnell returns as co-host of The View with moderator Whoopi Goldberg for Season 18'. Scroll down for video... She's back: Rosie O'Donnell will return to The View . Rumours have been swirling this week that O'Donnell would rejoin the struggling daytime chat show, which only recently ousted Jenny McCarthy and Sherri Shepherd. O'Donnell will co-host the show with Goldberg, who replaced the controversial star as moderator when she left on a bad note after just eight months on April 30, 2007. The brunette replaced Meredith Vieira as a moderator on The View in September 2006. She returns as The View's longtime executive producer and co-creator Bill Geddie leaves. It was no secret that Rosie and Bill were often at loggerheads - a situation that only intensified after Rosie's 2007 explosive on-air row with former View co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck over the Iraq war. Geddie egged on the right-wing Hasselbeck via her earpiece, and cut to a cable news-type split-screen of the duo going head to head. A source told MailOnline that more producers have also been fired as the show plans a revamp - adding: 'Everyone thinks the reason that Bill's going is because ABC wanted to bring Rosie back and they hate each other so much, there is no way they could work together.' And it's also claimed that Sherri Sheperd quit The View after learning Jenny was being fired - and Bill was going. Meanwhile, the source said that Whoopi Goldberg, the show's moderator, has a three year 'pay or play' deal - and while unhappy at the show's many changes, would lose $12 million if she walked away. Today, Whoopi addressed many of the rumors surrounding the show on air, saying: 'I just have something on my mind. You know there is a lot of speculation about a lot of stuff going on here. Yes, I'm here. We don't know who's coming in, but I will tell you this: The respect that I have for the people who work here will not change. 'I will do my best to respect the audience, to make sure that we bring you The View that Barbara Walters wanted you to have, which is women talking about issues. We are not little kids, we are grown a** women. And so, I'm just tired of people saying, 'oh, you know if this one comes in, or if this one comes in,' I don't argue with people, we have spirited discussions.' She continued, ""I don't fight with people, that's not my way. Quit trying to make me into something I'm not. I'm not a little girl with cat claws. I am not a cat, I am a human being. I am a girl with a fist. And so, I'm just telling y'all, The View is going to evolve as it always has. Quit trying to make something happen and let whatever's going to happen, happen, and we hope you will join us when we come back."" A rousing welcome: O'Donnell, who got a . standing ovation when she appeared on The View in February for the first . time since quitting the show in 2007, allegedly drove a hard bargain to secure her 'one-year, seven-figure deal' O'Donnell allegedly drove a hard bargain to secure her 'one-year, seven-figure deal', according to Page Six. The . star allegedly demanded a say on who will take a seat at The View table . next season, and she does not want any reality stars on the cast. O'Donnell hasn't officially commented on the news. But she tweeted a picture on Thursday morning showing her holding her baby daughter Dakota and joined by her son Blake as she enjoys a swim at a Florida beach. 'Nothing like Florida - pure joy,' she wrote in the caption. Says it all: O'Donnell hasn't yet commented on the news, but she tweeted this photo on Thursday morning showing her taking a swim in the ocean in Florida . O'Donnell's short tenure on The View resulted in several controversies, including an on-air dispute regarding the Iraq War, resulting in a mutual agreement to cancel her contract. However, she is credited with making the show more news-focused and increasing viewership. Despite an overall downward trend for most daytime broadcast shows, ratings rose by 27% during O'Donnell's first year on The View, according to Variety in 2007. Also linked to join O'Donnell is Meghan McCain, the daughter of former Presidential candidate Senator John McCain, who will co-host The View next week. According to The Wrap, McCain, the co-host of Pivot's TakePart Live, would provide a conservative voice to the ABC show, taking on the role previously held by Elisabeth Hasselbeck. The 29-year-old blonde 'presents herself as a progressive Republican who doesn't always agree with her party on social issues, such as gay marriage'. However, she is under contract on TakePart Live, and it is unclear whether she could join The View full-time.

Meghan McCain will guest host on The View next week . Favourite: Senator John McCain's daughter Meghan McCain is said to be in talks to join the ABC show . Meanwhile, rumours that O'Donnell would re-join the cast did not sit well with her one-time co-host and arch nemesis Elizabeth Hasselbeck, who did not mince words when addressing the possible comeback this week. O'Donnell infamously clashed with conservative pundit Hasselbeck, who took umbrage with some of O’Donnell’s statements about the Iraq War. Hasslebeck, 37, hosted The View for a decade before joining Fox and Friends last year. On Wednesday, Hasselback, who is currently on vacation, called into her show to weigh in on O'Donnell's potential comeback, expressing nothing but contempt for her former colleague.'What could ruin a vacation more than to hear news like this?' the Fox presenter quipped before launching into a tirade that resurrected the specter of her past on-air battles with O'Donnell. 'Talks about not securing the border,' the conservative commentator ranted. 'Here in comes to The View the very . woman who spit in the face of our military, spit in the face of her own . network... coming back with a bunch of control ready to regain a seat . at The View table.’ Clenched teeth: On Wednesday, Hasselbeck accused O'Donnell of spiting in the face of the military and ABC Network . On-screen battles: O'Donnell exited from The . View in 2007 after only eights months marked by fiery clashes with . Hasselbeck over the Iraq War . But O'Donnell's other former The View co-host Joy Behar criticised Hasselbeck's 'hate-filled' remarks. 'I thought that was really kind of below-the-belt, to say she spits in the face of the military. I would like Elisabeth to explain herself,"" she told CNN's Don Lemon on Wednesday night, mentioning that O'Donnell's eldest son is in military school. 'What does she mean by that? And isn't it kind of a nasty thing to say about somebody who basically is a good person? That's a dangerous thing to say about somebody. I think it's a hate-filled remark.' Standing by her: O'Donnell's former The View co-host Joy Behar came to her defense, calling Hasselbeck's remarks 'hate-filled' and 'dangerous' O'Donnell, meanwhile, responded to Hasselbeck's comments via Twitter. One fan wrote to her: '@Rosie, @etnow @ehasselbeck way to spin words by saying you spit in faces of our servicemen - she's becoming a great FAUX News anchor.' O'Donnell replied:' @MatPat82 - think she has donated any money to the armed services???? Hmmmmm.' Outspoken: O'Donnell responded to Hasselbeck's comments via Twitter . The claws are out: O'Donnell also criticised Hasselbeck's behaviour during the taping of Barbara Walter's farewell show earlier this year . ABC explained the recent changes to the show in a statement on Friday saying: ‘The View will be moving in an exciting new direction next season, and ABC has made decisions to evolve the show creatively.' Both McCarthy and Shepherd broke the news that they would be leaving last Thursday on Twitter. At first the Scary Movie star suggested she was leaving in support of Shepherd's dumping. The model turned actress wrote: 'If Sherri goes . . . I go too,” adding “#sisters.' She then later wrote: 'My View will be changing too. As will with many hard working folks. Thanks to everyone at the show for your dedication and an amazing year.' Not the only one: Co-star Sherri Shepherd's contract was not renewed after seven years with the talk show . Showing the close bond she and Shepherd had, McCarthy posted an image of the pair with two other members of The View production team saying, 'These are my Avengers and we will be back!' However, it has been reported that the blonde had been dumped from the role, which she had held since just September, as she did not appeal to daytime audiences. It is not known why her 47-year-old co-star's contract was not renewed. Confirming her exit, Shepherd released a statement to Deadline.com earlier on Thursday. She said: 'It’s been seven wonderful years on The View and after careful consideration it is time for me to move on. 'I am extremely grateful to Barbara Walters and Bill Gedde for giving me the opportunity.' She added: 'I look forward to the business opportunities that lay ahead for me and I am incredibly grateful to my View family and my fans for supporting me on this journey.'

"By . Ashley Collman . and Patricia Shipp . The parents of a 13-year-old girl who went missing 25 years ago are 'thrilled' police have started searching their home for more evidence, saying they 're just glad their daughter's case is getting a surge of attention. Amy Sue Pagnac went missing in 1989 from a gas station in Osseo, Minnesota while her father, Marshall Midden, was using the restroom. Amy's cold-case disappearance was reopened on Sunday when investigators began searching her childhood home in Maple Grove, telling her parents to leave the property without officially naming the two as suspects. Come home Amy: Sue Pagnac, mother of missing girl Amy Pagnac, says she's thrilled investigators are searching her home since it's bringing more attention to her daughter's case . In a press conference on Monday, police Capt KeithTerlinden said the search was expected to last until Friday, at the least. Search: Police are searching the home where Amy Sue Pagnac, pictured, lived when she went missing in 1989 . While investigators sift through their house and property, Amy's parents are staying in the garage of another daughter's home. 'I am thrilled that so much attention has finally been placed on Amy, I am hoping this will finally bring her home,' her mother, Susan Pagnac, told MailOnline. Mrs Pagnac says investigators showed up on Tuesday and told her and her husband to leave for about a week, without giving any explanation for their new search. However, she thinks some nosy neighbors may be to blame for the renewed efforts. 'I hear a couple of our neighbors, who have hated us for years, are talking and telling people we did a lot of landscaping on our property after Amy disappeared so perhaps that has something to do with what's going on now. 'What they obviously forgot to add is that the work we did was in 1993 and Amy went missing in 1989! 'But for whatever reason, I am very happy they are still looking for my little girl, but I will also be happy when this investigating into our home and family is completed so these people will have to shut up! 'We love Amy and would never do anything to hurt her.' Mrs Pagnac recalls the day Amy disappeared, saying her husband stopped at the gas station to 'do his business'. When he came out of the restroom, Amy was gone but he just figured she went to use the bathroom as well. When a stranger came out instead of his little girl though, Mr Midden started to worry. New search: Investigators showed up at the Maple Grove, Minnesota home of Amy's parents on Sunday, telling them to leave for about a week so they could conduct a search . What are they looking for? Amy parents' were ordered to leave but have not been named as official suspects in their daughter's 1989 disappearance . Rumors: Ms Pagnac believes that the search may be due to neighbors comments about landscaping projects following Amy's disappearance . Disappearance: Amy was last seen sitting in a vehicle at the Holiday Gas Station, pictured, in Osseo in 1989 . 'Marshall then started to look around the gas station for her but she had disappeared into thin air!' Ms Pagnac said. Her husband called home to see if Amy had showed up there, but she hadn't. He then called police and they told him to go home so they could interview the couple together. 'The police began looking for her but there were no witnesses, no calls, nothing and the police kept coming back to us because they said we were the last ones seen with Amy, but that's not true -- obviously!' Ms Pagnac siad. Over the years, her parents have received information giving them hope that Amy is still alive. Years ago, a woman who grew up with Amy said she'd seen her 'in one of these places - stripping and prostituting'. Tragic: Amy, pictured left and right, disappeared when she was just 13 and her parents think she is still alive . Mystery: Local police have traveled to Iowa and California to follow leads in the decades-old case. He said as a father of daughters the case struck a chord with him . And then there was the time someone was approached at a train station by a girl who said: 'I'm Amy Pagnac'. What Amy might look like now: An Artist's impression of how Amy may look today, aged 33 . 'How many people would choose the name Pagnac? Ms Pagnac asked the Star Tribune. But it's the story a private investigator told Amy's parents in 1990 that they believe the most, . The PI came to town and said Amy had been the victim of a sex-trafficking ring, but by the time police had stepped in the ring had already moved on. There's also question's about Amy's health state at the time of her disappearance since she was suffering from migraines and had a seizure previously. 'We had been taking her to the doctor to find out the cause of her health problems but did not have a diagnosis yet, they were still taking tests when she vanished. 'Amy was also showing signs of being bi-polar as well as fetal brain tumor symptoms, but the doctors had ruled out she had a tumor, thank goodness, but they did not know what was wrong with her.' However, they don't believe Amy's health issues would have caused her to run off for 25 years. 'Amy was a very gentle child, who was very sweet and nice to everyone,' her mother said. Ms Pagnac is certain that someone has more information about her daughter, and is hoping they come forward with that information. 'Amy's age-enhanced picture from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children is on their web site so I hope all of the heartache finally ends and we find out what happened to my daughter.'","Amy Sue Pagnac went missing 25 years ago at a gas station while her father used the restroom .

"By . Patricia Shipp . Intoxicated: Fox News anchor Gregg Jarrett was arrested on Wednesday after being brought into custody for refusing to cooperate with police at Minneapolis-St. Paul airport . It has been revealed that troubled Fox News anchor Gregg Jarrett was fueled by a potent cocktail of prescription drugs and vodka when he was arrested at a Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport bar on Wednesday. Admitting to police that he had started drinking at 9am that morning, the troubled 59-year-old journalist was taken into custody at 12.39pm at the Northern Lights Grill in the airport's main terminal. Once in jail, Jarrett, who was carrying papers indicating that he had just been released from rehab, launched into a furious and confrontational tirade at police, repeatedly screaming, 'f*** you', before officers physically restrained and cuffed him. He remained in Hennepin County Jail until around 1:30 a.m. Thursday and was released on $300 bond. Officers arrived at the bar after a bartender called about Jarrett, who appeared to be extremely drunk. Jarrett had only been served one drink and was making another customer feel uncomfortable, admitting to them that he had taken medication before his flight. The Fox News anchor appeared mentally agitated and had trouble replying to any questions asked of him with more than one word answers. Scroll down for video of Jarrett slurring his speech on the air . Reporter: Jarrett, 59, pictured, was booked on a preliminary charge of obstructing the legal process by interfering with a peace officer, which is a misdemeanor . He repeatedly denied any request from officers to see his ID and was clearly swaying wildly while seated at the bar - using his arm to grab the bar to keep from falling off his stool. Described as being in a 'fog', Jarrett's unwillingness to cooperate led officers to taken him into custody because 'he would be unable to properly care for himself.' At this point, Jarrett was not handcuffed and while he was walked to the squad car, he was overhead mumbling 'sorry' over and over. Admitting he had been drinking since the morning, officers searched his bag and found three pills identified as Gabapentin - which is used to treat seizures and bi-polar disorder. Jarrett did not have any prescriptions for the drugs on him and evidence was found that revealed he had just been released from rehab. However, once in custody, Jarrett's mood turned ugly and when he was being evaluated by medical staff he began to scream, 'This is your fault' at the arresting officer. 'His body became rigid and he leaned forward like he was going to jump up on his feet or launch himself off of the bench,' said arresting officer, Mark Dorsey. 'He yelled, 'f*** you!' and at this point, police felt that Jarrett was a danger to himself and others and went to cuff him. Fox News anchor Gregg Jarrett rehearsing, in New York, for the debut of Fox News Radio's five-minute newscast in 2005.

"By . Peter Rugg . Four New Jersey teens face sexual assault charges as prosecutors say they not only attacked a severely intoxicated girl but showed video of the assault to their friends. Craig Howe, 18, Justin Draper, 18, and Ashari Wilson, 18, of Elmwood Park, have each been charged in the case along with one as-yet-unidentified 17-year-old male suspect.

NJ.com reports the girl was discovered by her parents unconscious on the front lawn of their Elmwood Park home with a blood alcohol level more than three times the legal limit at 0.27. She later told police that the unidentified 17-year-old told her they had sex on the night in question. She told police she had no memory of this claim but that she later saw a video of her being sexually assaulted by multiple men while she was intoxicated. Police say the site of the alleged attack is the residence of Howe and Wilson at 100 Falmout Ave. Draper, Howe, and the 17-year-old allegedly penetrated the girl as Wilson filmed it on an iPhone, prosecutors said.

"By . Peter Rugg . Russia is now claiming that it was 'American Secret Service agents' who 'kidnapped' a Russian hacker authorities claim stole credit card information out of U.S. computer systems. Federal prosecutors say the hacker in question, Roman Seleznev, was arrested in Guam this weekend and will be tried in Seattle. Seleznev was called 'one of the world’s most . prolific traffickers of stolen financial information,' by the U.S. Secret Service who claim he is responsible for cyber attacks compromising thousands of credit cards between 2009 and 2011. Valery Seleznev, a Russian lawmaker from Liberal-Democratic Party and father of Roman Seleznev believes his son was kidnapped by the U.S. over hacking charges to trade for Edward Snowden . ABC News reports that Russian authorities say he was kidnapped and taken to Guam. Seleznev was 'forcibly put on a plane of a private airline . company by the American Secret Services and taken to Guam' while returning to Moscow from a vacation in the Maldives, according to the Russians. 'We view this as another unfriendly act by Washington,' the Russian . statement read. The statement went on to warn Russian citizens potentially wanted by the U.S. to be careful while traveling abroad. 'Seleznev was arrested by another country at the request of the U.S. and was taken into U.S. custody following his expulsion from that . country, which acted under its own laws,' a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice told said. Seleznev's targets allegedly included several small businesses like Broadway Grill, in Seattle, where he could steal credit card information . 'He was . advised of his rights and given consular notification. These actions . also were in no way inconsistent with any treaty arrangements with . Russia,' the statement continued, referencing a 1999 agreement for mutual assistance on criminal cases. The suspect's father is reportedly Valery Seleznyov, who is a member of the country's lower house of Parliament. In an interview with the Kremlin's propaganda network, RT, he said he believed the U.S. planned to hold his son to arrange a swap with Edward Snowden, who was granted asylum in Russia in 2013. 'For all I know they may be demanding a ransom tomorrow. Or try to . exchange him for Snowden or somebody. One can only wonder,' he . said. In 2011, Seleznev was indicted for hacking point-of-sale systems at small restaurants and entertainment venues then selling the credit card information he obtained online. One alleged target, Broadway Grill, in Seattle, was forced to shut down after tens of thousands of customers had their information exposed. It's believed he sold stolen data online under the name 'Track 2.' U.S. security officials allege Seleznev is behind attacks compromising thousands of consumer credit cards . He allegedly earned millions of dollars from such schemes, which are now seen as the precursors to hacks at Neiman Marcus and Target. The Secret Service has declined to comment on whether he is a suspect in those cases. Charges include five counts of bank . fraud, eight counts of intentionally causing damage to a protected . computer, eight counts of obtaining information form a protected . computer, one count of possession of 15 or more unauthorized access . devices, two counts of trafficking unauthorized access devices, and five . counts of aggravated identity theft. And in Nevada he faces separate charges for racketeering and two more counts of possessing 15 or more unauthorized access devices. He faces up to 20 years in prison for the first charge and a maximum of 10 years each for each additional charge.","Roman Seleznev was arrested in Guam and will be tried in Seattle .

Officer Tamika Gross, 35, reportedly has a history of fighting and even allegedly pushed her own children to engage in brawls with other kids. Her violent history has been detailed by the Philadelphia Daily News, including a 2009 street fight with another woman while on duty and an incident in 2013 when she brought her suspended 16-year-old daughter to Lincoln High School to fight a 14-year-old girl in an argument over a boy.

The jet pack is powered by a burst of hydrogen-and-nitrogen . In total, the daring flight took 30 seconds to circle the building's roof . The Independent reports that the stunt was a test flight for a future world record attempt off the tallest building in the southern hemisphere. In 2012, Macomber carried the Olympic torch while flying past Leicester's National Space Centre and wearing a jet pack. The machines are propelled by a blast of non-flammable hydrogen peroxide and nitrogen. Nick Macomber has performed several successful flights using the Go Fast team's jet pack . It was impossible to take eyes off Macomber during his stunning take-off, though experts say jet pack travel is far from likely to become a regular mode of transport . In 2012, Macomber carried the Olympic torch while flying past Leicester's National Space Centre . The flight was done in preparation for a record-setting flight attempt scheduled for later this year . While seemingly futuristic, jet packs have captured headlines for decades.

"By . Peter Rugg . Controversial regulations in Sacramento now require all taxi drivers to speak English, and many people who make their living behind the wheel say that could put them out of a job. The City Council passed several new rules requiring drivers to have proof of basic english skills, to drive cars eight years old or newer, and to wear professional clothing. Kazman Zaidi, president of the Sacramento Taxicab Union, called the new regulations unnecessarily restrictive. Scroll down for video . The Sacramento City Council passed several new rules requiring drivers to have proof of basic English skills . 'Maybe they can’t read English, but they can understand, and they can answer the question and where the customer need to go,' he told CBS Sacramento. Zaidi guessed more than 100 of the area's 500 or so drivers would likely not be able to pass their tests regardless of how good they were at their jobs. 'If they don’t pass this english test, they have to lose their job, you know?' Zaidi said. 'And they will be out of business.' Kazman Zaidi, president of the Sacramento Taxicab Union, said the rules would put more than 100 cab drivers out of work . However others said the new rules are only giving customers what they've asked for. 'The whole point is from the passenger’s perspective so that they can . communicate with the driver, and get to where they need to go,' said Sacramento City Revenue Manager Brad Wasson. Tests will be offered in an audio format for drivers who cannot read. 'We want them to succeed,' Wasson said. 'And we want to bring them along so they can . serve public better, and pass the test and thrive.' City officials claim the regulations are a response to customer complaints . Any drivers who fail to comply can be reported to the city. But Zadie still thinks the motives go beyond customer service. 'Why is the city causing trouble for our cab drivers?' he said. 'This is really discrimination.'","Sacramento Taxicab Union president Kazman Zaidi calls regulation 'discrimination'

"By . Peter Rugg . A pair of fetish models who allegedly filmed sex scenes featuring them torturing fish, bunnies, and chickens may never see a day in court because the statute of limitations has expired. Sara Zamora, 28, and Stephanie Hird, 29, performed in the sickening videos roughly a decade ago. A wait that prosecutors say has left them helpless. The pair were arrested in April after PETA found the online sex scenes, but prosecutors never filed the felony animal cruelty charges they would have otherwise faced. Sara Zamora, 28, and Stephanie Hird, 29, allegedly tortured and killed animals in videos for a fetish Web site roughly ten years ago, a wait too long for prosecution under the statute of limitations . The girls claimed they were manipulated into performing by a still at-large video director named Adam Redford . Under Miami-Dade County's state attorney the statute of limitations has already expired. Outside their Thursday court appearance in which the women were set free, Zamora said they were actually victims. 'We were 18 years old and we were manipulated into a situation that we, unfortunately, cannot take back,' she told reporters for Local 10. Zamora and Hird blamed Adam Redford, a South Florida boat captain who they say made the videos for fetish site 'SOS Barn.' The fetish videos were discovered earlier this year by PETA, and and the women could have faced felony animal cruelty charges . Zamora pleasured one man while karate chopping bunnies and slitting a chicken's neck with hedge clippers in one video, while in another Hird crushed live fish with her bare hands, abused rabbits, shot rats, and set a pile of vermin ablaze all while wearing a revealing outfit, the Miami Herald reports. After their arrest, it was reported Zamora faced eight felony charges and Hird five. 'We were manipulated and convinced that these things were alright,' Zamora said. 'And unfortunately they were very wrong and now we have to . pay the consequences, even if it was 10 years ago.' The models called the videos 'wrong' and said they had paid for their roles on the site . Hird added: 'The truth always comes out. I wasn’t guilty from the get-go. Those were other models.' Redford, who is listed as a co-defendant in the case, has not been arrested. 'If you're out there Adam Redford, I hope you get everything you deserve,' Zamora told reporters. As for those who still believe she's tortured and killed animals, Zamora had a message for them. 'They can all go to hell.'","Sara Zamora, 28, and Stephanie Hird, 29, .

"By . John Hall . 'White Widow' Samantha Lewthwaite married into the family of a notorious al-Qaeda commander just three years after her first husband took part in the London bombings, it has been claimed. The 30-year-old mother-of-four, originally from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, is said to have married Kenyan Fahmi Jamal Salim shortly after meeting him in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2008. Salim's brother-in-law was Musa Dheere - a senior figure in East Africa's al-Qaeda affiliated al-Shabaab group, who was shot dead at a roadblock in the in the Somali capital, Mogadishu in 2011. Lewthwaite is now considered to be a senior figure in al-Shabaab herself, having fled Britain in the aftermath of the London 7/7 bombings, in which her first husband Germaine Lindsay and three other men killed 52 people in a series of coordinated suicide attacks on public transport during rush hour. Scroll down for video . Muslim convert: Samantha Lewthwaite, a 30-year-old mother-of-four originally from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, is said to have married Kenyan Fahmi Jamal Salim shortly in 2008 . Forged: Both Lewthwaite and Salim are understood to have travelled to Kenya on fake South African passports - hers in the name Natalie Faye Webb - shortly after the death of al-Shabaab leader Fazul Mohammed in 2011 . Muslim convert Lewthwaite's marriage to Salim brought her closer to his brother-in-law Musa Dheere, according to the Daily Telegraph. The family were said to be slot close-knit that Lewthwaite apparently fled the property alongside Dheere when Kenyan police conducted a raid to break up his terror cell. Dheere was later killed in June 2011 at a checkpoint in Mogadishu alongside Fazul Mohammed - the overall leader of al-Shabaab and therefore the most senior al-Qaeda figure in East Africa. Lewthwaite is understood to have met Salim in Johannesburg in 2008 following an introduction by radical hate cleric Abdullah al-Faisal - who she is said to have visited while he was serving a four year sentence at Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire. According . to a BBC Panorama documentary due to air on Wednesday, al-Faisal . subsequently arranged the marriage between Lewthwaite and Salim because . he 'knew her taste'. Lewthwaite agreed to marry Salim because she wanted 'a young man of a different race, preferably the black race, who . was very handsome and very strong in the Muslim faith,' al-Faisel told the BBC. 'White widow': Samantha Lewthwaite is the widow of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay who killed 26 people in the London Tube train attacks in July 2005 . Links: Samantha Lewthwaite's brother-in-law was Musa Dheere - a senior figure in East Africa's al-Qaeda affiliated al-Shabaab (pictured), who was shot dead at a roadblock in Somalia in 2011 . Samantha Lewthwaite is the widow of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay, who blew himself up on a Piccadilly Line train between King's Cross St Pancras and Russell Square stations. She was the daughter of a former soldier before converting to Islam. The British Muslim convert is linked to the Westgate Mall massacre in Nairobi in which 67 people were killed, and is thought to be hiding in Somalia. Interpol issued a 'Red Notice' warrant for her arrest shortly after the attacks for terrorist offences in Mombasa dating back to 2011. The 29-year-old is the world's most wanted woman after being accused of allegedly ordering the killings of two radical Muslim clerics, two Protestant preachers, and three others with links to al-Shabaab. They are reportedly living in forests and caves and getting milk from nomadic farmers in the region. Both Lewthwaite and Salim are understood to have travelled to Kenya on fake South African passports shortly after the death of al-Shabaab leader Fazul Mohammed in 2011. Lewthwaite's passport was in the name Natalie Faye Webb and Salim's is his believed to be in . the name Marc Costa. Lewthwaite, the widow of 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay, is currently believed to be among those planning revenge attacks following the death of al-Qaeda leader Abubakar Shariff Ahmed. Ahmed was killed by unidentified gunmen in April as he and a friend were walking from a court inMombasa, Kenya to a nearby mosque. Security services now fear she will attack Western-affiliated targets in Africa because she blames the Kenyan government for the death of Ahmed. Ahmed, who had denied meeting Lewthwaite, was suspected of helping more than 100 Britons to join al-Shabaab, which carried out the Westgate Mall shootings in Kenya. Since his death, Kenya has seen a rise in the number of attacks. There have been a number of reports about Lewthwaite's relationship status over the last few years, with various sources suggesting she had wed a number of prominent Islamist militants. Earlier this year it was claimed Lewthwaite has married al-Shabaab warlord Hassan Maalim Ibrahim - who is also known as Sheikh Hassan. #Last year a copy of Lewthwaite's manifesto transcribed into English by one her recruits revealed her plans to wage war on westerners.","Muslim convert said to have married a Kenyan named Fahmi Jamal Salim .

A school at the centre of the Islamist ‘Trojan Horse’ takeover plot has refused to accept the findings of an Ofsted report that claimed it is failing to do enough to protect children from extremism. The report - made public yesterday but . leaked to the Daily Mail on Monday - revealed Golden Hillock, in Birmingham, . was doing 'too little to keep students safe from the risks associated . with extremist views'. It was placed in special measures after . Ofsted noted ‘staff views are polarised’ about leadership and that sex . and relationships education was not taught properly. Denial: Golden Hillock school (pictured) has refused to accept the findings of an Ofsted report that claimed it is failing to do enough to protect children from extremism. The charges were rejected as politically motivated . The charges have been rejected by the school’s management as being . politically motivated. A statement from the school said it disputed the . validity of the inspection. Golden . Hillock secondary school in Sparkbrook is one of three managed by the . Park View Educational Trust - all of which are believed to have been . rated inadequate. A . Trust spokesman said Ofsted found no evidence that Golden Hillock . either promoted or tolerated extremism or radicalisation. It added it . did not accept Ofsted findings that the school was inadequate.’ It . said: 'The Trust does not accept the findings of the Ofsted report, . which mischaracterises the school, and is now challenging it through the . appropriate legal channels.' Golden . Hillock was one of 21 schools inspected after a letter - now widely . believed to be a hoax - referred to an alleged plot by hard-line Muslims . to seize control of governing boards in the city, dubbed Operation . Trojan Horse. The . Trojan Horse letter, which was unsigned, undated and first sent to . council officials and teaching unions late last year, has sparked . several separate investigations including by Birmingham City Council, . West Midlands Police, the Department for Education and Ofsted. In . its statement, PVET, said it believed that the inspections had been . conducted 'in a climate of fear created by the 'Trojan Horse' letter'. Controversy: Park View School, which is at the centre of the Trojan Horse plot allegations, has been accused of segregating women and children during lessons . Inspectors . who visited Golden Hillock concluded that the school was not doing . enough to raise students' awareness of 'risks of extremism', according . to PVET's statement. But . the Trust said it was crucial to note that Ofsted's report contained no . suggestion, or evidence, that the school either promotes or tolerates . extremism or radicalisation. It added . that it disputed the inspectorate's finding that there had been slow . progress in ensuring that staff had been trained in recognising the . signs of radicalisation and how to tailor their teaching to counter . this. And it claimed a finding that students are not being properly prepared for life in modern Britain was a 'misrepresentation'. It said: 'On behalf of the staff, students and parents who have worked so hard to improve their school, we are extremely disappointed to confirm that Ofsted has decided to place Golden Hillock in special measures.' Education: Michael Gove has been accused of 'sitting on' warnings of Trojan Horse plots since 2010 . 'While we support the role of Ofsted in holding schools to account in a fair and transparent way, we wholeheartedly dispute the validity of these gradings. Golden Hillock is categorically not an inadequate school. It is also crucial to note that the school had been part of Park View Educational Trust for just five months at the time of the Ofsted inspection in March 2014. 'A number of the judgments are based on data and information that pre-date the Trust's involvement.' PVET runs three schools, including Park View Academy which has been at the centre of some of the most serious allegations. In the past, Trust chairman Tahir Alam has called the allegations 'a witch-hunt.' Earlier this week, it was revealed that three other schools inspected by Ofsted had been given a clean bill of health. The Birmingham-based schools published letters received from the watchdog which all found governance and leadership to be either good or outstanding - the highest rating available - and concluding that child-safeguarding standards were being met. Ninestiles School - an academy in Acocks Green - Small Heath School and Washwood Heath Academy were the first to publish the results of their inspections, after Education Secretary Michael Gove sent Ofsted in over the Trojan Horse allegations. A separate over-arching report by the head of Ofsted and Chief Inspector of Schools Sir Michael Wilshaw is expected to be published next week, along with any remaining Ofsted reports for the individual schools concerned. Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: 'Gender discrimination, undue influence of extremist views, the school curriculum influenced by hard-line beliefs. This report confirms that Michael Gove can no longer seek to distance himself from this episode. He is responsible.' 'In 2010, Michael Gove was warned by a highly respected Birmingham headteacher that this was going on. Four years on, he has failed to act and has not explained why.' 'Rightly, his record is now being called into question. Rather than rowing with Theresa May, he needs to answer why he has refused to act.'","Golden Hillock school refused to accept 'extremism' claims made by Ofsted .

"By . John Hall . Thousands of travellers are arriving in the small Cumbrian town of Appleby this morning as they prepare to take part in the annual horse fair. The week-long event attracts members of the gypsy community from around the world, and has previously been featured in popular Channel 4 show My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding. However this year's Appleby Horse Fair has already been hit by a row over an 'invasion', as a large number of traveller families have pitched cars, caravans and horse buggies on the town's privately owned golf course. Scroll down for video . Tradition: Thousands of travellers have descended on Appleby in Cumbria for the annual horse fair which has been running since 1685 when James II granted a charter . Occasion: Girls wear their finest attire for the fair which was traditionally a place for marriages to be arranged while the family reorganised their collection of animals . Kitted out: The participants dress up in their gladrags for the event in Cumbria, like this woman who opted for a leopard-print jumpsuit and Timberland boots . Popular: The six-day event attracts members of the gypsy community from around the world, and was recently featured in Channel 4 show My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding . Unconventional: While many arrived in horse-pulled carts, these two neon-clad men decided to make their way in a modern sports car . Part of the fun: The uniformed duo then switched their ride for a pony-drawn trolley to parade the so-called 'mad mile' in Appleby with other travellers . Spectacle: Residents stared as the travellers arrived this morning for the week-long trade event by taking their horses and carts onto the main roads . King James II granted a Royal Charter in 1685 allowing a horse fair to be held 'near the River Eden', and every year thousands of travellers come from around Britain and the rest of the world to take part. The horse fair, which runs from today until next Wednesday, is the largest and one of the oldest fairs of its kind anywhere in Europe. Travellers and horse dealers gather at Appleby, in Westmorland, in the Eden Valley, Cumbria, to meet old friends, conduct business, but primarily to trade horses. Traditionally they bathe the horses in the River Eden before grooming them and riding them fast along the 'mad mile' to show them off to potential buyers. As well as horses, the fair also features market stalls selling food and other merchandise, as well as fortune telling, palm reading and other live entertainment. Activities: With thousands of horses gathered, travellers take them into the lakes surrounding the plush fields between striking deals to buy or sell .

Learning the business: A young traveller and his father bring one of their horses under control.  Every year thousands of travellers gather in the town to trade the animals. Traditionally they bathe the horses in the River Eden before grooming them and riding them fast along the 'mad mile' to show them off to potential buyers . The event remains one of the largest and oldest events in Europe and gives the opportunity for travelling communities to meet friends, celebrate their music, folklore . Tradition: Trevor Jones from the Wirral has a cup of tea as he sits on the steps of his Bow top wagon where gypsies gather to buy and sell horses . Buy or sell: The festival took over the entire town, with horses tied up to barriers along the streets for would-be buyers to have a look at . This girl galloped into the water fully-clothed to give the black and white horse a wash before she takes to the field to barter . Ahead of . this year's fair, pubs and off-licences in Appleby have agreed to limit . opening hours in the hope of reducing anti-social behaviour. It . is thought that up to 10,000 travellers and an additional 30,000 . spectators will arrive in the small town over the next few days. The sheer number of people, plus previous incidents of drink-related disorder, have encouraged local businesses to agree to only serve alcohol between midday and 11pm over the course of the week. Police are out in force to control the event, which caused havoc last year. Pubs and restaurants have agreed to stop selling alcohol at 11pm to quell the hype . While many bring their horses and other fare in wheel-driven caravans, locals cart over the Eden valley in rickety carts that perilously scale the hills . Anger: The Appleby Horse Fair has already been hit by a row over an 'invasion', as a large number of traveller families have pitched cars, caravans and horse buggies on the market town's privately owned golf course. The fair runs until next Wednesday, so it is unlikely the vehicles will be moving anytime soon . Perfect pitch: The arrival of the travellers at the golf course has caused anger among local residents. Every year Appleby suffers from drink-related disorder, anti-social behaviour and a build-up of discarded litter and human waste during the week-long event . Large numbers: It is thought that up to 10,000 travellers and an additional 30,000 spectators will arrive in the small town over the next few days. Ahead of this year's fair, pubs and off-licences in Appleby have agreed to limit opening hours in the hope of reducing anti-social behaviour . Trouble: Police keep a close on those taking part in the Appleby Horse Fair. The event has gained a reputation for violence in recent years, leading to a heavy police presence. Last year officers arrested around 20 people who were on their way to Appleby on suspicion of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm . The Appleby Horse Fair has been held every year in early June since 1685 when King James II granted a Royal charter in 1685 allowing a horse fair 'near to the River Eden'. However many gypsy historians say it has been taking place for at least 500 years with some believing it goes all the way back to Roman times. Originally an event for trading livestock of all types it became known as a specialist horse fair owing to its popularity among gypsy traders. It traditionally begins on the first Thursday after the first Tuesday in June and ends on the following Wednesday. In 1965 Westmorland Borough Council attempted to shut down the event but were forced to back down after a huge outcry. Deals are made by one-to-one bartering rather than a traditional auction and are clinched with a slap on the hand. Robin . Hooper, Eden District Council's chief executive, said: 'A great deal of . preparation has gone into the planning of this year's fair to help . people enjoy the event safely.' 'This . work includes pubs and off licenses signing up to a voluntary charter . and having the street cleansing operation in place throughout the fair, . so that the impact of this event on the local community is minimized as . much as possible,' he added. With its rolling hillsides and lush green pastures the countryside around Appleby is some of the most beautiful in Britain. But last year's event was blighted after some of the travellers left piles of rubbish, including used nappies and broken bottles strewn around hedges and fields prompting a flurry of complaints from locals. With bin bags, cardboard boxes and scraps of food lining the hedgerows and roadsides, local people and the authorities faced a massive clean-up operation. Many were left furious with the mess left behind with some accusing Eden District Council of not doing enough to clean up. One irate local described the scene as being like 'an open sewer' claiming the portable toilets were overflowing. The man, who did not wish to be named, said: 'They got serviced once a day. 'They are filthy and overflowing. You wouldn't let your dog use them.' Mr Hooper said that, in response to these concerns, Eden District Council has allocated additional street cleaning facilities both during the fair and to assist the clean-up operation afterwards. The event has also gained a reputation for violence. Last year police arrested around 20 people who were on their way to Appleby on suspicion of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm. That followed a series of bare knuckle brawls in 2011 when several arrests were made. The 2009 event saw over 100 arrests mostly for drunkenness, drugs and disorder with police seizing cocaine, cannabis and 127 ball bearing guns. 27 of the arrests were made after rival gangs were involved in a mass brawl. Entire clans come together to the specialist horse fair, where deals are made by a slap on the hand and a simple exchange of livestock . Thoroughfare: Horses were not the only animals to sweep the Cumbrian town - this woman, and many others, also brought household pets such as dogs . Despite the cast-over weather, travelling and Romany crowds flocked to the fields to parade their caravans, a tradition dating back to 1685 .

"By . John Hall . Victim: Keith Murrain is believed to have been killed within hours of arriving in Jamaica . A prominent British businessman who was kidnapped shortly after arriving in Jamaica has been found dead with his throat slit. The body of Keith Murrain, 54, was discovered in a shallow grave in a remote sugarcane field outside Spanish Town, which has been dubbed the murder capital of Jamaica. The Birmingham-based businessman arrived on the island on Friday but was abducted and bundled into a waiting vehicle as he left Kingston's Norman Manley Airport. Mr Murrain, who lived in Edgbaston, is believed to have been killed within hours of being kidnapped. The father-of-three's body was found in a sugarcane field outside Spanish Town less than 24 hours later. Mr Murrain's close friend Howard Reid, a Birmingham barrister, said: 'Whoever did this are scum, filth, savages and I hate them. I curse them, I really, really do.' ''The savagery, the lack of humanity, the coldness... To look a man in the eye and cut his throat. I really do hate them,' he added. Mr Murrain was travelling away from the capital Kingston's Norman Manley Airport in a hire car when he was abducted and bundled into a waiting vehicle. It was unclear whether he was robbed before he was killed. Mr Murrain had built a thriving business exporting engineering parts to Jamaica and Trinidad. He was a regular visitor to the island, where he reportedly had a home in the gated Caribbean Estates Community, said to boast 'Fort Knox-esque security'. Reports from the island said police were following up several leads over the killing, but his family in Aston said they could not understand why he had been murdered. Mr Murrain's mother Josephine, along with his three brothers and two sisters, are being comforted by West Midlands Police liaison officers. Mourning: Keith Murrain's friends and family are pictured at home after his murder. From left to right are family friend and barrister Howard Reid, brother Samuel, sister Jenifer, mother Josephine and brother Niney . Location: Keith Murrain's body was discovered in a shallow grave in a sugarcane field near Spanish Town (pictured) which has been dubbed the murder capital of Jamaica . One sister, Jenifer Murrain, said: 'We, as a family, want justice. Why kill him? Why not just rob him? I want the people who did this to hang'. 'What happened to Keith will have a major impact on people doing business or going on holiday to Jamaica,' she added. Everyone knew Keith and everyone looked up to him. He was the life and soul of the party. When his body is brought back, it will be the biggest funeral Birmingham has ever seen,' she went on to say. Mr Murrain's mother, originally from the Caribbean island of Montserrat, is now trying to fly to Jamaica with her son's former partner. She has been in contact with the British High Commission in Kingston, which has pledged to provide police protection during her time in the Caribbean. Anger and confusion: Keith Murrain's sister Jennifer (pictured left, alongside her mother Josephine) said: ''We, as a family, want justice. Why kill him? Why not just rob him? I want the people who did this to hang' In 2005, Jamaica - which retains the death penalty - had the world's highest murder rate, with 1,674 killings: a staggering 58 per 100,000 people. In 2011, the island, with a population of 2.7million, endured 1,124 murders, 1,322 shootings, 738 rapes and 3,033 robberies, the US Bureau of Diplomatic Security revealed. Following the killing, a senior officer in Jamaica's police force urged those flying back to the island to be careful who they inform of their journey. 'Crimes committed against people returning to the island are often organised by people who know them and the time and date of their return,' he added. A Foreign Office spokesman said: We are aware of the death of a British national in Jamaica and are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time'.","Keith Murrain, 54, was found brutally murdered in a remote sugarcane field .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A hairdresser with a rare brain tumour claims she is plagued by robotic voices similar to Daleks. Katie Barnes was terrified of the Doctor Who characters as a child, but now whenever someone speaks to the mother-of-three, she hears the tinny sounds. The 46-year-old noticed something was wrong when she started to lose her hearing in April 2012. She started to suffer constant ringing in her left ear, making it harder to hear her customers while she was cutting their hair. Katie Barnes is plagued by robotic sounds similar to Daleks from the programme Doctor Who, after being diagnosed with a rare brain tumour . The mother-of-three was terrified of the Doctor Who characters as a child, but is now surrounded by noises resembling Daleks every day whenever someone speaks to her . Months later she claims she started to hear robotic sounds every time someone spoke to her. Mrs Barnes, who was also suffering from pain all over her body, was first diagnosed with fibromyalgia - a long-term painful condition. But when she began to lose her balance, she went back to her GP and was referred for an MRI scan. It revealed the hairdresser had an extremely rare brain tumour, called an acoustic neuroma. Doctors have managed to shrink the tumour and are hoping they can keep it under control, concerned about the risks if they had to operate. But her balance and hearing will be affected for the rest of her life and she has been forced to quit her job. Mrs Barnes, of Northfleet, Kent, said: 'I had a constant ringing in my left ear and everyone sounded like Daleks. 'I was terrified of the Daleks as a child and I used to have to run and hide under my bed. Now I have to hear them all the time. 'It was bearable because I still had my good ear. But if I blocked the right ear, it genuinely sounded like I was in an episode of Dr Who - it made me think I was going deaf. 'For a while when I put my phone on my ear I just thought it was a constant bad line and I even changed my phone.' But when she began stumbling and suffering from poor balance, she knew something was wrong. The 46-year-old has had gamma knife radiosurgery, where blasts of radiation are directed at the tumour to stop it growing while the head is held tightly in a clamp, pictured . 'It was like I was constantly on a boat,' she said. 'I was told it was an acoustic lesion, or an acoustic neuroma, and I laughed, I didn’t know what it was. 'I Googled it and found out it was, thankfully, the least deadly tumour you can have.' A neuroma is a growth of tissue which is not usually cancerous. But when it is an acoustic neuroma it can lead to other life-changing symptoms. An acoustic neuroma is a benign non-cancerous tumour in the brain. It growns on the acoustic nerve, which helps to control hearing and balance. The acoustic nerve runs alongside the facial nerve, which carries information from the brain to face muscles. A small acoustic neuroma can cause problems with: . A larger tumour can cause multiple symptoms, including: . Every year around 20 people in every million in the population are diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma. They tend to be more common in women than men and those aged between 40 and 60 years old are most often affected. After a 'watch and wait' programme, doctors noticed her balance had become significantly worse and her tumour was rapidly growing. Mrs Barnes, who is mother to Rebekah, 20, Thomas, 19, and Jacob, 14, underwent gamma knife radiosurgery at The London Gamma Knife Centre in January 2014. The procedure involves blasts of direct radiation to the tumour to stop it growing while the head is held tightly in a clamp. Thankfully, Mrs Barnes was told at the end of last month the tumour is shrinking and she can get her life back on track as her symptoms lessen. Unfortunately doctors told her that despite the tumour shrinking her balance and hearing will be affected for the rest of her life. She is now struggling to look after Rebekah, who suffers from syringomyelia - a cyst in her spinal chord which leaves her bound to a wheelchair. Mrs Barnes, who lives with husband Paul, 46, said: 'It seems to have improved since I was told it was shrinking, a hearing aid has stopped the ringing and I’m able to stand and move around. 'Unfortunately everyone still sounds like a Dalek but I will just have to get used to that. 'The tumour is benign lbut it’s just on the edge of my brain stem so it’s going to be watched very closely. 'If it does seem to suddenly start growing I will have to have surgery, and with it being so close to the brain it could leave me paralysed facially. 'It shows brain tumours come in many different disguises and I had no idea that something like a hearing problem could be the sign of one.' Mrs Barnes, who now relies on walking stick to get around, is starting a university degree in humanities in October despite her condition. She is raising money for the British Acoustic Neuroma Association, by taking part in a number of fundraising pamper days, where her friends will provide massages, and manicures.","Katie Barnes was diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma, a benign tumour attached to the nerve which controls hearing and balance .

"By . John Hall . The writer of Quirke, the latest BBC drama to face complaints over inaudible, mumbled dialogue, has admitted watcing the programme with the aid of subtitles. Andrew Davies - one of the UK's best known screenwriters, whose work includes Pride and Prejudice, House of Cards and Bridget Jones Diary - said he and his wife struggled to hear what the actors were saying, and required the assistance of subtitles to follow what was going on. Quirke, which stars Gabriel Byrne and Michael Gambon, is the latest BBC series to experience mumbling actors and poor sound quality, after Jamaica Inn was hit by the same complaints. Mumbling cast: Writer Andrew Davies said even his familiarity with the script of Quirke - which stars Gabriel Byrne (left) and Michael Gambon (right) - wasn't enough to follow what was happening on screen . Davies, 77, adapted Quirke from the books by Booker Prize-winning author John Banville, but said that even his familiarity with the script wasn't enough to follow what was happening on screen. Settling down to watch the programme at their home in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, Davies and his wife of 53 years, Diane Huntley, needed to read along with the dialogue in order to make sense of it. 'She said, ""Do you mind if we have the subtitles on?"",' Davies explained to RadioTimes.com. 'It's a funny thing, mumbling. It's a bit to do with actors, a bit do with with modern, flat-screen televisions and both my wife and I are of an age where our hearing is beginning to go,' he added. Inaudible: Andrew Davies (pictured) said he and his wife struggled to hear the dialogue during Quirke . Last week, a BBC spokesman said it had 'received complaints from some viewers unhappy with the sound quality during Quirke'. 'We appreciate that some viewers experienced problems with the sound when watching Quirke,' he added. 'A wide range of factors can influence audibility and we are looking into why this should be and whether there are any steps we can take to improve the experience for the audience for episode two...We will continue to work with others in the television industry on this important subject.' Davies said part of the problem with the sound may be that Quirke's production staff are so familiar with the script that they subconsciously fill in the mumbled lines when they listen back during editing. 'I could hear it because I knew what the words were. And I think that's often the problem with the people in the production... When you know what the lines are, there's a tendency to think you've heard them alright whereas if you didn't know the thing, maybe you wouldn't,' he said. Viewers watching the crime drama have reported having to turn the volume on their television sets up to the maximum setting, while others simply gave up and switched off. Set in 1950s Dublin, Quirke follows the city’s chief pathologist as he investigates a murder. But it seems many of the 4.2million who watched the first episode in the three-part series struggled to follow the action, with TV presenter Richard Madeley leading the complaints on Twitter. Anger: TV star Richard Madeley was one of the viewers to vent his fury about the sound quality during Quirke . Not the first time: The sound problems come after another BBC drama, Jamaica Inn (pictured), generated more than 2,000 complaints about 'incoherent mumbling' Madeley blamed the BBC’s sound editing, tweeting: ‘Was really looking forward to Quirke, BBC1, 9pm – but despite winding volume up to 100 per cent, still can’t hear at least a third of dialogue! Again!' He later added: ‘And it’s definitely the programme – switched channels and sound boomed out massively loudly. Back to Quirke, and inaudible. Grrrrrr!!!!’ The sound problems come after another BBC drama, Jamaica Inn, generated more than 2,000 complaints about ‘incoherent mumbling’ when it was broadcast in three parts of the Easter weekend.

"By . Emma Glanfield . More than 22,000 troops in the British Army have been found to be overweight over the last three years, new figures reveal. Serving personnel who have been deemed overweight are putting themselves at risk of a host of health problems – including Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and shortness of breath. The figures, released by the Ministry of Defence, also reveal how a total of 32,419 male and female soldiers have failed the Army’s basic fitness test – which includes press-ups, sit-ups and a run – over the last three years. More than 22,000 troops in the British Army have been found to be overweight and at risk of health problems over the last three years, new figures reveal (file picture) The statistics, which are from March 2011 to March . this year and include troops who may have served on the front line at Camp . Bastion in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, state that 29,600 men and 2,819 women failed the standard personal fitness assessment. The MoD states that servicemen under the age of 30 must be able to do 50 sit-ups within two minutes and 44 press-ups within the same period of time, as well as a 1.5mile run in under 10 minutes and 30 seconds. Female troops in the same age bracket must be able to complete 50 sit-ups, 21 press-ups and run the 1.5mile stretch in 13 minutes or less. Once a year, troops are also expected to take part in an eight-mile march - carrying a rucksack weighing up to 25kg - and complete it within two hours. All service personnel in the British Army must complete the personal fitness assessment twice a year, and any troops who fail must retake the test within seven days. Repeated failures could result in disciplinary action which could eventually lead to a soldier being discharged. The MoD said 50 troops had been dismissed from the army for obesity since 2002. One senior officer blamed poor diet for the obesity levels and said overweight servicemen and women could be found up and down the country. He told The Sunday Times: ‘Part of the problem is the appalling diet many soldiers have. ‘While soldiers can have salads and low-calorie meals, they can also have a cooked breakfast, followed by chips at lunch and chips at dinner and a stodgy pudding too.’ All service personnel must complete a personal fitness assessment twice a year, and any troops who fail must retake the test within seven days. Pictured: A young soldier attempts an exercise course at Sandhurst . Mo Ahmed, 32, a former serviceman who is now the owner and founder of Army Boot Camp Fitness, said all those who serve in the army should be able to complete the physical test. He said: ‘If you stay on top of your fitness you should really be able to pass. If I’m honest, it’s not unbelievably hard. ‘It is average level, you don’t need to be superhuman to complete it. ‘To be a soldier you need to be extremely fit and robust and should be able to deal with any sort of physical challenge. ‘I think a lot more people should be passing it and not failing.’ 'It’s their job to be fit and well to look after our country.' - Professor David Haslam . Mr Ahmed, who also serves as a firefighter for East Sussex Fire and Rescue service, said large amounts of food on offer at army bases could be responsible for some troops letting their fitness levels slide. He said: ‘There is a big culture of eating in the army. ‘You want to load the calories in for energy levels but that’s all good and well when you’re training lots and staying on top of your fitness but if you’re not doing anything, that’s where the problem lies. ‘It’s definitely an issue.’ The former soldier, who served in the 16 Air Assault Brigade, also said those who serve for the country should want to take pride in their fitness. He said: ‘On a personal level, I think all of those in our forces should have higher fitness levels including police and firefighters. ‘I find it disappointing to see soldiers who’ve let themselves go and are not taking pride in their fitness. ‘I firmly believe you should look after yourself and keep on top of your fitness levels all of the time. ‘You realise the public might see some soldiers in their beret and uniform, perhaps at a service station or somewhere, and see they’ve let themselves go a little and they will wonder “Is that what the British Army is nowadays?"" ‘It’s not good in that sense.’ A Ministry of Defence spokesman said the figures represented only a small number of troops serving between March 2011 and March this year and said training and support was offered to all service personnel (file picture) Professor David Haslam, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said the figures were ‘worrying’. He said: ‘It’s their job to be fit and well to look after our country. It’s a necessity. ‘When a group of professional soldiers are being looked after by fitness and nutritional specialists, they really should be able to ensure they are fit and healthy. ‘The inability to do simple fitness test is a worry. It seems to me that it’s one of the most basic parts of their role, the tools of their practice.’ However, a Ministry of Defence spokesman said the figures represented only a small number of troops and said training and support was offered to all service personnel. He said: 'This figure represents 11 per cent of the Army serving in that period and many of those who failed will have subsequently passed their fitness test. 'All personnel are provided with the support and training necessary to meet the Army’s physical standards, with additional help for those personnel who fail to meet this criteria. 'Personnel who remain unable to meet the standard could ultimately be discharged.'","Overweight service personnel at risk of health problems including diabetes .

The news came as Nasa moved to calm fears that a comet is on a collision course with our planet. The plans for a test mission to stop an asteroid from colliding with Earth come from Nasa’s cousin, the European Space Agency. Rescue plan: The European Space Agency is planning mission Don Quijote - to blow up a huge asteroid that could potentially be hurtling towards Earth . In the Hollywood movie Armageddon, Bruce Willis attempts to blow up a huge asteroid hurtling towards Earth. In real life, the mission, called Don Quixote, will see two spacecraft launched. One will be fired at an asteroid  at . break-neck speed in an attempt to push it off its course. The other will . analyse data with the aim  of informing future missions in which the . future of mankind may be at stake. One potential target for the test . mission is a 1,600ft-wide asteroid called 99942 Apophis, which has a . tiny chance – around one in 250,000 – of hitting Earth in 2036. Nasa scientists yesterday took the . unusual step of officially dismissing claims sweeping the internet that . comet Elenin, discovered by an astronomer last December, is on a deadly . course. Brucey bonus: Armageddon starred Bruce Willis as the leader of a team of astronauts who destroy an asteroid that threatens to wipe out Earth . Scare stories include the comet . plunging the Earth into darkness for three days by blocking out the sun, . colliding with Earth, moving tides or continents and throwing the . planet off orbit. It is even claimed that a fleet of . UFOs are streaking towards us in the comet’s wake, and that Nasa has . conspired with media organisations to create a news blackout on the . comet to avoid mass panic sweeping the world. But the space agency said  Elenin will . never come closer to Earth than 22million miles and will not compromise . our planet in  any way. An official said: ‘The truth is that . Elenin has received much more attention than it deserves due to  a . variety of internet postings  that are untrue.’",Plan is similar to the plot of Hollywood film Armageddon .
"By . Aap . Members of the notorious Brothers 4 Life gang will face court next month over a range of shooting charges. NSW detectives last week arrested Nazir Akbari, 28, who is accused of shooting a man, 30, and a woman, 22, who were in a car parked outside a Wentworthville swimming pool, in Sydney's far west, in July 2013. One of the shots hit the driver's door and grazed the man's leg, police allege . Akbari, who is already in jail on other matters, was charged with discharging a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, among other charges. Three men who are alleged supporters of the Brothers For Life gang leave Burwood court following a brief appearance by a gang member who is charged with the attempted shooting of a man as he sat in his car outside Wentworthville public swimming pool a year ago . An alleged supporter of the Brothers For Life gang holds his fingers up as he leaves Burwood Local Court on Monday July 14 after one member of the gang's Blacktown, Sydney chapter appeared on a charge of the attempted shooting of a man in Sydney's west in July last year. Six members of the same gang are due to face court in relation to a home invasion in Penrith in October last year, in which a man was threatened and his dog shot and wounded . NSW Police made dawn raids and swooped on addresses in western Sydney following a series of shootings and gun crimes, placing several men in custody. A 28-year-old man was charged at Long Bay Correctional Centre last week and appeared briefly in Burwood Court on Monday, July 14 after which the men (pictured) left the court, allegedly supporters of the accused . His shooting matter was briefly mentioned in Burwood Local Court and he will reappear before the same court on August 25. He did not appear via video link. Six other members of the Brothers 4 Life Blacktown chapter were also charged on Monday with new offences over a home invasion in October 2013. Police allege the gang forced their way into a home in Castlereagh, in Sydney's greater west, threatened a man in his bedroom, shot his dog and fired several shots into the floor. The 26-year-old victim escaped and the dog recovered from its injuries. Police arrest a member of the Brothers For Life gang in a 2012 dawn raid in Sydney.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . People who claim to be concerned about global warming are in fact the ones using more electricity, according to a recent study. The research claims that these same people are often in denial about how much energy they use and widely underestimate their consumption. Those concerned about climate change use more than 1,500kw/h of extra electricity each year, the study found. People who claim to be concerned about global warming are in fact the ones using more electricity, according to a recent study . Commissioned by the UK Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC), the study used data on the electricity use of 250 families over a year. The results could partially be due to age demographics, with the over 65s shown to be more careful with electricity while also being less worried about climate change, according to a report by Matthew Holehouse in the Telegraph. When pensioners were discounted from the study, scientists found only a 'weak trend' to show those who talk reducing reliance on fossil fuels do anything to reduce their energy need. This graph shows the difference in electricity usage of people who strongly agree climate change is too far into the future to worry about and those that strongly disagree, tend to agree, are undecided or have no opinion. The labels in red show the number of households that fell into each category . Earlier today, advisors to DECC said the UK will fail to meet its targets to cut greenhouse gases over the next decade without stronger and more ambitious policies . Emissions from agriculture threaten to keep increasing as global meat and dairy consumption increases, according to a report release earlier this year. If agricultural emissions are not addressed, nitrous oxide from fields and methane from livestock may double by 2070. This alone would make meeting the climate target essentially impossible. 'We have shown that reducing meat and dairy consumption is key to bringing agricultural climate pollution down to safe levels,' said Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden. 'Broad dietary change can take a long time. We should already be thinking about how we can make our food more climate friendly.' By 2050, estimates indicate that beef and lamb will account for half of all agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, while only contributing three per cent of human calorie intake. Cheese and other dairy products will account for about one quarter of total agricultural climate pollution. The study suggests a different approach needs to be taken if people are to reduce their energy consumption. The researchers wrote: 'Taken all together, householders who strongly agreed they were not worried about climate change because it was too far in the future in fact used less electricity rather than more, counter to the hypothesis that households concerned about climate change use less electricity. 'However, we found this was largely due to the effect of age, as older households were much more likely to agree with this statement, and also had lower energy consumption. 'When we separated the pensioner households from the younger ones, there was no significant relationship between this statement and energy use in the pensioner group, and only a weak trend among younger households.' Earlier today, advisors to DECC said the UK will fail to meet its targets to cut greenhouse gases over the next decade without stronger and more ambitious policies. The Committee on Climate Change highlighted failures in policies such as improving the energy efficiency of homes, where the installment of insulation has plummeted since new schemes were introduced last year. Under current rates of progress, the country is set to cut its emissions by around 21 per cent to 23 per cent between 2013 and 2025, well short of the 31 per cent set out in the ‘carbon budgets’. The Obama administration, meanwhile, has pledged to cut its emissions by 30 per cent by 2030, and will be pushing each country to adopt their own ‘aggressive’ targets to do their fair share at G20 in November.","Study was done by the UK Department for Energy and Climate Change .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Millions of people gazed up at a moonlit sky last night to witness an incredible astronomical phenomenon. With cameras at the ready, sky watchers around the world were treated to the sight of a perigree moon, more commonly known as a supermoon. One photographer in London was able to capture not only the stunning lunar surface, but also a mysterious-looking dark object as it floated by. Photographer and Co-founder of group travel company The Flash Pack took these pictures of the moon around 11.30pm BST on Sunday night and was amazed to see a black object (ringed in red) flying from the right side to the left of the moon . Lee Thompson, photographer for group travel company The Flash Pack, took these pictures of the supermoon around 11.30pm BST last night. ‘I captured the image from my back garden in Brixton using an 800ml Canon lens,’ Mr Thompson told MailOnline. ‘At first I thought it was an aircraft as it was moving from right to left at the same sort of speed you’d expect from a plane.' Mr Thompson added that he believes it may be some sort of satellite shown up by an unusually bright moon. What is this mysterious object? Colin Stuart, an astronomer at Royal Observatory Greenwich, said at first sight it is plausible the dark object is the International Space Station. But he added, that if the image was from London, then it is unlikely it is the ISS . The mysterious object travelled from the right to the left hand side of the moon. Mr Thompson added that he believe it may be some sort of satellite illuminated by the unusually bright moon . The supermoon is not the technical term for the full moon. Astronomers call this phenomenon a 'perigee moon,' which describes the full moon that occurs when the moon is at its closest point to Earth each year. Perigee marks the closest point of a body as it orbits around Earth, while apogee marks the farthest point from Earth. However, . Dr Ilian Iliev, a reader in Astronomy at Sussex University claims the . most likely explanation for the shadow is the International Space . Station. 'The shape is slightly strange, however, there could be something docked to it at the moment,' he said. Astronomy and physics writer, Colin Stuart, said at first sight it is plausible the dark object is the International Space Station. But, he added, that if the image was taken from London, then it is unlikely it is the ISS. ‘Looking up ISS visibility for the UK in July shows that it doesn't make an appearance above London until the 19th,’ he said. He added the most logical explanation is that it is a satellite, which often pass in front of the moon. The supermoon rises over houses in Olvera, in the southern Spanish province of Cadiz . Looming lunar: The supermoon captured over Kansas in the Midwestern U.S. Glorious: The moon over the Oregon Convention Center in Portland . A supermoon occurs when the moon is 30,000 . miles closer to Earth than the farthest point in its orbit making it look bigger and brighter than usual. In fact, it is just an optical illusion caused by its position in the sky. It is not that uncommon. Last year we had three although only one made the news. This year we will also have three supermoons with the next occurring on August 10 and then on September 9. It is the . one in August that moon fans are really looking forward to with glee and . anticipation. The moon will be 863 miles closer than last night’s. Geoff . Chester at the US Naval Observatory said: ‘I guarantee that some folks . will think it's the biggest moon they've ever seen if they catch it . rising over a distant horizon, because the media will have told them to . pay attention to this particular one.’ Silhouette: The castle of Somoskoujfalu (left), 123 kms northeast of Budapest, Hungary.

The waxing gibbous moon is viewed from Whittier, California. The supermoon happens when the moon is 30,000 miles closer to Earth than the farthest point in its orbit . The ‘Moon Illusion’  is probably what will make people remember this coming set of full moons, more than the actual view of the Moon itself, he said. The illusion occurs when the moon is near the horizon. For reasons not fully understood by astronomers or psychologists, low-hanging moons look unnaturally large when they beam through trees, buildings and other foreground objects. When the moon illusion amplifies a perigee moon, the swollen orb rising in the east at sunset can seem super indeed. 'There's a part of me that wishes that this 'super-Moon' moniker would just dry up and blow away, like the 'Blood-Moon' that accompanied the most recent lunar eclipse, because it tends to promulgate a lot of mis-information,' admits Dr Chester. 'However, if it gets people out and looking at the night sky and maybe hooks them into astronomy, then it's a good thing.'

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Richie Vallance, a 35-year-old father, found what he believes to be space rocks scattered near to Henley Green Primary School, in Wyken Croft, Coventry . A sharp-eyed father believes he has found parts of a meteorite which have crashed to Earth in Coventry. Richie Vallance has discovered dozens of odd-looking rocks and, having done his own research, is convinced that they are not of this world. The 35-year-old found the rocks scattered near to Henley Green Primary School, in Wyken Croft, last week and also further afield. With the help of advise on the Nasa website, the father of three conducted some tests at home and is keen to find someone who can back up his theory. Nasa claims there are a number of signs that could suggest whether a rock is in fact a meteorite. For instance, meteorites contain at least some metal. Nasa claims if you see the metal shining on a broken surface you may have a meteorite. Those meteorites that do have a lot of metal tend to be very dense compared to regular rocks. Many meteorites also contain iron-nickel metal grains or are made up largely of iron-nickel which can attract a magnet. Mr Vallance's discovery came just days after a fireball, believed to be a meteorite, was caught on film by the dashboard camera of a police car near Solihull. The footage was filmed in the early hours of Monday June 30 and the meteorite was reported to have also been spotted across England and over the border in Wales. Scroll down for video . 'I’ve been doing some research and they pass lots of the tests,' said Mr Vallance. 'You can see the metal running through the rocks, there’s iron running all over it and magnets even stick to it' The magnetic rocks were discovered in Coventry last week by Mr Vallance . Mr Vallance said: 'I’ve always been fascinated by space and what’s going on out there and I’m hoping that someone can help me to verify this. ‘I found them all around the area near the school and when I found these I felt my heart really start going. 'I’ve been doing some research and they pass lots of the tests. You can see the metal running through the rocks, there’s iron running all over it and magnets even stick to it. 'Also when you cut in to it, it is shiny inside and not dull like a normal stone is. 'There have been some meteorites that have gone over us recently and I just want to find out exactly what it is as it has baffled me. 'I’ve found some other stones before that are really interesting to look at but they are just slag, which is common around here and looks similar, but it comes from the steel works that used to be around here.' Metal - Meteorites contain at least some metal. If you see the metal shining on a broken surface you may have a meteorite. Density – Those meteorites that do have a lot of metal tend to be very dense compared to regular rocks. Magnetic properties – A lot of meteorites contain iron-nickel metal grains or are made up largely of iron-nickel which can attract a magnet. Chondrules – Primitive meteorites have little round pieces of stony material in them. These little round pieces are called chondrules. Fusion crust – . When a meteorite falls through the atmosphere, it begins to heat up. This causes the outer surface to begin melting, producing a thin . black/brown coating on the surface of the rock. ‘Thumbprints’ – . When the surface of the meteorite begins tomelt during entry into the . atmosphere, some areas of the meteorites are eroded by the melting more . than others. This leaves a small dents in the surface of the rock, making it look like someone put thumbprints into clay. Mr Vallance is now hoping to find an expert who can verify his find. Because meteorites are relatively scarce, they are priced and sold by the gram. Depending on their quality and type, iron meteorite prices are generally in the range from 30p to £3 per gram.","Richie Vallance has found odd rocks near Henley Green Primary School .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . The devastating droughts that are plaguing southern Australia are caused by greenhouse gases and ozone depletion - and they will only get worse. This is according to a new high-resolution climate model by a U.S. government-based organisation which warns the cause was not due to natural events but man made. Southern Australia has seen a decline in the amount of autumn and winter rain since the 1970s with the decline increasing in pace over the last four decades. Scientists showed that the decline in rainfall is largely a response to man-made increases in emissions. Pictured are changes in fall-winter rainfall from observations (top panel) as compared to model simulation of the past century (middle panel), and a model projection of the middle of the 21st century . Climatologists claim droughts are predicted to get much worse with a further 40 per cent decrease in rainfall in the southwest around Australia's fourth city Perth by the end of the century. 'This new high-resolution climate model is able to simulate regional-scale precipitation with considerably improved accuracy compared to previous generation models,' said Tom Delworth of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. 'This model is a major step forward in our effort to improve the prediction of regional climate change, particularly involving water resources.' The study by the U.S. government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration conducted several climate simulations using the global climate model to study long-term changes in rainfall in various regions across the globe. Parts of Australia have been gripped by devastating drought and heatwaves in recent years.In March, the World Meteorological Organisation said record high temperatures in 2013 would have been 'virtually impossible' without human emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases . Simulating natural and man made climate drivers, scientists showed that the decline in rainfall is largely a response to man-made increases in greenhouse gases as well as a thinning of the ozone caused by man made aerosol emissions. Several natural causes were tested with the model, including volcano eruptions and changes in the sun's radiation. But none of these natural climate drivers reproduced the long-term observed drying, indicating this trend is due to human activity. The model predicts a continued decline in winter rainfall throughout the rest of the 21st century, with significant implications for regional water resources. The drying is most severe over southwest Australia where the model forecasts a 40 per cent decline in average rainfall by the late 21st century. The devastating droughts that are plaguing southern Australia are caused by greenhouse gases and ozone depletion - and they will only get worse, according to the computer models . The drying is most severe over southwest Australia where the model forecasts a 40 per cent decline in average rainfall by the late 21st century . Mr Delworth said: 'Predicting potential future changes in water resources, including drought, are an immense societal challenge. 'This new climate model will help us more accurately and quickly provide resource planners with environmental intelligence at the regional level. 'The study of Australian drought helps to validate this new model, and thus builds confidence in this model for ongoing studies of North American drought.' Parts of Australia have been gripped by devastating drought and heatwaves in recent years. In March, the World Meteorological Organisation said record high temperatures in 2013 would have been 'virtually impossible' without human emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. The 2013-2014 summer saw sweltering temperatures in Perth, in the southwest, and Adelaide, in the south, while Sydney went through its driest summer in 27 years, an independent watchdog, the Climate Council, said. While the latest study suggests global warming is damaging Australia, separate research last month claims the solution might lie down under. Dryland ecosystems such as deserts play a more important role in the global carbon cycle than previously thought, the study revealed. And one of the biggest contributors, responsible for a huge spike in the amount of CO2 absorbed in 2011, is located in Australia. The findings suggest that the Australian Outback, when exposed to increased rainfall and in turn grows more vegetation, could become a giant 'carbon sink' and might even be a major driver for global carbon absorption. However, researchers warn it is not a complete solution to the problems caused by what they believe to be man-made climate change. Montana State University faculty member Ben Poulter and his collaborators explained their findings in the journal Nature.

"By . Joel Christie . Oklahoma man Desmond Campbell was identified last week by police as wanted in at least seven assaults cases. Authorities linked him to 10 counts of sexual assault - including rape in the first degree and rape by instrumentation - as well as seven counts of burglary and six counts of robbery. A possible assault against an eight woman was pending, with all occurring between June 5 and June 29 in Tulsa. After naming the 30-year-old at a press conference last week, police said their suspect was actually in a critical condition at Saint Francis Hospital, according to 2NEWS. Karma?: Desmond Campbell, 30, was wanted over seven assaults on women in Tulsa, Oklahoma, when he crashed his car and died . The 30-year-old was wanted a total of 23 charges, including 10 sexual assault complaints, seven burglaries and six robberies . According to KJRH, Desmond Campbell, 30, was in critical condition and unresponsive following a car crash June 29 . Campbell’s car hit a light pole on I-44 about 10 minutes after the most recent assault was reported on June 29, just minutes after the most recent alleged assault. There were no other vehicles involved. Campbell later died in hospital. Following the crash, police used DNA to connect Campbell to the crimes he was wanted over, according to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigations. Search warrants also show police found some of the victims’ belongings in the wreck of Campbell's car. A source told 2NEWS Campbell was pronounced dead at 11.23am. Will autopsy is expected to completed on his body on Wednesday. However toxicology results may not be available for another six to nine weeks.

Tulsa County DA Tim Harris informs press on Tuesday that Desmond Campbell is dead . Following the crash, police connected Campbell using DNA, according to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigations . None of the crimes will be processed now that Campbell is deceased. 'The death of Mr. Campbell isn't going to provide any justice for these victims in a criminal court of law,' assistant DA Steve Kunzweiler said.

The couple are now engaged after Mr Nawalit took his partner to the Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, on the pretence that he had won a competition for a free tour. But once there he surprised her with the proposal - surrounded by onlookers including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg. Mr Nawalit, 32, got down on one knee in the middle of Hacker Square and said: 'When people ask us how we met, we say ""mutual friends"". And today you meet your mutual friends. 'Nafis, I love you very much. You're my best friend. Will you marry me?' Mr Nafalis arranged for the message 'Nafis, will you marry me?' to appear on a screen in the square . Miss Joon at first looked a little surprised to see the message on the screen . She then covered her face with her hands as the full realisation of what was happening set in . To the delight of onlookers, she said 'Yes'. Mr Kawalit told ABC News: 'It was funny how I jumped on the social network to catch up with long-lost friends and ended up meeting the love of my life.'

"By . James Rush . A Somerville school teacher has been charged with having a sexual relationship with a 13-year-old student. Alexandra Romanos, a fifth-grade teacher at East Somerville Community School, has been held on $50,000 bail after pleading not guilty yesterday to two counts of aggravated rape of a child and three counts of indecent assault and battery on a child. Police were tipped off to the alleged assaults in late June by the victim's mother after she became aware of inappropriate electronic messages between the two. Alexandra Romanos has been charged with having a sexual relationship with a 13-year-old student . An investigation found the teacher allegedly initiated a sexual relationship with the child in late March, myfoxboston.com has reported. Authorities say the alleged assaults took place both on and off school grounds. Romanos has been placed on administrative leave and barred from the school. If she makes bail, she is not allowed to contact the victim or the victim's family and cannot have unsupervised contact with children under 16. She will also have to stay away from the Somerville School system, wear a GPS device and remain under house arrest. Romanos, a teacher at East Somerville Community School, has been held on $50,000 bail after pleading not guilty yesterday to two counts of aggravated rape of a child and three counts of indecent assault and battery on a child . In a statement released yesterday, Somerville Public Schools said: 'Nothing we can say will soften the impact that such news has on a community, particularly one as dedicated to nurturing and supporting our youth as Somerville. 'We are repulsed and angry that someone who made an oath to uphold the highest moral standards in the execution of her responsibilities as a teacher and a role model has allegedly blatantly violated that trust.' According to CBS Boston, Romanos has worked at the school for seven years.","Alexandra Romanos charged with having sexual relationship with 13-year-old .

"By . Matt Blake . This is the moment the captain of the South Korean ferry which capsized two weeks ago abandoned ship in his underpants - leaving hundreds of passengers, mostly children, to drown with the ship. Lee Joon-seok, 68, was in charge of the Sewol, which was carrying 475 passengers when it turned sharply and later sank on April 16. Yet, as this video shows, he was one of the first to escape. The death toll currently stands at 188, with 114 people believed to be still missing. Scroll down for video . Abandon ship: Apparently wearing no trousers, Lee Joon-seok, 68, is seen clambering over the heavily-listing vessel's rails as he is helped onto a lifeboat while the ferry is still above water . Saving himself: He is then helped onto a life raft leaving hundreds of passengers behind . Apparently without wearing any trousers, Lee is seen clambering over the heavily-listing vessel's rails as he is helped onto a lifeboat while the ferry is still above water. A second video that emerged today shows some of the people on the Sewol ferry as it began to sink. Broadcast on the South Korean national TV network JTBC passengers are heard saying: 'Wow, it's tilting a lot. We're tilting to this side. Can't move.' And: 'You think I'm really gonna die? What's going on?' A teenage boy on the vessel captured these desperate moments on cell phone video. The teen's father gave the network the footage after authorities recovered his son's body and found the cell phone. Its memory card was still intact, JTBC reported. At a press conference today, two Coast Guard members defended their rescue of Lee, insisting they didn't know it was him. Capt. Kim Kyung-il said: 'No, absolutely not. I didn't find out until later. During the rescue, people were just dropping from the ferry ... falling into the sea.' Masked and handcuffed:  Lee Joon-Seok is led to a prosecutor's office in Mokpo yesterday. Meanwhile, South Korean authorities today arrested three people on suspicion of destroying evidence connected to the sinking of the ferry . Coast Guard member Kim Yong-ki said it was difficult to tell the difference between crew members and passengers, adding: 'Everyone was wearing life vests so we couldn't tell who was crew or who was a passenger. 'The life vest covers the uniform. We could see the sleeves but in that situation we are not thinking about that.' Lee and 14 crew members have been arrested, accused of negligence and of failing to help passengers in need. Doomed: This photograph shows just how badly the ferry was listing when the coastguard crews made their way to the vessel . It has since emerged that he initially told passengers to stay in their rooms and took half an hour to issue an evacuation order, by which time the ship was tilting too severely for many people to get out. After his arrest he said that he withheld the evacuation order because rescuers had yet to arrive and he feared for passengers' safety in the cold water. Meanwhile, South Korean authorities today arrested three people on suspicion of . destroying evidence connected to the sinking of the ferry, CNN reported. They also raided a Coast Guard office in Mokpo - the office that handles emergency calls - as part of an investigation into how officials handled the first plea for help from a passenger. They are looking into possible dereliction of duty, said Yang Joong-jin, the chief prosecutor in Mokpo. The office received the first distress call from the ship when an 18-year-old boy dialed the 119 emergency number, the report said. State-run news agency Yonhap reported: 'According to a transcript of the recording, a Coast Guard official asked the student to provide the latitude and longitude of his location, sparking criticism that authorities wasted crucial minutes before starting a rescue operation. Arrest: Lee Joon-seok, centre, was pictured being led towards a court in Mokpo, south of Seoul, following his arrest . Safest way to travel? Captain Lee Joon-seok says he believes ferries are the safest form of transport 'as long as passengers follow the instructions of our crew' in a 2010 promotional video .

The . mobile phone containing the audio files was found among the belongings . of a teenage boy whose body was recovered from the ferry. The memory card on the phone was still intact, with the boy's father handing it over to South Korean news network JTBC, who later shared it with CNN who were able to translate the audio file. The voices heard on the audio appear to be aware the ferry is listing, telling each other it was getting difficult to move because 'it's tilting a lot', according to CNN. Another voice can be heard shouting: 'Mum, dad, dad, dad! What about my younger sibling?' Search: It comes as an audio file recovered from a mobile phone belonging to a teenage boy who died in the disaster revealed the panic among passengers when they realised the ship was sinking . Tragic: Mourners wait in long lines amid drizzling rain to pay tribute to the victims of the ferry Sewol's sinking at a joint incense-burning altar set up at the Ansan Olympic Memorial Hall in Ansan, near Seoul . Yesterday . divers renewed their search for the bodies still trapped inside the . ferry after weekend efforts were hindered by bad weather, strong . currents and floating debris clogging the ship's rooms. Authorities now say they have narrowed down the likely locations of most of the remaining missing 100 or so passengers. Divers . found only one body yesterday after a week that saw an increasing . number of corpses pulled from the ship as divers made their way through . its labyrinth of cabins, lounges and halls. Senior . coastguard officer Kim Su-hyeon said most of the remaining missing . passengers were believed to be in 64 of the ship's 111 rooms. Divers . have entered 36 of those 64 rooms but may need to go back into some . because floating debris made it difficult for divers to be sure that . there were no more bodies. Ko . Myung-seok of the emergency task force said 92 divers were searching . the ferry. He said the government was making plans to salvage the ferry . once search efforts ended. South . Korea's prime minister resigned yesterday over the government's . handling of the sinking, blaming 'deep-rooted evils' in society for the . tragedy. South Korean executive power is largely concentrated in the president, so Chung Hong-won's resignation appears to be symbolic.

"By . Matt Blake . Murdered: Rohan Gucchait, a pupil at the All Saints High School in Mumbai, was kidnapped more than a week ago by an electrician hired by his father, a jeweler, to wiork on the family home near Mumbai . A murder-kidnap gang are facing the death penalty in India after the dismembered body of a 12-year-old-boy was found near a flower market. Rohan Gucchait, a pupil at the All Saints High School in Mumbai, had been kidnapped more than a week ago by an electrician hired by his father, a jeweler, to work on his house. Ishtiyaq Sayyed Shaikh, 37, spent 11 days masterminding a plan to kidnap the boy in return for ransom, painstakingly plotting the family's movements from a secret vantage point that overlooked their home. But the plan went awry when he phoned the boy's parents to demand 5,000,000 rupees (£50,000)... only to find they were already reporting their son's disappearance to police. Rather than give himself up and release the boy, Sheikh ordered his accomplices to strangle him instead and chop the body into pieces with an electric saw. They then scattered the boy's body parts about APMC flower market in Kalyan, near Mumbai. All five men now face the death penalty after they were arrested and charged with kidnap and murder. The abduction took place at around 11am on April 17, when Shaikh arrived on a motorbike at the housing complex in which the Gucchaits lived telling Rohan his father wanted to see him at his shop. He already knew the boy would be home alone because he had been charting the family's movements for over a week. CCTV later captured Shaikh driving out of the complex with Rohan riding pillion. About two hours later, the two stepped into a sports shop, police said, where Shaikh bought a cricket bat for Rs1,400 and told Rohan to check it outside, where his four accomplices lay in wait. Gruesome: Rather than give himself up and release the boy, Sheikh ordered his accomplices to strangle Roshan instead and chop the body into pieces with an electric saw. They hid his body parts around the APMC flower market in Kalyan, near Mumbai . Callous: The AMPC flower market is a bustling hub of local trade . They grabbed the boy, bundled him into a van and drove away. But the kidnapper had not expected Rohan's parents to go straight to the police when their son did not return home. Tragically, by the time Shaikh made the ransom call, Mr and Mrs Gucchait were already at the police station. Shaikh learned that he was being hunted by detectives when the parents returned home, overhearing a conversation from his spy position. So, that same night, he arranged for the boy to be killed. His body parts had been scattered about several locations, all near the flower . market. The parts were then recovered after Shaikh made a full . confession. Police said the electrician turned killer was driven by greed and plotted his crime over 11 days, carefully plotting the movements of the boy and his family. It was Shaikh who had told the boy he was wanted at his father's shop, and kidnapped him on the way, they said.","Rohan Gucchait was strangled and chopped to pieces with an electric saw .

"By . Matt Blake . Mystery death: Rodick Andrew Reymond appeared to have been killed by a blow to the head. His hands and feet were tied and a catalogue of injuries - including what appeared to be cigarette burns - were found on his arms, head and face . A murder hunt has been launched in India after a British tourist's badly-beaten and decomposing body was found wrapped in a carpet, stuffed into a plastic bag and dumped by the side of a road. Rodick Andrew Reymond, 40, appeared to have been tied up, tortured and beaten to death, police said, before his remains were covered in blue polythene bags and left outside a shop in south Delhi's Bhogal neighbourhood. His remains were only found when locals raised the alarm yesterday, complaining of a foul smell emanating from a bag. A police spokesman said: 'We originally thought that it was somebody possibly from Africa, because the body had been in the plastic bags for some days and the skin had turned black. 'But we then found a passport on the body which was also in a bad condition but it was possible to read that the man was a British national.' When police opened the bag they found Mr Reymond's hands and feet were tied and a catalogue of injuries - including what appeared to be cigarette burns - to his arms, head and face. A murder investigation has now been launched as detectives await the results of a post mortem examination. Police said Reymond appeared to have died of head injuries. 'It appears that he was hit in the head with a heavy and blunt object,' a police source told The Indian Express. 'His body was then stuffed into the plastic bag. It also appears that he was stubbed by a cigarette or his skin burnt with a lighter. Nothing is, however, clear as the post-mortem report is not out. The exact cause and time of death will be clear once the report is out.' He added that it appeared Mr Reymond was a tourist staying at one of the many guest houses in the area and had apparently visited Chennai, Mumbai and Goa before coming to Delhi. 'We are on the case and are trying to gather as many details about him. It appears to be a case of personal enmity, but it is too early to say . anything. We are investigating the matter,' the officer added. Dumped: His body was found in a plastic bag dumped by the side of a road in Delhi . A police source told The Hindu newspaper: 'Preliminary enquiries revealed that initially many of the locals . thought the bag belonged to someone in the area who would come and . collect it later, while others mistook it for a garbage bag. 'Later, the . bag was opened after the shopkeeper, outside whose premises the bag was . dumped, came to open the shop. By then the locals had also become . suspicious as a foul smell had started emanating.' Police said there were currently looking at CCTV cameras in the area to identify the person who dumped body, adding that they suspect the killer or killers could . be familiar with the area, as they had dumped the body on the roadside . only after local guards had clocked off for the day. Police confirmed that they had been in touch with the British High Commission and Foreign Regional Registration Office to ascertain details about the victim. A foreign office spokesperson said: 'We can confirm the death of a British national in India on April 28. We are in touch with the Indian authorities and are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'","Rodick Andrew Reymond's remains discovered in Bhogal, south Delhi .

"By . Matt Blake . Spanish government vessels have unlawfully entered British territorial waters around Gibraltar more than 600 times since the start of 2013, according to official figures. There were 496 incursions in 2013 and 112 in the first three months of 2014, the figures disclosed by Foreign Secretary William Hague revealed. The busiest month for incursions was August last year, when 68 Spanish vessels entered British Gibraltar waters at an average rate of more than two a day. Illegal incursion: The busiest month for incursions was August last year, when 68 Spanish vessels entered British Gibraltar waters at an average rate of more than two a day . A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'The Royal Navy challenges Guardia Civil and other Spanish state vessels whenever they make unlawful maritime incursions into British Gibraltar territorial waters. 'We back this up by making formal diplomatic protests to the Spanish Government about all unlawful incursions. Our challenges and protests make clear that such incursions are an unacceptable violation of British sovereignty. 'We are confident of UK sovereignty over British Gibraltar territorial waters under international law. We make our position clear to the Spanish Government whenever appropriate and we will continue to uphold British sovereignty and use a range of proportionate naval, police and diplomatic responses to incidents.' The Spanish Ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Office earlier this month after an incursion resulted in a collision with a Royal Gibraltar Police vessel. Angry: Gibraltar has accused Spanish authorities of causing border tailbacks in retaliation for its decision to drop concrete blocks into the sea to create a reef for fish (pictured: drivers push their cars to save fuel at the border crossing between Spain and Gibraltar) No backing down: Europe Minister David Lidington told ambassador Federico Trillo that the . UK Government would take 'whatever action we consider necessary' to . uphold British sovereignty and protect Gibraltar . Europe Minister David Lidington said the activities of the Spanish state research ship and its accompanying Guardia Civil vessel had not only been 'unlawful' but were also dangerous. He told ambassador Federico Trillo that the UK Government would take 'whatever action we consider necessary' to uphold British sovereignty and protect Gibraltar. The summoning of Mr Trillo marks the fourth time the Spanish ambassador has been publicly called in to the Foreign Office in relation to Gibraltar since the current government in Madrid took office in December 2011.

The Rock has been a long-running cause of friction between London and Madrid, with Spain maintaining a long-standing challenge to Britain’s sovereignty over the territory, which it has held since 1713. Tensions flared again last summer after the Gibraltarians dropped concrete blocks into their waters in order, they said, to create an artificial reef - although the Spanish claimed the move was designed to disrupt their fishing boats. Madrid retaliated by imposing strict border controls at the crossing between Spain and Gibraltar - a move denounced by Britain as politically-motivated - leading to long tailbacks.","There were 496 incursions in 2013 and 112 in first three months of 2014 .

Curtis told Sports on Earth that the first accusation against him broke . on his 3-year-old's birthday, and the second on that of his his . 11-year-old. He said he was arrested on the day of his 19-year-old's . graduation. Curtis is carried off the field after his game 3-winning home run, the defining moment of his career . Curtis hugged his wife (pictured here in the courtroom) and children after the verdict was read . He then claimed: 'Now, is that coincidental? Or is that someone looking at your personal file and deciding to mess with you?' Before the judge handed down his . sentence, Curtis gave a long and rambling statement - lasting more . than an hour - in which he denied the assaults, accused the girls of . propositioning him and said he led prison inmates at Barry County Jail . to Christ. The two-time World Series champion . was set to become the Lakewood High School’s head football coach last . fall, but resigned when the allegations were made public. During . his statement he accused all of his victims of lying and said that one . day he would write a book with one of the girls that 'would benefit . millions of people', adding, 'the truth will set her free'. As he told the judge he was the one who . told the girls he would not engage in a romantic relationship with them, . his victims stormed out of the courtroom. His . 16-year-old victim who testified that he touched her private areas and . fondled and kissed her breasts, made a statement prior to sentencing . before a packed courtroom that included Curtis’ wife, MLive reports. 'I, . myself, kept giving you a chance to walk away from the monster you'd . become,' she said. 'As a Christian, I don’t hope for any bad things to happen to . you. I hope for good things. I hope you admit what you’ve . done to God and yourself.' Curtis connects on his game-winning home run against the Atlanta Braves in the 10th inning of game 3 of the 1999 World Series . Another said: 'There was a time I believed you to be a man of high morals and . integrity. That time is long gone. Now, a little over two years later, I . have a better view of who you really are. You are a manipulator and a . perpetual liar.' Curtis played 10 seasons during his big league career. First coming up with the then-California Angels in 1992. The outfielder then moved on to the Detroit Tigers, Los Angeles Dodgers, Cleveland Indians, New York Yankees and Texas Rangers. He won two World Series rings with the Yankees in 1999 in 2000 – famously hitting a game winning walk-off home run in the 10th inning of game three of the 1999 World Series, his second of the game. Curtis retired from professional baseball in 2001 at the age of 32. The soon-to-be convict was previously athletic director at another school district before being dismissed for reasons unknown, which Curtis explained as differences with the administration. When the allegations were first made public, the devout Christian asked his community to pray that the case ‘would be resolved in a way that is honoring God'.","Chad Curtis was convicted in December of sexually assaulting three girls .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . and Matt Blake . The skydiver who fell to her death in Arizona as she tried to break a world record has been named as a 46-year-old German from Berlin. Diana Paris was among 220 parachutists attempting to become the largest group to free-fall from an airplane in formation when her parachute malfunctioned, sending her plummeting to her death in Eloy at 7.30am yesterday. Her husband told police the experienced skydiver had completed 1,500 jumps over her career. Skydive Arizona blamed the accident on a malfunctioning parachute that . was released too low to the ground to allow a reserve parachute to fully . open. She was declared dead at the scene. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Diana Paris was among 220 parachutists attempting to become the largest group to free-fall from an airplane in formation when her parachute malfunctioned, sending her plummeting to her death in Eloy at 7.30am yesterday . Drop: The woman died after her parachute malfunctioned as she fell through the sky with the other divers (pictured on Tuesday). She was unable to pull her reserve parachute in time . In a statement on its website, Skydive Arizona paid tribute to its 'dear friend' and vowed to continue its attempt to break the record in Mrs Paris' honour. 'The whole team met after this accident and amid the hugs and tears . agreed to create a special jump, a missing man (sector) formation . skydive, to honor their fallen friend,' it read. 'It is always a difficult decision for the organizers to make after a . tragedy, but the team as a whole has decided to keep moving towards the . record.' It continued: 'However it will no longer be a two point 222-way.  It will be a . 2 point 221-way.  Our dear friend can not and will not be replaced. The group will continue to hold the slot open in the skydiver’s honor.' 'It had nothing to do with the size of the group or the aircraft,' World Team spokeswoman Gulcin Gilbert said. 'It was a malfunction of the parachute.' The accident occurred on Thursday during an attempt to break a world record for what is called a 'formation jump'. A group of 220 people from 28 countries free-fall from about 18,000 feet, then come together in a formation before separating and doing another formation before pulling their parachutes. The skydivers jumped at such a high . elevation that they needed oxygen masks in the airplane, and they . hurtled through the air at speeds of more than 100 mph. Attempt: A group of 220 people from about a dozen countries were part of the record attempts this week . Practice: Ahead of the attempts this week, the World Team practiced a dive on the ground, pictured . The group did not complete the formation and therefore did not set the record on Thursday. World Team organized the event at Skydive Arizona, one of the nation's top skydiving locations. Skydivers cried and hugged each other and prayed after they learned of the death. Skydive Arizona in Eloy has been the site of other skydiving deaths in recent months. Two skydivers - from Germany and the United Kingdom - died in November as their parachutes collapsed and they fell to their deaths during an attempt to set a jump record. The previous record was carried out in Florida with 110 people in November 2013, according to Skydive Mag.","Diana Paris' parachute malfunctioned during the dive on Thursday and her reserve parachute did not have time to open .

"By . Matt Blake . The far-right porn star sacked from Germany's neo-Nazi NPD party when they found out she made a film with a black man has now been banned by the porn industry... because she is a neo-Nazi. Ina Groll, who works under the porn . name 'Kitty Blair', had been widely featured in a high-profile campaign . by the National Democratic Party of Germany (NDP), encouraging men to join the group by standing outside polling stations dressed in revealing outfits. But when party chiefs saw her latest porn film they were horrified to see her having sex with a black adult actor and sacked her as the face of the party. Now, according to German porn industry spokesman John Thompson, who is also boss of the Berlin porn film company 'GGG', there had been a unanimous decision to boycott the blonde actress. Sacked: Ina Groll (pictured, left, taking a selfie and, right, as her porn alias, 'Kitty Blair') was fired as the face of the country's National Democratic Party - because she has sex with a black man in her latest porn film . Porn star: Ms Groll had been widely featured in a high-profile campaign by NDP, which was founded in 1964 . He said: 'In the porn film industry, . we welcome participants with all skin colours, and all nationalities, . but we don't welcome Nazis. If we had known about her political . activities, we would have sent her home straight away.' The . porn industry ban follows on from a ban from using her in promotional . stunts for the far right National Democratic Party of Germany (NDP) or . from appearing at events with senior NDP officials, after she was found . to have had sex with a black man in her latest porn film, 'Kitty . Discovers Sperm'. Representative: She encouraged men to join the party by standing outside election polls dressed in revealing outfits. Above, Ms Groll poses with a member of the NDP, which is widely perceived as a neo-Nazi organisation . Confident: But the model has now been fired after NDP officals watched her film, titled: 'Kitty Discovers Sperm' The NDP . leadership had apparently been happy to use images of the 28-year-old . blonde in their various campaigns and promotional material until then, . believing she would lure male fans to vote for the NDP. She . became friends with many of the senior neo-Nazis in the country and . senior NDP officials but all that changed when one of the men sat down . to watch one of her videos - and was horrified to find she was having . sex with a black man in the film titled 'Kitty discovers Sperm'. Once . the fact was made public a Facebook page was even formed to get rid of . Groll from the party. One wrote: 'Those who sell their body for money . and disgrace their race have no place in our party.' Posing: Ms Groll was sacked following a number of lengthy discussions and a NDP party meeting . The . matter was also raised with senior NDP officials and after a party . meeting it was decided that the political group would sever all ties . with Groll, who goes under the porn name of Kitty Blair. Another . German porn industry insider, Axel Schaffrath, who was the former . partner of top German porn star Gina Wild, said: 'The popular view is . that she needs to be locked up, no one needs someone like her with her . perverted view of the world. She . certainly has no chance of filming any more porn movies after her Nazi . links were revealed. I personally advised the producers to keep her as . far away as possible, people like her need to be ignored by everyone. Founded in 1964, the NDP identifies itself as Germany's 'only significant patriotic force'. The party, widely perceived as a neo-Nazi organisation, is currently represented in two of the country's 16 state parliaments.

"By . Matt Blake . Hand(set) in hand: Earning the right to keep his beloved BlackBerry was one of Barack Obama's first major political victories when he walked into the White House . For years they were the most photographed power-couple in U.S. politics, always together, hand(set) in hand. But after a long and faithful companionship, Barack Obama may finally be about to call time on his relationship with his beloved BlackBerry for a younger model... a touch-screen Android smartphone. The military unit responsible for White House communications is testing a batch of new handsets for use by government staff, it was revealed today. And one of the most likely replacements is an Android smartphone such as the Samsung Galaxy with beefed-up security to better cater for the U.S. president's phone and web-browsing needs. 'We can confirm that the White House . Communications Agency, consistent with the rest of the Department of . Defense, is piloting and using a variety of mobile devices,' a Defense . Department spokesman told the Wall Street Journal. He declined to . comment on the devices in the pilot test or in use at the White House. But . the suggestion that Obama may have fallen out of love with his . BlackBerry months ago when it was revealed in December he had asked if . he could switch to an iPhone but was turned down amid 'security . concerns'. However, his dream of using an iPhone for his voicecall and web-browsing needs will remain unfulfilled after it was revealed the White House is only testing phones from Samsung and LG, which both run on Google’s Android operating system. He is still, however, allowed an Apple iPad for reading, a source confirmed. A . Samsung spokesman declined to comment on whether its phones were being . tested at the White House. 'We have seen strong interest from the . government sector and are working closely with various agencies to . deploy pilot programs,' he said. Government . orders have long bolstered BlackBerry’s revenue, but as the company’s . market share continues to wane, those contracts are becoming harder to . secure in spite of BlackBerry's best efforts. True love: After years of faithful companionship, the U.S. president may finally be about to call time on his relationship with the button-laden BlackBerry (pictured together with wife Michelle in 2011) CEO . John Chen held talks with the White House earlier this month in a bid . to shore up support for the smartphone through the U.S. corridors of . power, Bloomberg reported. BlackBerry shared closed down 1.3 per cent yesterday on the NASDAQ, trading at $10.61. The company laid off more than 30 per cent of its employees last autumn after posting nearly $1 billion in losses. In 2009, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said a compromise had been reached to allow the president to use the BlackBerry to keep in touch with senior staff and some personal friends. He did not say with whom the compromise had been struck. Gibbs said Obama will limit its use, and that security has been enhanced to protect his communications. Downfall? The BlackBerry (left) has seen its share of the mobile phone market dwindle in recent years while Android phones, such as the Samsung Galaxy (right), have enjoyed a surge in popularity . Trouble ahead: BlackBerry shares closed down 1.3 per cent yesterday on the NASDAQ, trading at $10.61 . Previous presidents chose not to use e-mail because it can be subpoenaed by Congress and the courts, and may be subject to public records laws. Gibbs said the presumption from the White House counsel's office is that the e-mails will be subject to the Presidential Records Act, which requires the National Archives to preserve presidential records. But he also said some exemptions in the law allow for 'strictly personal communications.' He did not say how that classification would be determined, but made clear that the device could be used for both business and personal exchanges. Obama's BlackBerry has been a constant companion, and he had noted publicly that he was negotiating to find a way to keep it despite security concerns and records-keeping issues. Gibbs said that Obama believes using the device will help him escape the 'bubble' that surrounds the president.","Barack Obama had to fight for his BlackBerry when he entered White House .

"By . Matt Blake . A 40-year-old man who murdered his mother, sister and her children because she was stopping him from being with his 'one true love', the actress Selena Gomez, has been ruled unfit to stand trial. Daniel Green, from Oklahoma City, will instead be sent to the Oklahoma Forensic Center in Vinita in the hope he may regain his sanity and face a jury for the crime. He is accused of shooting dead his mother, Sallie Green, 57, his sister, Rebecca Cizek, 34, and her children, 16-year-old Katherine Cizek and six-month-old Amario Dominguez III in August last year. Following their deaths, detectives found Green's Facebook page to be littered with pictures and posts about Gomez, including many that suggested he was fantasizing about an imaginary relationship with the Disney star. In one message, he wrote: ‘I want Selena to be my eternal wife and the queen of my kingdom forever. Hey, I love her more than God, my momma, my dad, Jesus, myself and y’all.' 'One true love': Daniel Green (left) believed he was in a relationship with Disney star Selena Gomez (right) and that his family were stopping the imagined union from flourishing . After his arrest, he told police he had to get away from his family members because they were stopping him from being with his 'one true love', the affidavit states. He was arrested near a 7-11 store a couple of hours after a family friend raised the alarm at around 11pm after finding bloody footprints on the doormat, and the bodies. The state medical examiner said Mrs Green and the baby died of gunshot wounds to the head. It has not yet been revealed how Ms Cizek and her teenage daughter died, according to The Oklahoman. Helicopters were used to search for Green and police circulated his description to nearby stores after neighbors told them the 40-year-old was often seen pacing the sidewalk and buying energy drinks. 'This person is obviously significantly troubled, then that frustration and those problems may build up to the point that he felt like he had no other options,' Dr Steven Sternlof said. He added that although he had not met Green or treated him, he could recognize the warning signs, News 9 reported. Victims: The bodies of Green's sister Rebecca Cizek (left), her daughter Katherine, 16, and six-month-old son Amario (together, right)  were found in the Oklahoma City home they shared with him . Crime scene: The family's bodies were found inside this home by a friend who lived with them . Troubled mind: His Facebook page was littered with pictures and posts about Disney star Gomez, including many that suggested he was fantasizing that he was in a relationship with her . 'Someone that may have an obsession, in this case with a celebrity, might have a compulsion to respond in a certain way, thinking that this celebrity is in love with them or they're in love with the celebrity and they need to be close together, and they may need to stop others that are interfering in that relationship,' Dr Sternlof said. In his Facebook posts, Green makes constant reference to Gomez and posted a threat against her celebrity boyfriend in October 2011, saying: 'Justin Bieber is going to get a bullet in his head'. Neighbors claimed Green often spoke to them about his past lives or was seen talking to himself, according to NewsChannel 4. Young love: Gomez has been in an on-off relationship with pop star Justin Bieber since 2011 (pictured together at the Teen Choice Awards in 2012) Shocking: Daniel Green holds the baby he is accused of shooting in the head . One of his alleged victims, Katherine, had been due to start her sophomore year at Del City High School on Monday. A statement from the school district said: 'The faculty and staff of Mid-Del Schools is mourning the loss of one its students today, Katherine Cizek, Del City High School sophomore. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to the family during this time of tragic loss.' The Sonic drive-in, where her mother had worked, also released a statement expressing its grief at the loss of Ms Cizek, who had worked for them for 15 years.","Daniel Green arrested after friend discovered bodies and bloody footprints .

"By . Mark Duell . and Matt Blake . A Swedish man who once was considered a psychopathic serial killer has been freed, after authorities found that his eight murder convictions were based on false confessions. Sture Bergwall was convicted of eight murders in a series of trials from 1994 to 2001 - despite there being no forensic evidence or witness statements - and confessed to more than 30 killings in total. But the 63-year-old later recanted his confessions, saying that he made them to get attention and drugs, and prosecutors dropped the final murder charge in July last year. Freed: Sture Bergwall was convicted of eight murders in a series of trials from 1994 to 2001 - despite there being no forensic evidence or witness statements - and confessed to more than 30 killings in total . Yesterday, a court in Falun, Sweden, ordered his release from a secure psychiatric unit where he has been held since 1991 - ruling that he should continue to receive care, but no longer in a closed unit. Each of Bergwall’s convictions was overturned after prosecutors said they had no other evidence linking him to the deaths, some of which may not even have been murders. ‘He has been detained for 20 years in a locked psychiatric clinic. It is a miscarriage of justice,’ said his lawyer Thomas Olsson, adding that they will now start looking at whether to seek damages. Bergwall had been kept at the mental institution until now, waiting for a verdict on whether his mental health was good enough to let him out. His case is one that has gripped Sweden for years. Unexplained: Bergwall claimed he killed 17-year-old Norwegian Trine Jensen (left) in 1981, and strangled prostitute Gry Storvik (right) in 1985 . The Government launched a commission of inquiry last November looking into possible shortfalls in the legal system that may have resulted in Bergwall's convictions. Outside: Each of Bergwall's convictions was overturned after prosecutors said they had no other evidence linking him to the deaths . He relished his reputation as . 'Sweden's answer to Hannibal Lecter' and would happily regale anyone in . ear shot with stories of murder, mutilation, rape and cannibalism. His . tales of how he strangled, stabbed, defiled and mutilated his victims . captivated and horrified his homeland, cementing his standing as . Sweden’s most prolific and deranged serial killer. Some victims he claimed he stabbed, others he strangled and one he beat to death with a rock. Some he said he raped, others he chopped up and one he even claimed to have eaten. But what was constant throughout all his gruesome confessions was the detail with which he described the murders: how he killed them, where he killed them, even their last words. He managed to hoodwink judges, psychiatrists, journalists and the Swedish public, until he decided to make his most staggering confession of all: that he had made it all up. His near forensic knowledge of many of the murders convinced detectives and prosecutors that he must have committed the crimes. Nobody bothered to find out that he had studied the killings during regular trips to a local library on day trips from the asylum. Bergwall, a convicted sex offender and bank robber who at the time had changed his name to Thomas Quick, had already been locked up in the Sater hospital for a botched bank robbery. 1976, Charles Zelmanovits, 15 . He claimed to . have picked the teenager up in his car by the side of a road. After . persuading him to engage in a sexual act he said he strangled him, . abused the body and cut it up with a saw in nearby woods. He said he . took a leg as a souvenir. 1980, Johan Asplund, 11 . He spotted Aspland by the side of a . road and asked to check if he had run over a cat. When the boy bent over . he smashed his head against the door and dragged him into his car. He . drove the boy into the countryside, where he sexually assaulted then . strangled him. He buried some of the organs, put the hands on the car's . front seat, the head, legs and torso in plastic bags. He said what he did no't throw out of the window he took home and ate. 1981, Trine Jensen, 17 . After beating and raping her, he said he strangled her with the strap of her handbag . 1984, Marinus and Janny Stegehuis . The . Dutch couple were on a camping holiday. He said he stabbed the husband . through the tent canvas and clambered inside. He described the attack in . extraordinary detail, accurately numbering how many times each victim . was stabbed. 1985, Gry Storvik, 23 . He made the Norwegian female prostitute strip before he tortured her, and he described how she vomited as he strangled her. 1988, Israeli student, Yenon Levi, 24 . He . said he and an accomplice took the tourist, who was seeing relatives, . to a holiday home in the woods and killed him when he tried to escape. 1988, Therese Johannesen, nine . The . Norwegian girl was waiting at a bus shelter for a downpour to end when . he pulled her down a slope and bashed her head against a rock. he later . told how disappointed he was that she was not a boy. He said her last . words were: 'Mummy, mummy'. He then dismembered and buried her, returning . a year later to burn the remains. Police later found a bone fragment . that matched that of a young girl that appeared to have been cut by a . sharp instrument in the spot he identified. It was there, during a series of therapy sessions which he says were so uninteresting that he felt a failure even at that, that he realised for the first time how to make people sit up and take notice of him. He told GQ magazine in an interview last August how when he said his heavily-pregnant mother had walked in on his father sexually abusing him at the age of ten, the therapist's interest sparked up. Such was the shock at what his mother had seen, he claimed, that she miscarried the baby onto the bedroom floor. He told how the next day his father took him to bury the dead foetus in nearby woodland. As the therapist listened intently to his tale, for the first time he felt important. And within weeks he was telling staff he was behind one of Sweden's most famous unsolved murders - that of 11-year-old Johan Asplund whose torso alone was found in 1980. As the months drew on he confessed to a host of other murders including that of a 15-year-old boy in 1976; a 17-year-old girl in 1981; Dutch husband and wife in 1984; a 23-year-old female prostitute in 1985; and an Israeli student and a 9-year-old Norwegian girl in 1988. Of those eight murders he was convicted, despite claims of a lack of real evidence. Retrials were ordered in each case, but prosecutors said that without the confessions they didn't have enough evidence to go back to court. Last July they dropped the final case, which involved the death of 15-year-old boy who disappeared in northern Sweden in 1976. Bergwall was convicted in 1994 of murdering the boy, even though there was no technical evidence linking him to the crime and the cause of death could not be established. The lack of evidence to support the confessions led to some doubts over Bergwall's guilt, but a 2006 review by Sweden's chancellor of justice found no problems with the convictions. Two years later Bergwall recanted in a Swedish TV documentary, saying he had fabricated the story of Thomas Quick the serial killer. He now claims it was a cry for attention, fuelled by heavy medication. Sven-Erik Alhem, a Swedish legal expert who was not involved with the case, last year called it the country’s 'greatest miscarriage of justice in modern times.' He said it was particularly painful for the families of the victims, who are unlikely to ever find out the truth of what happened to their loved ones. With Bergwall's confessions withdrawn, there are no longer any strong links between the eight deaths, and it is not even clear that all were homicides. In two cases no bodies were found.","Sture Bergwall was convicted of eight murders between 1994 and 2001 .

"By . Matt Blake . Sour taste in the mouth: Tad Osborn, from Fort Collins, Colorado, was summoned to stand before a judge over claims his cheque for a dozen boxes bounced . A good Samaritan is facing court and $700 in fines for trying to buy a $42 batch of Girl Scout cookies, it emerged today. Tad Osborn, from Fort Collins, Colorado, was summoned to stand before a judge after the youth organisation claimed his cheque for a dozen boxes of the doughy treat had bounced. But the IT professional claims it could not have bounced because he has a healthy balance in an open and functioning bank account... and he says he can prove it. 'What did I do to deserve this? I just wrote the cheque,' he told CBS Denver. 'I was helping the Girl Scouts and now I’m having to go court over and over again and answering legal questions that I have no business answering.' After purchasing the biscuits from a . girl scout doing rounds in his local neighbourhood, he enjoyed them with . his family last year. But a few months later, he received a letter from a debt collection agency telling him the cheque could not be processed and that his bill had doubled to $82. He called the local Girl Scout troop who directed him to its nerve centre in Denver. 'When someone called me back, they said my account was marked as closed. That was the first sign that we had a problem here, because my account . was not closed,' he told ABCNews. Instead, he blames an administrative error on the part of the Girl Scout's bank. Rachelle Trujillo, a spokeswoman for the Girl Scouts of Colorado, declined to comment specifically about this case because of pending proceedings but said the cookie operation is like any other big business, selling 3.5 million cookies a year. American institution: Girl Scouts are synonymous with selling cookies and even have their own National Girl Scout Cookie Weekend (picture in Grand Central Terminal in New York on February 7) 'When a cheque is reported as bad debt by a troop's bank, the troop attempts to contact the customer and the council then attempts to resolve the debt,' she said in a statement. 'Like any other business, after multiple attempts to resolve, we use a professional collection agency.' But Osborn said: 'The problem is I was never notified [that the cheque had bounced]. Because they never contacted me, I never had the chance to set this straight.' AAA Collectors Inc., sued Osborn for $739.85, which included $450 in legal fees. The firm declined to comment. He also had to pay $100 to file a legal response just to stop the agency from winning a judgment by default. He says it was the 'cost that got [him] really upset'. He was asked if he wanted to settle but declined and will appear in court on May 8. However, he says the ordeal has not dampened regard for the Girl Scouts and saw his daughter join a different troop earlier this year. 'I like the Girl scouts and their Girl Scout cookies,' he said. 'I have no problem donating the money to them. This is making me think twice about writing a cheque. Just cash -- lesson learned.'","Tad Osborn, of Fort Collins, bought 12 boxes from a girl scout last year .

"By . Matt Blake . The Second World War could have been prevented by a single document... but Hitler destroyed it before it was made public, MI5 secret files have revealed. The last will and testament of Baron Paul von Hindenburg, Germany's president until his death in 1934, rejected Adolf Hitler's claim to the Reichstag and urged the nation to embrace democracy. Such was the respect that Germany's political class had for Hindenburg, his dissent from beyond the grave would surely have been heard and may well have obstructed Hitler's rise to power, prevented war and changed the course of history, reported The Times. Mistrust: The last will and testament of Baron Paul von Hindenburg (left), Germany's president until his death in 1934, rejected Adolf Hitler's claim to the Reichstag and urged the nation to embrace democracy. But Hitler caught wind of the document and demanded it be brought to him before it was released. It was never seen again. The claims, part of a haul of secret MI5 documents declassified last month, were made by Baron Fritz Günther von Tschirschky und Boegendorff, an aristocratic diplomat and confident of Hindenburg who helped draft the will. The confidant: The claims, part of a haul of secret MI5 documents declassified last month, were made by Baron Fritz Günther von Tschirschky und Boegendorff, an aristocratic diplomat and confidant of Hindenburg who helped draft the will . Tschirschky claimed Hindenburg's will was a powerful attack on Hitler's ambition, declaring that the the army should be independent from parliament, that a constitutional monarchy should be established and that the legislative and executive branches of government should be separated. 'He said further that he wanted the . rights of parliament established under a two-tier system on democratic . lines, like that of Britain, and that he wanted all racial and religious . discrimination abolished,' Tschirschky told the Times in 1947. Hitler and hindenburg hated each other. Hindenburg . described his Chancellor as that 'Bohemian corporal', intentionally . confusing Hitler's birthplace of Braunau in Austria, with Braunau in . Bohemia. Despite . Hitler's repeated demands to be appointed as Chancellor, Hindenburg . repeatedly refused until finally being forced by the deteriorating . political stability of the Weimar Republic to grant the Nazi Party . leader his wish. His health failing, he issued a decree which . suspended various civil liberties before signing the Enabling . Act, giving Hitler's administration legislative powers. He . died the following year, after which Hitler declared the office of . President vacant and, as 'Führer und Reichskanzler', made himself head . of state. Best of enemies: Hindenburg (left) described his Chancellor as that 'Bohemian corporal', intentionally confusing Hitler's birthplace of Braunau in Austria, with Braunau in Bohemia . But instead of sacking Hitler and . declaring martial law, Hindenburg drew up a will - a 'bomb timed to go . off posthumously and blow Hitler off course', wrote historian Ben . Macintyre in The Times. Before becoming Germany's president in 1925, Baron Paul von Hindenburg was a highly-decorated Prussian-German field marshal. He first came under the national spotlight when, at the age of 66, he won the decisive Battle of Tannenberg, almost completely destroying the Russian Second Army in August 1914. Becoming Chief of the General Staff in 1916, he quickly rose in the German public's esteem ultimately gaining more influence in Germany than the Kaiser himself. Retiring in 1919, he returned to public life in 1925, surfing his wave of popularity to become president. But the rise of the National Socialist Party made Adolf Hitler impossible to ignore. Hindenburg described his Chancellor as that 'Bohemian corporal', intentionally confusing Hitler's birthplace of Braunau in Austria, with Braunau in Bohemia. Despite his repeated attempts to spurn Hitler's advances on the office of Chancellor, the deteriorating political stability of the Weimar Republic coupled with the rise in popularity enjoyed by the Nazi Party forced Hindenburg to give in. He appointed Hitler as German Chancellor in January 1933. In February, he issued a decree which suspended various civil liberties before signing the Enabling Act a month later, giving Hitler legislative powers. He died the following year, after which Hitler declared the office of President vacant and, as 'Führer und Reichskanzler', made himself head of state. Within . hours of Hindenburg's death on August 2 1934, Hitler announced the . offices of Chancellor and President would merge under his rule as . supreme Fuhrer. A vote was called to let the German people express their view of Hitler's unprecedented move to become head of government and head of state. But as soon as he heard about the will, Hitler reportedly ordered his henchmen 'to ensure that this document comes into my possession as soon as possible'. Colonel Oskar von Hindenburg, son of the late President but a loyal Nazi, duly handed it over. It was never seen again. Instead, just before the vote, the Nazis published Hindenburg's 'political testament' - a glowing endorsement of Hitler and his political goals. Many historians believe it was a forgery. Four days later, 38 million voters supported Hitlars coup. Five million people rejected it. the next day, the Nazis made every member of the German army swear an obligatory oath of allegiance. Baron Tschirschky insisted: 'Hitler . would never have come into power, and there would have been no war, if . the wishes of Hindenburg had been known to the German people.' 'We . tend to see history in terms of unstoppable forces, great movements of . economics or ideology that dwarf individual choice and volition,' wrote Macintyre. 'But small things also change history — the whistle-blower, the resister, the single, history-defining document.' While Hitler must have destroyed the document he was given, two drafts survived. Nazi agents tracked the first down to a bank account in Switzerland and destroyed it. The other was kept by Tschirschky. But just before Tschirschky, a staunch opponent of Nazism, defected to Britain to spend the rest of the war in an internment camp, he said he burned his copy - the last written testament to Hindenburg's true feelings about Hitler and the future of Germany.","Hindenburg rejected Adolf Hitler's claim to power, pushing for democracy .

"By . Matt Blake . Francois Hollande speaks to his new girlfriend, Julie Gayet, only via text message for fear their private life may fall under the global spotlight once again, it has been claimed. The French president was plunged into an unprecedented sex scandal after he dumped his partner, Valerie Trierweiler, for the 41-year-old actress last year. But thanks to a relentless campaign of media scrutiny since news of the scandal broke, the couple have been forced to live separate lives, never meeting in person and communicating only via SMS, gossip magazine Paris Match reported. Despite their difficulties in maintaining a normal relationship, however, friends were last night keen to stress the couple's romance is as strong as ever.

News of their affair dominated front pages across the world after gossip magazine Closer published pictures of Hollande hopping off the back of a scooter, his head clad in a large black helmet, for an apparent rendezvous at an apartment near the presidential palace. Now Gayet is relying on France's notoriously strict privacy laws to sue Closer for 54,000 euros over the pictures, which she says have devastated her professional and personal life and violated 'the most intimate side of her privacy'. Appearing at a court in Nanterre without his client, Ms Gayet's lawyer, Maitre Jean Enocchi, said she had 'suffered and still suffers on a daily . basis', describing her as a discreet and . private woman who enjoyed film festivals and going out with Tadeo, 14, . and Ezechiel, 13, her children from her former marriage to Santiago .

Violation of h'her most intimate side': Now Gayet is relying on France's notoriously strict privacy laws to sue Closer for 54,000 euros over the pictures, which she says have devastated her professional and personal life and violated 'the most intimate side of her privacy' He said she has become a prisoner in her own apartment which lies under siege by an army of paparazzi. 'The first time she went out, she was attacked by a veritable hoard of photographers who followed her to the chemists and to the supermarket, gluing themselves to the supermarket window when she was inside,' he said. He said the money she sought, though high by French standards, was 'well below the harm she has suffered'. She is seeking 54,000 euros (£44,500) in damages and legal fees from the celebrity gossip glossy, plus front-page publication of a summary of any judicial ruling in the case. Damages: It comes as Hollande's estranged partner Ms Trierweiler, 48, won 12,000 euros (£9,800) from magazine Closer after it ran pictures of her on holiday in Mauritius in February . Closer's January revelation that Hollande was meeting secretly with Gayet led to his public separation from his long-time companion, Ms Trierweiler, and drew international headlines. Hollande never denied his relationship with Gayet, who has appeared in public only a handful of times since the report. Laurence Pieau, the editor of Closer, has defended the publication of the photos of Gayet and Persident Hollande saying it was something the public had a right to know.

"By . Matt Blake . When this tourist visited a South African game reserve, she was warned of the dangers ... but nobody told her she'd actually have to put her neck on the lion. Lina Jek, 42, stopped for a selfie at Lion Park, in Johannesburg, when one of the locals photobombed the snap in terrifying - but adorable - style. As she posed against the stunning backdrop of the African savannah, an eight-month-old lioness crept into frame and gave her a big hug and a kiss.

It can now be confirmed hundreds of people in gleaming white trailers have descended on the Forest of Dean to film scenes from the hotly-anticipated Star Wars sequel. Speculation and excitement over the film site reached fever pitch in the past 24 hours with a number of clues eventually giving away the purpose of the temporary Gloucestershire community. The Forest of Dean is now awash with jedis, sith lords, caravans and set production equipment involved in filming an unknown forest scene for Star Wars Episode VII. Scroll down for video .

Due for release in December next year, Star Wars: Episode VII features the stars of the original 1970s trilogy Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher alongside newcomers and unknowns. It will be set 40 years after the original films in the same fantasy galaxy, and fans have been buzzing with debate about which planet the lush green forest of Puzzlewood might represent.

The knotted trees and winding paths of the forest, a popular family tourist attraction, were said to have been the inspiration for J.R.R. Tolkien's enchanted woodlands in Lord of the Rings. More recently they have been used to film the BBC fantasy dramas Dr Who, Merlin and Atlantis. Fans have speculated Puzzlewood could be a return to the lush green territory inhabited by Yoda or the Forest Moon of Endor, inhabited by Ewoks. For the original Star Wars trilogy, the spectacular redwood forests of northern California were used for the Forest Moon of Endor. And the frozen landscape of Hoth was represented by the northern wilderness of Norway - which was so cold in real life that some scenes were shot out of the crew's hotel doorway. Magical woods: The site in the Forest of Dean was said to have been an inspiration for Lord of the Rings . Few details about the set have been released, but Kevin Smith - the director of Clerks (1994) and Dogma (1999) - gave a few tantalising details after a recent visit. In a Q&A session at the Neuchatel International Film Festival in Switzerland, he said: 'It was tactile; it wasn't a series of f****** green and blue screens in which later on digital characters would be added.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . European web users can now ask search engine Bing to remove links they don’t like. The move comes after a court ruling in May gave people in the EU the ‘right to be forgotten’ on the internet. The Microsoft-owned search giant has created an online request form that lets people identify specific web pages they want omitted. European web users can now ask search engine Bing (pictured) to remove links they don't like, following the 'right to be forgotten' court ruling in Luxembourg in May. This ruling requires search engines to remove information deemed 'inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant' - or face penalties . Under the European Data Protection Regulation, Article 17 includes the ‘right to be forgotten and to erasure’. Under . Article 17, people who are mentioned in the data have the right to . ‘obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to . them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data.' This . particularly relates to data about the person when they were a child, . when the data is no longer relevant or necessary for the purpose it was . collected, the person who owns the content withdraws their consent, the . storage period has expired, or if it was gathered illegally. The EU defines ‘data controllers’ as ‘people or bodies that collect and manage personal data.’ The EU General Data Protection Regulation means any data controller who . has been asked to remove data must ‘take all reasonable steps, . including technical measures' to remove it. If a data controller does not take these steps they can be heavily fined. ‘We will use the information that you provide to evaluate your request,’ said the Bing request form. ‘This information will help us to consider the balance between your individual privacy interest and the public interest in protecting free expression and the free availability of information, consistent with European law. ‘As a result, making a request does not guarantee that a particular search result will be blocked.’ The site added it will also consider other sources of information beyond the form to verify or supplement the information, and create a case for removal. It also said submissions may be re-evaluated over time, and this could lead to previously deleted results reappearing. People submitting requests are required to prove who they are, and whether they are a public figure such as a politician or celebrity. They are also asked to explain why they feel the data should be removed. Examples given include if the information is ‘out-of-date, false, incomplete or inappropriate’. The Microsoft-owned search giant has created an online request form (pictured) and said not all requests will be removed, and submissions will be re-evaluated over time. People submitting requests are required to prove who they are, and whether they are a public figure such as a politician or celebrity . The court ruled that individuals have the right to have links to information about them deleted from searches in certain circumstances, but only if they meet specific criteria.

When searches are made on Google, a warning message now appears at the bottom of the page that tells users results 'may have been removed.' This warning appears on all results regardless of the name searched. The decision affects 500 million citizens and states that if search services don't comply, they face heavy fines.

'A simple way of understanding what happened here is that you have a collision between a right to be forgotten and a right to know. 'From Google's perspective that's a balance,' Schmidt added. 'Google believes having looked at the decision, which is binding, that the balance that was struck was wrong.' European citizens can submit take-down requests directly to Internet companies rather than to local authorities or publishers under the ruling.

The ruling was made by the European Union Court of Justice (pictured). It comes after a Spanish man complained an online auction note about his repossessed home infringed his privacy.

"By . Dan Bloom . A teenage sex attacker who robbed a woman while she walked home late at night wrote a five-point checklist reminding himself how to commit crime. Zach Jackson, then 18, . slapped his 19-year-old victim before sexually assaulting her and grabbing her . phone in Blackpool, Lancashire. The victim’s father used a tracking app to help police trace the phone to Jackson's home - and when officers searched his house, they found the chilling bullet-point instructions in a notebook. Jailed: Zach Jackson, 19, wrote a checklist (right) before sexually assaulting a young woman . The list read: 'Wear black clothes', 'Gloves', 'Warm up before doing it', 'Watch out for CCTV', and then, finally: 'Grab'. Roger . Brown, prosecuting at Preston Crown Court, said the victim had been out . drinking with friends in Blackpool in December and tried to phone her . father for a lift, but wasn’t able to contact him. She described seeing a male stood on the corner, tucked into the doorway of a house and on a phone. The court heard that during the incident, Jackson slapped her so hard that he caused her to fall to her knees. She had her mobile phone in her right hand and her bag in her left hand. The defendant then bent over, put his hand under her clothing and sexually assaulted her, the court was told, before grabbing her mobile phone and running up the street. Jackson, now 19 and from Blackpool, pleaded guilty to robbery and sexual assault. He . also admitted attempting to possess cocaine with intent to supply in . connection to a drug offence on Merseyside in July . last year. Rachel Woods, . defending, said the list found at Jackson's address did not indicate he had . been planning a sex assault - but could indicate the idea of a . robbery. Preston Crown Court, pictured, heard Jackson had targeted a vulnerable victim and jailed him for three years . 'He did not seek out the female,' Ms Woods said. 'There is no evidence to suggest he had been stalking or following her. 'She had asked him for a cigarette. What happened was opportunistic. 'She had one of the latest iPhones and he had taken a fancy to it. He went on to sexually assault her.' She added: 'His guilty pleas have spared the young woman from having to come to court to give evidence about the matter.' But while saying the attacker's remorse was 'genuine', Judge Anthony Russell QC jailed him for three years and placed him on the sex offenders' register indefinitely. 'You specifically targeted a vulnerable victim,' the judge added.","Zach Jackson, 19, sexually assaulted victim in Blackpool and stole her phone .

"By . Dan Bloom . Wanted: Police want to speak to Lloyd Trainer, 24, in connection with a burglary on an antiques shop . A man wanted for questioning over a burglary at an antiques shop has fled Britain and become a rep for the firm behind the now infamous Magaluf sex video, it was claimed today. Lloyd Trainer, 24, featured on the BBC's Crimewatch less than a month ago in connection with a high-value raid on a shop in Petworth, West Sussex, in January 2012. Police said he had links to Glasgow, Surrey and London - but a Facebook profile for Trainer now says he is living in Palma de Mallorca, the capital of the Spanish holiday island. And two days after he was featured on the BBC's Crimewatch Roadshow on June 12, he posted a photo of himself smiling in a bar. According to The Sun, Trainer has been herding teenagers round the holiday resort of Magaluf for Carnage, the firm behind the now notorious sex video which was leaked online last week. A Sussex Police spokesman told MailOnline today: 'Lloyd Trainer, 24, from Surrey, is wanted for a high value burglary from an antiques shop in Petworth in January 2012. He has been wanted by police since then.' A source told the newspaper that Trainer had been 'bragging about how he has been on Crimewatch, showing people clips from the show on his phone'. The video shows 24 men receiving a sex act from an 18-year-old woman who was reportedly promised a 'free holiday' - which turned out to be the name of a cheap cocktail. It prompted horror and outrage from thousands of people on Twitter, where the firm initially revelled in the publicity. The @carnagemagalluf Twitter account, which has posted photos of teenagers slumped on the floor and others with the hashtag #exvirgin, retweeted dozens of compliments and insults about the video as publicity mounted. Boozy: Brits take part in a Carnage barcrawl yesterday. The reaction to the video does not appear to have impacted on the firm's popularity, with hundreds of people still hitting the resort's famous strip for cheap drinks . Its organisers then wrote: 'We are not responsible for the girl's actions. The girl and her eight friends bought tickets for the next barcrawl as they said it was amazing! 'All you . need to do is look at the video and you can see she clearly isn't drunk . and knows what she is doing. Definitely not forced in any way.' But . a friend of the woman in the video, from Northern Ireland, claimed she . was a born-again Christian who had 'made a terrible mistake'. The footage was described by . many as a new low in Magaluf, where pub crawls were regulated for the . first time this year following years of complaints by locals. Spanish mayor Manu Onieva . voiced his ‘absolute indignation’ and said police were investigating the . practice that local press have dubbed ‘mamading’ – a play on the crude . Spanish word for a sex act, ‘mamada’. Wanted for questioning: Sussex Police said Lloyd Trainer had links to Glasgow, Surrey and London - but a Facebook profile for Trainer now says he is living in Palma de Mallorca, the capital of the Spanish holiday island . Despite the outrage, Carnage barcrawls attract hundreds of participants - with more than 400 people, many teenagers on their first holiday without their parents, on one recent event alone. The firm is not linked to Carnage UK, a separate barcrawl firm which has also made headlines. Benefits Street's 'White Dee', real name Deirdre Kelly, was a guest . of Carnage Magalluf in May and was photographed at a party wearing the . company’s T-shirt. And Geordie Shore's Jay Gardner, who also featured in the video but did not take part in the game, claimed the participants had been swept up in Magaluf's 'wild, everything-goes' culture.","Lloyd Trainer, 24, featured on the BBC's crime show less than a month ago .

"By . Dan Bloom . A motorist tried to drive home from a court which had just banned him from driving. A stunned police officer saw 29-year-old Kieron Pemberton getting into his car moments after magistrates in Wigan, Greater Manchester, had revoked his licence. He chased Pemberton, pulled him over and arrested him, hauling him back before the same court - where he was promptly jailed for 12 weeks. 'Stupid': Kieron Pemberton, 29, tried to drive home from a court which had just banned him from driving . Wigan and Leigh Magistrates' Court had previously banned Pemberton for 14 months for failing to provide a breath sample to police. Driving ban hearings usually include a direct warning to motorists not to take their cars home. But after the short hearing, a police officer who had been in court saw Pemberton leave the building, get into his car and start the engine. Mike Ardern, prosecuting, told magistrates: 'When he left the court, the officer was . exiting the nearby supermarket and saw him walking and holding a car . key. 'Mr Pemberton opened the driver’s door and drove. 'The officer pulled in front of him, got out and pointed out to him he had just been disqualified and then arrested him.' No escape: Pemberton was promptly hauled back before Wigan and Leigh Magistrates' Court and jailed . Defence: Pemberton's lawyer insisted he was only trying to take the car home so he could put it up for sale . Yesterday Pemberton, from Wigan, was jailed for 12 weeks after he admitted driving while disqualified. Andrew Stock, defending, said Pemberton, from Wigan, got behind the wheel to take the car back to his address where it would be sold. 'If he could take that decision back he would do,' said Mr Stock. 'It was a foolish and stupid thing to do. It is something that with the benefit of hindsight would never have happened. 'There was a complete lack of foresight which led to a decision he wishes he could take back.' Pemberton will serve half of the sentence in prison and half on supervision.","Kieron Pemberton, 29, had just had licence revoked by Wigan magistrates .
